{"UWcZuCEZnO4": "hello and welcome to cupcake addictions candy bomb tutorial rubbish oh you how to make this really cool little candy bombs kind of like a mini pinata now I don't know if these are a cupcake addiction original but I haven't seen them anywhere before so you know what you guys saw them here first I hope somebody gave me a silicone cake pop mold and for those of you guys that follow my channel you know that I make cake pops out of crushed up cake and frosting rather than actually baking circular ball shaped cakes that's what a cake pop traditionally is so I didn't really have a use for my silicone cake pop mold apart from drying some flowers and it made me start thinking what else can I do with this piece of equipment tools and equipment for today's tutorial I've got a ziploc bag I've got a pair of scissors I've got my silicone cake pop mold and you will need a silicone one for this one rather than an metal one I've got some melted dark chocolate some mini M&Ms and a couple of spoons really really simple tutorial this one so the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to take out silicone molds because they're silicone you don't need to prepare them so I'm just going to use my spoon I'm just going to spoon in just a little bit kind of about a quarter of a teaspoon or about a half a teaspoon or so of chocolate and you're going to do two layers of this so don't be tempted to put too much chocolate in on the first round I'm not going to do the whole tray today I can just make one or two and you'll have the general idea so once you've spooned in all of your chocolate use the back of that same spoon and just drag the chocolate up the sides try not to go too far over the side and it's okay if you can see a little bit of that red silicone through at the bottom and on the sides you really want to try and make the walls of that as thick as you can and this is why we're going to give it a couple of coats any little bits around the edges just use your finger to wipe them off so we can keep really nice little clean edges around the edges of our little candy bombs off to the fridge and we'll bring them back when they're set alright so we're back from the fridge and those little guys are set they want to take long because they're really quite thin so we're just going to repeat that process again and on this one you do want to make sure that you can't see any of that silicone poking through if you love this unique idea for your cake pop container your cake pop baking tray make sure that you head on over to our channel my cupcake addiction if you like what you see there hit the subscribe button we upload three times a week and I am always always on look out for new and inventive ways for you guys to use your existing equipment and great ways to decorate cupcakes and cake pops alright so just finishing that one off effect so once again just use your finger just to clean up around any edges make sure that it's really nice and flash and that's just going to give us a really nice seal when we come back to stick these two parts together they're going to go back into the fridge alright so we're done with our refrigerating now it's time to get them out of your silicone mold so this is why I say you can't use a metal mold because the silicone you can actually peel it away and just watch them because they sort of come with the sides quite easily and then they tend to pop out oh that one's okay they tend to pop out at you and kind of go flying so do allow for a few casualties here you might have one or two that break along the way perfect alright so now what you want to do is you want to take some of your candy so I'm going to fill this is kind of the surprise inside these great little candy bombs I'm going to fill one half with mini M&Ms and just one half and don't go too crazy just sort of fill it up to about the middle and if you overfill these you can't hear that really satisfying little kind of sprinkle of candy that happens as you shake them here we go now you want to take your ziplock bag we want to prepare this now before we go too much further and we're just going to fill it up with some of that chocolate I'm using dark chocolate but you can go with any color you like depending on the theme in the occasion and I'm just showing you a simple decoration but I think these have limitless possibilities when it comes to decorating and what you can actually do with them so as always we squeeze the air out of the bag push the chocolate all down to one corner and seal it up and then I'm just going to cut just a nice little corner off the end just a little corner just fashion into a little bit of a piping bag as always make sure that you know where your corner goes alright so now you want to take your half your other half and sit it on top so I'm meeting those two little edges up and just watch I've got one little tiny just a little bit of chocolate overhanging a little bit there so you just want to break off any little additional bits but you should have a really nice little seal sort of meaning there are not a seal yet you want to hold it on each end and you want to work quite quickly here because you don't want your finger heat to start melting through we've done a double coat so it should be okay taking your ziplock bag just a nice sort of a little squeeze and if you can kind of squeeze it into the gap a little bit not too much but just put a little bit of pressure on it as you're squeezing around that line turn it around all the way around and then you want to count to five so one two three four five perfect now that's just going to give it time just to start getting a little bit tacky now just take your finger and just wipe around the sides perfect you can set that down and we can let that one completely set and then it's time to decorate all right now similar to cake pops there really is no shortage of ways that you can decorate these so I'm just going to show you a really simple decoration technique today that's a little bit I guess typical of a pinata type treat so just using your little ziplock bag and you may need to refill in new one just depending on how long you let your set for and whether or not that chocolate had started to harden and just be careful about what colour M&Ms you're picking here but I'm just going to use those mini M&Ms again just to quickly stick on just a few around the outsides in all different colors so make sure that you're sort of spacing your colors apart relatively evenly for maximum impact and just be careful how hot your hands are here so if you're if you're someone that has particularly hot hands you might just want to go and just run them under iced water before you start doing this just to make sure that they're as cool as they can be and these would go absolutely gorgeously with our giant cupcake pinata as perhaps the main attraction or the main treat and then the little mini pinata is to take home or for the kids to smash individually at the table so that's your little completed candy bomb now as I mentioned that's going to stand pretty much on its own just find a little spot fruit there in those aluminum's will repeat that with that other one now I do just want to mention with the type of chocolate that you use I'm using a compound chocolate or a cooking chocolate so if you are just going to the supermarket and just getting cooking chocolate from your cooking oil I use Nestle melts here that's perfect you're not going to need to anything with that if you're using really high-end chocolate or some of the block chocolates that are available you're going to need to temper it so unless you're familiar with working with chocolate I wouldn't recommend using really really high quality or high-end chocolate for this and now for the grand finale I know that you guys are going to want to see me smash one of these so let's crack it with the back of a spoon and open it up taking the back of my spoon I'm just going to give it one good hard whack and there you've got your candy bombs did you see that explosion of candy awesome so if you guys love the candy bomb concept I want to hear about it I'm in love with it I think it's awesome and you can definitely expect to see more candy bomb ideas coming out of my cupcake addiction thanks very much tuning in I hope you guys enjoy this tutorial", "xti1ZgwBxz4": "[Music] welcome back to the station bakery let's make some cotton candy drink bombs take a giant fluff of cotton candy and unravel it any flavor and any brand of cotton candy will work the size of the cotton candy fluff that you use will vary based on the size of drink that you would like to make now i am adding in my strawberry pineapple drink mix i will be using about 1 to one and a half tablespoons pour the mix into the center of the cotton candy it's very important that your cotton candy does not have any holes in it i am going in now with some edible glitter just to add a touch of sparkle gently fold up the edges of your cotton candy squishing the pieces together to seal in the powder and the glitter firmly squeeze the cotton candy together just to ensure that there are no openings if there are holes in openings then your powder will fall out you should be able to pick up your cotton candy drink bomb without any of the filling and inside spilling out if you can do this then you've done it correctly cotton candy is very fickle so it's important that you choose the correct packaging to store your drink bombs i found these cute little tents to be perfect for storing my cotton candy drink bombs they seal and hold the cotton candy well and because it's sealed well improperly this will last for at least a week these were great but before i came across these i used these these were so cute and i thought that they were perfect for little mini sized drink bombs however this packaging does not seal properly and that is why i want to stress that it is important that you choose something to store these in that will seal it completely around because well let me just show you what happens when you don't um so yeah they were great for the first day but i went to sleep and woke up to this not only do these hold the cotton candy well but they are also so cute especially when i add on my custom sticker labels you can purchase these labels plus so many more from my etsy shop it will be linked here as well as in the description below these are so cute now let's see how the juice bombs actually work thank you guys so much for watching this video if you enjoyed it please be sure that you give it a big thumbs up and hit the subscribe button until next time peace", "IWTurPt0BGE": "[Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Music] oh [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] room [Music] so [Music] hmm [Music] bye", "dGZQE5v2S8M": "hello my name is brooke and i am the owner and operator of spun sweets cotton candy catering company and today i'm going to show you how to make cotton candy sugar bombs all right so what you're going to need is cotton candy this is fresh made cotton candy it's actually peach flavored because i have a peach flavor carbonated water i actually have a cotton candy business so i made this cotton candy here myself but if you don't have a cotton candy machine you can absolutely buy the cotton candy from the store you're going to need a 1 4 teaspoon some type of edible glitter what i like to use is prism powder this glitter is fda approved it is um tasteless it doesn't leave any type of greediness in the drink and it makes it really shimmery so i have pink and blue today you're gonna need a little container that's between two to four ounces so this is a two and a half ounce container and then like i said some type of carbonated drink so i have sparkling peach today but you could absolutely use champagne a white claw you could use sprite or ginger ale if you're making the drink for kids so it's adult and kid friendly all right so what you're going to do is take your piece of cotton candy and you don't need a very big size so this is about 1 4 size of a cone you're going to open up that prison powder take a look at that and see how shimmery the prism powder is i love this stuff all right and then you're going to take your 1 4 teaspoon put it inside the prison powder and you do not need very much so you don't have to fill up that 1 4 teaspoon all right put it right in the center of that cotton candy and then you're going to fold it up and just kind of start to fold it so it gets smaller and so the prism powder is not showing and then you're going to stick it inside of that container all right and you have a cotton candy glitter bomb so once you're done you can put a lid on it or put it right into your drink so i'm going to go ahead and put it right into the drink and show you what it looks like like i said these are so delicious so pretty add a little bit more of a sparkling drink to it and you just start to see all that glitter spin around i'm also going to show you i already have a pre-made pink one and i'm going to show you what the pink looks like so it takes just a second for that glitter to start to move around just add your drink into it this would also be great for gender reveals you can't see the prison powder inside the cotton candy until it's actually dropped into the drink so it would be a great idea for that if you guys have any questions please leave them in the comments and if you want to see more videos on cotton candy please like and subscribe to my channel cheers", "ns_b8JhhyUg": "hey guys here dirty booty soaps and today we're going to be making bath bombs I'm doing them in a doughnut shape today I did a batch earlier this morning and they turn out really cute I'll show you here I shrink crack them and all they are these ones are pineapple papaya fragrance one and they're drizzled with a cocoa butter drizzle I sprinkled some hobo beads on top and they have a little so gross so very cute I'll shrink-wrapped excuse me still have that nasty cloth hanging on and and instead of the little little soap roses I put on the other ones this time I'm gonna be putting these little soap berries on the top since they are blueberry so I don't give my it's a basic bass on recipe anybody can research bass on this B's and tweak it to make it your own I have baking soda citric acid and some SLS a in there for oil I use coconut oil and so I've got and also some poly a tea in there and my fragrance is blueberry so we're just gonna whisk that together and then I'm gonna divide off half and put some blue mica in half so it's gonna be white and blue okay on just a moment I must be one of those bogus phone calls usually it's my mother but I already talked to her today doesn't mean she won't call again oh that's that that nasty the first call didn't try so we'll try it from another number bogus phone call okay so this is pretty good I'm going to divine half away here roughly and we're gonna put some blueberry or blue this is actually neon blue disco pants powder just a touch of that in there to go nicely with the blueberry fragrance blueberry always seems to be one of the more popular bath bomb fragrances for me anyway from my customers they really love the blueberry and I've got my witch hazel here we're just gonna give it a spritz here actually there's a few spritzes so for a mold like so I'm using this nonstick I've got two of these they're non-stick pans doughnut pans there are six cavities in each I've got two of them and they work really well not easy to you have to give them a good whack to unmold them but anyway what I do is I fill the molds and then I put them down by my dehumidifier and should have done my white first anyway I leave them by the dehumidifier for a while so dry them out good and then I bang them onto a cookie sheet to get them out and then we're gonna drizzle them with some cocoa butter and then hold the beads and maybe a little bit of glitter on the top anyway that's pretty much a white except for a little bit of blue that came off my hands so we're gonna do as you can see we're firm from here as well so I'm gonna bring one of my things over here I hope you can see let's see if you can see yes we're good I like to start out with a little bit of the color in each one so just a little bit in each one brush off the the top center part there like so and then we add some white keeping that center part cleaned off so I'm not really packing down yet I'm just kind of making sure we're evenly divided here so I'm going to do my other mold so I'm going to set that off the side and bring the other one over just clean this off here so again with the blue first that's the way I like to do it you could make them all one color or you can do them three or four colors and it's up to you entirely if you're selling these always make sure you are wearing gloves you don't want to get your own skin cells in there nobody wants that right anyway thought I would do another bath bomb video because I don't know it must be bath bomb season but people keep looking at my old videos like from when I first started making or attempting to make bath bombs and critiquing them like crazy it's like I keep thinking you know I haven't done these in over a year those particular ones I've learned since then but you still get the critics I'm just gonna finish the white off here like my rubber duck bombs no matter how many times I try and tell people the reason they weren't working out was because when I squished the mold together the Ducks were getting squished there are little rubber ducks they were getting squished and when you compact the bomb together so then when I take the bottom part of course the little rubber duck was all switched up is gonna pop back out and it crack the bomb but people weren't I guess understanding that they were commenting like crazy uh-huh your mix is too dry and I'm like yeah that's part that was part of it but the problem was the Ducks we're getting squished so anyway anyway long story short I'm decided I'm gonna make a new bath bomb video and I will do it in a fun doughnut shape so and we're not putting off another thing people always were yelling at me because I put candy sprinkles on them candy sprinkles they're gonna cause yeast infections well then if you're prone to yeast infections don't use them but anyway I decided okay this one's not gonna have candy sprinkles on it so we'll make those people happy so we're just moving stuff around in here pressing it down firmly so we've got you know the blue the white more blue alternating on these bombs hopefully have enough blue left for my other tray here okay so I'm gonna spray this one with alcohol just helps them to dry out a little quicker when I put them down by the dehumidifier then we'll bring this them back over pressing a little bit here just to make a room for a little bit of the blue that I've got left I'm just gonna put the whole thing here and spread it around so we get someone every bomb somewhat evenly and then start keeping that Center clear because once they bang out you wanna let that little donut hole in the middle smells so good I do love this blueberry I'm gonna be doing another probably be doing another bath bomb video in another fun shape coming up guess the man's here now dogs think they're gonna die if they don't bark at the mailman you know oh I know it's a tragedy you didn't come say hi to you heavens to Betsy and it's relax anyway where was I oh yeah I'm gonna be doing another bath bomb video soon kind of a beachy theme one so keep your eyes peeled for that anyway get the last little bits here throw those on top like to clean my mess up BAM I'm making I don't know if it's just me there's the messiest thing okay so those aren't all press nice and firm let's give these a spritz and I mean they will shut them down like I said by the dehumidifier downstairs for a few hours and then I'll pop them out and we'll come back and do some decorating on these babies so we'll be back in just a few seconds for you came back and and I pop these out actually I should say pop these out when I bang these out of the mold I did have a couple break on me this one is a this one's cracked but you know what it's got let that one be from so what I've got here let me crank this up a little bit higher so I've got my melted cocoa butter and I add a little bit stuff to the same as if you'd make a bath ruffled a little bit of baking soda and citric acid and I also put in some matte white pigment powder so just to kind of give this a creamy look you can see how creamy that is it's not a white but it's kind of like a cream color and my glass is a little hot so so that's why I've got this on it but this is just like it's just like giving it a little glaze so we're just gonna give these a little glaze and all my other ones I sprinkle glitter on the top as well but I'm not going to do it on these just in case I have some men or boys who want to pamper themselves with blueberry I'm gonna keep the glitter off of these so Sami what I mean it's just gonna take I'll keep stirring and I'm just gonna take a little bit and just kind of drizzle over the top you see a lot of it runs off but I just want to give it just a really light glaze and then I'm going to take one of our little soaked blueberries and I'm gonna get a little bit more in my spoon and just give him a little puddle right there and put my little berry on the top just one that's all we need so we're gonna do another one here and I just love how this is cream a colored coconut oil or sorry cocoa butter stands out against the bull ooh isn't it pretty so another little blob there and we'll put a berry on now is there's cools then the berry will kind of stick to the bomb just love it and smells so good cocoa butter and the blueberry really go well together I find and you notice I'm doing this on a cooling rack over over some wax paper now actually what I'm going to do while these are still the wet I'm gonna take some blue for hobo beads and sprinkle on the top just a little that way we're not adding sugary candies so the people who are prone to getting UTIs or yeast infections whatever they should be fine it's not sugar so just drizzle a little bit more and put our little berry on oops try and put our little berry on a little bit more they're sticky there and our little hole puppy eats aren't they cute like I said the smell so good and it looks just adorable oh my gosh justjust delectable and there stick him on so I mean it's a little process to get these all put together but they turn out just too adorable after stick their berry stick stick of berry Oh - cute - cute I just love how these doughnuts are turning out like I said I had a couple of them break woe is me I guess I'll have to use them just just a tragedy are these turning out just too cute let me zoom you in here on these last couple aren't they cute look at that white creamy white against the blue like I said super easy it's just melted cocoa butter and Oh some matte white pigment you can use titanium dioxide as well I just grabbed this because I have like a really big bag of it and look at just how how beautiful really there that it's our last little berry just just adorable I wonder I have a little bit more here maybe I'll just drizzle some on the edges here just looks like it could be edible seriously look at that my house smells so good just like sweetness and berries yummy yummy yummy look at that and that beautiful so it looks good we'll leave it at that we'll come in and give you a close-up here aren't they beautiful get my focus in there look at that blue how it just pops in these bombs just adorable so we'll let these dry on the rack for a while and then we'll come back and package them up and actually I uh I'll end the video showing you how I'm gonna wrap these so I'm gonna let these dry out a bit more and then we'll be back and show you how to package them up okay back and try packaging these up now I'll show you what I've got are these shrink wrap bags they're six inch square it's what I used on my other ones I made earlier so I just kind of blow them open a bit and I've got my little heat gun here I bought this off of Amazon it was pretty inexpensive so I'm gonna take one of my bath bombs and I'm a footage I could try to put these in the same way for every for every package so I've got my my little berry facing this way the next one I'll face the berry the other way like so just like that and carefully I take it and I just fold the back edge over upside down holding it and I'll turn on my little heat gun and just start shrinking this up [Music] and around to the front and just like that it doesn't take very long at all and we've got a nicely packaged pair of bath pumps and then I'll put my little labels on them and they're ready to go so we'll do that again here and I've only got four packages to do here because silly me broke a couple bombs straight so there's one and two like so and lifting my edge over gently hold it okay so these are six inch square shrink wrap bag [Music] just to get them nice and tight in there oh I hit that one underneath anyway here's another one see I don't think I'll be able to use this so use it why not I just love these bags I think they're the perfect tool size and that one it's the front and just crank it up nice and tight in the front not too much and our very last one finding the opening making sure I'm not grabbing the bomb that I have cracks that's for me I'll use that tonight so up there with me I let my dog out hold on just a second sorry he was making these little chirping noises by the back door like ha I really won't be long I have to love him right back in anyway we're done anyway drinky dinky doo turn it over and do the front and there we go couldn't be easier so bring it out there we go nice shrink-wrapped pairs of blueberry doughnut

she's probably gonna be watching this so bye Emma have a good day everyone", "LItVt97Ph0Q": "morning everyone this is Cathy and I thought we'd do a little something different today today we're gonna do some bath bombs because I'm getting ready for a craft show and they're very popular and especially the ones that I'm doing today just everybody loves the fragrance and they're very skin softening as well I'm gonna keep my boys in line here so what I've got is my recipe I won't give you the amount but I'll tell you what's in it is the naturally the baking soda I've got epsom salts my citric acid and it's cornstarch and then I use coconut oil I don't use any water I use coconut oil and I have my fragrance and my color and that's it and I have a little bit of witch hazel and a spray bottle to mist my mixture down with you want to be very careful when you're mixing this that you don't get any of the citric acid into the air because it can be a little irritating I mean some of it still gets up in the air even as slow as I'm going but anyway just be as careful as you can with your recipe and I got this recipe from somebody else online that's why I'm not I'm not sharing the exact quantities but it's one that I found pretty works pretty well for me I'm not a pro at bath bombs by any means but but like I said it works so I've got my my mold so my mixture makes usually six six bombs the big bombs Oh and what I do these are blueberry I'm gonna sprinkle a little bit of something blue in here I think I did this yesterday and with the ones I took to the store I think I'm gonna go with the darker candies and I just put just a touch in half of the mold get my molds all separated out here into their proper positions one two three four five and then what I do is I just take a little bit and just just a little bit and sprinkle in one half of each mold just a little bit of this of the candies this much cuz they're just for an accent really so you don't want like a lot like I just don't in just a touch so what I'm gonna do is that gonna make it still like a little in dance here in the middle and they're not gonna pour it all and I've got my in my coconut oil and fragrance and my colorant and the corner probably will stick in there till the end but I pour a little bit in you see I've got my gloves on now we're just gonna kind of mix it in and I like to use my cans that way you can break up any clumps as you go just kind of turn it get to get it incorporated and then you pour a little more in just doing a little bit at a time I found in the past when I started making bat bombs like I said I'm no expert at this but when I used water in the recipe they didn't turn out real well I don't know I think it's cuz the water maybe I put too much in but I find I really like this recipe the colorant I use I'm out of now so I I think I'm gonna next time I do a bramble berry order I'm gonna order some of their blue lip balm because I don't have any other blue Lebon color so I'm gonna order one of the shades of blue so just do like I said just incorporating here flipping it over from time to time making a mess and it's not overly blue but it's blue enough for blueberry and you want to test it when you get to the point where it's holding together pretty good then you can start the last little bit in and then we'll get started filling my molds like I said I'm getting ready for a craft show and I think for Christmas these will be popular everybody loves a nice basketball I've got some Christmas candy ones already made up and so oh so I've got my half with little sprinkles in it and I'm just gonna take a half full and put there I'm gonna take my other half and scoop up and then what we're gonna do is just press them together we're not gonna twist you don't want to you don't want to turn them into each other but you just want to press them together and I like this I got this little padded cover excuse me stop and I just like to lean into it and just press down like I said we're not turning the house we're not going like this we're just pressing together and you'll see it's got like a little lip here when I unmold them I brush that off because you don't want it to look like a flying saucer at least I don't okay so there's one I'm going to set it off here to the side and get my other and just keep going and usually like so usually I can get six out of these it takes it takes a bit of effort to get that last one but because it's all little bits in the bottom of the bowl kind of thing you know so I'm just kind of kind of kind of wiping off the excess here before I start pressing I guess this one's got a lot of excess I might not get a sixth one out depending so I just like I said to kind of lean into it I just want to make sure it's all compacted very nicely set it off to the side and then some people let their sit for a day in the mold I don't I usually go I don't know a couple hours maybe before I unmold them but and then I just I'll let them sit before I put them in a package I love them sit for you know another hour to whatever let's see how many I get out here it smells so good though I love this blueberry this blueberry scent is it's another crafters choice fragrance blueberry and I really like it like I said it's it's a popular one for my bath bombs at the store which if I had to make more yesterday and then I thought well it makes them for the show if you find your mixture starts to dry a little bit which mine is not and that's why we have the witch hazel because then you can give it a spritz just a little bit and mix it in like okay just just a little three or four sports mix it back in and keep going you see yeah I think I'm gonna get him out of this we'll see so they just lean into it you want to make sure it's all nice and compacted so we'll see what what I can get out of this here and I get it all into the center this last was always a little tricky to see it but what I can get out of my bowl I'm gonna kind of tap it out because I've got this a little bit so I'm gonna kind of pile it on over the sink here so there's my 1/2 the room here bit and press it down and I did get six so and I said usually usually I don't unload these right away I will do one for you though so I'll leave the rest in the mold though I'll take out the first one I did I just kind of give a a tap around just a little and I'll take the bottom off like so and then gently flip it over like so and off comes the side our little saucer bits and there you go you have a little bath boom and then I'll just gently set it down and just I'll just leave it alone I'll just let it sit but like I said these I'm gonna I'm gonna let sit before I before I pop them out I just wanted to get one out there for you and if

making no soap so you guys have a great day thank you for watching and if you haven't already hit that subscribe button to see more videos thanks everyone bye bye", "gcafoXBoOI4": "[Music] see why is

gin now what Oh do something [Music] [Music] [Music] hit tell nine nice pork buns I loved him [Music] hae-jin did you get enough to eat let's just say I've got blueberries in places where boomers

keep moving all right come on pang you need to get back to that dog first thing in the morning yes", "Fjfsv5mXy1A": "hello my buddies welcome back today we are going to be making tea bombs so these are basically a tea version of hot chocolate balms so they have a candy shell that is actually flavored with the kind of tea that you like and then just pop it into a cup of boiling water and your tea is ready so let's get started so first we're going to make the shells you want to place three tea bags in a mug and pour one cup of boiling water on top allow it to steep for 20 minutes until the tea is very strong so don't drink it it's going to taste awful but you want the tea to be concentrated enough so that the taste will come through later on then measure out half a cup of tea and pour it into a medium pot along with some granulated sugar and some corn syrup and stir until the sugar has fully dissolved and if this recipe seems a bit familiar to you years ago oh my god i feel like it was another decade ago i made some tea lollipops which are basically the same kind of technique so i'll link that in the cards if you want to see me use this recipe with a huge variety of tea so then while the candy is still boiling and heating you want to prepare the mold so there are two different techniques you can use the first i am going to credit ann reardon from how to cook that because she actually her video showed me how so i'll link her video down below but you're basically going to flip over a silicone half sphere mold and pop it onto your work surface and spray it with cooking spray and then just gently smooth the spray over the entire surface with a small square of paper towel then place the mold on top of a sheet of parchment paper and place something underneath the mold to have it sit at an incline [Music] and then for technique number two it's pretty simple you just want to use that same mold and then just place it right side up on some parchment paper that's literally it set the pot to medium high heat and attach a candy thermometer heat the sugar until it reaches 310 degrees fahrenheit stirring occasionally then remove the pan from the heat and stir until it stops bubbling so then when the candy is ready you want to pour it on to the mold according to the technique you're going to use so for technique number one we're going to pour the candy directly on top of the spheres making sure that it coats all sides and then you want to wait about 10 minutes for the sugar to start to set and then use a round cookie cutter to make a round seam around the edge of the sphere so this is going to make it much easier for the sugar sphere to detach from the rest of the sugar and i'll have these cookie cutters linked below it's much safer if it has a little handle like mine does so don't worry check my description box i have you covered then for technique number two you want to pour the sugar into the molds and let the sugar sit in the molds for about five minutes and then very carefully hold the mold above the pot and turn it upside down allowing the sugar to pour back into the pot so this is basically a chocolate technique that i tried with candy and it works almost i think better than the first one you guys will see later it's much stronger the walls are much sturdier but you do get a little bit of candy pooling at the bottom so it just depends on what you like if you'd like your tea to be sweeter use this technique if you'd like it to be less sweet use technique number one then allow the sugar to cool and harden completely for about three or four hours or i waited overnight and then very carefully unmold the shells and set aside you also want to make extra because i broke so many of them like from technique number one because it's much more delicate so we're also going to be filling the tea bombs with some tea so you could either just put a tea bag in the middle but i'm like no we're going to make it 100 edible and dissolvable so we are going to make some gummy bears so you're going to add some tea bags to some boiling water again and steep for 20 minutes [Music] then remove those tea bags and add enough hot water to restore it back to one cup of liquid then you want to get some gelatin and pour it into a microwave safe bowl and pour about a third of a cup of the tea on top stir it to combine and then microwave for 10 second intervals until the gelatin has fully melted mix then pour it back into the remaining tea and whisk to combine then pour the mixture into a silicone gummy bear mold and chill them in the fridge for about 30 minutes or until they are firm [Music] then to assemble your t-bombs place one shell onto an espresso glass this is just gonna make it easier for it to stay in place and then fill the shell with the gummy bears then a top with some sugar stars if you like just because it's cute and then to steal them close we're gonna brush the edges of the bottom shell with some water and press the other shell on top to seal now these are much more delicate than the hot chocolate balm so like don't like roll them around i'd recommend like being quite delicate with them and then when you're ready to have your tea just place the tea bomb into a mug pour some hot water on top and you are done so i also want to let you know that since the little sphere is made of sugar this is going to be quite sweet tea so if you don't like sweetened tea this is not for you i cannot think of a way to make this circle the shell without sugar if you have any suggestions let me know and i can definitely try it out so thank you so much for watching i hope that you like this recipe i will link my hot chocolate recipe in the cards here if you'd like to check it out i showed three different techniques on making them and adding different flavors and using different shapes so if you would like to see that video it's linked in the cards right here but anyways yes thank you so much for watching and i will see you guys next tuesday for an all new video bye", "psxCb6CbRO8": "okay let me show you how i've been doing this first i'm using gold luster dust this is edible this is what i use on cookies and i've also tried the rose gold it i didn't like the way it looked when it's rolled in the glass as much as i like the regular gold so i mean i'm just letting you know this is um my favorite and then i purchased this on amazon just to test this and see if it's something that i can do and let me show you how i'm doing it i take a very small piece of cotton candy because if you put too much in there it doesn't dissolve very fast the smallest measuring spoon that i have is an eighth of a teaspoon and it was way too much so i just pulled out a little baby spoon let me show you how much i'm using just a tiny tiny amount that's it then you're going to take your cotton candy in this small little piece and you're going to um close it up tightly like that and then take some of this that's more fluffy and just kind of put it around it like that and then that's it it's done now let me show you um what it looks like when we put it in the sprite so i have tried sprite i have tried ginger ale i have tried wine sparkling cider i've tried just about everything this is ginger ale i prefer sprite because it is clearer but i am currently out of sprite so i'm going to show you this one in ginger ale so you just take it and drop it in and when you stir [Music] let's see if i can good is", "hFWwtif9D0s": "[Music] hi everyone welcome back to pretty pastel pastries if you're new here hi my name is giselle today i have for you guys these super easy strawberry hot cocoa bombs just in time for december now let's go ahead and hop onto the tools and supplies so let's first start off with our chocolate melting wafers i love using the brown ghirardelli right here i have my oxo silicone cups everything i use will be linked in the description box down below for you guys don't forget to check that out we're going to be using nesquik in the flavor strawberry a tablespoon some mini marshmallows now right over here have my half sphere molds already cut up a cupcake tray with some cupcake liners now right here i have my sheet tray lined with some silicone now right over here i have two small spatulas a small pastry brush some scissors and one or two brushes now onto decoration we have our silicone butterfly mold we're going to be using these sprinkles this one is from the brand sweetest thing bake shop we are going to be using color mill in the color candy and lastly some diamond dust rose gold and some piping bags so we covered everything here in today's video now don't forget to stay till the end because i will show you guys the many ways that i like to package all my cocoa bombs all right guys with that being said let's hop right into the video i forgot to mention we're going to be using chef master candy coloring in the color violet now to our chocolate i'm going to go ahead and place this into the microwave for 30 second intervals and we'll be right back so this is right after the first 30 seconds and as you guys can see there's a little bit of melting going on towards the bottom you always want to grab your spatula and keep mixing everything around just so that the heat distributes evenly after this we're going to place it into the microwave for 30 seconds more now my chocolate is all nice and melted at this point now i'm going to add some to this small cup right here and we're going to reserve this for drizzling later so let me just go ahead and add some to this cup [Music] so this small cup is only used for drizzling so i'm just going to set this one off to the side and to this one we're going to add some of our color mill in the color candy just always make sure to shake it up now i'm going to add a couple drops in here you can just see the kind of pink you would like i'm going to add like about three drops and we can go from there so i added about 15 drops and that pink looks absolutely beautiful i loved how it turned out now we're gonna go ahead and hop onto our silicone molds so to coat our half sphere mold we're simply going to grab our chocolate and we're going to place it into this mold it doesn't matter how much you add inside um we're going to end up removing a lot of it out now we're going to go ahead and just move this all around make sure to get every side [Music] now since we have that all nice and covered you see that extra chocolate in there we don't want that to stay in there we're going to place it back into our cup and make sure to take off as much as you [Music] can [Music] now since we're done we're going to place these into the refrigerator for about five minutes and we'll be right back now our cocoa bombs are nice and set out of the refrigerator i'm going to show you guys what to do for step number two so we're going to grab our melted pink chocolate i just reheated mines by the way now we're going to grab our cocoa bomb and our pastry brush and we're gonna go ahead and actually dip this right in here and we're gonna go ahead and add some all around and it's as easy as that guys we're all done with this one let's go ahead and do it to the rest and we'll be right back [Music] so now that our chocolate is nice and set it is super easy to take it out of its mold you're just gonna go ahead and start pulling away from all the sides and once you do that you're gonna get your palm of your hand you're gonna place it here you're gonna use this hand to guide it upwards just like that and they came out so pretty i'm gonna do this to the rest of them and we'll be right back now at this point we're going to grab half of the sphere mold we're going to place it on this really hot plate just be really careful and you're just going to spin it a couple times we just want the bottom to be nice and flat you're going to pick it up from the bottom and as you guys can see that is perfect now i'm going to place this on my cupcake mold right here now we're going to do the same to each and every one of them and we'll be right back now that we have that done i'm gonna go ahead and grab my nesquik and i'm going to add one tablespoon and actually one teaspoon inside so let's go ahead and do that [Music] now from here this is going to be one of the most trickiest parts a lot of people have like problems with but don't worry it's going to be okay just go ahead and follow these simple steps so you're gonna grab your cocoa bomb we're gonna do the same as step number one so let's go ahead and do that together now you wanna pick it up from the bottom and really quickly place it on top of your cocoa bomb now from here you want to ensure all the corners are nice and like set um and a way to ensure you're doing that don't just place it on top and just like you know just call it a day actually like go throughout these three corners here one two and three and just press them there to just make sure that it's nice and centered and just hold it at the top for a couple seconds [Music] and that cocoa bomb should be nice and sealed but if for some reason your cocoa bomb tends to be a little bit like more like not so leveled and straight that is most likely because you're pushing it off the corner right here and we definitely do not want that so like i said before pick it up from the bottom directly so we're going to go ahead and do that to the rest of them and we'll be right back [Music] now hopping into decoration we're going to have some pink left over and we also reserved this white from the beginning so basically to this pink one we're gonna add some chef master candy coloring always make sure to shake this up and i'm going to add one drop and we can go from there so one drop was perfect it left us with this really beautiful like lavender color and we're both going to place these into our piping bags and i also got a question earlier asking how do you add your chocolate into your piping bag and it's really easy if not i have an alternative for you you're just going to go ahead and open it up i like to cup this over my hand just like this and just like put it right here by your hand you're going to open it up now you can see that the chocolate's not going to overflow over here and you're going to have a huge mess now you're just going to grab your chocolate and you're gonna add it inside [Music] now from here i like to just scrape away the extra chocolate you're gonna pick this back up directly so go ahead and close this up you're going to pick it up just like that and that is pretty much it guys that is how you fill a piping bag with some chocolate and if you ever want to set it down for any reason i would recommend you set it down like this okay now i'm going to show you guys the other way that i like adding chocolate inside is you just grab a cup um a smaller one would be a lot better you're going to add your piping bag inside and you're just going to cup it over your cup [Music] just like that now it is much easier to also add in your chocolate so let's go ahead and do that and at this point you can actually use a spatula to help scrape all the chocolate inside [Music] so now that that's done you're gonna pick it back up and try to push as much as you can down and yep it's as easy as that guys [Music] now from here we're going to grab our butterfly mold i'm actually just going to use one and we're going to use this really pretty lavender color and just pipe it inside so let's cut a small tip on here and from here we're just going to go ahead and pipe it inside [Music] [Applause] [Music] and we're going to place this in the refrigerator for about four minutes so i went ahead and cut a small tip on my white chocolate piping bag now from here we're going to do a simple drizzle and we're going to add some of our beautiful sprinkles on there [Music] now we're going to grab some of our sprinkles and just sprinkle it all around then we're gonna go ahead and move on to our next one and we're gonna drizzle this one in our beautiful lavender [Music] then quickly we're gonna grab our butterflies right here and just place them around with the little amount of chocolate [Music] [Music] then we're going to grab some of these really tiny chocolate balls right here and just place them all around [Applause] now from here we're going to grab our diamond dust in the color rose gold and i'm going to add a little bit on the side of my silicone then we're going to grab a small little fluffy brush you want to pack a little bit on there and we're just going to go ahead and add some to this butterfly [Music] now for our next bomb we're going to combine both colors together and form it into this really awesome combination so let's go ahead and drizzle some of this lavender and some of our white [Music] and just to finish this one off we're going to add some white amount of chocolate and we're going to add a couple of marshmallows in the center now i'm going to grab back my small little brush and add a little bit more diamond dust to the marshmallows and to our last cocoa bomb we're going to grab it just like this and we're going to add some chocolate to the sides you want to work really quickly with this and just go all around the bottom [Music] now since we have that all nice and covered we're going to grab our sprinkles and just roll it in here [Music] just like this we're going to place it on here let it set now i'm going to place this one actually in my cupcake liner just so that i know like where is the middle so let me just place that in there and then now we know it's like nice and centered we're gonna go ahead and add one mound of chocolate just a little bit and i also went ahead and did a chocolate butterfly so we're just gonna place this one in the center [Music] so on to packaging we're first going to start off with this one right here and we're gonna go ahead and place one of them inside now around it i actually like adding marshmallows so let me go ahead and do [Music] that [Music] now onto our next packaging we're going to use this one right here this one is for a four slot cupcake holder and i'm going to show you guys what this looks like when it's all nice and decorated [Music] now our last option is to place it in a mug just like this i personally like this one because it's big enough for you to place the bomb inside and you can also see what's happening so i did purchase this one off of walmart so let's go ahead and add our butterfly one inside but before we place this one inside i'm going to place it into this one right here and we're going to seal it off with a cute bow [Music] so now that we have that bow nice in there we're gonna place this into our cup but we can't forget the extra marshmallows now if you were to leave your extra marshmallows like exposed to air they would get hard within time so i went ahead and bagged mine in this cute little bag and i just also went ahead and added some diamond dust and rose gold to these little marshmallows and since this bag is pretty flat this fits right behind our bomb [Music] and lastly i purchased these teaspoons from walmart as well and let me just go ahead and take this off now to this teaspoon you can just go ahead and add it in there or you can also add a bow um up to you but i'm just going to leave mines like that now to just bring it all together i grabbed this really big plastic bag right here and we're going to add this inside now to close it i'm going to use a different colored ribbon actually changed my mind i'm going to add a ribbon to this one right here in the center you're just going to lift it up and tie the bow so i just ended this off with my bow and a really cute pen my sister made me so thank you jennifer um but yeah guys that is my last one to show you guys for packaging and i just love how it came out um everything is in there and it is just ready to be sent off to your best friend family member anyone um but i really hope you guys did enjoy this video so we're all done with all of our designs i love how each and every one came out don't forget to

beautiful t-bombs t-bombs are fast becoming popular and they're so special to serve for your next tea i'm chef sally stick with me to the end of this video as i show you the tips and tricks in making these gorgeous tea bombs to make these tea bombs i will show you how to work with isomalt isomalt is a sugar substitute created from beet sugar it is less sweet than sugar and is used as a sugar-free alternative if you've never worked with hot sugar or with isomalt it can be a little tricky to work with and it's extremely hot isomalt is odorless and it has little to no impact on blood sugar levels so it does not stimulate the release of insulin in the body on medium-high heat melt isomalt in a pan i prefer to work with a non-stick pan when working with melted sugars and with isomalt i'm not using very much isomalt about a half a cup and it's produced a lot of shells for me when melting the ice malt rotate the pan from side to side to regulate the heat and promote even melting once melted keep the ice malt over low heat while creating the tea bombs this will help to ensure that it's still fluid when you're forming your t-bomb shells to decorate the t-bombs i added bits of edible gold leaf to a silicon demi-sphere mold the gold will stick to the sides of the mold keeping them in place when working pour melted ice malt into the cavity about halfway from the top to color the tea bombs stir in a bit of blue food coloring use a skewer to dip into the color and stir the color into the isomalt as this helps to create a pretty pattern to the shells lift and rotate the silicon mold to cover the sides of the mold be careful as the ice malt is extremely hot when doing this step i place the silicone mold on top of a warmed stone surface this will keep the ice malt fluid for longer to make it easier to work with you want to achieve nice even walls to the shell that are thin and delicate once cooled carefully remove the shells from the mold and set aside do limit the consumption of isomalt but because these tea bombs are thin and delicate you don't have to worry about it compared to using regular sugar isomalt has a lowered melting point which allows for a crystal clear appearance as opposed to using sugar as it melts with the high temperatures the sugar can have a tendency to brown to fill the tea bombs position some of the shells back into the mold add a teaspoon of good quality loose leaf tea to the shells these gorgeous aqua blue and gold speckled tea bombs are filled with a fragrant green tea with citrus and licorice but have fun when making these tea bombs by changing the colors as well as using your favorite loose leaf tea or you can use tea bags before sealing the balms i'm wearing two layers of gloves first i'm wearing a thin cotton glove to buffer some of the heat i added a form-fitting natural glove on top of the cotton glove to help with handling the isomalt when melting and forming the bombs using a hot nonstick fry pan place an empty shell into the pan to warm the edges position the shell on top of a filled shell and add gentle pressure to seal the balm continue to do this with your remaining bombs to smooth out any rough or jagged edges around the seam pick up a t-bomb and roll the seam of the bomb onto the hot pan to gently melt and smooth the edges be careful as the t-bombs are very thin and delicate and they may crack if too much pressure is applied [Music] to serve your tea bombs add freshly boiled water to the teapot place a tea bomb into a teapot or your favorite mug and allow the tea to steep when steeping tea it can take between three to four minutes for white tea or green teas when steeping herbal or black teas it can take up to four to five minutes to steep the tea properly for today's indulgence i'm serving the tea in vintage china and using this antique tea strainer to catch any loose tea leaves doesn't this look stunning these tea bombs are perfect for an afternoon tea and they make lovely gifts too

my first episode i showed you how to make the uber training coco bombs if you haven't checked that out it's definitely a must watch now let's get down to business because i'm not like the other youtubers who say the same thing over and over and over again so that they can waste your time and get more youtube ads in their videos so let's get started first you're gonna need some butterfly pea flowers tea is loose leaf you're gonna need some isomalt sugar you're gonna need some granulated sugar [Music] a microwave fake bowl my secret and guardian of edible glitter [Music] silicone mold and gloves for safety let's get started it's time to melt our isomalt i have about 15 to 20 minutes that's going to be enough to make one tea bomb now i am going to microwave the nibs at 20 second intervals until they are bubbling and melted completely oh they're still hard as a rock uh it's starting to bubble but we still have some glaciers in this 20 more things i think after one more round we'll be ready to go be super careful from this moment forward because these melted nibs can burn you now we have to work quickly i'm going to get this melted goodness over to our dome station and we are going to make our molds our isomalt nibs are freshly melted from the microwave and we're ready to go if you have any protective gloves to wear please put those on right now i myself have a high tolerance to heat so i am good to go without them so you want to fill your molds up about 1 4 the way full and pay close attention to the edges a good seal is the make or break of this project and yes if you hear that that's my cat sassy in the background wreaking havoc all right let's go ahead and make our second dome you can add food coloring to this step with us using butterfly pea flower i didn't feel like that was necessary we're actually going to have a chemical reaction take place and our t-bomb is gonna change colors right before your eyes it's super cool party trick i cannot wait to show y'all now let's do a once over and try to get these edges as flush as possible that's less melting that we have to do later all right it's looking good next step is that we're gonna put these in the freezer for about five to ten minutes and then afterwards i'm going to see you at my kitchen stove see you soon welcome to my stove top i have a few things going on here and i'm going to fill you in on the details i have a simple syrup mixture going that's one part water to one part sugar i have that on a low heat and i am going to heat that up until all of the sugar melts that's going to be my sweetener for my tea i also have this non-stick pan going at a low heat this is what i am going to seal on my t-bones with we have our t-bombs fresh from the freezer they are looking so glamorous i'm going to get them very carefully out of the mold all right first things first i'm going to start on the first side and get the edge completely straight all right i'm going to add our secret ingredient of edible glitter it's going to be beautiful when it explodes and also i am going to add one scoop of our butterflower tea one scoop is about six to eight flower buds this is three here we are now let's make our seal looks like we need to melt it a little bit more again be very careful with this step and do not burn yourself let's go one more time it's almost there and there we have it we have our first t-bomb let's let these set for about another five minutes in the freezer and we are ready to go this is the moment y'all been waiting for whoa something's happening the glitter definitely is a nice touch oh something's still happening now we are going to let our glitter bomb actually set and seat for about five minutes and then we're off to part two of our magic trick we're only a couple seconds into steeping and you can see how this butterfly pea flower is turning into this beautiful royal blue right before your eyes this is absolutely hypnotic look at this like if disney was in a glass this would be it this is just enchanting while we were waiting for our tea to steep i actually added some lemon juice to our one part sugar one part water simple syrup so now there is one part sugar one part water and then half parts lemon juice this is going to be the secret ingredient for our color reaction so here we go y'all wow and here you have it the best party trick ever let's recap everything that we just witnessed from this magical tea behind the scenes butterfly pea flower is great for your heart helps with diabetic conditions and is an amazing stress reliever just brew a tea of this sit back relax and let your worries melt away as you just saw this tea is one of the best party tricks ever and as for taste let's try it out it tastes just like an earthy lemonade delicious now i know a few of you were asking about the color changing and how that took place whenever you add lemon to the butterfly pea flower it changes the ph of the tea therefore giving you a color reaction if you have any questions feel free to drop those in the comments also i have attached my links for all the products that i used during today's t-bomb making stay tuned next time for my next project and again thank you guys for watching", "bwn38sBcWYg": "[Music] hi guys today we're gonna be eating cotton candy and white chocolate desserts so let's get started do so so so so [Music] so [Music] so so so so so so so so so so so so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so wow stretch so so so so so last ones cheers [Music] so [Music] so so bye guys thanks for watching", "tTRR3yraDxM": "hello everyone and welcome back to my channel in this video i'm going to show you guys how to make peppermint hot chocolate bumps i hope you guys like this idea and this is all the ingredients that we're going to need this is a hot cocoa powder that i'm going to be using this one i got it at walmart but there's a lot of different brands that you can use so for the powder you can use anything that you like you're also going to need mini marshmallows and this is a chocolate that i'm going to be using this chocolate you can find it at sam's club target or walmart i'm also using the red color so i can give my bombs the look of the candy cane i also have some edible dust and look i found this candy cane spoons at the 99 cents or you can also find them at the dollar tree and to make my chocolate bumps i'm going to be using this molds this molds are for bath bombs i found this at hobby lobby it comes in a set of three for like four dollars you can also use the silicone molds i ordered one on amazon and i haven't received it yet so that's why i'm using these molds also if you want to make it as a gift i found this box at hobby lobby it was only like seven dollars and they have a 50 off so you can pay a little bit less and this cup i got it at walmart and i think it would be a great gift if you have this also to cover your bombs i have this red foil this one i got it on amazon a while ago but i'm going to go ahead and use it for this video i also have some paper shred so i can put it on the bottom and now we're gonna begin by melting our chocolate i'm going to melt it in the microwave by doing intervals of 30 seconds i also have my red chocolate already in this piping bag and what i'm gonna do first is make some lines on the molds and this is gonna give the look of the candy cane like the peppermint uh candy and now we're gonna go ahead and add the white chocolate i'm gonna go ahead and add two full spoons and that's gonna be enough also uh just make sure that your white chocolate is not too hot because if it is uh it will start melting the red chocolate and now we're just going to move it around so all the surface of the mold can get nice and covered with the white chocolate [Music] and now it's ready once you have it all covered and for this one i'm going to go ahead and leave it like this this is going to be like a chocolate ball and later i'm going to go ahead and make an opening and for the second one i'm going to do the same design but i'm going to go ahead and make two separate pieces and after we're going to glue them together so this is two different ways that you can do it with this molds and if you do it this way just make sure that you get all around the edges so that way when you separate it from the mold it's not too thin and doing it this way it's a lot easier because you can see how much chocolate you have so if you feel like it's a little thin go ahead and add a little more and just move it around so you can get the chocolate all around the the malt and now we're gonna go ahead and place it in the freezer i'm gonna place it in the freezer for like 10 minutes or you'll be able to see when it starts separating from the mold that's when you can remove it if you see it that is still um not separating from the mold that means that the chocolate is still um hot that is not set yet [Music] and look this is what i mean by saying that it separates from the mold i almost feel like the chocolate shrinks a little bit because it separates completely from the malt so now just very gently you're going to open it and it's going to be very easy to remove it from the mold and look now we have these beautiful colors i just love the candy cane look of the chocolate bombs and now i'm gonna go ahead and remove the chocolate from the two separate pieces and it should be pretty easy too i like to flip them so that way um the chocolate stays on my counter but if it doesn't um just um gently just try to remove it from the mold and look it comes off pretty easy and now with a decorating tip i'm gonna go ahead and make an opening you just have to warm it up a little bit so the chocolate can melt i'm using a lighter so it's uh just be careful that you won't give burn but um this way it's pretty easy and now we have an opening so we can put all the ingredients inside and now we're going to go ahead and fill them up with our cocoa powder i'm going to go ahead and add a full spoon but you can add a little more or less it all depends on your liking also i'm going to add some mini marshmallows and to give the peppermint taste i'm gonna add a little bit of candy cane crush candy and to glue them together i have some boiling water and i just place a baking tray on the top so that way it gets nice and hot and just place your half chocolate and glue them together and that should do the work and now i'm gonna go ahead and add my cocoa powder to my chocolate balls and for this one i'm using a cupcake liner so it's easier to put all the ingredients in there [Music] and to cover the opening i'm just going to use some of my candy canes i'm going to cut it in pieces and i'm going to use my white chocolate and just glue them in there i'm also going to add a little bit of the crushed candy just to sprinkle it on the top and i think this is going to give a really cute look or you can also seal it with just chocolate if you don't want to have too much of the candy cane [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] and now i'm just gonna add a little bit of my edible dust and this is gonna give a really nice shine to my chocolate bumps [Music] and here i have some chocolate i'm going to dip my mug in there and i'm also going to be adding some sprinkles some of the candy cane you can add anything that you like and this is going to give a really cute look and especially if you want to give it as a gift if you really like this candy you can go ahead and add this much if not maybe more sprinkles it will be better so you don't have so much taste of the candy cane of the minty taste and as if you want to make it as a gift i want to give you an idea here really quickly i have this um this box and i'm just going to be placing my mug and my three chocolate bumps and look at this it will be a really cute gift very easy and inexpensive i'm also adding one of my spoons here and i think it will be a really nice gift and now let's try one of our chocolate bombs and just make sure that you add really hot milk and look at this they look delicious and the taste it was very very good i hope you guys um try this it's really fun if you do this with your kids they will love making these chocolate balms and especially they would love to eat this chocolate i hope you guys enjoyed this video if you guys did don't forget to like my video subscribe to my channel and i'll see you guys on my next video thanks for those who asked me to make this video in english i'm sorry for posting this video so late but this is for you guys that asked me to make it in english thank you so much bye", "HIUG1eqrFVY": "hey what's happening guys today Michelle we're making some strawberry cream cheese fat bombs that literally tastes like strawberry cheesecake this breast babe totally delicious totally easy it's another one of those tossed everything in your food processor processed that thing up and boom the recipes pretty much over it's one of those kinds of recipes very few ingredients very few steps but tons of deliciousness so that being said let's jump into this one let's make some fat bombs alright so the first thing you want to do for these fat bombs is get together your cream cheese so what we're gonna do is we're gonna chop up about six ounces or a hundred and sixty eight grams of some full fat cream cheese and we're gonna be adding those chopped up chunks as you'll see to our food processor now I highly recommend having a food scale to do this because that way you know you're adding the right amount of cream cheese to your food processor if you want to pick one up there's a link to grab one in the video description below but after we've added all the cream cheese to our food processor the next thing we have to prep is some melted butter so in a small dish we're gonna add four tablespoons of some unsalted butter then we're gonna go ahead and pop that in a microwave for about fifteen to thirty seconds which should just be long enough to let the butter melt completely and while the butter is melting we can add in our strawberries we're not gonna be adding a ton of strawberries because we're gonna be keeping the carbs pretty low but enough to give it a nice strawberry flavor so we're gonna be adding three-quarters of a cup or about 105 grams of some sliced frozen strawberries and now at this point the melted butter should be done in the microwave so we can go ahead and add that into our food processor as well as some sweetener now today I'm using swerves confectioners erythritol and I highly recommend using the confectioner's kind instead of the granulated kind because in fat bombs the granulated kind can kind of make them sorta grainy so I'm gonna be adding two tablespoons or about 24 grams of the confectioners sugar all to my food processor and once you've added all the earther all the last ingredient we're gonna add is the juice from half a lemon so now at this point we've got all of our ingredients added into our food processor we're just gonna pop that onto the base of the food processor get our top on there and then we're gonna process things for about a minute or two but at some point you want to scrape down the sides of the food processor just because the cream cheese will have a tendency to stick to your food processor and just to make sure everything kind of blends together really nicely you'll have to process everything one more time after you scrape down the sides so at this point you want to get out a mini muffin tray and some paper liners and line the slots of the tray with your paper liners when you get the liner set up you can go ahead start adding the batter to the paper liners I personally like to use a cookie scoop to do this that way each fat bomb kind of has the same amount of fat bomb batter in it and if you do that you should end up with about 18 to 20 fat bombs so once you've got all that fat bomb batter added to the mini muffin tray you'll want to freeze the tray for at least an hour and when you're done freezing the fat bombs and you take the tray out from the freezer you just want to slightly bang it against your countertop to loosen the fat bombs from the tray because sometimes the fat bombs will end up sticking to the tray and this will just make it easy to get them out and you should end up with some delicious looking strawberry cheesecake fat bombs like this all right so that's today's fat bomb recipe I hope you guys enjoyed it if you want the full written out recipe with the metric measurements and the macros that's in the video description below along with links to all the products that I used to make the fat bombs today thank you guys so much for watching I hope you enjoyed these and I'll see you in the next recipe", "PF4wE75NsLY": "hi friends this is Susie your candy crush guru here to give you a tutorial on how to create color bombs I've chosen a nice big board it's almost got 81 squares it's almost a nine by nine grid and I've got five colors which is kind of medium not as tough as if I had six colors on the board but certainly more difficult than if there were only four here what I'm going to do just because it's a bit visually distracting is I'm just going to go ahead and get rid of the stripes that set up on the board already and then we're gonna take a look at some patterns to see some potential one of the reasons I get rid of those is because other specials can actually blow up and explode your chance thereby of making the specials that you want so the first thing I do is I look for setups like this striped candy possibility is it possible for me to extend this by one to make a color bomb out of it well not really because I've got a green here except I could do this before I do this let me show you some other possibilities on the board here's another one where I could make a stripe so maybe I could get a purple here or here's where I could make a stripe so maybe I could get a green here and that's a possibility I could drop this down it's tougher when it's on the end though another pattern that we could look for is if we had like two green here and two green here and no green in here and then we could try to drop a green down and then it could hit here here or here and it would give us a good chance of getting your color bomb here would be directly made it here or here would be one more step so this kind of works I'm going to go for it but it's a little bit of finagling on this board I have 50 moves so it's not such a big deal so I'm going to do this and hope things don't go too crazy oh hold on a minute now here are some other opportunities that were created here's that green that I was talking about so if I could drop a green through here that would help you know if it gets here here or here and then here's the blue equivalent but if I do this it would have to drop into position here or here it's not as easy so I'm going to go with the that is the easiest and I'm actually going to put a stripe in here because if I have to take the stripe out then it can reset this whole line because there's no green in that line anyway although you can see that sometimes it's pretty rough this is not working out for me I'm going to I don't wait to do this here's that green that I need it's a little bit too far away but I do this and I drop it into position so it was a bit fussy but we got there and then I made another one while I was doing that so that is one way to make things now I said I was going to bring this down to put the green in but as I played around I lost that opportunity because this would come first of all I can't move this over now and this would come down oh I could actually bring this down with this orange so if I could get this out of the way that would work so let's try it it took the orange away wouldn't you know it took the orange away and this would bring it down too far so sometimes the things that we do have unintended consequences and of course I'm trying to make a whole bunch of color bones and show you the potential potential is different than actual and so we are sometimes going to run into little bumps and problems along the way now let's see another way to try to make color bumps on a board is to get rid of a color to concentrate things down I happen to have color bombs one way to get a color bomb is to set off a color bomb so if I take out a color then it's going to reduce the number of colors on the board I'll still get some red here and I could choose any color to reduce I just chose red because I chose red and then I look around and I see did it give me that opportunity almost I've got this orange jacket almost to get another orange here but not quite maybe I could get a purple to drop in but that's a one in five shot that's not likely oh here we go look at how this blue has lined up and it's separated if I do this I think I get that and then you always have to look to see did it setup anything new for you yes it did look now I can move this orange over and I can make a color bomb like this okay so these are the ways that you go about doing it and now I look and I don't really have a good setup and there's a lot more red on the board then there used to be just a bit ago and can't quite get an orange down here and there's this color bomb in the way so let's take out another color and see if that gives us more color bombs and now my only problem is I only have one of these to remove so the game is going to end fairly soon here if I take out purple this gets gone if I take out blue this gets gone if I take out an orange stripe this gets gone let's try to take out just a regular orange and see if I don't get a cascade so I can keep playing here oh well all right so that's how I make color bombs there sometimes you don't have a color bomb on the board in that case what I do when I'm using a color bomb and I'm removing a color what I do is usually go for one of the more prevalent colors and just wipe it out especially if I'm looking for points because then that will give me more points but if I don't have a color bomb and I think well if I could just reduce the number of colors on the board manually if I've got enough turns to consider that then I go for the least popular color on the board because it'll take me less moves to get those removed presumably and if I could take out the majority of one color like red then that would set up the rest of the colors to be more likely to be matched hopefully this was helpful if you have any questions or comments if you came up with ideas I didn't think of for making a color bomb please list those below please ask any questions you have because I want this to serve for everyone who's really struggling making those color bombs and as always thank you so much for watching", "yY6jJlnOR58": "[Music] [Applause] by now you guys have seen those fun hot cocoa bombs that are flooding the internet and all it is is just hot cocoa mix surrounded by a shell of chocolate so when you put it into your mug and then pour some hot milk or hot water over it it melts and explodes and releases your hot cocoa and if you put marshmallows in it too it releases those up too they're super fun well did you guys know that you could also make a tea bomb and that's what we're making today i'm annie from ketofocus.com and i've teamed up with chalk zero and i'm going to show you how to make a sugar-free tea bomb for your tea so this is a fun sugar-free outer shell and inside is some tea so when you pop it in your mug it will melt and explode up all these beautiful tea leaves let's get started to make our sugar-free tea bomb you want to start by adding one cup of sweetener to your saucepan and you can use whatever sweetener you want i'm going to be using a monk fruit blend sweetener but you could use erythritol too if you wanted to we're also going to add 1 3 cup of choco syrup now you can feel free to use whatever flavor you want you can use strawberry vanilla caramel whatever you want to add to give it that fun sweetness chalk zero has a wide range of flavors they even have seasonal ones like coconut and mango and peach so if it's summertime that's usually when those flavors roll out this would be perfect for that the only flavor that i don't know if it would work is their chocolate just because that does have a different formulation so just stick with their other basic syrups and we're also going to add in two tablespoons of water stir that until it's combined and we're heating this over medium-high to high heat you want to cook this until your candy thermometer reaches 300 degrees which is the hard crack stage and if you wanted to make some color tea bombs you could just add a few drops of food coloring to this mixture and then you'd have a beautiful like pink or green tea bomb once your candy thermometer reaches 300 degrees we're going to remove this from the stove and we're going to work fast i'm going to be using a mold this is a silicone mold for our t-bombs and you can find these on amazon probably even some department stores have these too but what we're going to do is just spoon a little bit probably like a tablespoon or two of each into each little cavity of our mixture and then just coat the edges too and continue to slide it up the edges because it's going to cool fairly fast but as you pour it in it's just going to run down too so you need to just keep on dragging it up along and then going from cavity to cavity and after a while it will actually set and harden and once it's hardened we're going to peel off our silicone mold and you'll be left with a half of a half a moon shape of your tea bomb now this mold holds six halves so we'll be making three tea balms with this so once you have your halves then for three of them we're going to add in some tea leaves so whatever tea leaves that you want to add in there you can add in you can put in a tea bag too now to seal this we only work with one of them so it's one of the the half moons that doesn't have any tea in it we're gonna put this on a skillet over medium high heat and this will just melt our edges of our half moon just enough so that you can stick it onto the other half and have it seal now we're ready for some tea [Music] look at that beautiful explosion of fun tea leaves and flowers i hope you guys enjoyed this recipe make sure you tag chalk zero with all of your photos of your sugar-free tea bombs [Music] you", "aHVuM_sN4bk": "hey bees I'm Murray from humble bee and me and today we're doing a little bit of a Halloween DIY with these candy corn bath bombs I should probably admit right off the bat that I really don't like candy corn it does not taste nice but I love the way it looks it's very visually striking with its orange and yellow and white color scheme and it was just very like quintessentially Halloween and so I thought that it would make a great bath bomb theme our colors come from a couple different Mica's an orange mica at a yellow mica not surprisingly our scent comes from how to two places and I've kept up sort of Halloween appropriate there's some benzoin which is quite vanilla like and then we're using cocoa butter as part of the oils for the bath bombs you get a little bit of a chocolates in a little bit of vanilla scent it's quite soft and lovely if you wanted to use a fragrance oil instead something there's an oak barrel cider type fragrance that I have that seems really quite well suited to her folly Halloween times you could also use that and that would be great the basic part of our bath bomb mixture is baking soda it has a basic pH and then we have two acidic ingredients there's cream of tartar and citric acid so the cream of tartar is technically optional and I do bake it in the video without cream of tartar but I gotta warn you this is like bath bombing on hardmode it is so much more pleasant to make this recipe with the cream of tartar in there makes for much firmer bombs that mold much much more easily and come together just much much more yeah 100% and worth sourcing yourself some cream of tartar and putting it in your bath bombs and if you are looking at Krupa tartre the grocery store in like Murray you're crazy this stuff is very expensive the little tiny tins go look at your DIY supplier chances are they'll sell it to you in a big old bag for way less money alright let's go get our Halloween fizz on we're going to begin by combining the powdered ingredients for our base so in this large bowl I have 416 grams of baking soda and to that I'm going to add 250 grams of citric acid and 73 grams of epsom salts this is going to be our oil phase so in this little heat-resistant glass measuring cup I have 32 grams of unrefined cocoa butter and 16 grams of polysorbate 80 so now I need to go melt this through okay so it was about 420 second versus in microwave and everything is melted through you could also do that in a water bath if you wanted and now we are going to add our scent to this mixture then this is going to be some benzoin resin oide which smells wonderfully vanilla like and goes really beautifully with the cocoa scent so we need 8 grams of this we're going to give the powder base a bit of a stir with a spatula and use that to start breaking up any clumps and once this is reasonably uniform we'll add our oil mixture and blend that in in much the same way you so now that the oils have had a chance to cool down a little bit and I've got everything distributed sort of well enough that I'm not going to get a giant handful of benzoin and end up smelling like vanilla all day which wouldn't be the worst thing in the world I'm gonna get in here with my hands and start kind of breaking up these clumps and further incorporating the oil so you can see with just the oil incorporated this still does hold together pretty well like it's not great but we won't need a ton of liquid to bring it all the way together which is great so we're going to start with witch hazel I'm going to kind of get this spread out as much as I can and then we're going to do a couple quick mists and mix and mix and mix pretty good I'm going to do a couple spritzes of alcohol and then we are ready to move on before we divide this up and color it and start molding I'm going to do kind of a test mold so kind a generous scoop into each half and a light tap you're not packing it in at his face just general generally light scoop tap press together do not twist or you will share the two halves apart whack with a spoon to help with release will boom boom okay perfect let us get to the colorful part divide this up a bit I'm gonna have it be mostly white with bits with like yellow and orange end caps to kind of work with our theme so for our Micah's I have two here from yellow B these were gifted to me so you have orange sunset to Dazzler and yellow Vani Buttercup Sparkle all right moment of truth our first colorful bath bar you nice I think I'm gonna get a little bit more alcohol when these you now there's quite a lot of powder there but not really enough to make another bath bomb so I thought we just pour some water in here and watch it fizz and here you can see our finished candy corn bath bombs so these bad boys need to dry at least overnight so that they can get a little bit sturdier so that you can kind of transport them and get them without them going poof on you like that one went on me but I'm just gonna throw that that ass crap into my tub anyways cuz it'll still fizz but yeah thanks so much for making some candy corn bath bombs with me please remember to go down to the description box and click through to find this post on my blog or you'll find all of the instructions written out links to all of the ingredients and lots more information so thanks so much and I'll see you next time", "FKRQtCbr_JA": "i'm going to be trying out the latest tick-tock trend t-bombs [Music] i've recently read about a new tick-tock trend t-bombs i'm not on tick-tock that's why i'm a bit late to the party my kids tell me that i i'm too old for tick-tock but that just sounds like a dare we've had bath bombs chocolate bombs hot chocolate bombs cotton candy bombs now a new trend and it's tea bombs is a hard candy shell with tea inside and it's dropped in hot water so i thought i would give it a go not done this before most of the recipes out there use iso malt i don't know what iso malt is i had a look for a recipe just using sugar found one from a blog called saltysidedish.com i'm going to use their recipe and i'm going to give it a go and see if it works the recipe says that we need sugar like corn syrup i could only find dark corn syrup so hopefully that works water a silicone mold a candy thermometer food coloring glitter and sprinkles and tea i think that's about it so i'm going to get started just to mix all of the ingredients into the pot until it reaches 300 degrees on here apparently it's a hard crack stage never made candy before hopefully this goes okay i don't know in goes all of the ingredients so it's almost ready i think at this stage you have to add the food coloring i'm gonna add pink i've got it all on my hands i think i put too much food coloring in because it looks a bit looks a bit red the next step is to spoon the mixture into the mold um making quite a mess [Music] there's one there's the first one it's quite fiddly i'm getting like strings of sugar everywhere as well [Music] just leave that until they cool down and then i can have a go at putting them together they're ready they're all nice and hard so they're ready to come out just peel it out like this it worked now it's a little bit messy around the edges actually for my first attempt that's not too bad i'm quite impressed with that i guess it could pass put it together that could kind of pass for a some kind of t-bomb the next step is to put tea inside then heat up the edge and then stick them together i thought well i'll put a tea ball inside one these gold heart edible sprinkles so i'll put some of those in black tea and rose petals in another blueberry pie herbal tea which is really tasty so i'm going to put that in the other one to stick the two sides of the the tea bomb together i have to heat up one side and stick it to the other probably should have brought some sugar gloves hopefully i don't burn myself warm up one side and then stick it to the other side last one i think i might burn that side a little bit let's see if that works there's a few holes in it there's the first one look that one's that one's actually a little bit wonky stuck that on a little bit wonky t-bomb number three is also wonky has holes in it and it's a little bit burnt so that's number three here my first tea bombs you could always get a little bit extra fancy and stick a flower on top [Music] so now i've made my tea bombs i'm gonna see what they look like when i put them in hot water [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "FwJWMfNlvTk": "[Music] if you lucky you", "ajZKj_JqYV8": "[Music] hi everyone welcome to cake it timmy today we're making a special treat for valentine's day geometric strawberries and cream hot cocoa bombs filled with strawberry hot cocoa mini marshmallows freeze-dried strawberries finished off with a pink and gold marble effect and surround it with a sprinkle border so let's get started here are the ingredients we'll need to make the hot cocoa bombs first up our white chocolate chip baking chips as well as a few candy melts to brighten up the color and in a separate bowl i have some bright pink candy wafers to give a nice pink marbling effect we will also need a nice flexible mini geometric heart mold with a self-leveling back i have that linked in the description below we're going to start by melting each of the chocolates in 30 second intervals in the microwave until they're silky and smooth and completely melted note that the white chocolate won't be as smooth and runny as the pink candy wafers but it'll still be workable once you have both of the chocolates melted take a small amount of the pink and add it to the center of the white chocolate and with a fork gently mix so that they're pink ribbons within the white chocolate but that everything doesn't turn a total pink color once you have that together we're ready to make the hard shells add a small dollop of the chocolate to the center of your heart mold i recommend doing two or so at a time and working very quickly spreading the chocolate to the edges of the mold i usually do this with a paint brush but i found that using a spoon work just as well don't use the fork however if you find that you've used too much chocolate be sure to scoop it out with the back of a spoon you can also give the entire mold a tap so that the chocolate evens itself out in the center note that this chocolate cools down really fast so you're going to have to work quickly to get the rest of the cavities covered it's okay if at this point you don't have the edges perfectly covered you'll see we'll fix that after the hearts come out of this mold you might find that there might be some thin spots of chocolate in the center of the heart so you can go ahead and take a little bit of extra melted chocolate and cover it right up if you need to before we put them into the freezer just take an offset spatula or the back of a knife and just scrape off the tops of those hearts so that they sit evenly when we take them out once that's done we can just put them into the freezer for about 10 to 15 minutes until they completely harden this is what they'll look like coming out of the freezer they're going to be completely set and it's going to be very easy to take them out of the mold if you're having trouble taking these things out of the mold it's likely that the chocolate is not completely frozen and you can see just how beautiful of a marble effect we're getting here i wanted to achieve a pink marble look and this technique works so well so once these are ready just take them out and place them on a tray near you so that we can move on to the next step before we get started for the next step we are going to need to microwave a ceramic plate so that it becomes really hot once you have that plate ready to go you want to take four out of the eight shells and press them against the really hot plate so that the edges of those hearts even out you can see that there are some imperfections when i turn them to the side but after i melt them down the edges become nice and straight also another thing to note is that all of the four hearts may not have come out looking the way that you would like so you can essentially pick out the pieces you'd like to represent the bottom of the mold at this point and make them even first then we can move on to filling them because these are strawberry and cream hot cocoa bombs i'm adding strawberry hot cocoa powder to fill them i'm adding less than a tablespoon of powder to each mold if you add any more it's going to be hard to fill the rest of the fillings in here so just be mindful of how much you're adding for my other toppings i'm adding some mini marshmallows then i'm also adding some freeze-dried strawberries that have been cut into little pieces now it's time to put them together so again we're gonna take our hot plate that's been microwave for a few minutes then we're gonna take the top shells of the hearts place them on the plate for a few seconds until they melt down and then attach them to the bottom hard shell some key tips here are just to make sure that your plate is very very hot and you might have to microwave it several times just to make sure that the chocolate melts down properly every time the other thing is is that if you're seeing some holes in between the edges or they're not perfectly lining up that's no problem you'll see we will fix that issue in the next step and like i said it's okay if the edges aren't perfectly touching we just need some areas to touch and hold just so that it holds its shape for the time being once you have those made it's time to melt down a few additional candy wafers i use bright pink but really honestly you can use any color then once it's melted just go ahead and add it to a piping bag that's made for candy coatings using a piping bag will allow us to have more control over where the melted chocolate is going on our hot cocoa bombs once it's in the bag i just checked the temperature of the candy coating i'm making sure that it's not too hot so that it doesn't melt our way through the heart shape so i usually just put it down on my tray or on my table until it is just ever so slightly warm in the meantime it's time to pour out any sprinkles that you'd like to attach the side of these hot cocoa bombs and once the chocolate is ready you just want to cut the piping bag pick up a hot cocoa bomb and start piping the melted candy chocolate all around the seams of the heart i recommend doing half the heart at a time so that the entire chocolate doesn't cool down before you have a chance to seal them with sprinkles so you can see here i piped the candy coating all along the heart and now i'm just dipping them in the sprinkles so that they attach to the melted chocolate i'm gonna repeat this step with each of my four hot cocoa bombs and then give them enough time to cool down so that everything hardens properly you can put them in the freezer for another 10 minutes or leave them out to dry overnight [Music] to finish them off i'm just adding a little bit of gold leaf to the tops of these hot cocoa bombs i'm using the gold transfer sheets not the loose gold leaf and all you have to do for this is take a sheet of edible gold leaf and press it onto the chocolate what i find works best is that if you take a little bit and either warm it up underneath your finger or scratch it with your nail so that it adheres to the chocolate better the other thing you can do is cut a little strip of the gold leaf so that it's just a little bit easier to handle i just find that it's much easier for me to place the gold leaf onto the hearts when i have a smaller piece of the gold leaf and this is how beautiful the gold leaf transfers on i'm just adding a few flakes on basically each corner of the hot cocoa bomb this just makes it look like a gold pink marble effect and i just love the look of this and this is the final look of the strawberries and cream valentine's day hawk cocoa bombs i just absolutely adore the pink and gold marble effect and the sprinkle border on the side not only makes them so so adorable but also makes them easy to create when it comes time to enjoy them you know what to do i like putting the steaming hot milk in my mug first and then dropping in my hot cocoa bomb just like i would with a bath bomb and it's just so satisfying to see that thing dissolve in there and release the marshmallows for me that wasn't enough marshmallows so i added some more a little bit later on i can't wait for you to try these hot cocoa bombs for valentine's day this year and if you do please be sure to give

guys and welcome back to the station bakery in today's video i'm going to show you how to make delicious and refreshing juice bombs using kool-aid just a disclaimer if you actually follow the actual instructions on the back of the kool-aid pack this video might not be for you let's get to it to make our shells we'll be using 1 cup of sugar 1 3 cup of corn syrup and 2 tablespoons of water pour all of the ingredients into a heat proof pot and then mix together on medium heat until all of the sugar has dissolved once dissolved increase the heat and cook the mixture until the temperature reaches 300 degrees remove from the heat and then add in any colorings or flavorings always take precautions when working with hot sugar by wearing protective gloves and other protective garments any food coloring will work to add a bit of glitz i am adding in some edible glitter please make sure that whatever glitter that you are choosing to use is fda approved and edible working with sugar can be a bit tricky because it does set pretty quickly so you will need to work quickly and carefully add more mixture to fill in any holes if necessary there's no need to freeze or refrigerate because the mixture will set pretty quickly on its own once set pop out the shells by gently pulling them away from the mold while pressing upwards this is the best way that i find to remove the shelves without causing any cracking now we have a beautiful candy shell ready for our juice bombs heat up a hot pan and then use it to melt down the first half of the shell heat the shell until you have completely perfect and even edges i will be using cherry flavored kool-aid for these juice bombs the kool-aid recipe says to use two tablespoons of their kool-aid mix for every one and a half cups of water however like i said in the beginning for mine i'll be doing it differently so instead of two tablespoons i am using four tablespoons per bomb this is going to cause a richer flavor and the sugar from the sugar shells is going to add just the perfect sweetness always feel free to adjust to your preference this is just how we prefer ours adhere the top shell to the bottom shell ensuring that it is completely sealed all the way around you don't want any of your filling to leak out they are absolutely gorgeous i am making a large batch for myself so i am adding three cups of water versus the regular one and a half cups for best results use hot water and now for the fun drop your bomb into the water as you can see the change is almost instant now for the second one your shelves will need a little bit of time to dissolve within the water just use your spoon to stir it around this will also help prevent it from sticking to the bottom of your glass we absolutely love finding different ways to spend time with our family and do fun things and this is just another thing to add to our list of enjoyment once the shelves have completely dissolved top it off with a few pieces of ice stir and

right welcome to this edition of the torture chamber we have a special guest with us today miss Megan Larson my girlfriend and victim we we were talking about we always do hot things here but we decided to do something a little different on Jonas's suggestion is we ordered a very sour something and what do they call Jonah's Barnett's Barnett's [Music] mega-mega sour fruits I believe is the actual name it came packaged like this I ripped it open because I wasn't sure this is what this was and then from there it comes like this which is kind of interesting it has a warning label excessive consumption of these candies sweets can cause temporary irritation to the mouth or stomach these sweets candies are not recommended for children under 8 years of age so be careful - okay I think so we're all up age it does have it's just eat sparingly so I guess we're happy to be kind of gentle I don't know what these actually come from the the postage on it says you get it from the UK it's either yeah I think it came from England and it says part airmail I'll be all so it's somewhere European could be Royal Mail is that that Prince t5 Station Road in said - said - Berg we'll find out where that is later so this is what we've got these these really sour things that are supposed to make all the sour candies that we've ever eaten in our tire life coward yeah it's supposed to be like the most sour thing besides taking a spoonful of moloch acid oh well we're not sure it so I I will say that I've got a bit of a tolerance to anything pod I've built up a heap tolerance from liking different sauces and things I am a crybaby when it comes to sour I think warheads are real sour I don't I did not when we were trick-or-treating I just like tossed one into my mouth and your started walking with it now those now these are supposed to make warheads look like licorice so rich is the best candy ever all right I don't know if there's any warning with this so usually when we handle hot stuff we try not to touch our eyes once we've been hailing the food so let's I don't know if we should not have sour all right okay and then this and then ziplock baggie they look like giant so well you know the this spiced candies this yes that's what it kind of looks like and yeah they're kind of like round balls spice candy to get a little I want to say it's sugar on the outside but I know it isn't that small like I don't get a whole lot of smell out of it though all right so we've got different colors does anyone have any specific color that they would like to try we seem to have yellow orange green and red yeah I'm a red guy myself so I'm gonna go the same route I feel like I should try a different one but what does it matter we don't have any point of reference so we'll go ah we're gonna go a yellow and two red big they are kind of big they're hard oh oh they do have some yeah they're not like squishy at least not with the fingers we'll see how that works out in their mouths do we know if they're sour the whole way through or did they get sweet at simple I have no idea my assumption was the exterior was the sour part yeah but I honestly don't know am I supposed to eat the cat hair with it yes okay so now when we usually when we usually do the heat challenge is what we'll do is we'll have rules about putting your mouth and you have to have it your mouth chew it swallow it and then you can wait so long to have a drink but I don't know how much I want it I don't know that anything puts out the sour like it does the heat so I guess we just kind of countdown we what we clunk it and dunk it yeah and then we go for it we do have water I don't know if it helps with anything but last time I saw I think it had water and only got worse so I'm not doing it but all right well clunk there very sour holy crap oh wow nothing here Katie that is horrible oh my god I just been into it did that help no but it did let me realize that it's a hard candy not a soft squishy candy there's nothing even sour it's just acid and vomit it's getting better it's Molly Dyson I can taste this good flavor I should have timed it because I'm already getting past the sour yeah yeah I get it sour in the middle like it doesn't that look white in there it does look juice has a streak to it but I don't know something's gonna change um this is much better now I'm over that was horribly sour for the first 15 20 seconds worse than any sour I've ever actually eaten is that the Sowers thing you've ever had would you but it's a lot it's not by a lot crazy it was very sour would you say it's not so bad that you would have another one [Music] now mine sweet yes sorry I'm gonna split them up my stomach hurts so and I got to the white part in the middle yes that sound it didn't seem to get sour again like it is it foamy and sour it's a little sighs it foamy yeah but it's the same thing inside sauce oh well what does it explain to people what Zots our thoughts are a hard candy that starts out sweet but it has a any like powder that turns into a foam in your mouth a power on the inside but the thing that was happening on the outside no that was our hurt yeah and then this Center thinks out like oh you can I'm gonna do a cleanse my palate here just up okay I feel like do yellow yellow really mad feel like paint stripper was taken to the inside of my mouth it's sort of like all dry and I'm not cuts in my mouth like I did when I had five times its it said on the package eat sparingly so too is fairly sparingly wouldn't you say you're going for green I have not tried orange Megan are you done yeah would you like to try one which which color would you like to like I will look at green dream on we didn't get a lot of green Zita this is the last green so there's two greens am I gonna be like ruining some these days no I can't I think that this is a three year supply of these things don't recommend that not excuse joke alright I feel like I'm over but now it's gonna start again that's the not something we usually do but clunk it thank it and don't get this way sour is this more sour yeah oh good award it's only not healthy all I have it's making me sweat I only sweat with hot stuff oh there's something to be said like obviously you guys are like dying right now because we actually have a litter no I know that's what I'm saying but like just to put my tongue on it like that physically hurts I think it's not even sad worried it hurts actually my mouth I'm getting over the hurdle Oh first 1015 seconds of that painful it feels like fire it doesn't get better the oranges tasty it's it's made by Barnett's no way low well we will we will put that right jeonse you gotta help with the post yeah no but who makes this evil people who have decided that food should not be enjoyable and they put this on the market for us to track Oh water does just that does nothing green sucks yeah orange I first I felt the second the second one dad do it no I don't want that have it coming I think we're past it um it definitely was it felt a lot more sour to me on the second one and seeing how we all tried different flavors you felt the same thing right so I think there's a cumulative thing that like hot sauce the more that you have the more sour it seems to it's a feel tell me about just putting your tongue on it doesn't feel like like sandy just at the enjoyable part no just hold it there no ahh like it hurts that's really bad right greens a horrible right just hurt Oh orange was worse I think though oh well almost fun why do you guys do this this isn't fun alright so that that's Barnett's mega sour fruits I would say that that's the sourest thing that I've ever had what would you say drink your water it's sweet like it's actually sweet with me it's gross no it's sweet oh it does change the taste of the water it makes the water feel like it's got like a sweet aftertaste what we've learned is if you think water is delicious now have a Barnett's it makes water very delicious good I'm having oh yeah this rock my whole my whole palate I can't this case this tastes like like we added like a one of those what do you call one of those juice things that okay so now we've we've successfully completed the Barnett's challenge time frame wise it it was over faster than the heat challenges which is nice intensity wise it was right up there that was that was pretty intense the first hit it literally tastes like you licked malic acid it's it's it's very it's very sour so we know the waters great after really good and water tastes excellent I would say that we have completed the Barnett's mega sour fruit challenge we have had the cheers pretty much it's like like you know how about Carolina Reaper the only thing hotter is pure capsaicin yep don't seem sour more sour no it's all weird more sour than this is the only thing more sour than this is our next-door neighbors and someone walks on our lawn it's pretty sour alright thank you for joining us for the torture chamber and we will see you soon that's water is so good right now I could live", "X8tnZfq_mRI": "[Music] so [Music] [Music] do you", "YpG17uzFRe8": "[Music] Hey Girl hey and welcome back to 25 days of Christmas here with girlfriend unwrapped today we are making this candy cane bath bombs that were super super easy want to know how I made them stay tuned to find out ok so right now I'm starting off with an empty glass bowl and this will just help me to mix all of my ingredients so the first thing I'm adding is one cup of citric acid and typically citric acid is used to like preserve vegetables I'm also using some baking soda the baking soda will create the fizziness of the bath bomb that we will need I'm also adding in I believe half a cup of Epsom salt and that'll just help to relax you I think this one is eucalyptus scent in so that's really good and now I'm adding some coconut oil for moisture notes of coconut oil and I'm just gonna mix all of those ingredients together until they are well combined you want to make sure that you're not leaving any dry ingredients everything is well well mixed ok so as you can see I just want to make sure that I have all of my ingredients well mix before I do anything because the next step is a very important step so now I'm about to split the pound the bowl in half I want to split this mixture up because you will see how I get my candy cane look to my bath bomb so I'm just putting half of the ingredients into another glass bowl okay so now I have my two mixtures and I haven't slit in half and the first thing I'm going to add is peppermint oil to the left bowl and that will be just the scent that I'm looking for to really just you know create that candy cane smell that you used to that mints and smell and now to help relax you I will be adding this lavender essential oil to my second Bowl and this is completely optional you don't have to put anything in it however this is what I'm going for it will help to relax me whenever I use it for my bags and you just want to mix all those oils in I think I put about 20 to 25 drops because I like a really really strong scent however you can do five to ten drops or more than twenty five to eight years and I'm just mixing up those essential oils into both of my bowls and making sure that it is well combined before I begin okay not to get that candy cane look we are adding in some gel food coloring and I love this stuff because it's not as messy as the original food coloring I used to using so you know I used about looks like about two squirts of it just to get that candy cane color and I'm just using my spatula to mix it in it will take a while to mix in don't fret if it doesn't look like how you wanted to look give it some time and put a little TLC into it you'll begin to get that candy cane color so I'm just adding in a little bit more because it wasn't enough I think I want it like a deep deep red color so you'll see me just completely probably using more than I thought I would use but that's okay that's that's what I'm going for it's always easier to add but you can never take this out so now I just decided to put the spatula to the side and put some gloves on and just really get down into it with my hands and just really really mix that a gel food coloring in you know and and the more I mix the deeper the color will become and you'll just see that I'm just like really really working that food coloring into all of my mixture really really well and you can see the texture that it's giving me its crumble but it's very soft and very moisture moisturized like I think it comes from the coconut oil so you'll just see I'm just mixing it in and mixing it in because I really want that deep deep red color you could do a lighter pink but I'm going for a deep red color really just working that into there don't be afraid and I'm just using the gloves to keep my hands from staining while we're in this stage I think that's really important but this will also give a beautiful tint to my bath when I do drop it into my water and as you can see I got that beautiful deep red color that I'm looking for and I'm just loving the texture of this and might I add that it smells so so good I'm just loving I love lavender and you putting lavender and peppermint together I'm loving it right now so as you can see I have my two mixtures my red mixture and my white mixture and that's exactly what we'll need to begin to create our bath bombs I'm just loving that this is coming out exactly what I know how I had imagined it and so now I have my bath bomb mold and I picked this up from my local craft store you can see that in Shutts clothes and you can easily take it apart which I love that about it and I got this in clear because I wanted to be able to see my candy cane as I begin to build my bath bomb so I'm adding a little bit of the white mixture used to get that base going and then I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to just make sure it's packed in how I want it and now I'm adding in my red mixture right on top you can do whatever design you want I'm going for the red and white look because this is a candy came back mom okay and so I'm going back to my white mixture packing that in don't be afraid to press it you want to pack it as tight as possible so that your bath bomb does not fall apart once you remove it from the mold okay and so now I'm gonna do the same exact thing with the second half of my mold but at this time I'm starting with the red so I'll pack in the red packet packet packet don't be afraid then I'll pack in the white just pressing as you can see and I'm back at my red mixture and we need to put just enough in so they won't be able to mash the two moles together so you may need to put a little bit more than you did in the that'll help to bind that entire mixture together and create that bath bomb look at that that is exactly what I was looking for when I tell you I was so freakin excited to see this come together so I'm just pressing firmly and I want to hear like a snapping sound that's how I know that my mold is closed and that is exactly what I was looking for I love it I'm so excited so after I packed all my bath bombs I had a little bit of leftover mixture so I just decided to take out this ice cube tray and pack in the remaining mixture because it wasn't enough to put into my actual mold but I can make little cubes out of this and I love that idea because nothing will go to waste and you never want to waste a new product you pay good money for this stuff use it use every drop of it okay bath bombs come in all sizes and shapes so don't be afraid and this is just an old ice cube tray that I had I don't even know why I have this ice cube tray but look you never knew you never know why you need it so I never knew that I'll be using it for this but hey here we are right so I'm just packing that in packing that in and making sure no air is in there pushing really really hard you want to just completely completely press down and you'll see I got four cubes fully packed that's enough I think that's the most I was able to fit and when I flip it over I'll have four beautiful bath bomb cubes which I'm so excited about nothing goes to waste nothing girls [Music] and this is my finished product these are my bath bombs I left them out to dry for 24 hours because you want them to dry up and just those remaining cubes I just put into some cellophane bags wrap them with some tinsel and put a candy cane in it it just really looks beautiful thanks for tuning in if you've enjoyed this video you should have liked comment share and subscribe and as always thanks for watching", "Y6kjPWDrpY4": "[Music] [Music] you", "K5zUnQhxKUc": "[Music] what up sweet gang it's your girl rochelle in the building coming to bring you another great video and if you already know or if you don't know we got these hot trending treats that's going around the net and they're going crazy and it's the hot cocoa bombs everybody loving cocoa and it's that time of the season but in this video i'm going to show you how to use the three part chocolate mold that will give you a good consistency of chocolate as well as nice smooth edging if you're new to my channel don't forget to like comment and subscribe and we're gonna get right into the video here is a three-part chocolate mold it comes with a top and some inserts and a bottom this is your top and as you see here i wrote top on the bottom on the top of my mold then it comes with these three silicone inserts that is placed over the chocolate and then this is the bottom which i wrote bottom at the top of this one and then there's a line that indicates where the chocolate should come to or feel to and we're going to place all three together and also while i'm showing you that i'm going to show you how i made my candy cane chocolate bombs so let's get into it here i'm using a compound chocolate which is merkins some candy cane cream uh gourmet mix this is cocoa mix along with some marshmallows and peppermint and you want to start off with melting your chocolate for 30 second intervals and get it as smooth as you can and i place my chocolate in a piping bag so this is a 16 inch piping bag long enough where i can put enough chocolate in here to fill my mold okay so you want to take the top off and remove the silicone inserts then you're going to take your chocolate and just fill up to the line where it's indicated and you can tap it a little bit but you just keep filling don't overfill that line or you'll get too much chocolate once you put the covering top over your mold so just give it a little tap and then you're going to take the silicone inserts and place them right over the chocolate and you can press down a little bit if you want to but the top um of the mode is actually going to do that so i just press just a little bit and then go ahead and put the top covering over it and you want to press until that chocolate rises to the top and do like a seal around the top and you will see that once you press down and it just rises up and seal right around the top you'll see a nice little ring form right at the top of that mold cavity all right so just i'm just firmly pressing down into the little cavity just checking for my ring here and it's just like it does a seal all right once you have got that done you can flip it over nothing's going to happen and i kind of press and do a turn on the outside of the mold just to make sure the chocolate is all even and then i place in the freezer for five to ten minutes and five to ten minutes with a compound chocolate you guys milk chocolate i will let stay in for probably five minutes more so after it has set in the freezer remove it and i'll do that little turn remove the top and then you're going to take the lip of the silicone insert and what i like to do is take a cupcake liner so i won't get a lot of hand prints on the chocolate and just begin to gently remove that silicone insert and i hold the like the rim of the spear and as you see you got a nice perfect sphere and you don't have to use a hot plate or anything to clean up your edges they're already perfect all right so to wash these um as you see here is the silicone insert i would not put these in the dishwasher i would just hand wash them and dry them after you're done using them so make sure you don't put this in the dishwasher you guys all right so as you see here nice and even spear uh half sphere great for your cocoa bomb so this also cuts out on a lot of different um parts that you would do with the red silicone mold so this is actually much better and i will leave the link in the description box below but it's um a back order on these because everybody's going crazy over the hot cocoa bombs this season but it is great to use this mold i love it and i'm sure you guys will too now let's get into my recipe for my candy cane hot cocoa bombs so after they're done i have them sitting in a cupcake tray and you want to put in two tablespoons of the mix here and that's all i'm using um you see a little peppermint chunk peppermint chunks or candy cane chunks um and that came with the mix so i'm using two tablespoons of that and then i'm going to add in my marshmallows and top it off and you guys gonna enjoy this because this is really good it's really good so as you see me applying the marshmallows and then we're just gonna go into the next step [Music] so now you want to get a small saucer plate and heat it up as hot as you can hot enough for your chocolate to melt and you want to take half of your spear rub it up against the plate so that it can melt just a little bit and then put it over your other half so that it can sit on top evenly and while doing that the chocolate will solidify so you don't need to rub the sides or anything like that to get all that extra hand print so leaving it in the cupcake tray and your cupcake liner will help prevent all those extra fingerprints and you don't have to rub any extra chocolate around the sides so this gives you a nice perfect clean presentable hot chocolate balm all right and as you see here this is the cocoa bomb and you see the sides the part here is so perfect now that little spot right there you see was probably some chocolate that didn't um cover well but it's okay you have a nice even cocoa pom and we're gonna get right into the rest of the video and my design [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and just like that

welcome to knowledge city this is your host Lakshmi and today we are going to make turmeric ladoos when I was studying in New York in college was very cold over there and my mother is to send me the small very small turmeric a larger slit bite-size pieces and she's to make sure I can during winter season because the anti-inflammatory they're very good for any body aches and they keep you away from cough and cold and of course they make your skin more cleaner because it helps your turmeric help see purify the blood and she's to make it with turmeric and black pepper and main ingredients and couple of weeks back I read an article that black pepper and turmeric is a good combination a black pepper helps to absorb turmeric in your body I was like oh my mother she knew everything whatever she is doing so today I'm going to show you her recipe and also some changes I've made for the recipe for vegans today I'm going to make now turmeric bumps so I'm going to make three different types of turmeric bombs I have taken 1/4 cup of turmeric powder into 3 different bowls add some black pepper and dry ginger powder so let's get started I'm going to add 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper into each of the turmeric I have taken if you're a starter you can take 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper if you Nadia to spicy food and wintered 1/2 teaspoon of dry ginger powder dry ginger powder is optional but Regina power is very good for digestion so I'm going to add 1/2 TSP of dry ginger powder and mix all the dry ingredients together now first and when you try my mother's recipe add 2 spoons of jiggly jiggly with dry ginger powder is very good for acidity that's why I am trying to use jaggery is very good for me problem you have but you can use the sugar it's your child so mix all the dry ingredients very nicely if you don't want to add any fat or any liquids into this you can just do this is the powder and eat it with the spoon now I am going to add in G easily which also has medicinal value so add about 1 tablespoon of G mix it nicely and the rest of the 1 tablespoon you're going to add as needed the % 1 tablespoon mix it and then add little by little you may need another household please both or another 1 tablespoon so make the dough very thin rolls into a ball if you want to make a ball and chip it so now this story is perfect for all its mean loading it into ball so now I'm going to take a measurement of 1/2 teaspoon if you are a Saturn start with 1/4 teaspoon so I'm going to measure it are in the half teaspoon and roll to the ball so this is ready our let's move to the second recipe same three ingredients turmeric black pepper soy ginger and Devon to add honey to this the bills are unlike any kind of fat any kind of heat butter coconut oil just can't honey and it isn't good for a beginner starters because with honey does the taste of spiciness will be lowered down so easy for you to get used to be spicy turmeric and black pepper taste so I'd honey 1 tbsp and then rest of it add as needed put it into 1/2 TSP or 1/4 TSP management roll it into balls and you're ready to go I prefer to eat this in the morning followed by a lukewarm water so this is ready let's move on to the third one same three ingredients turmeric black pepper and dry ginger powder and this is especially for my vegan friends we are going to use chocolate pie same thing add 1 tbsp first mix it very nicely and address of the 1 tbsp as Lingus you may need less you may need more so make it like dough consistency if you don't want too much of oil then just mix it and then you can eat it with a spoon if you want rolls into balls put in 1/2 TSP or 1/4 TSP management and those in the ball store it in an airtight container it will stay fresh for one to two months but I would like to make it every two weeks this is a very easy to roll so if you want to perfect a round shape then I'll show your way you can roll it with two hands so you'll get a perfect round shape so I prefer to eat it in the morning followed by lukewarm water to try this out it's become perfect and tasty thick for today is eternal it is very good for half as used a little bit of turmeric in your food like soups vegetables curries rice use a pinch because too much use of turmeric in food again with the food because you like 1/4 teaspoon for any colors or soups if you are making soup for two people or four people are 1/4 teaspoon a lesson that is enough and I hope you like this video please subscribe my youtube channel for more videos", "b6sKV0l_1n0": "hey there alison with everydayshortcuts.com welcome back to my channel so today i'm going to be making another hot cocoa bomb but a different one i love disney everything about disney i have been missing disney since this pandemic and not being able to go so i'm going to be making a mickey mouse hot cocoa balm they're so cute super fun easy to make let's get started in making the mickey mouse hot cocoa bombs so what you need is a medium silicone mold this is the smaller size mold and flexible easy to pop out the chocolates um for the shell we're going to be doing half of the black chocolate and half of a red chocolate we'll also be using these yellow candy melts that we are going to add the little buttons onto mickey mouse also need some hot cocoa mix any kind we'll do and some mini marshmallows a disposable pipey or disposable ziploc bag that we will use for piping the buttons on to mickey mouse and then also to add the ears on the top next you want to melt your black and red chocolate in the microwave in 30 second increments stirring in between until creamy and smooth once you have your chocolate melted you're going to do red into one part of the mold and then black in the other part of the mold depending on how many you want to make and the red is going to be the bottom part of mickey and the black is going to be the top part of mickey so when you put it inside the mold you want to make sure that you use the back of the spoon and push it up towards the top and leaving it hollow in the middle you want to make sure it's thick enough on the walls so that way it does not break and that there is no holes inside the hollow part then you want to put it in the fridge or freezer for about five to ten minutes or until harden and then pop it out when done so to smooth out the edges around the cocoa bombs you can see it's a little bit jagged on there you can just heat a plate up in the microwave for about 45 seconds and then just twist it back and forth until you get it until smooth just for a few seconds and then it'll be nice and smooth now you want to fill the bottom part of mickey which will be the red part with some hot cocoa mix and some mini marshmallows you can just add probably about a teaspoon of the hot cocoa mix and then just a few marshmallows on top would be fine now to connect the two pieces together you want to heat up a plate for 45 seconds and just kind of twist the chocolate back and forth and melt it a little bit and then connect and hold for a few seconds until it hardens so to make mickey's ears you're going to need the black chocolate wafers and they tend to have a little bit of white film on it so i usually just wipe it off with paper towel then i use a knife and you just want to cut the end like the end off a little bit and then it will look like this and then we're going to secure the ears on top with some melted chocolate and i'll show you how to do that okay to secure the ears i just took the leftover chocolate that i had for making the molds and heat it up a little bit and then what i'm going to do is i'm just going to take the ear and dip it into the chocolate and then i'm going to secure it at the top so you want to make sure that they are enough with the part so it looks like it is mickey's ears okay so i have the ears on here and i added the melted chocolate to secure them and i'm going to allow that to harden and once that's done we are going to go ahead and make the buttons we are at the last step of making our mickey mouse cocoa bombs and what we're gonna do is to make the buttons is heat up some yellow candy melts in the microwave in 30 second increments and stir in between until smooth and creamy and then to pipe it on there i'm going to use a ziploc sandwich bag and put the melted chocolate inside push it all the way to the bottom and then i'm going to cut off the end and then pipe it on so all i did was put some melted candy melts the color yellow inside the sandwich bag and just piped it on for his buttons now that everything is done and the mickey mouse cocoa bomb is complete i'm going to allow the chocolate to harden and to enjoy just drop it in a cup and pour six to eight ounces of piping hot milk over top and watch it explode [Music] so [Music] you", "yh_EQOFgECM": "hey guys welcome and welcome back to my channel today's video i'll be making hot chocolate bombs or hot cocoa

too and she adhered to it adhesive to it Acme zip to it he said yes and he said you're really bigger nut sacking this yeah I would go bigger nut sack - so this is apparently the finest of the white

have anything with Nutella on your menu is it is it a good cookie does it smell actually okay give us all your your Nutella cookies please oh yeah all them no problem ah no I'm gonna drive up and say hi there you go like if this is the only thing you could stop with you tella then like we got you beat we're doing a custom-built for this we don't even know what this is gonna be but we don't give up

you guys enjoy that drippy drippy the chocolate is Philly and oh baby this little lifting but what is it like most journeys you set out on you think your path will lead you to a particular place

"P7rin1OpCaE": "hi guys welcome to your library at home it's me alda and tonight we are going to make hot chocolate bombs um i'm sure all of you guys have heard about these or seen them seen these all over the place because they're super cool and super fun so um couple things about hot chocolate bombs so first of all if you guys want to make these i'm going to suggest you order your molds right now because they are out of stock absolutely everywhere and i'm gonna be honest with you um amazon totally failed me on this project so i've had to be super creative which is helpful because if you guys want to make these and you want to try messing around with them while you're waiting for your bums to get here in maybe two to three weeks i'll show you how you can do that um so a couple things that you are going to need to do this project is hi lydia thanks for watching um what you're going to need for your project tonight is chocolate so there's two types of melting chalk well there's a couple kinds of melting chocolates um to do this super easy with the silicone mold that you're going to order or you're going to want to use high angie i'm going to suggest you use a some kind of a almond bark hi natalie almond bark comes in a package like this i've used all mine but they are squares it comes in dark chocolate and it comes in white chocolate milk chocolate dark chocolate white chocolate i like to use the squares because for me they melt perfectly in 60 seconds high kelly they melt in 60 seconds in my microwave no fail and one square will make um one bomb like two shells so that's what i like to use but these high denise um are my favorite the ghirardelli dark chocolate melting wafers but they're a little bit more tricky to melt and you have to just they're not hard you just have to know how your microwave melts your chocolate so tonight we're just going to use the almond bark for our sample but i do want to tell you so if you want to try to make these i'm going to tell you guys what molds will not work because i totally thought oh this will work as a mold this is actually an ice cube mold um it's silicone so i thought yeah it'll work but it's way too thick and you will be really frustrated and your chocolate will track or crack when you try to get it out so don't fall for the ice cube mold okay although you guys will probably see this pop up because i'm thinking this is going to make a really great hot coffee drink or iced coffee drink when it's hot out so we're going to use this again for a different program so not a waste if you really are anxious and you can't wait for a silicone mold you can use these are little ornaments they're acrylic ornaments they work really great and they're the perfect size but you have to temper your chocolate tempering your chocolate means melting it for a certain temperature which is no more than 98 to 100 degrees and then adding chocolate to cool it down and then your molds will pop perfectly out of here it's a lot of work tempering chocolate's probably another program so tonight we are going to use um the silicone mold that you can find right now is in the shape of a snowflake so we have snowflake shake shaped high courtney hot chocolate bombs um but as far as tempering chocolate goes i did have like you guys see i've tried several molds i have this mold which i'll turn the camera down in a second with tempered chocolate and as you can see they slide right out and here's my perfect half half circle these are a little bit smaller than the chocolate balms that are super popular right now but i personally think this is a better size for maybe kids because you really don't want them to drink all that hot chocolate the big mom bombs make a big cup okay so i'm going to turn the camera down and i'm going to show you guys a couple different ways to do this um we are going to start with get my camera right here um so i have already melted my chocolate for for 60 seconds and when you melt your chocolate microwave if you guys have never done this you're gonna pull it out and you're going to think it's not melted all the way that's exactly how you want it and you want to just keep stirring it all the way until your chocolate is completely melted and i'm going to show you guys how to do this in the snowflake mold but i'll also show you in the circle mold because it's easier to to work with the melted chocolate in the circle but this isn't tempered so they won't come out of that plastic mold but i'll show you to give you an idea okay so i'm just stirring it and my chocolate is pretty much melted i did this right before we started so um i'm gonna stick another one in the microwave while i while i make that mold all right and also too i'm going to show you guys really quickly before we do that if you haven't seen um a hot chocolate balm okay here is what the three inch one will make so this is what a silicone mold that you want to use this is the size in your shape it's filled with hot chocolate inside there so this is a three inch one that is what you can make in this with tempered chocolate or silicone mold if you're patient this is what i made in the smaller molds they're a little bit smaller than that and then here is what we're going to make in our hot chocolate mold here's a white one that i made so this is a snowflake one i mean okay and then this one i'm going to show you guys at the end how to how to decorate them okay so that's a hot chocolate bun and in a little bit we'll dump one in some milk so you can see it hi lynn thanks for watching okay so i've got my snowflake mold these are a little bit trickier so this is going to get messy so you want to fill it i'm just going to eyeball it but let's say you're going to put about two tablespoons in there i'm gonna go ahead and do two and in this shape i've noticed it's better to do um two layers of it so i'm going to this is a really messy project by the way too at least for me um so i'm going to and lynn if you're still watching you recognize my little spatula this is my favorite little kale board and giveaway spatula okay so i'm going to go ahead and just use my spatula and kind of get it around the trick is you want to get it up as far as you can along the edges okay and i'm going to put this i'm going to make this one not super thick and then you just want to kind of wiggle your mold i don't know if you guys can see this but you just wiggle it until it gets good and flat in there and you'll know you can see actually this one's gonna take a little bit more okay so you just keep wiggling your mold until all of your chocolate is spread all the way around it and once you get it nice and even you can even tip it upside down tap it so i said it gets messy but that's okay don't worry about it hi beth thanks for watching okay so get it as good as you can in your mold and then you wanna pop this in the freezer so i'm gonna go ahead and pop this in the freezer but i can see a whole section on this one it doesn't have any chocolate so i'm just gonna it doesn't matter you guys too if the inside doesn't look super pretty because you are gonna stuff this with marshmallows and hot chocolate and no one's gonna see it anyways so spread it around i do like to tap it just so it's as even as it can be and then we'll pop it in the freezer okay so i'm going to stick that in the freezer for now [Music] i've got my other chocolate ready to go so as you can see it's oh this one melted it's got still got a chunk so we just stir this up until it's nice and melted it probably should two squares and my microwave two squares 75 seconds works perfectly okay so stir it up all my chocolate is melted and i'm going to show you how much easier it is to do it you're right messy but you get the drizzling is when it's really fun okay so i'm going to take these out so as you can see the tempered chocolate they slide right out they're nice and shiny they're perfectly shaped so i'm going to dump all the extra chocolate off and i'm going to show you how much easier it is to do the circle one so if you guys do get the circle modes this is a way easier process i grab my spatula go ahead and see i noticed that one square in this mold makes two okay so now this one you just keep going all the way around the circle is way easier than the snowflake but the snowflake i think is good to try because it really helps you work with the um you have to be patient and it helps you work with the chocolate okay so see how much easier it is with the um circle mold it went all the way around and i just kind of like to keep going in circles until you'll see that chocolate is starting to harden slowly and if you're patient and you keep going around you'll have a nice even coat so if this was a silicone mold we can pop this out in 10 minutes and it would be beautiful okay so now i'm going to pop that in the freezer this circle mold i found on amazon but like i said this one's a little bit smaller they they kind of i'm not gonna lie come out a little bit like um saucers instead of circles i think it's a good size though like i said i think that's a great size for kids and it's a great size to gift because you can put two or three in one package and it looks really cute and honestly it's good to have a good amount of chocolate in the bottom because this is what's going to make your drink taste good so here's the circles see how much easier that was i'm going to pop this in the freezer and then i'm going to show you guys um these i've already done so these have two coats of chocolate already on them oh christina lucky well maybe we'll have to have a um hot chocolate balm making party if your molds come before mine do okay so here's my my snowflake mold that i showed you first so the trick is so this has been um coated in the freezer for a few minutes coat it again in the freezer for a few minutes and then you want to let it sit out to room temperature um before you try to take it out of the mold and then you just literally want to pop and guys you're going to have a few that crack they're not going to work perfect at first but the beauty of this is you just re-melt your chocolate and try again so no waste there so i'm just going to loosen up all all my okay and so we're live here okay so you can see right here oh that sounds good to me i'd like it too um i didn't get enough chocolate right on this side so this one i can tell you right now is not going to come out all the way but what i can do while i have some melted chocolate here is i can just add it to that side patch it up like i said the inside doesn't matter because you won't see it so these are super messy okay so let's go to these guys because they're gonna work i probably should have waited to do that one until i tip this over so i'm loosening up all my edges this is so much more fun with the circle too because they pop out way easier all right so flip it over and you want to push from the center of your mold and you'll see the mold just peels right off and you will have a shell to fill with hot chocolate and marshmallows and then there it is so here's one so i'm showing you guys a really hard way to do this because honestly if we were working with circles this would be so much easier there's two let's see i think nope that's not the one i just did so if you guys can see i am literally just peeling away the mold from the chocolate this is the really fun and rewarding part i don't want to get the um the wet one all right well you guys get the idea so here's four of them now these don't seal yeah there's a lot of different molds out there you guys and you guys can see how how easy this mold bends that's if you're looking for a mold but trust me there's nowhere in the elgin area to get anything except for a snowflake mold and these are fun i found a really cute owl mold but unfortunately the owl did not cooperate so we're going snowflake guys all right so let me show you the fun part so ouch hang on i'm i'm getting something hot off the stove all right so i have a pot of boiling water on my stove with a hot lid okay and this is what we're going to use to mold these together okay my favorite hot chocolate is actually my homemade hot chocolate recipe from my better homes and garden but we're going to go swiss miss this time and i'm going to put these are a little bit smaller so i'm going to put a little less than a half a pack in there and i am going to put a oh i forgot to do i forgot one step so let me show you the first step so you want to take your mold and you want to set it on something hot that's why i'm using a hot pan now if your molds did not come out perfect just swish it around on this hot pan you'll see it's melted and it's flat so you want to just try to keep it even all right now i'm going to dump my hot chocolate into that side okay now you want to put your marshmallows in there and then you want to do the same thing i just cracked that one see that was too thin can you guys see that so we'll just re-melt that one so i'm going to go ahead and just push this down on the hot pan again which if i wasn't doing this live i would have kept the pan on the stove because i could see that my pans already cooled off a little bit and then you just use that melted chocolate to stick them together and there you have it so if this was a circle it would it would be perfect but i think that one turned out pretty good so can you guys see that so now now it's sealed together hi hika all right so there you have it there's your hot chocolate balm i am going to stick my milk in the microwave really quickly because i want you guys to see how fun these are when they explode and in the meantime i want to show you um a couple of different flavors that i've made so i have okay so this and i put in a really cute little um so um chocolate glue is a good idea and um just so happens that i have a sister who is a fantastic chocolatier and i wish she could have been here to help me with this because she makes the most beautiful chocolate things and i've made a lot of different chocolate things myself in the past um but this one's a little trickier i've never made shells okay so this one's got a pumpkin spice hot chocolate in there and i put it in this cute little fall wrapper and i was thinking in cute little fall gift bags to give away so this is where the really fun these are great hey melissa they would be cute with irish cream okay so there you go how cute is that for a little a little fall thankful little gift bag so these make great gifts so that one's got pumpkin spice in it um i'm gonna put my lid back on the stove too well i was gonna show you guys how to do the round ones but you get the idea so we got another minute before those um the hot chocolates ready or the milk's ready this one i did what i did was i put some candy canes and i hi nancy and i put candy canes in my ninja so this one's got um hot chocolate in there with peppermint sprinkles on top of it and you guys here's the trick so i'm going to show you on this one i'll melt some more chocolate we'll do this one in white this one chocolate glue lydia was talking about so my round ones didn't go together very well so i just took a little bit of my chocolate on my spatula and i went through and i just stuck it together with the glue and then i drizzled the heck out of it so if you can see that you can't even really see where the seam is anymore sprinkles these would be super cute all right so here's the fun part guys so here's my my hugs and hot chocolate mug and it's filled about three quarters of the way so here is the moment of truth we are going to let's see which one should we pop in there we wanted to pop this one in there here we'll go with this one see if it fits yep all right so i'm going to dump that in there and hopefully you guys can see that and just give it a little stir and it should pop open of course it's not going to do it for us now i don't know if my milk is warm enough it should crack open and the marshmallow should all pop out mine didn't bomb very well right here it goes can you guys i don't know if you guys can see that oh can you guys see the marshmallows popping up there you go cracked open and there's all my marshmallows so then you stir it up and you've got and this is really good because when i was making these my um my son was like he was helping me can i have one so he made one and it's super yummy so just stir it up and you have a delicious and you will get like stirs of chocolate in there too which is completely normal and super yummy so here's your hot chocolate balm hot chocolate and i just want to show you really quickly we have one more minute i am going to do some white chocolate and show you how to drizzle i should have put that in there sorry it's a good distraction for all of us tonight anyways hi sally thanks for watching this is okay so for the big the three ounce um the the big chocolate bombs like this the three the three inch ones you're going to want to do about 10 ounces of milk the smaller ones i would do six to eight this is super chocolatey i won't drink it now i'll wait till we're done but yummy so i was just going to show you guys really quickly how to drizzle this one we'll drizzle these two because i think the snowflake looks cute with white drizzles let's see if my chocolate is ready for some reason the white chocolate actually takes a little bit longer all right so i'm just stirring it up i like to have a couple ready to go hi kathy um hi maureen i like to have a couple ready to go in between because this is also a nice way to clean off your fork i always use a fork to stir my chocolate and then just go ahead and this is where you get it looking all nice and pretty so you want to tap the chocolate off your fork and then just go back and forth and here is how you make them and this is where if you if you have seams that you're trying to hide you could always turn it over and do both sides and you'll never see your seams and then we'll just go ahead and sprinkle on some candy canes because it smells really good it smells nice and pepperminty and this makes your nice peppermint hot chocolate all right and then you just want to pop these into a cupcake liners and here you have it so that is hi david okay so there is our oops one more time there's our hot chocolate balms and hot chocolate balms if you have to be creative because you can't get your molds because honestly guys if you want to do these order your molds as soon as we get off the phone if you can even find them because they will take two to three weeks to get here but these do make great gifts so thank you for watching tonight and you guys let me know if any of you guys make these i would love to see your creations they would be great with pumpkin spice thanks christina um all sorts of you can get this chocolate in all sorts of flavors to decorate them with so have fun let me know if you guys do it and thanks for watching have a good night bye",

I was\u00a0\nreally intimidated by the thought of trying these\u00a0\u00a0 at first because I saw so many people try them\u00a0\nand struggle.. so like I do with every recipe,\u00a0\u00a0 I watched and read a few different versions\u00a0\nand tried to simplify them the best I could\u00a0\u00a0 for you guys. Trust me, you guys these aren\u2019t\u00a0\nas complicated as they seem and they\u2019re so fun\u00a0\u00a0 for the kids. My daughter and husband actually\u00a0\nboth helped make these with me. And I promise\u00a0\u00a0 you even if they aren\u2019t perfect they are still\u00a0\nsuch a fun activity to create, watch and enjoy.\u00a0 Okay and something that I want to start off by\u00a0\nemphasizing is that one of the most important\u00a0\u00a0 factor in making these come out right is the type\u00a0\nof chocolate you are using . So I will emphasize,\u00a0\u00a0 that you should not use the chocolate candy melts.\u00a0\nA Great brand to use for this is the guiradelli\u00a0\u00a0 or the Lindt chocolate um but any high quality\u00a0\nchocolate will do. And you defiantly do not want\u00a0\u00a0 to use a milk chocolate for this either. Um you\u00a0\nwant to use a semi-sweet or a dark chocolate.\u00a0\u00a0 and all that I could get my hands was this\u00a0\nsemi-sweet bakers chocolate and this worked\u00a0\u00a0 just fine. And I recommend slicing up\u00a0\nabout half of a chocolate bar and then\u00a0\u00a0 using half of a bag of some chocolate\u00a0\nchips in combination with that as well.\u00a0\u00a0 And these amounts gave me enough to make\u00a0\n12 half spheres or 6 hot chocolate bombs.\u00a0\u00a0 Okay to start here we are going to go ahead\u00a0\nand melt our half chocolate bar and 1/2\u00a0\u00a0 bag of chocolate chips until they\u2019re fully\u00a0\nmelted using the double boiler method.\u00a0\u00a0 I use about and inch and a half of water, and\u00a0\nyou wanna make sure your bowl is resting high\u00a0\u00a0 not to close to the boiling water.\u00a0\nAnother tip that I would recommend\u00a0\u00a0 is not to use the microwave. And also be stirring\u00a0\nthis constantly to ensure that it does not\u00a0\u00a0 overheat you\u2019ll want a thin runny consistency but\u00a0\nas soon as it get there remove it from the heat.\u00a0\u00a0 So now we\u2019re ready to go ahead and put our\u00a0\nchocolate into our molds. And I would say\u00a0\u00a0 probably about a tablespoon to\u00a0\ntablespoon and a half of chocolate.\u00a0\u00a0 You really want to put it on kind of thick.\u00a0\nYou really want to be double checking that\u00a0\u00a0 there are no bare spots that are paper\u00a0\nthin because they will break or crack.\u00a0 Once all your molds are spread evenly,\u00a0\nyou can go ahead and turn the molds upside\u00a0\u00a0 down on the parchment paper and put them\u00a0\ninto the freezer for about 8-10 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0 (I used a cookie sheet underneath mine)\u00a0 Okay and once the chocolate sets in the\u00a0\nfreezer they should easy to pop out of\u00a0\u00a0 the molds. Try only holding them in one small\u00a0\nspot with your finger tips though because you\u00a0\u00a0 Do not want to over handle them your warm hands\u00a0\nit will melt and warp the chocolate. That\u2019s why\u00a0\u00a0 I don\u2019t recommend melts - because they\u2019re a\u00a0\nvery soft chocolate that is easily melted with\u00a0\u00a0 your hands. Before you go ahead and fill your\u00a0\nbombs you\u2019re just going to want to use a heated\u00a0\u00a0 surface to melt down the edges to be even to stick\u00a0\ntogether better. And I used a cooking pot top\u00a0\u00a0 on my gas stove flame for a second or two that\u00a0\nway you have a handle to hold onto as well.\u00a0 And another tip that I have is to use some real\u00a0\nhot chocolate inside of your bombs versus like a\u00a0\u00a0 real unsweetened cocoa. The cocoa is just\u00a0\ngoing to give it a more bitter taste.\u00a0 Okay and in order to get that bath bomb\u00a0\neffect we are going to add our bomb\u00a0\u00a0 into our hot milk versus pouring the milk\u00a0\nover it and it turns out beautifully. Okay guys thats all I have for you today,\u00a0\u00a0 let me know down below what your favorite\u00a0\nhot cocoa topping is. I hope this video\u00a0\u00a0 was helpful don\u2019t forget to subscribe before\u00a0\nyou go and I will catch you on the next one.", "v1Sk_JBvkDg": "hey everybody welcome back jordan and jose here

what are hot chocolate bombs i don't know but i always see it on instagram or tick tock so i think it's the latest social media food crates of 2020. yeah and it looks so delicious it's actually just um a ball of milk chocolate or white chocolate whatever your heart desires and it has mallows and cocoa powder and some people they put sprinkles or even um candy cane crushed candy canes inside so guys we are so excited don't judge us this is our first time to make it and we are very happy to share with it with you all so let's get started okay guys for the hot chocolate bombs that we'll be doing today we are gonna do the simple way okay the ingredients that we need are so i'm gonna be doing milk chocolate with some chippits and angie will be doing i'll be making white chocolate and in the inside we're going to add cocoa powder marshmallows and try to add some sprinkles as well yes and to mold our um actual bombs we need our silicone okay guys so we are excited to make this and let's get started so guys this recipe is not too hard hopefully because we don't have to bake the first step that we have to do is to melt our chocolate in the microwave but we have to be very careful not to totally melt our chocolate because what we have to do is put it in the microwave for 15 seconds and then we have to stir it and then put it back in the microwave and then stir it back again until we get the right temperature of the chocolate so we're just gonna do that and we'll be right back so we're just trying to stir our chocolate to make sure that um the heat is evenly distributed on our chocolates here we don't want it to be too melted because we we want it to um hold on to our silicone um mold so we're ready to put the first layer in our mold and then we're gonna put it in the freezer for five minutes yeah and then we're gonna do a second layer and then put it back in the freezer for another five minutes okay so we are uh done with our first layer we're just gonna pop it in the freezer for five minutes and then we'll put in our second layer so guys after five minutes in the freezer this is what it looks like and if you if you can see there's like some um bald spots that's why we have to do a second layer just to make sure that we cover all those bald spots so guys we are done with our second layer it's not perfect but you don't really wanna see the inside it's the outside that's gonna look so cool when we um pour in the milk so we're gonna put this back in the freezer for another five minutes so guys our second layer is done so we're gonna take it out of our mold just carefully and just press it and then just gonna put it here on top it looks so nice oops sorry there we go there so here are our semi uh circle hot choco bombs and we're gonna put the filling inside so i'm just gonna put the cocoa powder on mine on my milk chocolate and then angie is gonna put some hot cocoa powder or cocoa powder and i'm just gonna put some marshmallows and then we're gonna add a little bit of sprinkles just for color we're gonna be adding more so it looks let's bomb more and more and again guys we are not professionals but we're gonna try our best okay so here is our plate i'm gonna take our first spear and then i'm just gonna do this so it's gonna melt the sides of the chocolate and then i'm going to connect it to our other the other half of our um choco bombs here we go okay again we are not professionals so we're gonna try our best and if you want to totally seal it you can take a fork and put it in the microwave for maybe 10-15 seconds and then you can just swipe the sides just so it will close up okay okay so we're done with the uh two milk chocolates and then angie's gonna do the um white chocolate so she's just heating it up and then boom wow [Music] it looks so it looks so nice with a hint of some chocolates so guys our choco bombs are ready and we are gonna make our hot choco bum so angie do you wanna sure use the white chocolate so we're just gonna put it in our mugs here and then we have piping hot milk just gonna pour it in and you're gonna see it melt here we go doesn't want to open see whoa that looks so cool

"7Uns4gPQWA8": "[Music] hi everyone welcome to best recipes with sharon i am excited to bring this video to you today featuring one of the hottest items on the market they're so much fun that everybody wants them but they're a little pricey to buy so why not do your own for a fraction of the price i'd like to introduce to you hot chocolate bombs diy yes do it yourself so stay with me and we can make this happen let's have some fun in creating these and i'll go ahead and show you different flavors and different ways of creating designs on them and i'll also share with you what my ideas are for making sure that these turn out perfectly now these are a few ingredients that you can use for inside of the chocolate balms and then you also need to make sure that you've secured a really good quality chocolate and i'm using a silicone mold that has a round shape like this and they're very flexible as you can see right here that works to your advantage and even though you could use hard plastic molds these silicone molds are absolutely essential as far as i'm concerned it really makes your life so much easier and a lot less chance of breaking them especially when you go to remove them from the mold and you can buy these in most stores but also it's available online if they're sold out go ahead and get yourself some and let's get started so i'm going to start by melting some chocolate and like i said a good quality chocolate so this is milk chocolate here and then i'm also going to use some white chocolate turn the stove on high put a pot of water on the stove and put a bowl on top to create a double boiler effect and turn the heat down a little bit just to have it simmering and add your chocolate to the bowl and melt it slowly careful not to burn yourself from the steam as you're placing the chocolate in there and again it's melted slowly because you want to make sure you temper your chocolate and that it doesn't melt any more than just melted and no more than 90 degrees and i stopped heating my chocolate at about 80 degrees and i took it and removed it from the heat and finished stirring it until the pieces were fully melted and it's the same process for both the white and the milk chocolate temperature is important if you want them to set properly in the mold overheating it can actually cause your chocolate to be too soft and then it may not set properly and so stir it until it's nice and silky smooth like this and a little bit shiny now i'm going to go ahead and place it in the molds and show you how to just use a spoon to smooth around the edges like this making sure that you get about a tablespoon in each mold and making sure that they're up on the sides well so that it doesn't all pool in the bottom and it's very important to make sure that the sides are thick enough as well so that they hold firmly when you go to put them together and i'm using rounded spoons to smooth this out [Music] and then they need to be taken and chilled in the fridge for at least 15 to 20 minutes now check these ones out i sprinkled the bottoms quite generously with white chocolate then i added dark chocolate sprinkled back and forth and then i finished it off with milk chocolate and i smoothed it out gently not to merge the chocolates together but to create a marbled effect [Music] and this is what i ended up with something a little more artistic actually and so easy to make now don't worry if they didn't turn out perfectly the first time you can still patch it up after you take it out of the fridge you can see all the holes that have happened or the spots that you have made a little too thin so go ahead and use a paint brush to touch that up with a little bit or you can still use the spoon to top that up and you'll come under the mold just perfectly like this if you make sure that it's thick enough so after you've touched it up you'll need to chill it again before pulling it out of the mold and if the outside comes out shiny and smooth like this you've tempered your chocolate perfectly and the inside will be rough but that really doesn't matter at all and you remove them from the silicone by pushing up from the bottom like this and it just pops out so easily and it's nice if the edges come out nice and smooth so that it goes together quite easily but if there is a few chips in it or a little bit of irregularities don't worry about it they can still be fixed let's get ready to put these together now and because i already have hot water in the pot on the stove from melting the chocolate i'll use this to heat my plate as well [Music] now what are we stuffing the inside of these with of course there there'll be lots of marshmallows these will help to create the special effect that you want from these bombs [Music] so you can use white ones or colored ones i will also be using mini peanut butter cups mini mint chocolates and chunks of caramel chocolate bar and even pieces of rolo you can use french vanilla cappuccino mix carnation hot chocolate mix with mini marshmallows already in it and also rolo hot chocolate mix and you don't want your plate too hot just lukewarm use the plate to melt just the edges of these chocolate balls then turn it over and fill it with whatever you desire so this one's going to be milk chocolate one teaspoon of milk chocolate mix a bunch of mini marshmallows then do the same thing with the top just lightly melt the edges and then gently touch it together to seal you can use saran wrap to hang on to it with or you can use gloves or just your bare hands this one is one teaspoon of hot chocolate mix chopped rolos and of course lots of marshmallows [Music] slightly melt the edges of the top and place it on and gently secure it and then just top it off with a roll because this one is a rolo chocolate balm now let's do a mint one move along quite quickly because it's the same procedure to start with and then you just add what you want in the middle a little differently but this is again one teaspoon of milk chocolate mix add mint chocolate pieces some colored marshmallows here [Music] and top it up till it's nice and full and then of course just cap it off the same way as you did before and top it off with a mint piece and you know that that is your mint chocolate balm once again moving it along quite quickly because this is the same procedure only this one's going to turn out to be caramel so there's something for everybody in every type of taste bud but they all have their own appeal another idea is to use french vanilla cappuccino and again it would just be one teaspoon of this instead of the milk chocolate mix and of course you can add whatever you want inside and decorate as you wish use whatever type of chocolate shell you want for this it's quite interchangeable actually you can put whatever you like on the outside whatever you want on the inside and that goes for the milk chocolate on the inside as well it really doesn't matter it's whatever you feel would go together nicely go ahead and do it and you can just do the chocolate bombs and not decorate the outside if you want having said that if you like to do the decorating the sky's the limit you can do whatever you like to make these look nice on the outside as well and it's a good way to use up your leftover chocolate here i'm using the white chocolate and i'm coloring it with food coloring red and green to make it look a little bit christmassy you can make these look like christmas bulbs and do whatever you want back and forth you don't have to be perfect with it you'll see how it looks in the end when it's done and it actually doesn't look too bad certainly go ahead and explore a little bit and do what you feel that might look nice [Music] and if you're using food coloring in white chocolate use the paste so that it mixes well [Music] now when serving these bombs to your family and friends you can put them in a mug like this and pour hot water over it if you want it's an alternative to the milk if somebody has lactose intolerance they would also have to watch what they put inside of course and what type of chocolate the hot water will make it not quite as [Music] rich [Music] you're using milk the temperature is quite important you don't want to boil your milk you don't want it to burn or scald so you just heat it until it reaches about 180 to 190 degrees that's it and take it off and pour it in and you have a perfect hot chocolate as you can tell i prefer the hot milk it makes it so rich and creamy and all these different flavors that when they explode in your cup and make it into a hot chocolate it's like a warm hug on a cold day and there's so many rich flavors to choose from so you could say that if you want to level up your hot chocolate this is what you need [Music] these bombs are great for entertaining any time of the year and for any reason so now you can see why it's a hot selling item in the stores but you can now do it yourself so go ahead and i hope you found this video helpful and thanks for watching today's episode of best recipes with sharon and i hope you make these and enjoy them",

balms perfect for valentine's day so to start with you're going to need a mold silicone is best and i'm going to use these cute little geometric heart molds next up you'll need some chocolate and if you can temper chocolate that is amazing and you can do that but i'm going to keep it super simple and just use chocolate melts which is compound chocolate so it's going to set up nicely without us having to temper it i've got some dark and white chocolate here so i can have a play around with a couple of different versions you can also add some fruit color if you're wanting to color your white chocolate so a little bit of pink or something it's best to use an oil-based coloring if you can otherwise if you're just using a gel color make sure to add a little bit of vegetable oil and that will help it combine with your chocolate without seizing up next up you'll need your fillings so i've got hot chocolate powder strawberry nesquik and of course marshmallows because lots of hot chocolate without marshmallows and finish it off with any edible toppings that you want so it could be sprinkles or lusters or glitters just be aware that it's going to be going into your hot chocolate so some things are going to get a little bit soggy and you might want to try and avoid them so i'm going to be starting with my white chocolate hearts and i want this with fun little gold speckles on it so i'm just going to flick some of my gold luster into the molds before i get started i'm just going to grab a brush and my gold luster which has got a little bit of rose spirit in it which is going to evaporate quickly but leaves it as a liquid now so that we can splash it in nicely i'm just going to splash that into some of my molds just flick you can do it like this for some larger splats or if you just want fine little ones you can just flick it off the edge of your pot now this step is just for an extra little bit of sparkle so it's absolutely not necessary if you don't have luster don't even worry about it now i'm going to melt my white chocolate i'm just going to do this in the microwave and i'm just gonna do it for little bits at a time to make sure that it doesn't burn and give it a good stir in between each time [Music] so i'm doing the chocolate for about 20 or 30 seconds at a time and then just making sure that i stir it frequently so that it all melts nice and evenly now you can see this is pretty much done it's all nice and melted very smooth all liquid no big lumps left and that's exactly how we want it once that's all melted i'm gonna add in a little bit of my pink coloring which is my oil-based coloring and mix that in so i'm just gonna add in a little drop of pink and mix it in nicely make sure you give it a good shake first [Music] so now that's a gorgeous pink color we can add that to our molds and spread it all around so i'm just going to pour a little bit into each one [Music] and now we're going to want to spread this around so that it's got a nice even coating over the whole mold so to spread it out you can use a spoon and you can just [Music] push it all around the mold [Music] or you can try using a paintbrush that's easier [Music] making sure to get all the way up to the [Music] edges or you can even just swirl it all around until you get a nice even coverage [Music] now i'm making a mess if that does happen you can just grab a scraper or a knife or anything and just scrape off any excess i might stick to the paintbrush because it's a bit cleaner for me [Music] and just push that all around the heart mold making sure to get into all the little corners now if you are using a paintbrush and you do have luster dust on the bottom just try not to brush right to the bottom of the mold because otherwise you might move all that around and you won't have that nice speckled look now you can add in more chocolate if you need you can take some out if you put too much in this one i put a little bit too much in i reckon so i'm gonna move that over to that one [Music] and now i'll just do another little swirl around now it does tend to pull at the base of the heart so do just make sure that you're pushing it up onto those sides and right into all the corners if you get up onto the sides a little bit it doesn't matter too much we can clean that up later now that they're all covered i'm going to pop that in the fridge for a couple of minutes and that's going to help it set up nice and quickly so that we can move on with our next steps so these have just come out of the fridge and they're all nice and set they're in there for about five minutes and what i want to do now is just have a look around especially around the edge bits and just make sure that nowhere looks too thin because these can be a little bit more fragile and break easily when you're taking them out of the mold if it does look a little bit thin that's totally fine just grab a little bit more of your chocolate and just paint it around those bits and pop it back in the fridge to set up but these ones are looking okay so i'm just going to pop them right out now you want to be nice and gentle sometimes you might want to pull away at the edges a little bit to help it release nicely [Music] and then just pop it out of the mold and you've got your gorgeous little half heart so just repeat that for the rest of them being nice and gentle now i'm going to move on to my dark chocolate hearts pretty much just repeat the process so melt your chocolate and spread it all in the molds and let them set i'm just leaving these ones plain for now and then i'll add some extra decorations once they're all assembled again just make sure you're mixing it up between bursts in the microwave and that'll keep it nice and smooth so here we've got our nice glossy delicious dark chocolate all melted all nice and smooth time to add this one to the molds [Music] as always just being really careful to make sure you're brushing up all the sides and making sure you've got good coverage everywhere [Music] and now we'll pop these in the fridge to set so these guys are all set up in the fridge now and they are ready to come out of the molds as well [Music] again just carefully peeling back the edges [Music] and popping them out of the mulch and here we are with all our hearts out of the moulds and looking gorgeous now we can just tidy them up just a little bit and add in our hot chocolate and marshmallows so we're going to need something nice and warm now to just melt the edge of the heart and leave us with a nice clean rim and that's going to give us two nice edges when we go to stick the hearts together so i'm going to use a fry pan for this i'm going to quickly pop it on the stove for about a minute just to heat up and then we can use the heat from that just to melt the edges so i've got my warm pan and what you want to do is just grab one of your hearts and really quickly just rub it around on the pan you definitely don't want to leave it there for too long otherwise too much of it will melt but now we've got a nice clean level edge and just pop it upside down ready to be filled so in my pink ones i'm going to add in a couple of spoonfuls of my strawberry nesquik [Music] and you can absolutely add into your preference so if you like it a bit sweeter a bit richer you can add more if you don't like it quite so sweet you can add a bit less now you can totally add in as much hot chocolate or nesquik as you want do just keep in mind that you'll also be getting some sweetness from the chocolate from the hearts so that's going to contribute to that extra sweetness and richness and now i'm going to add in a heaping of mini marshmallows [Music] now just make sure that you're not covering the edges because the other heart will need to attach to that but you can heap it in a little bit of a dome because you'll have extra cavity from the other heart so now you want to take your second half of the heart and again just rub it on that pan and then we want to work fairly quickly because this has not only cleaned up the edge of the pan but it's also given us melted chocolate that's going to kind of stick the two hearts together so you just want to press them together nice and firmly try and match them up and line them up as best you can and there we've got our gorgeous hot chocolate heart and now we can just leave them there to set up nicely now i'm pretty much going to do the same for my dark chocolate hearts but first i'm actually going to use my blowtorch to just toast some of my marshmallows so that we get that lovely toasty flavor in the hot chocolate [Music] so just using my blowtorch and just lightly toasting over them try not to let them burn so now that that's done i can pretty much repeat the process so getting the first half just cleaning up the edge popping it upside down adding in my hot chocolate this time and some of those gorgeous toasted marshmallows [Music] and now take the other half of your heart be ready to work nice and quickly [Music] melt and line them up and push them together and leave it aside to set these are almost done and they're looking great already i'm just going to add the last little finishing touches especially to my dark chocolate ones so for that i've got the leftover of my pink chocolate from my heart and i'm just gonna drizzle it across and add on some little sprinkles so i've got my pink chocolate and i'm just gonna drizzle all the way across my heart [Music] and i've got some gorgeous pink sprinkles here i'm just gonna put all over and maybe even a little love bug better go with two actually and there we have our absolutely gorgeous valentine's day hot chocolate bombs for hot chocolate hearts to use these just pop them in the bottom of your mug pour some hot milk over and mix it all together once it's all melted hope you guys have so much fun with your hot chocolate balms for valentine's day or even your next date night and definitely leave a comment and let me know if you have a go especially if you do any fun and different flavors and decorations and i'd love you guys to subscribe so that i can share some more fun

Do it for U \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a  ", "gm_JhliDqPA": "[Music] welcome back to the vlog which actually isn't even really a vlog because i'm not really doing much outside my own home but that's the season of life friends so it's gucci it's fine it's fine it's fine you've all heard of the hot chocolate bombs today i'm gonna put a twist on them and make butter beer drink bombs you heard it here first i'm coining the term drink bombs listen white chocolate and matcha red velvet chocolate butter beer salted caramel vanilla latte there's a whole world outside of just hot chocolate so today we're gonna be making butter beer drink bombs i'm flying by the seat of my pants like i am in life [Music] but we'll see how it goes i'm kind of looking off a recipe from tablespoon.com i'm kind of fussed with some measurements to what i think would work but i don't really know what i'm doing so today's gonna be a lot of experimenting but that's fine because i like chemistry and science anyways so it feels kind of okay plus like how much can i mess up really [Music] anyways the things that i'm going to be using today rum if you can't have alcohol or you don't drink or you don't want to use alcohol imitation rum extract and apple cider vinegar mixed will give you the same kind of like punch and effect as wrong cream soda we have butter well in this case it's margin i'm using soy milk powder but there's coconut milk powder regular milk powder whatever floats your boat you can use that we also have brown sugar and my other ingredients are not here at the moment please hold i also have butterscotch chocolate chips here for those of you who are dairy free or vegan there are resources to get dairy free slash what vegan butterscotch chips there's a website called chocolate emporium i'll put the link down below as well as a link to another massive list of vegan chocolate websites and resources they make vegan dairy free like like literally everything and they have vegan butterscotch chips so if you have that dietary restriction there is an option for you that's not too expensive either so there we go we have some melted butterscotch chips when i was melting these over the stove i mixed and some of the margin and the milk to get it more liquidy the whole science of working with chocolate and if i was a real youtuber i'd probably do my research on it but i didn't [Music] i also have cotton candy flavoring there wasn't any cream soda flavoring that i could find in any like online or in any store that i went to so we have cotton candy and the materials we're using are these little chocolate bomb molds i have the brilliant idea of putting them in a mini cupcake pan so that they're easy to bring to the freezer to freeze [Applause] [Music] and then we also have a little brush here to paint the chocolate in the holes [Applause] [Music] okay hey hi how are you so update turns out you can't put anything in the chocolate in order for it to freeze properly which honestly should have been obvious because the alco alcohol doesn't freeze so i like that was super super obvious and then i tried to like make another batch where i just like liquefied it a little bit with milk that also didn't work so i only melted the chocolate it worked way better and now we have molds this guy's a little lopsided um that's the inside not pretty i'm just like you you are you're just like me i'm gonna mix what i'm putting on the inside of the drink box i've got my soy milk powder here let's start with that this is an eighth of a cup of sugar of light brown sugar i also dead ass i'm gonna put some butter in here i've never had butter beer so i can't compare it to the real thing which probably makes this not an ideal situation i'll post the approximate measurements that i used in the comments down below but use that as a leaping point if you decide to make this measure the ingredients with your heart is what i'm saying [Music] okay i added butter to this one like straight why am i surprised by that i know someone who likes butter in their coffee because apparently it tastes good so i thought i would try it i added cotton candy flavoring to the filling okay this is the same apple chocolate that was not working yesterday so that we all have to use this [Music] and they stick together [Music] here they are you give life you are love in all of their mishmash glory this is what me and my siblings look like just a mess well at least i am anyways i'm gonna stick them in the freezer now to let this solidify and then finally we're gonna try them it is only 10 am but i'm gonna add a shot of rum inside this guy here she is gonna add the hot water first [Music] okay okay little hole in there where the milk is seeping out the milk powder is coming through okay [Music] okay [Music] that smells so good [Music] that's delicious wow that turned out really well it's not as better scotchy as i would like but that's okay it's still really delicious butterbeer inspired drink bombs we did it we did it ciao that's unbelievable oh my gosh i haven't had real butterbeer to compare it with but then again this isn't supposed to be like a different way to make butter beer it's just a butter beer inspired drink bomb yes okay the approximate measurements of what i'm using will be down below please let me know if you give it a go another thing that i wanted to talk about on the vlog today that i want to start doing regularly is something called charity of the month i love the vlog i'm having so much fun trying new recipes and getting out and exploring the city but i want to do something more i don't want to feel like just another kid around on the internet in the spirit of generosity love kindness all those things once a month i'm going to highlight a charity that stands out to me this is going to be the charity because that's like january is already over basically this is going to be the charity for january and february and let me just tell you a little bit about it it is called the iowa 10 healing lodge society it's a women's emergency shelter and it's mainly indigenous focused their mission is to provide shelter and community services guided by indigenous traditional teachings to anyone affected by family abuse and violence the goal of iowa town healing large society is to shield and protect vulnerable women and children against family violence or any other form of abuse iowa town seeks to promote peace and to end family violence and bullying in our society and they have i was doing some research they have amazing resources they teach like indigenous storytelling they have elders that are present to help counsel so i want to highlight this charity this month to encourage you to give to it i usually try to donate a certain portion of my paycheck of each paycheck to charities so our channel is going to be our focus for january and february of course i'll put the link down below if you want to learn more about it it's based in calgs i'm really excited to encourage people to change the world and to be more generous because i think we all use it the pandemic is taking a toll on us so if you try the butterbeer recipe let me know tag me on instagram my instagram headphone is e dot a dot antigone oh i always have tik tok i have tick tock now i think my handle's the same let me i'm going to check and then my handle is just ea on take me on tick tock follow along come hang out it's gonna be lots of fun", "PA0oDCD9y1s": "what's up guys i'm back i told you i would be so the first person who commented on my video yesterday got to choose what we're making today so i will be making heart-shaped hot cocoa bombs for you i got these awesome molds off of amazon they're really nice sorry my roommate they're really nice because they're silicone but they have these little feet on them which makes it so nice because when you're doing a silicone mold it doesn't sit flat you just have to be really careful but this one has these wonderful little feet on it and this is kind of like a 3d heart it's really hard to see i guess you can kind of see it better from the back so i've not done these before the only ones i have done have been the generic heart the the circle ones and those turned out great so we're going to make some of these on video for you and uh i'll be right back things you're gonna need something to set these things on when you take them out of the molds this isn't really that important yet but you know to get started some molds some chocolate we're using merkins again today some mini marshmallows sprinkles of all types glitter and some hot cocoa mix it's so much easier to get this than packages you can just scoop it out you don't have to individually empty out packages and then here i have some white melting chocolate americans as well and that's also americans but i mixed it with some red so i thought we'd get a little crazy today and do some different decorations um on these and we're using milk chocolate today because yesterday i did white chocolate and i just want to mix it up if you want to use white chocolate you totally can you want to use ruby chocolate whatever you want it's your own world all right so this is a different container this is an awesome silicone the lip is not uh it's not squishy but the rest of the cup is so wonderful container for melting chocolate whatever you're comfortable with that's fine we're doing the 30 second stir 30 second stir 30 second stir until it's wonderfully melted and nice and smooth we'll be back and i just couldn't take the silence anymore i was going crazy yesterday so i'm watching hook in the background don't sue me movie companies or whoever i'm not making money i'm not making anyone else watch hook i just love the movie so goddamn much that it's one of my favorite backgrounds and we all miss the out of robin williams so i don't hear any crap alright so i should be wearing my anti-starbucks cool flare apron but it's filthy it has like three videos worth of chocolate on it so i don't think it's probably gonna be the best and effective method of keeping myself clean so i'm just gonna be extra careful yeah right i'm never careful i'm always spilling burning myself and somehow keeping you entertained all on accident so wear an apron if you want to be clean awesome i have this to really nice melt um [Music] oddly enough yeah you want it nice and melty and smooth and if this were a polycarbonate mold you could just dump it in give it a few taps and then dump it back out to get a perfect wonderful shell but these are not polycarbonate these are silicone so truth be told i'm gonna let this sit for a few minutes and let it get a little bit thicker because the thicker it is i wouldn't say super thick but when it's slightly thicker than liquid form it's a lot easier to put into the molds because once you start painting or fingering your chocolate into the mold it's so warm that it just melts and wants to pull down right at the bottom which creates a really thick shell on that side instead of a beautiful even even coating wax on wax off um so while this is sitting and getting slightly less warm i'm going to pack a bowl i'll be right back so we're back got a nice bowl of i don't know what and some really good sticky bubble hash i don't know if anyone else who's watched this video was entertained by my 3d effects i threw in the last video whoo i'm high tech do you see that explosion when i lift the lighter it was super fun it made me laugh for like 20 minutes but i guess i'm pretty self-entertained but i'll probably throw in a few more for you guys let me know what you thought time to take a hit so delicious so delicious oh there's nothing like some good marijuana to get you going and ready to make candy i don't know if it's just me but it gets me motivated i'm not a couch stoner i'm a doer i'm a doer all right this is getting thicker maybe a few more minutes and i'll show you how to put it into the mood so it's the best angle i can get you working on a camera the man says he got a tripod for me so hopefully okay so this chocolate has gotten thicker um some people use a paintbrush i have some they can be really thick and they don't hold a lot of the chocolate and it just gets stuck in the bristles and then bristles come out any chocolate i do not prefer a paintbrush i prefer using my fingers and paper towels um you should have gloves my dumb ass don't have any gloves i thought i did i don't i'm gonna get all chocolatey and then i'm gonna apron on it's gonna be fun always fun anywho okay so i'm going to these aren't very deep either you can see they're pretty shallow so i'm going to take a little bit of this chocolate just like probably a tablespoon and i'm gonna dump it into that mold and then i'm gonna come over here and i'm gonna fill up this mold with a tablespoon okay you can hear hook in the background and i don't care so there's that much in there you can choose to just like smooth it around like this give it a little swirl it will come down into the cavity but that's not going to be enough it's not going to reach all of those edges so take your good ol nose pick and finger i mean your pointer finger and start pulling up the sides very gently just letting your finger drag up the sides paying close attention to this point here and the edges in general because that's going to be your shell the bottom part is going to be thicker naturally because of gravity pulling your chocolate down it's just the way it's going to work but uh you want to make sure you have a good shell for when you go to pcs together because if you don't it's just going to fall apart and frustrate the living out of you while you are trying to put them together leave me a tab and i speak from experience so yeah um these are all coated you can see there's still chocolate in them that's moving around some people would tell you to turn your mold over and if you were using a polycarbonate that would be great because all the chocolate would run down but i don't feel like this will run down evenly so you might get one side that's thicker so i'm going to fill the rest of these cavities and by the time i'm done with this one this chocolate should be a little more set and then i'll continue to add a little bit and build up the sides a little bit more so we'll return so it's going to look like you're going to have this little pool in the middle this one doesn't have as much so it's a bad example you're just kind of pull up the sides and you're going to want to like scrape it down because you're building an edge especially see that part right there we're going to add a little bit more chocolate to this one and try not to make a heinous mess like i've already done and we're going to work on this one as an example maybe this this one pull pull pull pull it's okay if it goes over the side slightly this is where some people are like oh like a paintbrush i don't i really don't you can't get all that uh sorry you're seeing my finger you can't get all that precision and feel all the corners with a paintbrush you're never gonna get the same uh quality so we're gonna do this to the rest of these and we'll be right back so they're all smeared in and as you can see there's like kind of as much built up around the tops as i could get it's a little bit messy if you want to take a scraper let's see i don't know if this works but if it's still warm this is moving as i'm doing it because i'm trying to hold my phone hold on do that that just kind of like tore the chocolate because it was at that soft ganache stage where it shouldn't be manipulated so don't do that just wait till they dry you can at this point stick them in the refrigerator for a minute maybe three or in the freezer for like one minute because i don't want this building any condensation and i think i'll fill the other one with the rest of the chocolate i have so i'm not wasting any and that way we'll have more to decorate so you may think that your chocolate is ready to come out of the mold because it looks like it's all covered but stick it up to the light source let me see if i can show you oops that's me my nose and you see all those spots those are spots that need more chocolate so you can go back in with some more chocolate and just add a little bit so those don't become weak structure points in your bombs so we're gonna do that right now so of course my battery power's at like six percent yay that's no fun hopefully this doesn't get killed all right i have added to the spots i talked about who cares if these look like on the inside really do not worry about it don't try and get it smooth if it's like this it just means it was thicker and awesome and the the fronts are gonna look really good so no concern there say though this light's bothering me that it's a lot more difficult to fill something that's not round and i knew that was gonna be the case but yeah it is so you gotta be really careful and getting all those corners fingers are the best no no stop it okay phone's charged up enough to finish making this video i believe let me close the lines because for the curtain i should say it's really bright okay good so these have been sitting here for i don't know 10 minutes they should be fully hardened now when you're taking with the the round ones i kind of i kind of give a gentle tug all around the edges so that's what i'm gonna do with these gentle tug to release them and then you're gonna push on the center the bottom center look at that oh yeah it worked so i'm i'm gonna i'm using three fingers to pull and push up through the bottom there's another one just like that and don't worry if you have edges sticking over you can take care of that in the next step it's very nerve-wracking doing it because you're like please don't wait for somebody please don't work all right we're doing good so i'm gonna unmold the rest of these and i'll get back to you okay here we go damn it so we're gonna take one of the shells that's all funky on the edges we're just gonna give it i turn it like this some people might swipe it around i kind of give it a turn now yeah just perfect and we'll set it right there i'll show you one more time with a messier one this one's really messy with the edges everywhere really jagged come over here give it a couple turns to get that piece off because it doesn't need to be there and perfection let me set it there i would spare you the monotonous time it's going to take me to do that real quick not real quick and uh get back when it's [Music] done okay i'm trying to find the best place to set you up because this up um we're going to take one of our shelves we have a bowl of hot cocoa and a marshmallow it's probably easier to put the marshmallows in a bowl like you did the cocoa we're going to take a scoop and i have a rather large spoon now don't worry if you don't get a ton of hot cocoa in there i think it's really all about the marshmallows at this point because your your little heart is made out of chocolate and i've i've tried these the ones i've made and they're delicious like really good so try let's see if i can show you try and get marshmallows so that none of them are poking out of the sides it's okay if they're poking out at the top but the sides make it difficult to see and then you get holes and air bubbles and all that horribleness so i'm gonna take this one melt it up a little bit get it to where i know it's soft and we're gonna just put that baby on top now i'm having to poop i'm having to push a little bit if you see there's a seam there it's bugging me um hope that when i let go oh good it's sealed oh no it didn't look oh see now it's popping out crap so that can be a slight um hiccup you encounter it's just what happens we're gonna try it again maybe hold it a little bit longer so that it seals and since these aren't goddamn it okay it's not this is not bang right so we still have issues there so what i'm going to do is take a little bit of chocolate from the pan and rub it on the sides now you want to make sure it's not too hot of chocolate because you'll re-melt a new hole and that's just no good you don't want to melt another hole you're just trying to cover a mistake and the most difficult part about these i will say is that um with the round ones normally i don't worry about how perfect this the the outside is like i don't care if it's a smooth wonderful soft outside i want it to be sealed so i take chocolate in my hands and i roll them around like this with this one i can't really do that it'll lose all of the wonderful beautiful definition of this geometric heart shape so i'm just going to go over it a little bit here with my fingers and i'm going to give it like a twirl okay nothing else is falling out i sealed the edges now of course it doesn't have a perfect focus camera a perfect edge now and i guess you could go in and shape that off later if you're totally obsessive and look it actually cracked right there so we're gonna put a little more chocolate on that crack this will be our experimental one we'll try and save it but there's no guarantees all right let's try another one and hope that it goes a little better because i hate it when things don't go well maybe a little less marshmallows these are kind of mini bombs compared to the size of the christmas ornamenty ones how about that many marshmallows two four six there's ten so that seems like a more appropriate uh amount let's try this again come over here get nice and melty we'll put it on top oops the edges are very thin very very thin so it's really hard to match everything up perfectly and as you can see there's a tiny hole in that one as well nothing is ever perfect you just got to work with what you got keep on keeping on see it's covered everything's okay so i'm going to finish this process don't tell me when i did that i'll wash my hands before i touch the rest there's only three more i need to do because i didn't make a bunch and then we'll get to decorating and pouring one and see how it works okay so i have five in total okay back i have five in total um some of them don't have perfect seams but they're sealed so [Music] they're sealed but there's a line i wish i could get rid of that and we are doing exactly what to do the other day i put my piping bag in the microwave it's cause i still have chocolate left over and it's i mean as long as you're doing really low times like 10 seconds 15 seconds i guess it's all right if it's a good piping bag and mine are there quality from the college i used to attend um yeah so we're gonna get those colors uh the red chalk and the white chocolate melted and we'll start decorating okay another random bit of advice that is sound is do what you do when you're melting your candy melts don't melt the whole thing let it melt itself so i can feel a couple of chunks in here and i'm just going to move them around and get them to melt with my hands because you don't want your chocolate too hot i made a mistake i think the first time of putting chocolate that was too warm onto the cocoa bomb and since the shell is so thin and so fragile the heat from that chocolate just ate right through it and made a big hole and i lost a bomb so try and make sure your chocolate's just you know workable and you know what not but not super hot tip of the day okay i have rigged my uh cell phone on top of a paper towel roll to try and show you the decorating process and i'm just going to grab some non-perils to sprinkle on top oh my life really all right so i'm not going to be sprinkling those what i'll be back was irritating i think it's time to take another hit damn it those those non perils are like statically charged they stick to everything and they just fly around like they got a mind of their own there we go that's better now you don't have a huge glare goddammit i was able to save most of it but still epic pain in the ass shut up i don't care for 15 damn it just got cut off i'm making this video don't cut me off cell phone who do you think you are don't make me turn into a karen okay back to the decorating all right bring these non perils back over here they better not spill all over the place or i'll have a hissy fit we're gonna do a little test okay that looks good i'm gonna take that hair off there and pretend that wasn't there and i'm gonna do a sideways stripe oh hello parels now you can get everywhere when you're supposed to all right there's one down we're gonna pick up this bad boy move it over to the top and do the other few let's see maybe we could just do oh that one's gonna have drizzles all over it i have an idea with this one since i screwed it up already we're going to smear white chocolate all over just the top and just these areas never fail nothing you do is ever a failure everything you do is teaching you something so it's a valuable learning experience like i just learned not to you know put your non-perils on a freaking baking sheet that's a valuable piece of information now if i work extremely quickly you know what i'm just going to take this and dip this in my non-curls wow that was an epic failure all right well this is the one i'm gonna eat this is the one that we're just gonna keep doing crazy to because why not man i don't have any rules here no one's telling me how to make this stuff i could do what i want so we're gonna grab some red non pearls look at that it's almost completely fixed you can't even tell i screwed it up in the beginning no one's gonna know people that's a big deal like don't worry about if things get up you can always fix them always we're gonna pull this a little bit closer um hold on i like the diagonal seems to work the best for me we're going to take some of this wicked awesome sugar art glitter that is just seriously the best i've ever seen we're going to give a sprinkle on top of this white chocolate i want this stuff just expect that you're gonna waste a little bit as you're sprinkling it because that's just the way it goes dang that's pretty look at that glitter now you can actually see the glitter okay i have one more but i don't want to put sprinkles or anything on it i want to try and paint it with some luster dust so owner has forgot how to count there's actually two left so um let me get some paper put down and i'll show you the luster dust technique that may or may not work okay hard to see and does not do it justice because it has such a wonderful opalescence but this is the pink and damn that chocolate's got a good temper on it and then the purple you can kind of see what it looks like but it looks like that all over the camera's doing a bad job like it really does look purple um and it's really pretty very sparkly oh okay hi here i am all right so we've got a few hot cocoa bombs decent and if you have any spots you don't like cover them with you know these things little whatnots i really like that one i think that one's super pretty this one's also pretty elegant this is the one i didn't like and i stuck too many of those things on it doesn't look very good and then there's that bare spot that's kind of janky a perfectionist so what who cares they're going to be delicious i can take pictures of the few that i did and give away the rest people will be happy but i just realized i went to the store earlier to get freaking mini marshmallows for this video and i'm getting milk i'm so sad who makes hot cocoa with water really you gross i'm just kidding that's what i'm gonna have to do to show you that they actually open up because i don't want um i don't want them to take forever i've seen a lot of videos where people are like i'm just gonna pour this like the tiniest little stream and hope it opens up and then still doesn't have to stir and then the marshmallows come up but the ones i've made in the past have definitely popped up all beautiful and pretty so i just want to test that theory one small so we'll get some water boiling okay so i don't really know what else to say oh  i gotta show you yeah hold on crack i remember i'm supposed to show you i almost forgot there don't tell anyone okay so here's the bomb fits marvelously in there and i'm just gonna pour some hot water steaming up the camera sorry oh you see that says marshmallows come up and i'm not even waiting and now my dumbass needs a spoon just keep focusing on the cup focus focus on the cup all right now we're going to stir this the only thing is the reason most people don't want to number one not just because it tastes like not as creamy and lovely i won't say i should because this will probably still taste delicious full of great chocolate um water seizes chocolate so you get kind of a different texture in your cocoa than you would with the fats that milk help offer so this looks like it's ready let's taste it okay ah it's hot okay wait wait hold [Music] on i mean it would be so much better with milk so much better with milk but it is what it is and i just wanted to show you the effect which i did so yay for me that was the whole goal trying to get you a good life there we go um yeah so that's heart-shaped cocoa bombs i should do some regular cocoa bombs next time just kind of like slip the footage into another video somewhere so much easier but i guess since these take longer and they're different more unique you can charge a little bit more for them if you sell stuff so yeah i love you all dearly if you want to subscribe and like kick ass if you don't that's okay i'm not mad at you i still love you thanks for watching i'm trying to figure out what to make next if you have any suggestions or things you'd like to see made please let me know in the comments below down in my down under region i mean you know down below i don't know what they mean by down below it's probably under the video but i try i'm just dirty okay now i love you guys bye", "htl3W8uKvN4": "[Music] hi welcome to nikki's modern mediterranean i'm nikki quickest wife mother ceo and entertaining expert it makes me so happy when people eat well and enjoy each other's company that's why i've created this place where i could show you exactly how i do it for my signature dishes to my creative decor i love any excuse to get in the kitchen and have fun with my kids join me on today's episode where we're making these amazing hot chocolate palms [Music] to get started on our hot chocolate balms you're gonna need a silicone mold i purchased these online and we are gonna make semi-sweet chocolate and a white chocolate so you can use chocolate morsels or any melting chocolate that you could purchase at different variety stores so i'm gonna melt this you can either use a double boiler or i like to just use the microwave so i'm gonna melt that for you guys now [Music] now that our chocolate is melted i've melted the chocolate and the white chocolate and we can get started so i'm gonna be making three different flavors today we're gonna make a hot fudge an oreo and a salted caramel so when this craze came out about a month ago i was watching all these different videos on how to make them and sometimes they look a little bit complicated but my kids really want me to try to make these so they're actually super easy so i'm very excited to show you so once you melt the chocolate i like to use a spoon some people use a paint brush we're gonna put a good amount in the middle and i'm just gonna paint it up with the back of the spoon i think the spoon is easier than the paint brush because the chocolate was melting on the paintbrush but there's a couple key points when you're doing this put a generous amount so that there's no holes and try to paint it all the way up to the sides so that when it sets and you pop them out of the silicone that the sides don't break but you will be able to see how we're going to close them so even if they do break i'll give you a little tip on how to fix that so when you're painting these up remember you're working with melted chocolates you try to go a little bit as fast as you can because you don't want it to harden the other thing that's great about these is that it doesn't take a long time to set so you can make these shells which we're going to do today i'm going to put them in the fridge for about 10 minutes they'll be set and then that way i can ask my daughter to come and help me fill them with all these fun toppings that i was telling you guys about and so this is a great activity that you could do on the weekends when it's snowing out and then you can make this awesome hot chocolate bar for your kids when they're playing in the snow or you can utilize this as a birthday party activity or just having people over for a weekend this one's ready to go in the fridge so i'm gonna pop that right in the fridge get started on our next one the next one we're gonna make is an oreo kind of cookies and cream chocolate balm so we're gonna use the chocolate that we have and we're going to kind of just take a good amount in the spoon and kind of drizzle it inside the silicone molds it doesn't have to be perfect you can splatter it my kids like to do just kind of messy it does make a mess but we're going to drizzle this in because when we put the vanilla it's going to make a really cool marble pattern which is fun and if you have different colors you can do that too drizzle that in and we're going to take our vanilla and put a good amount in the middle and kind of paint those up and it's going to make a marble effect again make sure you paint it all the way to the top so that you have a full circle now we're going to make our shells for our salted caramel so back with our chocolate and once you get the hang of this you're going to be able to make them so quick remember go all the way up on the sides fill the hole in the middle don't worry about the inside looking perfect because once you pull these shells out the outside is so smooth and it's going to look so beautiful you're going to look like a pro and we're going to fill them with all different fun toppings this one we're going to do caramel hot chocolate and marshmallows of course so when we were watching all of these fun videos my 13 year old was trying to get me to make these in the beginning of december but i was busy making gingerbread houses and cookies so she was trying to get me to make these hot chocolate bombs i said all right we'll come up with some different fun flavors so i mean there are a ton endless possibilities you can do s'mores you could do crushed cookies if you wanted a cookie uh you could do peppermint we're not really peppermint people but i've seen lots of people do um peppermint inside the bomb and then also outside on the decorating it right now once valentine's coming we're going to be doing fun sprinkles for valentine's day the funniest one that i saw that i actually would love to do for somebody but i don't know anybody pregnant uh i've seen a gender reveal hot chocolate balm where they add the glitter inside pink or blue and then when you pour the milk over it it will tell you if you're having a boy or a girl i thought that one was a pretty funny one so these are all ready they look great just checking the sides and i'm gonna put this one right in the fridge and we're gonna go grab our other ones so now that these have set and it only took a few minutes in the fridge or you could pop them in the freezer i've asked christina to come help me excited we're going to fill these with different toppings for all of them so we're gonna just easily pop these out see that look at that nice smooth okay we'll put this down pop these out and you see how nice the back sets so when we decorate them they are gonna look great so the great thing about this is that if the edges are not perfect don't worry when we seal them on a pan we'll be able to smooth those out so look at that so look how pretty that marble effect is so if you have different color melting chocolates maybe if you had hot pink or pink blue and you were doing a birthday event you can use a splatter effect or the marble effect to make those so these are all ready for us to fill and you know when we're doing a lot of birthday parties especially now when you're trying to do smaller gatherings and trying to come up with an activity for kids to do a lot of people will do make your own cupcake station or decorate cakes or you can make pizza all those fun things why not to make your own hot chocolate bombs you can get these shells ready ahead of time and when the kids arrive you can have them set with all your different hot chocolates uh with all your different toppings and then let them fill their own hot chocolate balm [Music] so now that we're ready to fill them when you're making regular hot chocolate with just milk usually i'll put a couple teaspoons of the hot chocolate mix to melt into the milk but because the shell itself is already made of chocolate remember that you don't want to make it too sweet and when you're picking toppings think about toppings that will melt also in the hot milk so for these three we're gonna put hot fudge at the bottom just a little bit do you want to do that okay oh a little bit there and a little bit there and then you're gonna put a teaspoon of the hot chocolate mix great one more and then of course we can't forget our marshmallows and then we're gonna fill the rest with our mini marshmallows got that great so then these three are gonna be our lids to make them into a ball so we're going to leave those empty because we're going to sear them on a hot pan which i'll show you in a minute put a little bit more let's just fill them up the next three so those are our hot fudge ones those are good now these are our tops and then these three we're going to put salted caramel which is my favorite so put a little caramel i just made it fudges yours not oreo and oreo okay we'll put a little caramel and we'll put a little bit you're not the favorite it's not the caramel i'll put a little bit of that and then on the top when we sear these we're going to drizzle some more chocolate and then sea salt which will be delicious once it melts into the milk so fill that now christina you want to do these oreo ones so for the oreo one i thought it'd be fun to use white chocolate powder which is pretty easy to get at the supermarket as well put some crushed oreos in the middle a couple in there now you want to put white chocolate and we'll put some more marshmallows on top oh that's okay one more white chocolate there that one's yours that one's yours because it's super sweet so we'll put one in each some marshmallows and now we're ready to sear them so if you were doing this as an activity for kids just let them fill them with all their favorite toppings you could sear them and then let them drizzle the chocolate and the decorations on top so there we go now we're ready to close them to seal these we're going to turn a pan on medium-high heat and we're going to seal we're going to sear this so that we can close our bone it was that easy just to seal that and now i can get finished sealing the rest [Music] now that we have closed our bombs it's time to decorate them so i have our leftover chocolate and white chocolate we're just gonna drizzle on top be creative with this you could just take the spoon drizzle right on top and then these palms that we've closed right here these are the ones that we did hot fudge so i'm gonna do a couple different designs for the top and if you're doing this for a birthday party you can get all different color sprinkles and we can put the sprinkles right on there there we go the big ones are not always easy to stick so we're gonna stick those right on and then for this one i'm gonna use just some chocolate crunchies for the top of that one the next row is the salted caramel so we're gonna drizzle the chocolate and this is where we're gonna add our sea salt for that salted flavor so you could be creative and use the white chocolate on this or again if you have different colored chocolate there's no wrong way to make these i'm just going to take the sea salt and that looks so pretty too that crushed sea salt right on top of that chocolate put that right on there and those are ready now we have our oreo so i'm going to use the white chocolate that we've left over if it gets a little hard you can stick it back in the microwave for 10 15 seconds or again like the double boiler so we're just going to drizzle that on top and we're going to use the crushed oreos to decorate this one you can even add some chocolate if you want since we have it but i'm sure my kids will love it we're going to take our crushed oreos and just crush them right on top of the chocolate or you could take you know an oreo cut the oreo in half and glue it on the top with the different chocolate you could put some sprinkles whatever you want this is all about making it fun for the kids i'm all about making it look beautiful so now that they're ready so i'm going to take these and put them right in the marshmallows to display them it's our salted caramel there we go oreo and now we are ready to set up our amazing hot chocolate bar that's to die for [Music] our hot chocolate station is all set this would be amazing for a birthday party so we have here all of our hot chocolate balms that we've made you'll just put some nice mugs out whipped cream marshmallows i have crushed oreos sprinkles heart-shaped marshmallows that i found and these are chocolate spoons if you wanted a little bit sweeter and i just decorated this with just some peppermint candy i always like using either some edible or fun decor that you already have set up in your station so let's try one out [Music] so we're gonna make one right now christina which one do you want [Music] with the sprinkles okay i'm gonna take this pop this in right into a glass you want it to be at least a nice big size mug at least 10 amps 10 ounces and we're gonna pour the milk right above okay get ready look at that it's breaking up already hold on watch the marshmallows pop out [Laughter] you don't want me to tell you the surprise oh look at that looks awesome you could stir that and i can add some whipped cream to it cream you want to try it out what do you think it's hot but it's good it's good all right well she says it's [Music] delicious [Music] thank you so much for watching we hope you enjoyed today's episode for full instructions on how to make these amazing hot chocolate palms at home visit don't nikkigluckas.com to like and subscribe [Music] seriously [Music] you", "GAhkEsN94YE": "[Music] hello everyone it's finnovation so lately it's been pretty cold outside and the obvious question is the obvious question is do you have any ideas on how to warm up yes we do in this video we're going to be showing you how to make hot chocolate bombs let's get right into it all right these are the materials that you're going to need first off you're going to need one of these molds or some eggs we're going to be using these molds because they make them a little bit more professional but you can also use eggs as your mold we'll show you how to do that later you're going to need a couple tools some melting chocolate we have these here we have some melting white chocolate um that's not necessary some hot chocolate mix and some marshmallows we just have some fun marshmallows here because we thought it'd be fun let's get into it all right now the first thing we're going to do is melt some chocolate so i've got melting chocolate here i suppose you could use normal chocolate but we're going to be using this so we can get a nice glossy finish now we're going to melt this in the microwave doing 30 second increments all right now we are going to um make sure our chocolate is melted when it looks like this it means it's about ready and melted so i'm just going to stir this up and um the bowl will do most of the work for you so you want to make sure that it's not burning so as you can see here it's already getting pretty melty all right now what we're going to do is add some chocolate into our molds so i already have a little bit in this one but what you're going to do is add just a bit and you want to make sure you add more than you think you need because it's always better to have more because you can always take it out but um it gets harder to add it back in so i'm going to be using an ice cream scooper actually to push it up onto the sides and now why i'm not using a spoon is because the spoon isn't that great of a circle and that edge can make it a little bit difficult to do so again i'm just using an ice cream scooper because that makes it a little bit easier for me all right now what you're going to do is get your scraper and scrape off the edge this is so that you can have a nice clean edge and flip it over onto a piece of wax paper and a tray and then you can put this into the freezer all right now um once it is out of the freezer we're gonna take it out remember to be very careful because it is fragile now we are going to be adding a second coat right now just to make sure that everywhere is covered because we don't want any weak points that when we take it out they fall apart so i'm going to do is get some more chocolate and put it on i'm not going to show this on the video but and we're just going to repeat the process that we just did all right now they're ready to take them out so now i am going to start by slowly peeling away and making sure that there is no chocolate stuck to that mold so um once you've got that a little bit just really start slowly kind of peeling it back now this does take a while um and now some of them like we had one here where it's definitely too thin so we are going to go back for a third time and put on some more chocolate because we don't want to take it out and let it crack so if you notice when you're taking it out it has like little tiny lines where it's cracking then you want to make sure that you can put it back so right now all i'm doing is just slowly peeling this back and when it comes out it's beautiful now here's another really great tip you can actually use a cupcake holder um and you can just put flip it upside down and put them on the back so as you can see we've got a couple here that are already done and like i said we're gonna work on that one and we're gonna put that back in and add some more chocolate now we're gonna be showing you how to do this without a mold what you need is an egg and some saran wrap so we've wrapped an egg with some saran wrap and you're gonna dip it in the chocolate now supposedly this works i've actually never done this before so we're gonna give it a try and um let you know if it works so i'm gonna just dip it in i guess and um i guess i'm just gonna take it out and hopefully it should be pretty even and it should be like one side of a chocolate bomb all righty so now there we go we have that and it kind of looks like a little acorn all right so we as you can see we have all these out now we're gonna do is try our eggs like i said i've never tried this before so we're still gonna just give it a little try so i took the egg out and the egg is okay it seems then i guess we're just gonna really carefully try and peel this out oh my gosh it's working i was a little skeptical of this but there you go that's another way to do it i guess right now it's time for the fun part i'm really excited now we are going to be filling our um hot chocolate balms so now make sure that you're only filling one side because the other side you're going to need to heat it up and stick it on so my ingredients that i'm using i'm using some hot fudge some marshmallows some brownie mix which i thought would be fun and some chocolate chips and of course hot chocolate mix so first i'm going to add a good amount of hot chocolate mix because well that's how your hot chocolate is going to be hot chocolate so i'm going to get about two scoops of that mix and then i'm going to add whatever else i want there we go that looks delicious now i'm just going to do that for all of them all right now we are going to be sealing up our chocolate so what we're going to do is we actually have a little bit of extra chocolate on here to serve as a little bit of a glue so that when we do put this on um it has a little bit of extra chocolate to just get glued to like this and we're just going to kind of let it melt just a little and we're going to kind of get some of that glue on there or the chocolate on there to help it stick now this is a pretty quick process you're only going to let it sit there for not too long and then we're gonna switch over and stick it right now we are just quickly trying to stick it on there and make it stick so i think i got it pretty good on my first try and i'm just gonna let it sit all right right now i am just decorating them so you can kind of add like a little drizzle here and make it look really yummy all right now that they're all ready it's time for the taste test so now what we're going to do is we have one of them here and we're going to put it in a mug alrighty now if you get an overhead view here i have some really hot hot milk here that we're going to pour over the top oh it's melting through this is going to be awesome let's get it to melt here oh it's going all the way through here there it goes oh that's awesome went all the way through so now that i've poured out all my milk i'm gonna stir it up all right i have a fork here oh my gosh look at that i see why everyone loves these things that is awesome and there we go that's hot chocolate so i'm going to stir this a little bit more and let's give it a try oh man i'm excited we've worked pretty hard on these all right you can totally do these at home all right delicious wow these hot chocolate balms turned out great hot chocolate fan that reminds me of a joke oh boy what do you call a warm milky drink that was stolen i don't know what hot chocolate i don't get it whatever if you enjoyed this video please leave a like and subscribe down below i also want to give a huge thank you to my aunt julie she gave me the materials that i needed to make this video and she was the inspiration so thank you now bye", "QTwagF7_r3I": "taystee divine solar crud tasty [Music]", "Zxqezqa3XPw": "what's up y'all it's your girl cp and today we're going to be making something that i've seen all over the internet and i think it's pretty awesome it is a hot chocolate balm the hot chocolate balm is a like cinderella chocolate circle and it's filled with a bunch of stuff and i've seen so many different recipes and different methods of doing this i'm going to try out a few different types using a mold i'm going to use this kinder surprise egg for one of those like quick cheap diy versions of doing this and we're gonna use some of these supplies that you see here as well as just some of your regular ways of making hot chocolate so let's go ahead and get started bear with me it's going to probably not be the prettiest thing the first thing we're going to have to do is melt our meltables the instructions say to like do it on defrost or like half your um half your energy and i don't know how to do that so i'm just gonna do one pound to defrost and do that for one minute the bowl is going to be a little hot so just oh that melted pretty good already so i am using a glove this is after one minute of defrost you don't want to overheat it says the instructions so i think i think this is pretty good it's starting to melt down already i can't find like the original like bath bomb molds bath bomb are you calling it bath bomb i couldn't find the original like chocolate chocolate balm molds that's um on like amazon and michael's a lot of them are very expensive or a lot of them are sold out because like i said this is trending so not a lot are available but what i found at target and like the sort of like drinks and fancy glassware area they have this um ice mold for like you're a hard liquor and so it actually comes with like a top so you can make ice cubes um but i'm going to just use the bottom mold here this is going to be a little bit smaller than some of the other ones i've seen but you know making do with the supplies i got and so another method i've seen a paintbrush so i got this washed it up and i'm just gonna go ahead and take the chocolate apply it inside of the circle get it painted on and then some of the things i've seen is that it's really important to get the top because that's going to be like the thinnest piece so you just want to paint that in and make sure you get your edges if you don't have a paint brush another method i've seen is just using the edge of a spoon to sort of circle out the sphere so i'm just gonna do that and just clean up some of these just make it a little bit cleaner okay now we're gonna put this in the fridge to harden what i'm gonna do when i wait for the chocolate to harden is open up the surprise egg and we're going to actually use this as a mold as well that is sweet i want to build this jasmine real quick shiny shimmering splendid we got our surprise egg kinder i don't even think that's what it's called i keep calling it surprising is it actually called surprise egg by the way we have our kinder joy shells that came from a chocolate and i'm going to now just coat the inside similar to the silicone molds yeah this one's gonna be nice because it's it's a little deeper than the ones i originally had i think i like the spoon method better second one the brush is really nice to start and then go through with your spoon afterwards and get those details you missed i'm gonna toss this in the refrigerator and let that cool down our chocolate molds are nice and cooled down already and so i'm gonna try to pop this out and hopefully i won't break it let's see how to pop this out oh be very careful it will crack i know it's cracking ah no rip oh no oh no so they all broke let's let's try that again but let's try to add maybe some pam inside first let's see what happens when you add butter i don't have pam so we're gonna have to make do with butter so i took just a very faint amount i'm just going to rub that into the silicon mode here another thing i realized i was trying to pop out the mole of the chocolate was i think it was too thin so now i'm gonna make it a little thicker i've kind of got a lot in a lot of them now but um the method i've seen they've also like turned it over to let some residual chocolate fall off so also i think i need to cool down my chocolate again it's starting to uh get a little bit difficult to work with well i'm gonna go with this take two so here are our kinder eggs literally i'm just going to try to pull the sides ooh okay this is pulling off much nicer i'm also going significantly slower than the first time when i use the molds oh i feel movement in the bottom i did it ah yeah we got one beautiful looking shell by the way oh my god amazing okay so now we're gonna try the second one gently pull the edges hello i thought i saw you pop out already yay look at that oh my gosh i got my second gel okay cool cool cool so i actually get another one in here so that we could get some more started in case the initial oh these are dr dried up reheat the chocolate and mix it you know what i could i could make do with this let's let's do this i definitely should not have used the chocolate as it was melting it definitely needs to be melty but we're going to give it a try and see what happens when i put this in the fridge and let it harden all the way but it's a little chunky and clunky in there all right let's see if we can get this pop this one out slowly krishna teases us every time i think it's working oh no i cracked another one okay cool cool i might have been able to get two yeah i got one slowly oh yeah there we go ah spotter on this but i did it yay okay so what was different about this one it was thicker so i'm gonna put a lot more in here and give it another go for this mold now i'm just moving it around so for that excess chocolate so that it tries to coat some of the sides i missed without trying to damage it with like a spoon or the paint brush try to get this corner and i'm gonna pop it in the fridge and then i'll be right back since i've already made some in this particular mold while i'm waiting for some of the white molds to uh cool down i actually have some chocolate molds that i'm pretty happy with um the egg mold did way better so i'm just gonna melt down a few and so that i can start packing it i have a little griddle here on the side i'm gonna place it down until i see some of all the edges touch push it down a little bit just get that smooth edge and then pick it up and then place it to the side i'm gonna do that for half the eggs and half the circles and then we'll we'll melt down the tops later so that we can put and close it on some of my circle ones like they've cracked on the side but i think with the meltdown process it'll help even it and so a lot of them cracked on the side because it's kind of thin uh oh i can't pick it up oh no ah ah okay you gotta be a little fast on this okay please i know the circles are so hard to pick up now that we have our shells ready it took it definitely took a lot of trial and error and i think and i started to feel more comfortable for some reason i feel like the white chocolate was able to hold its shape better and pop out of the mold um i don't know if that was just because i've been able to do couple already or the white chocolate probably just holds better than the dark um the cocoa so what i'm going to do now is just put in on the ones i've already pressed down and sort of clean the edges and give them a nice edge that's where i'm going to put the ingredients so you have the ability to make your own cocoa basically how you want to do it if you don't have sort of this ready mix cocoa i'm going to take my swiss miss mix and i'm going to take for the egg shaped ones it's about a teaspoon and a half and then in the smaller egg ones i'm just going to do one teaspoon so now i'm just gonna go through and decorate some sprinkles maybe some snowflakes crushed candy canes star sprinkles and of course add your marshmallows just decorate how you want to do this we're going to add marshmallows to all of them sort of stack them up high like we have here some of these smaller ones it's going to be really hard but you'll make work now that you have all of your shells with your marshmallows it's time to cover up what i'm going to do is use this to melt the covers and then place it right on top so i'm going to take an egg oopsies melt it is melted pick it up and place it on top of this egg try to seal it oh it doesn't match shapes i'm going to do is just sort of run it through the heat to melt it together i'll see some of the pieces are coming out careful okay it's a terrible idea that i can't pick it up okay be fast to cover oh no it doesn't fit i know it doesn't work okay this isn't working so we're gonna need another plan and what i'm going to do is grab more chocolate okay so i melted more chocolate i'm gonna take back the shell because that clearly did not work then i'm going to re-dip this into my new melted chocolate oh now it's stuck pick it up oh god please oh no it's everywhere an old small bag okay just gonna try to fuse that with this bottom one no all right that's not gonna work we're gonna dip it into this oh my gosh this is terrifying oh no oh god it seems so promising i've dropped that everywhere okay let me wash i'm going to try one that perhaps wasn't already on something so let's start with a fresh topper dip it in okay it's coated throw it on top of the other side ooh that was actually pretty good wow okay so i'm gonna do just a little bit and then i'm going to take this and roll it in some peppermint and then i'm also going to roll it in some of the sprinkles really take away some of that oh that is pretty yay it took away the imperfections and it made it beautiful look at this we did one my battery's about to die we tried to salvage these pieces oh no oh geez oh no oh this one's lost all it's philly that's that one's gone forever oh that one broke oh no here's the destruction i've made so far this one came out oopsies this one came out very nice i'm very happy that that in the outcome i have melted chocolate i'm going to start off with the smaller one so i got my cap dip it in chocolate the melted chocolate just rolled around so it has some chocolate take this place it over grab the ball oh that one has no edge oh oh oh oh okay so it's kind of closed take it roll inside this chocolate okay get that closed and then i'm going to roll it ah that's not too bad okay now we're going to do the eggs let's start oh this is our nicest shell that we've made look at that wow that's the nicest one nice edge too and i wasn't even pressed down all right let's get our egg coated dip swirled and place it on this wow look at that get that to press down oh that's a nice jump okay similar i'm actually going to take my spoon this time and then there's this one's a little bit bigger i'm going to just rub chocolate on the side okay i'm going to dip this one here okay it's cool it's not bad place that down let that harden wow okay not too bad look we have one two three four five six pretty good looking ones and then this one is just extremely filled and this one just broke on me but other than that these ones look so good i could do little dots here star to here all right y'all it's been like three hours since i started filming this video i'm so tired here is the aftermath of all of the bombs obviously this one's a nice one these are nice this one's actually not too bad that one was a disaster that was the very first one i tried to make now actually this egg was the first one i tried to make and it just that i could not salvage that and then this one just broke on me you know adding the chocolate on the side and putting decorations i think really comes in clutch especially if you're new to making this you can't necessarily get your them to close quite easily this design is super cute i love it this one is my peppermint one and i put a little uh candy cane on the outside just because it was starting to i was starting to hold it too much and it started melting in the middle so i like that one too and this one was the first white one i did that came out really nicely and so don't look at the bottom but like this one is a peppermint inside and a same concept it was a circle and i put a little bit more glitter and peppermint on the outside so that came out really nice i would say the difficulty in this is rather high especially if you don't really have i guess like the regular mold i have no idea what it's like to use a you know the regular mold that they recommend there's a few things already i could come off from this particular video i made so the smaller ones when i said i use like the ice the one that makes the sphere ice cubes so that one is a bit too small so that's what this made here and i feel like because of that i wasn't able to get as much of the hot cocoa mix inside of the sphere therefore i think when i make the hot chocolate i'm gonna have to use about two so if you end up going this route i'm just keep that in mind um because if you put too much of the hot cocoa mix then you won't be able to add any of the other parts inside and i think it kind of ruins defined when you can't add like marshmallows and things like that but one thing that i think is super clutch in this situation and it's super super affordable is using the kinder surprise egg let me see if it's so funny this right here was the real mvp this came in hella clutch like this cost me what a dollar fifty i got chocolate chocolate out of it and i got a cool toy this was just so much easier to work with in terms of like being able to separate it from the mold and then you know for only a dollar fifty i was able to make so many of these cute egg shaped ones and sure it's on a bomb but it still has the same concept there's still there's a little shaking in there i think this is still gonna be really exciting and and i think if i had to recommend this to anyone who's new like myself this was amazing especially with not being able to find the supplies i love this get try this for your first time the kinder surprise egg i keep calling it surprising kinder joy it comes in this shape it's like a you see it usually at like when you're checking out at like a target or a safe way or something it's like you know how they have the candy aisle get it hella clutch another thing i found interesting was i'm not just because i was already doing it you know x amount of times but i felt like the white chocolate was able to hold better and stay melted longer than the dark uh the cocoa um i feel like the cocoa it was definitely a lot more finicky it broke a lot more compared to the white chocolate and i felt like it hardened faster than when i was going through the process so i'm not sure if that just was a happen stance or if it actually is something with white chocolate but that was just something that i came across because it's late i am going to just try smalling so we're going to try this one right here oh my gosh hello i know i think it's too thick oh there we go ah wow [Music] i was supposed to be real disappointed like i was getting ready to turn the camera up to be like but it did it yay all right well let's mix it very nice chocolatey color so i guess i would put enough cocoa i put enough of the instant hot chocolate in there that's really good you still see the marshmallows floating so that's really fun let's try oh yeah mmm [Music] all right i'm gonna try it tomorrow we're gonna pour milk over one of them okay so the last one we did was hella anticlimactic so what we're going to do is take this and then pour it inside reverse and see what happens jesus oh amazing oh that looked cool at least all the marshmallows rose than that one because there's a lot oh that's a lot of chocolate um this is now my second chocolate hot chocolate balm i've made just taking the third i made one for jason too and all three i could say is very anti-climactic i mean also that this one was hella bad poor don't judge me um let's try it that one's gonna be super sweet when all that chocolate melts down i think the bigger size one could probably do with less of a hot chocolate mix because the chocolate is going to melt down so like what's happening now and it's pretty sweet i do like that i was able to see the marshmallows on top no sad i didn't see any of like the candy cane and the candy cane i put on top i'm just like i think just disintegrated already you kind of see a little bit of the bottom i wish you could see like the sprinkles and stuff i would say this is just definitely prosthetics like it looks cute but maybe these smaller ones now i would just stick to making irregular hot chocolate all right y'all see you next time [Music] you", "uqKUvlBP2_E": "today we're making bombs hot chocolate bombs so we're gonna get started by melting some of the candy melts here these are chocolate flavored candy melts which means you don't have to temper chocolate if you do want to use real chocolate i would just look up some videos on how to temper chocolate i do that all by feel so it's a little hard on a video but this way it's really easy we just use the candy melts and you don't have to worry about tempering so i've got some of the chocolate flavored ones here you could also use different colors um like the white ones or they have like every color of the rainbow if you want fun colored hot chocolate bombs uh so i'm gonna get these melting in the microwave about 10 second intervals make sure you stir them after each 10 seconds so it doesn't burn uh and then we'll get to making our little bombs all right our chocolate is melting so we gotta get our molds ready so if you watch other videos and stuff they have silicone molds but who has one of those in their house and not me so i just went to the dollar store and i got these like photo frame ornaments and they open up um in half which is perfect they do have a little bit of an edge on it but we'll just cover it with sprinkles it's fine no one will ever know um so i'm gonna use that as a mold so any kind of uh decorative ornament that you can open in half should work pretty good for this um especially this cheap one i found at the dollar store so i'm going to check on my chocolate and then we'll get to filling them all right so our candy melt chocolate's all melted here looking great so we've got our ornaments all opened up and cleaned and dry dry is very important so i'm just gonna fill up one side there's two parts to this with some chocolate a few scoops of chocolate probably around that much that's probably good and then put the lid on to it and then shake it around until your whole ornament is all covered so this part's empty keep shaking and this helps get it a nice even kind of coating on the outside so it'll take me a minute and then i'll open it up all right so you can see it's all covered in chocolate so we're just gonna open it up [Music] um and then i'm gonna put it on a parchment lined baking tray upside down so it doesn't have all the chocolate dripping to the middle it's going to drip out to the edges and then i'm going to fill the rest of them and we'll pop this into the freezer all right so all of our little ornament halves are covered in chocolate so i'm going to pop this into the freezer for about 15 minutes all right our chocolate's set it's been in the freezer for about 15 minutes um i will warn you this is the trickiest part and you're gonna break some it happens but that's the best part of chocolate you can just re-melt it down refill them pop them back in the freezer and you're good to go i definitely had some that broke um and i've done this already two times uh another day to try it out um but the best way to figure it out how to do it is um you get your little chocolate ball and give it a tap on to a cutting board or your counter and that'll kind of loosen it up and then you should be able to pull it out with your hands very carefully like i said a little tricky um but i did get it out so then it should slide out there and don't worry about these like gaps at the end um or if it's jaggedy that's fine and then i just got a muffin tray here so i'm just gonna put it in there because it sits real nice and then we can fill it with their hot chocolate so i'm gonna empty out the rest of my little molds here get them all lined up in here and then we'll start filling amazing i got all my little chocolate balls out here and i have fives total so ten halves so i've just divided it in half so i don't fill them all by mistake so then on one half of your ornament uh you're gonna put two tablespoons of hot chocolate powder as per the directions on the hot chocolate mix so if you like it more chocolatey you can add more if you like it less add less so i'm gonna fill that into all five of my little halves all our hot chocolate mix is in so now we want to add marshmallows so you just want to add a little pile of marshmallows and remember it's gonna have a full dome over top so it can be like popping out of it that way it will kind of fill up that other half and you can also add like sprinkles or you could add some other flavors maybe like um an after eight chocolate kind of broken up for mint chocolate or some candy canes or um even a little pinch of instant coffee for like a mocha flavor so many options all right this looks good so then we're going to get our other half stuck on top okay so to stick the lid on i've got a frying pan here i've just heated up with nothing on it um so it's hot but not probably like roasting hot i was just on for like two minutes um but chocolate melts at body temperature so it needs to be hotter than that so you want to grab a top piece of your chocolate and just lightly put it onto here and it's going to start melting and then you want to stick it on to your ball and then you'll follow through with the rest of them all right so they're all stuck together you can see some of them came together really nicely and then others might have a little gap or two on the side so i've just melted down my broken chocolate base and just using my finger oh my gosh i just got coco everywhere i'm just going to go around the edge and kind of smear on a nice little seal with my finger and don't worry if it's not too pretty because we're going to add sprinkles and decorations so we'll cover it up so i'm just filling in any of these gaps just to make sure it's nice and sealed in there all right our hot chocolate bombs are looking awesome they're all sealed up there um and like i said don't worry if it's not the like prettiest thing on the edge that's okay because we're gonna be looking at it from the top and on top we're gonna put sprinkles so i've melted some white candy melts here and i just put it into a ziploc bag and then i cut the end off so i'm gonna drizzle it on top give it some nice fancy lines or you could even be more fancy and make like snowflakes or something nice squiggle and then of course holiday sprinkles right on top and just make sure you sprinkle them on while it's uh not set yet so cute so i'm gonna decorate the rest of these and then we can melt them all right our hot chocolate bombs are all finished up you can see here they look so great such a good present you can just put a little cellophane bag it's a great stocking stuffer or you could get them a fancy mug and put it inside and then cover that in cellophane so many options such a nice gift that you made yourself easy a little tricky to get out the molds but still work um and now we're gonna make a hot chocolate out of it delicious see you next week", "kQhBC360Fno": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] two [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

sea rad's baby yoda territory home of the child merchandise news reviews diys and more so if you love baby yoda as much as we do make sure to subscribe to our channel and turn on that notification bell so you don't miss seeing us in the future today i've got baby yoda sweets i've got two new items that i got recently from amazon one is a little baby yoda with sweets and one is a baby yoda that actually is sweet all baby odors are sweet right guys yeah all right the first item that i got is this really super cool mandalorian the child holiday milk chocolate with marshmallow it's got a little sweet surprise inside and guys i'm gonna be honest with you when i ordered this and saw that i thought it had a cute little plushie inside but of course now looking at it reading the box it looks like it's just going to be a baby yoda marshmallow like a little baby yoda peep maybe go to peeps yes guys peeps are you are you team peep or not let me know in the comments me i love peeps sorry i'll get a little bit of crank i could go on and on about peeps but i won't so i'm going to actually open this up try out the chocolate let you know how it tastes and we're going to see what that little baby yoda marshmallow looks like inside the only problem is when you get things from amazon is guys the box was all kinds of ripped and banged up but it's okay because i'm gonna be eating this chocolate anyway and not saving the box so it's not really a big deal on this item i don't know if you can hear that or not guys but it sounds like that marshmallow inside's really hard but here is the cute little wrapper it's a little baby yoda in the pod and it's got the little landscape on it as well and actually if you turn it around on the back you can kind of see it there it does have the razor crest in the background but i'm gonna try to open this carefully and maintain the wrapper and let's see how well that goes that actually didn't go too bad the wrapper got maintained so yep got the little razor crest in the background there like i thought but inside on the chocolate itself there is no baby yoda imprint it's just pure chocolate kind of melted together and again it's got that marshmallow inside but let's crack it open and give this chocolate a taste it cracked in half really easy so that's super cool glad i didn't have to try to force it open too bad now as far as the taste of the chocolate goes it's not the best chocolate that i've ever had but it's not dollar store chocolate either guys do you ever get that dollar store chocolate and you eat it it's like you're eating like wax well now this actually melted in my mouth as i was eating it so that is a sign that it is a higher quality chocolate so i'm glad on that because i love chocolate and i'm gonna eat that whole ball eventually probably within a day not even sorry and i know you guys want to see the little marshmallow that was inside there is the little marshmallow complete with melted chocolate on them guys it's been up near the triple digits here for the last week so i'm actually really surprised that the ball came in one piece and wasn't completely melted so yay for that but so yeah he's got a little schmutzy chocolate on his face but that's okay i'm kind of squishing him around to feel them he's got sugar on the outside like a peep does but i don't think he's like that same peep consistency he's really thin i thought it was going to be a thicker and a full bodied baby yoda in there but it's not it's just this little marshmallowy head so i took a tiny little bite off the bottom there just so i could let you guys know how the marshmallow is and if it is like peeps and marshmallows really hard and rubbery so i'm probably not even gonna eat that maybe i'll try to figure out a way to preserve it anybody know how to preserve peeps or marshmallows let me know i'd really be interested to see if there's a way to do that so as i mentioned i got this through amazon i'm sure it's probably coming out in stores but i wanted to grab one just to see how it was and do a little review for you guys to give you a heads up and i paid i think like ten dollars for it i'm sure it'll be a lot less than that when it does hit actual stores or if it has hit actual stores already i know there's also an advent calendar out there and i saw a pack of those it was like a two pack for like 15 bucks on amazon and then i did some research and i found that big lots has them for two dollars so i'll be hitting a big lots in the near future hopefully and be able to find one so i held off on that one but these little holiday gift ball chocolate things i have not seen in any stores on any websites other than amazon yet so if you come across one in the store let me know in the comments and let me know how much that you saw it there for so keeping in mind the price that i paid for it and the marshmallow quality and the chocolate quality on a scale of totally bad to totally red i'm gonna kind of put this one in the middle guys yeah the wrapper's cute but it's really thin and rips really easy when you open it i kept it mostly in one piece but i didn't kind of gash a whole corner out of it the marshmallows almost like stale not like even the good peeps stale kind of way so a little hard little chewy the chocolate was the best part even though it was just a chocolate ball and there was no baby yoda imprinted on the chocolate itself now the other sweet little baby yoda item i got was this cute little plush that comes with little yoda head candy how cute is he guys now i got him on amazon as well for the plush and the candy it was about twelve dollars but he is a super little cutie there look guys he's got feeties he's got weird little feeties but he's got feeties and he's got this cute little adorable face now the tag on him and the description on him when i got him it was just that it was a little child plush with candy characters they're little yoda heads they come in different colors and it's actually a hard candy so let me try one of these real quick see what kind of candy it is since it did not say in the description so these are actually hard little kind of sour fruity candies i like these they kind of remind me of sprees do they still make those i'm not sure but they're good i like them of course the cute little plush that comes with it he's a little adorable little guy and i love him too now i actually had an idea for this little guy instead of just having another little plush laying around i had an idea to modify him to make him like the shoulder plush i haven't done it yet but i have the stuff to do it but i'll just tell you how to do it now instead of making a whole video on that guys but i'm just going to take a magnet and glue it to his butt there and then of course i've got the shoulder plush so i can just use the magnet group right on top of that and it can be little baby yoda on your shoulder just like this little baby yoda on your shoulder and if you don't have the little metal thing any tiny little thin piece of metal will do or another magnet to stick it on there just so it sticks together and doesn't flop around too much he's a little bit bigger but he's about the same height and i think that would work out really well and be really super cute and it's a cute way to modify this little plushie and if you can't get the shoulder plush if they've sold out or if you want a less expensive option there you go this little guy right here he was about 12 on amazon this guy's about 20 and i've seen him even on ebay and stuff up to 30 and above so yep or you can have two so on a scale of totally bad to totally rad i think this guy's totally rad i don't know what do you guys think let me know so two baby yoda sweet items today one not so totally rad and one that is totally rad i still think both items would make awesome stocking stuffers especially if you have a baby yoda lover in your life or if you're a baby yoda lover just buy yourself a gift do it buy yourself a gift once in a while guys splurge make yourself happy but anyway thank you so much for watching and if you like this video make sure to give it a thumbs up and if you want to see more awesome baby yoda things and totally rad things in the future make sure to subscribe to our channel and turn on that notification bell so you don't miss seeing us and i guess there's only one thing left to say right little dude we'll see you later bye guys", "gVKw8yW8Efk": "hello everyone and welcome back into my kitchen i interrupt or regularly schedule soup and salad saturday to do this special for valentine's day it is so cold here in texas i am freezing so i have to wear my little fluffy hat all right come on let's go and make these strawberries all right so here's what we're working with today i have a dozen strawberries that i've washed and you really want to dry them very very well i also have some blueberries here same thing washed and dry them very well we're gonna make some blueberry clusters with the leftover chocolate that we have from our strawberries so someone asked me to actually make a sugar-free or low-carb ones so that's what we'll be doing today and i bought a few of the brands that are available to me here you may have different ones where you live but this is hershey's sugar-free chocolate chips i've used this several times it's very good there's no off-putting taste that i can detect and it says here that one tablespoon is 70 calories nine carbs but of those carbs seven of those are sugar alcohols and one is uh fiber so in actuality all you're getting is one net carb so if you're doing keto or low carb that's that another option that you have is this white chocolate and this is by lily's 55 calories and nine carbs but again we're subtracting the fiber and the erythritol which is a sugar alcohol so that leaves us with three and three six three net carbs for 26 chips that's not bad all right and the one i'm using today is lilly's semi-sweet baking chips i think the macros are the same for the last one actually it's 50 calories and that's for 30 chips the carbs is nine total three erythritol and four fiber so four four five six seven so you get two net carbs for 30 chips okay all right all right on to the fun stuff so i have one cup here of the lilies chocolate chips it smells yummy and what i have here is some um coconut oil and i'm gonna put a tablespoon and a half in here so this is a half a tablespoon measure one two three so that's a tablespoon and a half and then what you want to do is put it in your microwave or you could use a double boiler if you want but it that's a lot more trouble i in my opinion so put it in your microwave and every 30 seconds pull it out give it a stir pull it out give it a stir until it's melted so after just 30 seconds look at this it's melting nicely so i'm gonna give it a good mix and back in the microwave we go all right so after 30 more seconds look at this we're completely melted and we're ready to dip our strawberries and what i have here i'm gonna make some of them a little bit fancy schmancy i have um some coconut desiccated coconut that i threw in my little bullet to make it into little tiny pieces so to look like snow i also have here some macadamia nuts that i chopped up so let's go ahead and start dipping our little strawberries and it's actually very simple to do you just grab them by their little leaves see and dunk them in your chocolate pull them out [Music] and see they're all covered nicely onto your baking sheet that i lined with um i lined it with parchment paper you could use a silicone mat also so again in we go pull them out and go over here on my mat and the oil that we put in there is going to make this have a really nice glow and sheen look at that all right i'm gonna go ahead and continue dipping these actually before i do that let me just sprinkle some coconut on this one here so you can see and some macadamias on that one all right and i'll go ahead and do the rest and come right back all right so remember i said we were going to see we have leftover chocolate makes no sense wasting that so in we go with some blueberries and we're just going to toss this up and make little clusters with it alrighty like so can you see that and i make sure you can see it right making our little blueberry clusters [Music] look at that see make use of everything and you can also do this with like different kinds of nuts peanuts cashews almonds anything you want all right and if you start working with this and your chocolate starts getting kind of hot and difficult to work with pop it back in the microwave i have a few more blueberries and just a little more chocolate so we're in business all right i'm gonna try to get a little fancy i just melted a tiny bit of the white chocolate and see if i can get a drizzle on these well not quite a drizzle yeah that experiment didn't go as planned let's put a little drizzle on our blueberries well we tried okay so now that or now that all strawberries um where we have them all done what you want to do is put it in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes but it's actually 20 degrees outside so i'm going to put it outside on the back porch for 10 minutes and bring it back in let me give you a little glimpse of what's going on here in texas look at the porch every single thing is frozen ice everywhere everywhere and here are little strawberries crazy crazy weather all right here are our strawberries and our blueberry clusters all right let me taste one for you all right here is my strawberry you can see it's coated nicely down the hatch check that out it has a really nice ratio of chocolate on the outside very decadent and it's low in carbs no added sugar what's not to like guys thank you so much for coming back into my kitchen i sincerely appreciate your love and your support and i look forward to coming back next time when i promise to make another delicious recipe bye", "3-qloaWphpo": "guys welcome back to the elizardos today we are going to make the most cutest snowman hot chocolate bombs you guys have ever seen

bags or sandwich sandwich bags of course your melting balls and your moat and so we are going to get started on our beautiful little snowmans you're going to want to melt your white chocolate first because we're going to get our little bombs ready so we're going to go ahead and put them in our molds i know that looks like a lot but it's okay because we can always take out i just want to make sure that it's all coated nice and evenly and then of course you're going to want to move your chocolate all the way around make sure you get every corner okay so now that you have already put all your chocolate in your bums you're going to go ahead and freeze them or put them in your refrigerator for five minutes so we're gonna do that and we'll be right back okay guys so i left them in the refrigerator for about five minutes and they're already really hard and that's what you want so now what we're gonna do is i'm gonna get my parchment paper and i'm gonna take these out very gently see okay so what i'm gonna do now is i'm gonna go ahead and melt the domes that are gonna be my bottom it's just to even out the little um the little circle on the top [Music] now i'm going to go ahead and put my um my cocoa powder inside of here i'm going to do half in each [Music] you know what i went ahead and used one packet for all three put the little bitty marshmallows inside of there so just to give it an extra pizzazz [Music] and we're going to go ahead and it again and we're going to put it on the top of our dome and we're going to close them up [Music] it's okay if you have little cracks like that because we have extra chocolate and we're gonna go ahead and just fill in those little holes right there and you're gonna do that to all three of your domes so you're gonna put them inside of your little tin like this we're gonna put a little bit of um marshmallow puff inside of the little bowl i'm gonna dye it orange [Music] because this is gonna be for the nose [Music] we're gonna leave that there now what we're gonna do is we're gonna get our marshmallows and you're gonna do three of them because you have three bombs of course and what we're gonna do is we're gonna put some of the white chocolate on the bottom of the marshmallow because this is going to be our glue [Music] our black sparkle gel or whatever you're going to use for your eyes and we're going to do one eye two eyes and in the mouth and you're going to do that to all three of your chocolate molds with your little fluff that you made i'm gonna get a little um toothpick and i'm gonna pick some up and i'm gonna make the nose there you go now what we're going to do is we're going to get the chocolate that we have left over first well you know what yeah let me put the chocolate on the top of the head and then i'm going to get another toothpick and i'm going to move it around because this is going to be for the hat so squares that we made were the top hat and i'm going to put it on but what i'm going to do is i'm going to get a another toothpick oh you know what i don't need it yeah as long as it's still squishy but you should have started with the last one i'm gonna put the scarf yes so i'm gonna get the green candy milk [Music] and i'm going to cut the little hole on [Music] it [Music] and then i'm going to draw around the [Music] neck [Music] and i'm going to do the same thing with the red i'm going to do one red one [Music] [Music] [Music] so i mean they could be a little bit better but it was my first time making them so i don't think i did that bad i'm your husband okay guys so there you have it there's our three little snowmans there was some trouble that we had making them the good thing is is that it's chocolate everything's candy chocolate so you can kind of go around and kind of like take care of your imperfections and stuff like that and we really hope you guys enjoyed this video and we'll see you guys tomorrow bye [Music]", "IV-VhEArAlQ": "hey y'all welcome to my halloween theme hot chocolate balms monster style here's my version if you're on a budget so to speak i use making mold chocolate vanilla flavored purple color i place my chocolate candy molds in a bowl i did not use the whole bag because i'm not going to make that mini chocolate balm so i just didn't eat that much then i placed it in the microwave for about 30 seconds to kind of get the ball rolling in the melting process once i realized okay it needs a little more time i place it in the microwave for another 30 seconds so a total of one minute and then i finally got the chocolate to melt to the desire of my heart however i'm having difficulty with my chocolate being nice and smooth kind of like water so i placed one tablespoon of cocoa powder in there because i read that word it didn't work for me then i tried to put some shortening in there like a little tablespoon of shortening to see if that will help still didn't work for me so i said forget it so i just kept going and then i placed my chocolate in my silicone cupcake molds silicone molds are perfect for this if you don't want to go to amazon and buy those little you know oval shapes you can just use what you have so that's what i did place the chocolate in there and i took a spoon and tried to smooth it out as best as i could because it wasn't to the consistency that i liked but i said i'm just going to work with what i had so i did that then i was able to not put it in the freezer because it was able to take shape for about 10 minutes it was real quick got my little smooth surface there and i got preparing my or started to prepare my insides put a tablespoon of cocoa powder unsweetened put some peppermint in there because i love hot chocolate and peppermints then i said oh i have some caramel sauce so i decided to put some caramel sauce in there as well with a pinch of sugar i love sweet stuff so this was perfect for me and then once i realized okay i'm just going to stop and not add anything else on the inside i took my leftover chocolate melted it and then placed my other half my top in there and then place that on top of my other half for my monster and i think they turned out really cute and i was just excited that i was able to get it done so with that being said it was time to get my mug i found about an eight to twelve ounce mug so to speak and then i was able to fit my cupcake monster chocolate balm in the mug and then instead of using regular milk i wanted to use some almond coconut cream milk and then i boiled it on the stove and then i said it's time to melt the chocolate so i did not fill it all the way place my warm almond milk and here's what happened once again you can use marshmallows i don't like marshmallows but you can adapt it to your liking then i continued to pour fill up my mug and stirred and this was absolutely delicious i enjoyed it so once again um it's all about adapting to what you have and realizing that you have everything you need if you just look most times if not then just make it do what it do so that being said i just wanted to show you my method what worked for me i didn't have to put it in the freezer i didn't have to go and use certain types of cocoa and chocolate i just made it work and it was super cool add in my whipped cream and there you have it enjoy your monster hot chocolate bombs", "hrc7tLGgaI8": "what's up you

enjoying time with your family with your loved ones it was a crazy year this year christmas was different for a lot of people so i hope you guys all had a great time now i'm really excited for this video because this has been like my obsession for this whole past two months i've seen these all over social media and i've actually ordered some a couple months ago and i think they're so neat a couple weeks ago sorry and i think they are so neat and that they're called choco bombs right what are they called choco bombs hot choco cocoa bombs i'm going to be making some hot cocoa bombs now this is going to be my own twist and i'm going to be doing them of strawberry nesquik if you guys know nesquik bomb og it takes me back to my childhood um i just love strawberry next quick sharper anything anything is just delicious so i said i'm gonna give these a try and make my own twist and attempt to make some i don't know if you call them cocoa because it's not cocoa but maybe we'll call them strawberry bombs i'm not sure but um i have some ingredients here that i'm going to tell you guys what i'm going to be using again this is my first attempt at making these i am not a professional baker so if i'm doing these steps wrong i'm sorry don't kill me in the comments but let me tell you guys what i have now i have some strawberry nesquik you guys get these at any grocery store i have some mini marshmallows they're going to be used to be stuffed inside the actual balm itself i have some white chocolate and this is going to be my actual shell for the balm and then to glaze or to decorate on top i have these red candy melts which is pretty much like it looks it says vanilla flavored i guess it's similar to just chocolate and you could use it for a dip drizzle and definitely use it as a drizzle for my uh bond and then here are the actual molds looks like they're made of silicone now these are uh sold out everywhere and you know a lot of people have been making these cocoa bombs this year so i want to give a special shout out to mp sweets which is lucy's sister she let me borrow some of her stuff so i really appreciate it i do have a bowl here this is where i'm going to be putting my white chocolate i have a spoon which i'm going to be using to put the white chocolate into the mold and then i have this clear ziploc bag that i'm going to be using as a way to just put in my red drizzle so i could just drizzle onto my bombs and i also have these decorative i don't know if you call these sprinkles but they're just these little star-shaped colorful uh decorative things that you could put on top of the bombs for extra decoration uh yeah and that's pretty much it so i'm gonna be attempting to make these um i'm gonna walk you guys through all the steps and at the end we'll see how they come out cool and then once again if you guys enjoy this video don't forget to give this a big thumbs up okay guys so the first step is gonna be to uh melt my white chocolate here for my actual shell now you could do these two different ways you could put it in the microwave and mount the chocolate and just kind of stir it or if you get some hot water and then you i'm gonna get this bowl and put it on top of my boiling hot water now this is going to be just creating a really really hot bowl now i'm going to throw these in here and i read that you do have to be really quick okay so this mouth's super fast and you just get a spoon or spatula whatever you want to use and you just make sure you mix it [Music] guys we have our melted chocolate here um as you guys saw we just stirred it stirred it you have to be really quick because this will get hard now i'm just going to grab a spoon and i'm going to go ahead and just place this on the outside of these little molds and again you're not filling it up you're just kind of spreading it on the outside part so that you create a mold any excess that you have you want to take it out and you want to make sure that every part is covered now i'm not exactly sure how much you have to put in here but i'm just going to kind of keep turning it with the spoon here and make sure there's no spaces because that might cause a hole in my mold [Music] all right i think let's see [Music] i know but i feel like it has enough chocolate how does that look can you guys see that [Music] i'm gonna add a little bit more chocolate literally hardly anything because it looks like one side may need a little bit more i don't want these to come out super thin if not they might break all right gonna grab some more this is kind of messy [Music] there you go now i don't know if this is white chocolate or if it's vanilla flavored but it looks like a white chocolate so i hope it tastes pretty decent with the strawberry i've seen people do different colors of these so you could do i've seen them called grinch grinch balms and you could add some food coloring make them turn green i've seen red and they do sell the red chocolate [Music] already all right guys we are in the last one now this mold only has um six so i could get three chocolate bombs out of this i don't know if i should call them chocolate bombs maybe they're nesquik bombs choco no it's not choco me no because choco meal is chocolate you know and you know there's no real i don't think there's like any real technique with this you just gotta use your spoon to you know mix around and make sure that every part of the silicone does have a white chocolate in it and then with your spoon you just fill it out and remember you're not feeling like filling it up because then you don't have you have to leave some hollow space so that you um you could put stuff it with other stuff now i'm gonna take out a little bit of chocolate from this one it has a lot now i'm removing a little bit of the chocolate from here because it looks like it's sat down and it's getting a little messy [Music] all right perfect i'm gonna give this a couple taps just so that all the chocolate sits in here okay cool um i'm gonna show you guys what this looks like i don't know if you guys could see that but they're not filled up again i just used my spoon to kind of wrap it all around the outer part of the shell i'm gonna go ahead and pop these babies into the fridge i mean you could probably put them in there for anywhere between five to ten minutes shouldn't take that long to harden and then we're going to go ahead and bring them out and i'll show you guys what it looks like when we take them out of these showers cool so next i need to grab a plate and i need to heat it up now you can do this two ways you can pop it in the microwave and warm up the plate that way or just the same way i melted my chocolate i'm gonna boil some water it's been boiling for the past three four minutes and i'm gonna put the plate on top now be very careful because this will get really warm so i have my little glove things here to grab it after but i pretty much just want to get the plate really warm and this is going to be able to melt our chocolate bond outing so it serves as glue and i'm going to show you guys what that looks like in just a bit all right guys i brought my chocolate bombs that were um in the freezer or the shelves and literally only took like five minutes i actually put them in the freezer so it kind of sped up the process a little bit now i have my hot plate here it's pretty warm and what i'm going to do is i'm just going to take the shells off of the silicone and you want to make sure you get use the correct molds because silicone doesn't stick and literally just comes right off as you guys can see it looks just like this it's a beautiful white shell i'm gonna place them in here and i hope i don't break any of these now you guys i may be sounding like i've made these before and i honestly haven't but i've been watching youtube videos of other people making them so i could at least learn some of the steps so again this is my first try i'm also going to do them a little bit different i've never really actually baked or made anything kind of crafty in the kitchen besides just cooking so this is pretty cool all right so now i'm gonna this is still pretty warm um what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna stuff one side with a couple of spoons probably just one teaspoon of this strawberry choco meal [Music] all right i'm probably doing about half of it because i don't want them to be too sweet i hate when things are really sweet so probably just doing maybe one three fourths of a teaspoon of that i'm gonna get a couple marshmallows and put them in here [Music] just a little pinch of marshmallows [Music] all right and you guys can see looks like that can you guys see that all right cool now these are pretty small so i feel like they're like minis or something let's see if this melts yes it's melting and then this should act again like glue and you should just be able to kind of stick these on and then you just gently push them down together and looks like they are maybe a little bit sensitive so you want to make sure that you don't push it down too hard but any of the excess chocolate it will act as glue so i'm just kind of spreading it around now i'm going to do the same thing to the other one and if you put it right on it literally just melts and it's kind of like a glue you want to make sure you're a little bit quick you want to make sure your glue doesn't dry out this is pretty cool i hope they stay like this they kind of remind me of um pokemon balls and like you just throw it or like an easter egg all right one more oh you guys may hear benny in the background he's in his crate playing with a toy that he loves to kind of wrestle with all right here's the last one [Music] perfect oh i may have pushed this one a little hard let me bring this back to my [Music] hot plate and melt it a little again one more time [Music] perfect up all right the bot the last one was kind of didn't fit onto the eggshell perfectly but i think that's okay because for the most part it looked like it did fit now i'm not sure where i screwed up but i don't know this looks like a deformed nest quick bomb looks a little weird benny's just wrestling by himself all right so looks like these are ready i'm gonna put them here and actually i'm gonna use it no i can't use this plate because it's warm and it might melt the chocolate so i'm gonna grab a new plate so that i could go ahead and drizzle on so this is too hot so i'm gonna use this plate okay i'm grabbing another bowl and here's my water it's been um on for the past 10 minutes so i'm gonna put this on top of my hot water and again the bowl is gonna heat up so that i could melt my drizzle red chocolate that i'm going to drizzle onto these bombs i don't need that much so i'm going to use the whole thing um but pretty much i'm just going to grab it and you got to be careful because this could get really warm and you just stir it and it will literally just melt really quick as you saw we put the red chocolate or the red drizzle inside this ziploc bag cut the tip and lucy helped me out help me out with that and it's we're pretty much making i think what's called a piping bag not too sure bakers don't crunch me in the comments for that and again i've never done this before so i'm pretty stoked to do this here we go i'm gonna go just do it just a bunch of lines i'm trying to be quick and not think about it too much okay that's not too bad i did move a little bit with my sweater but i'm gonna be fast and i'm gonna get some of these uh looks like they're like sprinkle things and there's a little stocking put one on there oh you can't really see the red one okay i'm gonna use these white ones and yeah i'm just gonna use the white ones because these are red and white it's not bad for my first set now i'm really curious to know how these will taste considering that there is a strawberry on them strawberry nesquik and not actual cocoa we're going to call it nesquik bombs cool all right i'm going to move these out of the way i'm putting into my nicer plate so that you guys could see them i've got to be extra careful that i don't mess up the frosting all right move this out the way and i'm going to show you guys what this looks like okay guys this is what my nesquik bombs looked like pretty cool right not bad for my first try i could get i could work on my red drizzle uh but looks pretty good as you guys can tell i started with the red candy thing and it blended too much with the drizzle so i switched it over to white but these look pretty good they are really small i think compared to other chocobons or cocoa bombs that i've had so i think they're good size hopefully it's not too much uh strawberry and that's quick in them but let's go ahead and leave this um in the fridge for a little bit longer so the red chocolate hardens a little bit and then we're going to warm up some milk to try them all right i'm finally going to be warming up my milk i'm going to put it in my red mug and we're going gonna go ahead and see if how these taste 20 minutes later you guys this milk is taking like 20 minutes to get really warm can't put it that high because it will literally just burn from the bottom and stick to the pot but why does milk take so long to warm up you guys know the answer let me know in the comments i'm literally like waiting a little longer than a few minutes later all right you guys i got my steaming milk i swear i left i didn't look at this for like two minutes and then start boiling out of the pot but something about milk it takes super long time to um boil but here it goes i'm gonna bring this to you guys look how good these came out can you guys see these [Music] look at that this one looks like a little button or something now i know my drizzle could take some work but this is the first time i drizzled something and i think it's like a b i think i would give this a b all right i have my steaming milk here i'm gonna try to tilt this so you guys could see what it looks like and then drop in this is like those bombs where you you know when you take a bath i think that's why they call them uh cocoa bombs but this is my version of a nesquik strawberry bomb here we go [Music] and then usually oh did you guys see that did you guys see that i was gonna say usually it turns around and somehow all of the all of the inside just opens up and give this a quick stir i could feel some of that nest quick on the bottom so i'm going to stir it it doesn't look very very pink it might be because i only added one teaspoon of the strawberry powder again because i didn't want these to be super super sweet but just sweet enough for me to taste the strawberry milk in here okay so oops awesome i'm gonna throw in a couple extra oops a couple extra marshmallows so they sit on top and it does have that pink color if you guys could see that on my screen here we go oh yeah perfect level of sweetness it tastes just like strawberry milk i mean it is strawberry milk ah it's good i think what i would do different next time is probably add a little bit more of the strawberry nesquik in here just so there's a little bit extra flavor all right so i just got a brilliant idea from lucy who's behind the camera watching i'm gonna add a second bomb into my cup now this actually looks a little bit more pink than it did when i first threw it in here threw it in here so i'm gonna go ahead and add another bomb and i'm gonna show you guys what that looks like boom now usually you're supposed to stir it but as you guys saw from mine it literally just turns on itself and all of the uh straw marshmallows just float on top i'm gonna give this a quick stir and then let's see if it tastes a little bit more like the strawberry milk i was afraid that it was gonna be super super sweet but actually it's not it's too sweet which is pretty good all right here it goes it's a little bit more pink if you guys could see that try not to spill it here we go cheers you guys happy holidays oh yeah that tastes good this tastes better threw in two i did notice these bombs are actually smaller than the ones i've ordered compared to my hand look how tiny it is it's like super tiny can you guys see that i'm gonna do like the makeup gurus no but it is it's like super tiny i don't have a really big hand but um it's a tiny tiny little bob i mean compared to this mug you guys can see how tiny it is so it just depends really on your silicone but it is red and it tastes really good pink it's good that's good all right guys that is it for this video thank you guys again for watching if you guys enjoyed me attempting to make these nesquik strawberry bombs make sure you guys give this video a big thumbs up i'm gonna go ahead and grab a koncha and finish my strawberry milk and enjoy these on the couch thank you guys again for watching and i'll see you guys in my next

"HBaxgpJ7eno": "hi guys so i just made the infamous hot chocolate bombs um and they were a little bit time consuming but they're a lot of fun to make and they definitely get you in the season it's a fun way of doing hot chocolate um so i'm gonna show you a tutorial on how to do it and hopefully we get the fun poofing effect [Music] so first you take your hot chocolate mom and you put it on some sort of spoon situation and you put it inside of your mug and then this is what it looks like [Music] and then i already warmed up some i actually boiled some milk in on the stove and it's hot enough but not like super overly hot and hopefully we're gonna get a fun pushing effect okay so i'm gonna pour the hot milk over it and then it's gonna open up and then all the marshmallows are gonna come out and the hot chocolate are all gonna go together okay here we go ready [Music] there it goes hot chocolate bomb [Music] and then you mix to make sure all the chocolate is melted see it's all getting all brown and then enjoy", "xmTpcTQBC7I": "so since everyone else is doing it i thought i'd give it a try too hot chocolate bombs are the hottest trend on the internet right now so let's not waste time and just get started here's what you're gonna need candy melts hot chocolate powder mini marshmallows and some sprinkles so cocoa poms are actually like super easy to make the first time i made them i was really expecting it to be kind of difficult but they're really not so what i'm going to do is i'm going to take my melted chocolate and i'm going to put it in to my mold i'm using a silicone mold so that way it's flexible so it'll be really easy to pop these out whenever they are done now i'm going to stick them in the freezer for about five minutes so that way they will harden so after we've taken them out of the freezer then we're going to pop them out of their molds then we're going to even them up by taking a hot plate and just kind of melting the edges of them we want to make sure we have a nice flat clean edge on all of them then we're going to add our hot cocoa and maybe a few little surprises and then our marshmallows we want to put as many marshmallows as we can fit in there because this is what really is the ah factor in a hot cocoa bomb is when the marshmallows float to the top so once you've got as many as you can fit in there then we're going to take our top piece melt the edge of that and place it right on top and smooth out the edges if you need to you can carefully use a little bit of your already melted chocolate to put a thin layer to seal it around the edges i have to be really really careful because your melted chocolate is hot and it's going to melt your hot cocoa bomb if you're not careful so you want to make sure that's a nice thin layer just used to seal it once you've done that it's ready to decorate so i'm going to just set it here on my decorating plate and i'm going to take some of my white chocolate drizzle it on top then sparkly sprinkles and i'll add some white sprinkles nice little snowman right in the center and there you go there's your hot cocoa bomb all you need is a glass of hot milk and drop that in there and then it's magic thank you guys so much for watching and for more winter recipes check out this playlist right here and i'll see you next time", "su746DrxeJI": "[Music] you", "A_aTiPpRHlc": "[Music] here are the ingredients microwave chocolate at half power 60 second intervals after chocolate is 75 percent melted stir until smooth then you spoon the chocolate into the mold use a brush to coat the shape of the mold if needed touch up the edges of the mold after this place the molds in the freezer for 10 minutes after removing the mold from the freezer gently take out the shells from the mold fill half of the shell with your desired hot chocolate fillings we used hot cocoa powder marshmallows crushed score candy canes and white chocolate chip seal the two halves with melted chocolate place the sealed hot chocolate balls onto a separate plate to dry place the hot chocolate balm in a desired mug of your choice pour heated milk and watch your hot chocolate bomb explode", "2wysmPShmGw":

I HAVE SOME WORK TO DO ON THESE.", "iiiVFzMd7so": "hey everyone today i'm going to be trying out a food recipe that has gone viral on tick tock and it is known as a hot chocolate balm it is such a fun way to make a hot chocolate because the hot chocolate powder and marshmallows are within the chocolate itself and it melts when you add it to the milk so here we have all of the ingredients we need in order to make it so the first item you need is chocolate and you can use milk chocolate dark chocolate or white chocolate i am going to be making it with dark chocolate and white chocolate up next you need some hot chocolate powder or drinking chocolate powder and i have this container from cadbury so the next item you need are toppings for the hot chocolate and i'll be adding in mini marshmallows this is definitely optional but i will be decorating the dessert itself so i have a few different sprinkle options here and this container has so many different styles to choose from and also some icing and these are writing gel pens so i can just design the top of the hot chocolate balls and there are a few different color options within the container to choose from as well so the first step is to melt the chocolate so i'm just going to be adding the chocolate to a microwave-safe bowl and melting it in order to add it into the milk and i'm just going to be repeating the process again but instead i'll be adding in dark chocolate to the bowl the chocolate is around halfway melted what i'm doing right now is i'm mixing it and i'm going to be adding it into the microwave again for a little bit longer the chocolate is now melted i'm just going to go ahead and mix it together to make sure that it has and now it's time to go ahead and add it into the mold so here i have the mold i'll be using for the recipe there's a total of six sections so i'll be able to make a total of three of the desserts i'm going to be styling them two of them to white chocolate and the middle one to be dark chocolate all i'm doing right now is i'm adding the chocolate with a measuring cup and as for the spatula i'm just making sure the chocolate spreads around the mold itself and that way when the chocolate completely hardens i can remove it from the silicone mold and i can add both pieces together and it will make a sphere and all i'm going to do is just keep adding chocolate to the mold until it is completely full and i'll repeat the process over again so so far i've completed two of the semi-spheres so now it's time to go ahead and complete the other one so i'm just adding in the chocolate like so and we have finished adding in the white chocolate to the mold so now it's time to go ahead and add in the dark chocolate and all i'm doing right now is spreading the chocolate around the mold with the spatula i have nearly finished adding all the chocolate to the mold and this process definitely takes a while but once that is all done we can add it to the fridge so now that all of the chocolate has been added i've just placed the mold into the refrigerator and i'm just going to wait for it to set it has been a few hours and as you can see the chocolate has completely set into the mold it looks very different from what it looked like before i added it into the fridge so now the next step is to remove the chocolate from the mold but this is probably the trickiest part because you definitely don't want to break it especially the top part of the chocolate is quite thin compared to the main part of the sphere so all i'm doing right now is unwrapping it slowly until it's completely removed from the mold and then i'm able to move it out of the way and then i'll just continue the process with all of the chocolate i have removed two of the white chocolate molds and now i'm just removing the dark chocolate and it seems like the dark chocolate ended up a lot thicker compared to the white chocolate so it's a lot easier to remove so i'm going to be making two of the hot chocolate balms today one with white chocolate and one with dark chocolate but now it's time to add in all of the filling and then we can seal them together a hot chocolate balm would definitely not be complete without some drinking chocolate or hot chocolate powder so what i'm going to be doing is i'm going to be adding in a tablespoon of hot chocolate to each of the molds i have one of the white chocolate here and one of the dark chocolate and then the next step is to add in marshmallows here we have some mini marshmallows i'll be using you can definitely use regular size marshmallows but i think these ones are perfect for hot chocolate so i'll just be adding a few to each one and now the next step is to attach both spears together so i have this hot plate that i place in the microwave and i'm just adding the hot chocolate mold on top of it so it melts a bit and then it should stick and connect to the other side of the spear with the toppings and here's what the dessert should look like you should have both pieces stuck together with the hot chocolate and the marshmallows and the toppings inside of it and now the next step is optional but i'm going to be decorating these and i found these icing gel pens at my local supermarket so that is what i'm going to be using i have this gorgeous teal blue one for the white chocolate and i'm just going to be placing a zigzag pattern on top of it and then i'll be adding some sprinkles and this is optional again as well but it should be able to stay in place because i've added the gel pen and i'll be using a different color rather than blue for the dark chocolate i'll be using gold it's very glittery and i think it'll be perfect for it so i'm going to do the exact same style and pattern i'll just be making that zigzag pattern that goes across the entire chocolate what's really great about this sprinkles container is that there are so many different styles to choose from and they're also different of course there's a theme of blue and white which i think is perfect for the winter season also definitely reminds me of the movie frozen as well so i'm going to open up this one and this is just classic blue and white sprinkles i'm going to add it on top of both of them as you can see some of the sprinkles are stained and i'll also be adding in another style of sprinkles we have these classic blue white stars that are also part of the set so i'll just be adding a few on top of each hot chocolate item so i have the milk here and i'm just about to add in the hot chocolate balm and as you can see it's melting straight away and all of the marshmallows have started to appear on the top this is so awesome you can see the hot chocolate powders everywhere as well you'll definitely have to mix it to make sure all the chocolate is completely mixed into the milk itself but i think this is such a different way rather than having a classic hot chocolate to make this instead this was definitely a very easy tutorial to follow along and you hardly need any ingredients as well it's perfect for the winter season and it's such a delicious hot chocolate too it's so great how all of the marshmallows melt within to the hot milk and then you also have the hot chocolate powder and it's definitely more chocolatey because you add the outer chocolate as well let me know in the comment section down below if you've ever tried out this recipe so thanks for watching you", "sQvzW3C4Qz8": "hey you're awesome too do it do it do it do it do it Oh so I'm Derek he's scary um two-fifty it's

understand this new invention we've our time out we've gone over this everything it's not a new invention regular rolling papers have been using perfect fold technology since the dawn of [ __ ] rolling papers this is not a [ __ ] invention you folded it in the middle you know look these are folded in the middle too it's not new it's definitely not your invention come on now get grip reality

having issues tonight I'm willing to bet that the gum is going to be a liquid stickum but as usual we'll burn the [ __ ] yes and while you're burning to find out quantity cost I already stuck the roach in two in then quantity versus cost see here 25 packs per box 4 wraps per pack that gives you 100 wraps per box and once you figure in exchange shipping and handling and Duty crossing the border it works out to about 47 dollars a box so that works out to just under 50 cents a wrap that's that's a respectable price yeah so I'm gonna put that at in 8 out of 10 ok 10 points for the road trip post yes I say that's in for sure so gonna burn aroma ash density and smoothness school bus giraffe elephant police officer be racist against the monkey no well that's because he he [ __ ] and like I can forgive and forget but it's the third one this week little bastard [ __ ] stabbing it's a fillet - um it's not the dark ash so it's Luke it is your phone right gray before it even took a tow fellas oh we had no the stiffness on this is gonna go beautifully and I like the fact that you can taste the smoke you can take its smell the blueberry do that you can smell the blueberry you can taste the blueberry on your token on your Indian again kingpin blood wraps are absolutely in my top category favorite you can taste the blueberry you can smell the blueberry it doesn't burn the nose

class so if these statements offend you please report to too [ __ ] bad yeah 1-800 you're know clearly taking life too seriously and I need to maybe go check out a comedy show or two or maybe smoke a nice blunt to yourself and then go check out a comedy show with you me you clearly need to laugh hello at least a little through this through this night night night night a little bit of bite at the back of the throat a little bit not much a little bit but it must be acknowledged it must be I am NOT surprised whatsoever 96 out of 100 so you guys know how to do it 70 points out of 100 is this is the recommend not recommend line and we got 96 out of 100 it's four point shy of a hundred so for us that means if you are out and you find these if you're online and you find these whatever the cost they're worth it finally you won't be disappointed and that's really the bottom line you give four wraps instead of two generally for the same price as the pack that carries two bags and they're good quality the flavor strong the scent is strong and the paper itself is a good durable stock it's not super thin so you're able to get a nice tight solid roll and as you know with the plum wrap that's what it's all about that nice tight slow-burning so if you find him go get them out of mine all right guys that's what we got for you for this episode stay tuned stay medicated stay stoned we'll be

some like tarps or candy that you can put into your water I like to call them edible bath bombs but if you want to call them just things you can throw in your drink to make your drink taste a lot better that's good it's perfect for throwing in your water at lunch or something so we're having a new subscriber bowl if you would um by the end of this month we're trying to get twenty subscribers so please subscribe to our channel and like this video and share with us your thoughts in the comment section below so yeah let's just get started the very first thing you're going to need is 1/3 cup of baking soda and this is 1/3 cup I'll just put it in a bowl and I'm going to pour this into my big bowl the next thing I'm going to need is 1/4 cup of corn starch and yet again we've already measured this out for all of this you're going to need 1/2 a cup of powdered sugar make sure it's powdered sugar and then you're going to need 1/4 cup of citric acid make sure you spread the citric acid evenly amongst the top so it spreads with everything very well and now we're just going to mix all of those ingredients together and just make sure that you stir all of the ingredients nicely together so we're it makes this really powder that was like a boring step now we're going to add in some kool-aid one packet of kool-aid of whatever flavor you want it to be now there are some fun things that you can add in that I haven't added in you could add in some phlegm dip powder pick it add in some pop rocks anything like that I need my kool-aid and yes you're probably thinking well doesn't kool-aid need water yes we are going to add some water into these bath bombs just wait a second and since I'm using lemon you can't see it so this is definitely a boring color and I think I've mixed them all well together so now you're going to take some water doesn't help matte matter how much water you have I've just gotten a cup of water because they're probably not going to use all of this and if you want your edible candy thing to taste wool-like have color you're going to add in food coloring but before I do that I'm going to add in these sweet tarts I crush I crushed up sweet tarts and then I'm going to be putting them inside of here so this will give it a little color I guess and now I'm going to put some food coloring into my water I'm going to put maybe two drops three drops actually my color I wanted a little darker than that there we go that's our bed and now we're going to slowly mix this in to our mixture make sure you put it in slowly and then mix really fast I mean I'm not added in just a little bit and you're gonna want to mix that in with this very slowly mix it in slowly until it is like a sand texture I'm not getting my desired color but that's okay and as you can see you just follow the same steps if you add too much all of these things will start fizzing away so you have to be careful of that and smells like lemon so once I've done with this I'm just gonna come in here with my hands and mix out together it's like the sandy texture the moldable texture that you're gonna want and this is just an extra of water the stuff that came off on the spatula so I don't know where to put it let's put it inside of a bowl okay so this is a really light pink color now I'm going to now this is when you would actually add some pop rocks or something like that but I'm adding in sprinkles cuz I want this to look really festive and this will make you a lot of edible sponsor sorry for background noise yeah sorry for background noise guys and you might want to have two mixers just in case your other one has that real a bad cloudy stuff so now that I have mixed in all and now that I have incorporated all of my things I am going to move all these other things to the side if you can see I didn't use all my water now I'm going to start putting these into my molds we might want to you might want to spray these with something before you do it but I'm not going to or you might want to drip in a little bit of water or something but I'm not going to spray it and you just want to go and want to pack this feels really cool pack these into your mold sorry dead silence and yeah I'm going to finish packing these notes um some other time but I feel like you guys don't want to wait so once these come out you're going to put them in your drink and it will be awesome and in another video I might show what they turned out like bye guys subscribe", "VFVy7DyElTc": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] hmm [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]

cocoa mix marshmallows sprinkles chocolate chips and crushed peppermints use low heat so you do not burn the chocolate chips make sure it's liquidy enough to pour into the mold [Music] to let it cool we want to put it in the fridge for 20 minutes now that they're cool let's pop them out of their shells be gentle so you don't break them you need a hot plate to put the bombs together let's put some water in and now a plate [Music] let's turn the heat to low today we're making my basic hot cocoa bomb so we want to add hot cocoa mix marshmallows but make sure you don't overfill them to seal the bomb we want to warm up the edges of the top piece and put it together time decorate the bombs this hot cocoa bomb's gonna blow your [Music] mind [Music] wow this is the bomb you", "lTYkEqoILIk": "hey guys and welcome back so i have a treat for you guys today um alicia found somewhere i think it's on facebook right uh yeah facebook youtube on facebook and youtube about these um awesome they're like chocolate bombs where hot chocolate bombs where you actually make a chocolate egg and it has two halves and you fill it with marshmallows and hot chocolate mix and like little pieces of mint or andy andy's candies or whatever so i'm going to turn this around so you can kind of see what uh what we're talking about okay so here's kind of like a half you can kind of see is half of a chocolate egg and we're getting some different molds but our idea to make them right now is these these were these kinder joy and there's two halves but the only thing is that it's hard to coat them when you spray them with non-stick so they kind of bust apart but we have one that actually turned out so the two halves oh this is awesome she used jira deli chocolate and then on the inside she put marshmallows and some hot chocolate mix from nestle's and then you heat a pan up and you just run you run the edge and melt it and then you stick the two halves together isn't that genius and then you put it in a cup and pour hot uh hot milk over it and then you just watch it melt so we're she's heating up some milk over on the stove right now and then we're gonna watch this sucker melt okay so her hot milk is all heated up she's gonna put her little chocolate egg in her cup and it's a clear uh kind of cup so that we can watch this baby melt this is gonna be so cool there it went it exploded and then it's just something neat um she's gonna make them for like christmas and give them away just something fun something different so she used those little kinder joy molds but she ordered some some real ones because they're actually supposed to be like oh two and a half two and a half inches so yeah they're supposed to be a lot bigger but that's all we had to work with we kind of wanted to see how to make them so this kind of given us some little experience before the real molds come so there's just an idea for you guys for christmas they're called hot chocolate bombs pretty neat thanks for watching guys catch you on the next one", "7o9A47jULFw": "[Music] hey guys what's up welcome back to my kitchen i guess this is what i do now i make videos where i try to make things you're gonna hear a lot of birds there's nothing i can do about it there's just a lot of birds around here and we have to keep all the windows open wow that one bird was really loud so today um we're gonna try something that i've wanted to do for months now um i'm gonna start a series and i'm gonna call it late to the trend because that's what i am i see a trend i watch a bunch of videos on it i say i'm going to do that i get all the things to do the thing and then i don't do it or i do it a million years later so here's the first thing in that series i guess the thing that i've been dying to make are um the hot cocoa bombs that i've seen all over instagram and tick tock everybody here was making them i would go to i would go to the grocery stores and there would be like no candy melts um i couldn't find a mold we don't have a michaels or a hobby lobby or anything like that so my places to find it were kind of limited anyway but i still didn't see them anywhere so then i looked on amazon and all of the round molds were like back ordered they weren't gonna get here for like ever and i saw these which i thought were really cute so i bought it and you know then i just never got around to doing it and they've just been sitting in the drawer staring at me but then i realized valentine's day is coming up they're shaped like hearts it's chocolate it's a good project to do i decided i didn't want to just do like regular plain chocolate on chocolate i haven't done this before so it's going to be my first time testing these flavor combos i'm going to do a mexican hot chocolate um or mayan hot chocolate and that's like hot chocolate with cayenne and cinnamon and spices in it the spicy and has kick to it it's valentine's day so i was thinking pink and what's pink obviously strawberry flavored so i'm gonna do a strawberry white chocolate uh bomb and then i've had ube extract sitting in my cabinet for a few months now and i haven't done anything with it i like ube drinks and i have ube extract so i think i'm going to try to add that to the white chocolate and then put white cocoa powder inside and see how that turns out i got these to melt down i'm gonna chop this up and melt these down the way that i saw online which is jars in a simmering saucepan of water okay i don't really know how much i need of this i feel like i should chop it this isn't a good time for me to be thinking about this but now i'm not sure can you melt baker's chocolate and use it like this i guess we'll find out oh guys i'm not measuring anything in case you didn't notice i'm just kind of eyeballing it truthfully i'm already having my doubts about this but here we go i feel like this isn't right actually so surprised this is working pretty well and it's supposed to keep the uh i'm supposed to keep the chocolate like melted okay so i dumped like half of my melted white chocolate in this bowl i'm kind of getting frantic because i don't want it to cool down but i'm gonna take a few drops of this ube flavoring oh it smells so good and we're gonna just like scoop oh i think i might have put too much you don't want to put too much because then your chocolate is going to seize i think i might have put too much holy sh that smells amazing by the way it's giving us this really pretty purple color so this is what we've got i'm gonna put it here oh no shoot oh no i got it everywhere wow it's staining the counter oh i'm in trouble oh no okay so now my hands are purple and they're just gonna stay purple i guess i'm gonna fill this i'm gonna start with the ube one because i feel it is the most unstable so what you're supposed to do is spoon it in here and then like brush it up the sides with the back of the spoon um you want to really fill it in and make sure there are no holes because then there will be holes in your hot cocoa bomb and the hot cocoa will just fall out and it won't explode and look all cool like it's supposed to [Music] so i'm going to put this in the fridge for like 10 minutes and then i will do a second coat hopefully my chocolate stays warm okay so while i wait for that to melt i have my cocoa mix here in order to make the mexican cocoa i am going to add cinnamon i'm doing a half tablespoon i mean half a teaspoon a pinch of salt i'm just gonna do like this sounds weird but chili powder as well actually it's more like an eighth of a teaspoon because chili powder to me is really strong so i don't want to put a lot of it and then finally cayenne if you don't like spicy things i guess you could leave it out but it really gives it like a nice kick so i'm just gonna go one two because i like spicy things a few moments later i might have made it a little too spicy okay so here comes the part that i'm really nervous about um this is where it could all go wrong people keep your fingers crossed for me as you can see it kind of already went wrong my ube chocolate kind of seized up and i didn't have any more so i had to patch up some spots with the white it's fine whatever you're not going to see the inside did i mention that i'm really nervous because this could go so wrong so you're supposed to like pull the sides gently to loosen it up [Music] oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god that's not coming all the way out come on come on please okay okay one is out the plain chocolate one is not setting i don't know why oh no got them all out so i'm gonna put them back in the fridge for a minute or i'm gonna put them in the freezer actually i don't know what's going on i don't know why this one isn't setting i feel like i shouldn't have used baker's chocolate i should have used candy melts i heated up this pan and then took it off the heat because you kind of need it to finish the edges of the chocolate and then stick them together i am so nervous right now this one oh this one it's melting i don't really know why so you go like this you run it over a few times so that your edges turned out nice one and a half teaspoons of white chocolate i'm also going to take a few marshmallows put them in here like so then i'm going to take this for the top part i'm going to put it on top and while it's still hot try and close all the seams oh no it's not really working dude this is much harder than it looks or maybe it's just because i don't know what i'm doing this one looks like it's just going to have a hole in it no matter what i do please stick your fingers in a hot pan like i just did do not try that at home uh i quite often burn myself so i just did it again the second time i know i just told you not to do it this one is really delicate i'm so scared wow that melted so fast okay i also want to put in some of these heart sprinkles look so cute okay so these will go in here as well [Music] here we go my last one my strawberry one is done they were melting so i put them back in the fridge and i want to try to decorate them but we might not be able to decorate them because they might just fall apart we'll see what happens hopefully they don't melt in my hands while i'm trying to decorate them okay i thought i had parchment paper but i don't so sorry for the reflection but i'm gonna do the ube first i put some white chocolate in this zipper bag i'm going to cut off the end [Music] drizzle so what my ube one looks like i've got my strawberry quick that i put in some white chocolate in this bag okay so here's my strawberry white chocolate one i am too scared to do the mexican hot chocolate one i think i'm just gonna leave it the way it is because it's so delicate let's just sit and when my husband comes home later we're going to test them out and we'll see how well they bomb no bomb is bad explode is good here we go um i'm really sad that this one looks so plain but like i said it was melting when i tried to decorate it just came out really cute though all right so it's time to call over the taste tester it looks really pretty i don't want to try this i want to try something special you didn't even let me tell you what was in it oh there's something in it yeah okay mexican hot chocolate let's mexican hot chocolate it has cinnamon and cayenne pepper okay i don't okay ube white chocolate okay strawberry white chocolate oh candy [Music] oh good what's going on now it should all of it in theory yeah break open not breaking open one second have a spoon oh you missed it no no no it was so hyped [Music] sorry oh it's good so you like it it's a little too sweet though we only have the one pretty glass mug i gotta wait till he's done i'm gonna try the ube and i guess we will leave the chocolate until tomorrow because we decide we can't drink all three hot chocolates today might be a little too much okay can you just eat it like that you could that would be super sweet powder on the inside [Music] why is it floating why is this one floating might have to crack it open wait you're gonna miss it okay poof what and i was hot oh it's good oh it's really sweet i'm telling you it's super sweet i had trouble finishing mine you want to try it sure i just want to just take a sip then okay well it's good but oh it's less oh no i don't like the milk i don't like the oatmeal but you taste the way flavor right yeah i like mine better really yeah wait a second i just realized you didn't even offer me a soup of yours oh snap you don't even offer me a sit that one's not strawberry well i don't know if it shows up really well but it's like this pretty lilac-ish color purple lilac is purple bird barbie barney's way darker than this grimace is the same color as barney you think you know everything huh i do sure anyway i guess that's it for now i'm going to finish drinking this hopefully it's kind of sweet i don't know if i'm going to finish it um and then it'll magically be morning and you'll see and we'll see how much you threw me off why did you why did you do it it'll be magically be morning to then and we'll try the other chocolate one the spicy chocolate and good morning what's up it's evening the final hot cocoa bomb the mexican hot chocolate [Music] oh yeah hey what does that mean it just broke yeah that one was melting before i even did anything [Music] here we go it looks nice and chocolatey i don't like the smell why oh it smells good does it really yeah [Music] they're supposed to it's mexican hot chocolate you drink your fruit if you really think about it you have to be the one that judges which one is the best because i ain't getting strawberry it's just dark chocolate that's it yeah i feel like you're not sophisticated enough for all the nuanced spices and flavors right hey what happened i put so much spice wow i mixed it okay so only person that's had all three flavors which one was better strawberry better than lupe yeah i feel like and they will be a second this one's last yeah i don't think it's that bad it's not bad but it's not special you're not special well anyway so this has been my hot cocoa bomb experiment why are you laughing because i thought something special that happened i don't understand see i put a lot of spice in this but no no when you drink it you feel warm yeah what you're supposed to do but i don't taste cinnamon or any of the spices it's just pure dark chocolate yeah so i think using baker's chocolate like i did instead of candy melts was my mistake oh yeah because we went everywhere yeah we went to the commissary we went to the local shopping mall or we couldn't find it the market yeah we can find it if you guys try this let me know what flavors would you come up with what flavor would you come up with what's your dream hot cocoa bomb i probably should have asked you before you should have you should have which i never had but i feel like it would be a good mixture that's a good idea for caramel salty caramel that would be my pick too so maybe someday i couldn't figure out the logistics i had to do that but yeah so let me know what would your dream hot cocoa bomb flavor be and if you try this how did it turn out okay bye", "lp7v7DgY8Ys": "hey guys it's misso here and today i'm gonna make homemade chocolate bombs my chocolate bombs what's on the top of these is crushed up candy canes okay so here are the ingredients that we are going to use so we have almond bark for chocolate marshmallows hot cocoa candy melts we have also these sprinkles and we might do a peppermint flavor one and we have our mold right there and we just thought a baby spoon would be easier because we didn't have a paintbrush so and we also have this okay i think i got that one [Music] i have an adult um melt the chocolate um this is kind of what it looks like before putting it in the fridge okay so i'm gonna pop them out right now because they're just gonna okay please don't break please don't break please don't break you like it yeah but that one looks like the smoothest connect them yeah so they didn't have hot cocoa mix so we got the pre-packs um so here's what it looks like and i'm about to pour it so here we go [Music] actually there's a lot in just one package so we got two filled here are the marshmallows and we're gonna stack this thing full of marshmallows i like marshmallows that i put a lot on so now now we're gonna close it okay so what i'm gonna do is we have this pan heated and i'm not gonna put like the whole thing on it or else it will melt i'm just going to put the edges on it so it just like flattens out the top like really neat okay that's good check that out on top do we need to take out some marshmallows i got it oh cool that looks so good oops okay you gotta be careful because it will break okay got the next one wait does that look fancy it's a drizzle guys oh well looks like a blob sprinkles yummy i think that looks good yeah so this one got cracked a little bit so this is our testing one um so we're gonna put it in the mug [Music] we'll drop it okay oh oh it fits in the mud perfect and it didn't break yeah i dropped it in the mud i guess it cracked it a little bit it was already cracked yeah okay so our water's still heating up already okay that's so cool it really melts [Music] that's so cool really i feel like you're gonna you can burn your tongue oh is it hot it's not hot so as you can see we did these um chocolate shells and this one it dried really quick so we like couldn't um get it as smooth as the others but look at the others they're like really good and smooth and they feel nice and this one's just whoa so when we use this we put like and filled it to like right there i would say but it was like a lot in there so we just used half of an instance hot chocolate and it was really sweet like really sweet um so we decided not to use this the next time we do these so on these ones i'm just going to use marshmallows and mix them with peppermint that's not really a drizzle that's like a blob who cares we'll fix this i just don't want to splatter it everywhere that's how it looks like a drizzle okay then i'm going to take i'm going to take candy cane crumbles it's so professional right now and we get a circle but you gotta be careful because it will melt your chocolate underneath it that's when all that round chocolate is coming off okay so we found these cute little bags that have snowflakes on them and what i'm gonna do is and we also have this red um kind of crunchy stuff you know and um um i would have wore gloves to do this but this is just for me and my family to try out like using these bags you know and so i'm gonna put a lot in there and then you're gonna set your hot chocolate balm in there here's what it looks like inside and i also got these cute little um kind of candy cane um twister twisty tie things to tie this up and here's what it would look like here here's what it looks like it's really cute on the top and look how cute that is thanks for watching my video make sure to like subscribe and ring that notification bell ding ding ding", "SeIboJDWH4g": "you're going to start with this beautiful mold that you bought and don't cry when i tell you that we are going to cut them into individual little cups cut around leaving enough edge for you to still hold on to and then what you're going to use are these candy wafers so you're going to pour about half a bag into a bowl a full bag will make about eight bombs total and then what you're going to do if you get your melts in here is you're going to put them in the microwave for about 30 seconds give it a stir take them out do it for another 20 to 15 seconds and just re-keep repeating that process until it's completely melted the reason for doing it in small increments is that so you don't burn the chocolate so here i have this nice beautiful candy melted um i'm gonna switch here and use just a regular kitchen spoon and what we're gonna do is we're gonna hold our cup in one hand we're gonna take a big old glob and put it in here and then i'm gonna come up here and show you guys a little bit better what i'm doing so in the little cup i am gonna use the back of my spoon and i am going to coat all the way up to the edge it's important to have a nice strong edge on here so that it doesn't break and i'm going to grab a little bit more chocolate here okay so that is done and now what i'm going to do is i'm going to hold on to the sides and i'm just going to jiggle this around like pop the mold up and what happens is hard to see on camera but these little air bubbles are popping that way when you take your chocolate out of the mold it doesn't have a hole in it from an air bubble so once that's done i'm going to take the back of my spoon again and i'm going to make sure that these sides are coated well especially at the top perfect and you can see on the bottom of this one there's a little orange mold showing so i'm just going to use my fingers and move the chocolate in that spot so once that's done i'm going to put it in my muffin tin and i'm going to put it in the fridge to harden well i would fill this whole tray and then put it in the fridge to harden so once your hot cocoa bomb comes out of the fridge it's going to be nice and hard and all you're going to do is i like to put both thumbs on the back side here or at least my dominant thumb and what i'm going to do is i'm just going to kind of peel the rim as i push down on the center and there it comes this beautiful half glossy sphere i like to make all of my shells at one time and i keep them in a container and then i go back and assemble all at the same time i just think it's a little bit easier and then what you're going to do is you're going to take a microwave safe plate and we're going to put it in the microwave for at least 35 seconds so what we're going to use that for is when you pop this out of your mold there's going to be some rough edges so you can see it's not beautiful there's a lip on here they're a little cracked and crumbly but to seal it tight to the other half of the sphere we really want that nice and clean so that's where this microwaved plate is going to come in also these are just for friends and family but if you're making them for sorry just for my family if you're making them for friends and family you might want to wear gloves while doing this and here's our toasty plate so i'm gonna grab one and we're just gonna hold it on the plate here as you guys can see this i'm gonna rub it around and all my edges are melted and then i'm gonna take a scoop of hot cocoa this is about one tablespoon and i'm gonna grab a handful of marshmallows and fill it up so then i grab the other half melt that on the plate as well and then i'm going to stick them together so i'm going to bring this over here to show you guys this nice clean seal where the two edges that were still a little sticky that put together easy so that one is done what i'm gonna do now is grab a cute package of valentine's day baking cup and we only need one we're gonna put it in there it fits perfect next what we're going to do is take our pink candy wafers and put them in one of these disposable piping bags so all these are is a triangle plastic bag and again you're going to use the same process you're going to start by putting them in the bag microwaving for about 30 seconds you're going to mush this bag up and then you're going to put it back in the microwave melt a little bit longer 15 seconds mush it up and repeat until it's fully melted so i'm going to push this down and i am going to use a scissor to just cut to the very tip of this off just like that i'm going to make sure it's coming out here beautiful and then what i'm going to do over my cupcake here is just make some nice clean simple lines and then do our cute sprinkles that's adorable so do as many or as little sprinkles as you like here is our beautiful hot cocoa bomb after our pokemon is hardened i have two different packaging options that are really cute so these are actually cupcake boxes and they come as these little guys and you just pop them open and then what i would do is i would open some of this white shred or you can get pink or grabbing this also and put some of that in the bottom and then i would just take my hot pokemon put it right in fold it up and you have this super cute way to display your bum otherwise you always have another option we have these treat bags they come in a 30 pack and a 60 pack and what you can do with these is open them up put your hot cocoa bomb right inside bunch it up and tie it off with a really cute ribbon this is also a great way to give these as a little gift", "GMV0Ibg2WN4": "[Music] whether you're looking for a great valentine's day gift for that special someone or you just haven't had a chance to decompress from the franticness of the holidays we've got you covered here on the winter shopping show and i'm joined now by alyssa creves from l and l bath bombs alyssa it's so good to see you again yeah thanks for having me on i know jessa was up here last time talking about some of the great products you have to offer i have to confess i love bath bombs i got i got to take a couple of years home last time and they just offer an amazing experience the fragrances are so relaxing and it really softens the water up quite a bit yeah it does yeah yeah so talk to us a little bit before we get into exactly what you have to offer here today talk to us a little bit about how you got started with making bath bombs so it was actually just suggested to me to start making these it wasn't like something i'm like oh this is like a hip thing i want to start making them i was buying them a lot so someone had just suggested i start making them and that's really just kind of how it started that's it so yeah so you found a recipe and lo and behold here we are yeah i mean it took a long time to get there but yes i found it probably didn't all look this good i'm guessing no they did not okay all right so what all goes into your bath bombs because i know that obviously these are all hand made which i think is what makes them so amazing but you really are careful about the ingredients that you're adding share us share with us some of the ingredients that you put in your bath bombs yeah that was one of the main things i wanted to focus on was making sure that i use quality ingredients um surprisingly the two main ingredients are baking soda and citric acid are which are things that you can eat so yeah i mean they're and they're all natural and organic pretty much and yeah i just make sure that i buy the best quality ingredients so maybe make sure you don't eat it after you've taken a bath right the water it does stain the label don't eat it don't eat it okay good good you got your bases covered well let's talk a little bit about this because you are offering a deal right now to folks who are watching and tell us a little bit about that deal so it's a variety pack of um four bath bombs and it comes with a free bin so this is free yes wow okay and this is normally a 25 purchase but it's yours you get not only do you get the free bin but you get additional five dollars off so twenty dollars for four bath bombs and you get to keep this bin and who doesn't like a few extra things for decoration around their house you know i mean this is almost kind of a rustic look here kind of a country feel to it and if that's something that you're interested in i mean it's a it's a really really great thing to have in your bathroom living room kitchen wherever so excellent i'm curious to know about some of the ones that i see in this wooden bucket though because you've got i don't know what this is even i mean you've got a white bath bomb there's something kind of orange like crystals or something there can you tell us a little bit about that those are sea butter popping crystals so when you put it in the bathtub and once they get wet they actually start popping really just make a popping noise yeah so fun for kids okay it's kind of like the candy that pops in your mouth but it pops in the back yeah right yeah and then you got some like looks like little gold pieces in here yeah those are what you call gold bursting beads so they're really tiny you can buy like big ones in the stores but these ones are really small and they just have um oils in them so obviously once they dissolve they have oils and so it just releases oils in your bathtub sure it makes the water even more soft right sure and probably makes your skin even more soft yeah i'm guessing that you're you know using these in time will probably soften your skin a little bit as well so if you need that in the winter time like so much of us so many of us do yes absolutely and then what about this hot pink one what is this here in the middle of that that one is actually just candy topping really that you would you know sprinkles that you would just buy at you know walmart or target no kidding yeah okay and then you have some some others over here as well and it looks like you've got kind of like multi-color ones yes so i just have a kind of variety here um this one here is one of my favorites it's called bombshell it smells just like a victoria's secret perfume yeah all right so um and then this one is my favorites a day at the beach um kind of brings you a

some sprinkles we're gonna put some christmas sprinkles in them yup and we got some red and green edible glitter which is found on amazon and we're going to brush those on with just some cheap i think these were a dollar a piece makeup brushes and no no nope let's show them the most important thing that they need ty don't use marshmallows okay i'm not it is a sphere silicone mold to make the chocolate i love more tomatoes so this is the mold that you will need we got this one from walmart i've seen them on amazon um in fact since we started looking up videos how to make hot chocolate balms i'm getting ads for them it's pretty easy to find but um you want to make sure it's silicone or the chocolate will stick to it okay what do you say let's do this all right let's do this okay so step one you have to melt your chocolate and this is very important you can't over cook it because it will grow on your chocolate we have a little bit still melted at the bottom so we're just gonna add one half of this bag start every 30 seconds until it's melted um no not so we're done [Music] um please hurry why because i'm waiting to do this until we get back all right so this is the perfect consistency not too hot it's all melted okay now you want to spoon it into your pretty big heaping spoonful into your mold make sure you can see mix it around like so make sure it's all the way up to the top and also make sure it's got enough in there that it's not going to be too thin when it pops out so i put a good heaping tablespoon around looks good yeah christmas is your favorite me too all right so that's done put them in the fridge about 30 minutes until they get hurt yes 30 minutes we have to be patient we have to wait till they're done [Music] now i want marshmallows for you why i not i ate a lot you did am i going to turn into one turn it into a marshmallow yeah if not and i'd have to eat you what all right it's time to get our chocolate out of the fridge okay this is very hot don't touch so you're one again you're going to want to get a plate and microwave it for just 30 seconds to a minute get it hot now we're going to get our molds out okay i'm always gonna do this part

put red okay and i want to put this one between two christmas trees too all right this one has little christmas trees in it super cute okay put them in there so that when they open up in the mug they'll explode cute little christmas sprinkles some snowflakes in there too we're gonna take the other half that's the top can i just berry no and just very gently you don't want it to melt too much but just touch it to the plate enough that it starts to melt a little and then place it on top after you make it after we make it okay okay now you want to make sure that the sides line up we've got a little bit of a hole in this one so we're going to patch it up with the chocolate that we have left over okay no sir let me do that part okay set that one aside because we've got to attach a little hole okay perfect and then like the other one has a little hole right there so we'll just pop it up happy happy oh [Music] we're gonna take some of this melted chocolate patch up that little hole that we have i did wash my hands i'm just going to patch it up a little they're not perfect now [Music] [Music] and we got some glitter we got some glitter okay so that's going to be our next step we got

back to our kitchen today we're making dragon inspiring hot chocolate bombs yes and they're inspired by this merchandise that we got and sent us miss hamasaki i mean i guess technically you could say this was our first pr package for you it's pretty cool man i really appreciate it thank you for sending all this stuff it says queen but this shirt is not bootleg it's pretty high quality and it takes it takes 10 pounds off you well all these others inspired me and i'm like what can we make so we're going to make some hot cocoa bombs but we're going to be using these hot pink candy melts and these super cute little sprinkles i got their little crowns and we're just going to drag them up let's see what we get drag that up cousin let's get to it for today's video we're gonna use white chocolate milk chocolate and then our hot pink candy melts we're gonna melt them all the same way 30 seconds for the first round in the microwave give it a stir and then 15 seconds each interval after that until they're melted so let's start with our hot pink candy melts at first it's going to look like it's not melting at all but you got to trust the process [Music] and then this time we're gonna put it in for 15 seconds and you're saying oh it's not doing anything yes it is stick to the program yes don't get impatient and try to put it in for too long because you could scorch it or mess it all up make it seize and then you won't have usable chocolate watch this plan starting to melt on the bottom because the bowl is getting hot first and i know we're thinking oh oh just smoking melted for 30 seconds and now [Music] getting there it's looking good one or two more 15 seconds cycle should do it and we'll do one more 15 second cycle there that is nice and healthy now we're gonna move on to our regular chocolates all right white chocolate's turned this one melts pretty quick so watch this everything's normal and now it's not starting to melt yeah so we do 30. now we're going to do 15 okay watch we'll probably take probably take another 15. check it out see that gotta do another 15. oh i love white chocolate it's like chocolate but white 15. [Music] oh we got it that's it so we did the 30 and we did two cycles of 15. then we got our two chocolates melted well this isn't really chocolate but we'll call it that we're gonna go ahead and start working our molds i like to just put a little bit in and then take the back of a round spoon and just smear it yes this is fun quality time making sweets uh what's it called valentine's day is coming up you and your your honey boo you can make these all right so mine's coated i just take the wax paper with a little cutting board to use as a surface and i'm going to flip it upside down that way most of the stuff will come toward the edges because that has to come together to form the dome of the actual bomb boom see now we're gonna we're gonna wash this we're gonna flip it peep and leave it in the mic and uh we're gonna put it in the microwave for 30 minutes that's so wrong it's gonna go in the fridge for about ten minutes five to ten minutes to let it set oh it's actually the opposite of what i said we're refrigerating for five minutes and we have microwave these for ten more seconds just to get them kind of liquidy again and now time for our second coat [Music] to keep your chocolate malleable the word for today is malleable malleable [Music] for the second coat you want to catch any little areas that you might have missed the first time any thin areas especially the edges you definitely want to get your edges thick because that's the part that has to come together is your lower value it's rock solid let's say no oh good good answer all right so it's pretty filled in looks like all my little thinner areas are done and the edges look pretty thick in the freezer for five more minutes we're gonna wear gloves because we don't want your fingerprints on the surface of the shells because the warmth of your fingers can start to melt it all right let's start separating it then you just want to unstick the edges a little first so you're gonna need a pretty hot plate we're just going to microwave ours for about a minute and then we're going to use that to melt our edges all right so now to assemble our chocolate balms you take your edge clean it up a little using the hot plate just to melt your edges and get them full good and if you're using two different colored chocolates make sure you're you continue melting each color when it's respective you see she was she just said that for me she wasn't talking to you she's tucking away simple then take your face add a scoop of hot chocolate whatever hot chocolate you want put a ton of marshmallows because the more marshmallows you have in there the cooler your bomb is going to look when you melt it and then take the top get it melty again and press them together i've melted some milk chocolate now that i am going to put into the molds that way we can have other colored bases as well all right i'm gonna put these in cupcake holders just so we have something to hold on to and we don't warm them up with our fingers with our fat little digits yep because then we leave fingerprint marks on them i'm gonna put some of the dark chocolate that i melted into this [Music] baggie [Music] now the plan is to do eyelashes we'll see if those work out i'm gonna start darker one we're gonna go ahead and put on a crown i'm gonna paint the back with the little white chocolate and now to add more makeup take a little eyeshadow primer a lot of glitter [Music] time for the best part the taste test [Music] and here we go oh oh there it is look at that nice give her a stir here we go perfect for a winter's day but we're in southern california it was like 60 degrees today it was like it was like 92 but the rest of the country can enjoy a lot of cocoa sorry guys thanks for watching we had a lot of fun making these hot cocoa bones inspired by our new drag merchandise all right let's get ready for the next one we're out we're out we're dead bye alright guys see you next time peace", "mi9nSRltA2U": "[Music] so i'm gonna try these uh slim fast keto fat bomb snack bar minis strawberry top cheesecake um i really got these for jennifer we had him in the keto box i think it was that they came in and she liked them um but i actually bought this before the box came in uh let's look so i know this little the slimfast keto fat bombs have uh pretty good ingredients for the most part but these this is a snack bar mini these are something newer they have and they have a few flavors i think um let's see uh there are 12 servings in here one serving is a bar it's 80 calories it's six fat three protein eight total carbs four fiber two sugar alcohol so two net carbs per bar um ingredients there's a white chocolate flavored coating that is made of cocoa butter inulin whole milk powder erythritol natural flavor stevia extract vanilla extract then there's almonds inulin milk protein isolate coconut erythritol cocoa butter soluble tapioca fiber natural flavor cashews glycerin freeze-dried strawberries sunflower lecithin salt citric acid mct oil from coconut whey protein isolate and stevia extract not too terrible ingredients in there the tapioca fiber i'm not a fan of but um it's a lot of ingredients though so let me get one out see what it looks like and give it a try so they call these snack bars with their snack bar minis remember so this is tiny this is eight total carbs in this little tiny thing they're individually wrapped let me open up and see what it looks like all right so here's the size of it i don't like it i'm not even gonna eat the other half um i thought it was gonna be like a cheesecake type filling with just like a little layer of like maybe some strawberry on top it looks like maybe there is a layer of strawberry stuff on top i can't taste the strawberry but it's more of an aftertaste there's no cheesecake taste to this um i don't think and it's kind of a crumbly texture [Music] yeah all um i'll defer and let jennifer have these i've had one of these before i'm gonna try to get it it's been a while i don't know if it's just the same thing it's the same thing okay i mean i like it i liked it last time it doesn't look right to me though but it's not bad at all [Music] you", "TEfDTBY58Ho": "[Music] hello i'm isabelle welcome to sepals world i'm going to make a chocolate balm i think it's going to be safe like a rose i got this

watching this recipe please do try this i hope you enjoy it", "AqTVqHeKlI8": "hi guys and welcome back to my channel today i'm going to be showing you how to make cocoa bombs and just so you know this is my first time doing it um my sisters and i my sisters and i decided that we wanted to make some cocoa bombs so they're going to be coming over and we're going to be making some cocoa so diego's here all right so these are the molds that my sister ordered off of amazon that um took forever to get here actually i think it was actually the purple ones that took a long time to get here so if you're ordering some online um i don't know what to tell you i'm sorry and so i got super impatient so i got these at dollar general and then these are some of the hot cocoa things that we got from dylan's and then my sister brought the abuelita hot cocoa so you can just use whatever you have or whatever you want but this was our first time doing it so that's what we decided to get and then we also got some milk chocolate um chocolate chips and then we have some candy wafers and then my sister also got this chocolate bar um but we just kind of you know we never made these before so we just wanted to play with it and see what worked best we also had some candy wafers the green and the white and then some sprinkles so that we can sprinkle on top the mini marshmallows so that we can put on the inside and that is some of our ingredients that we used the first thing we did was we took them out of the package and then we wanted to rinse them because of course they're dirty so then the next thing that we did was we cut each mold as you can tell like this evie is cutting them just because i saw a video where they did this and i thought it was a great idea so we went ahead and did that also so we just all individually cut them so everybody got a chance to make their own cocoa bomb so here is evie cutting them and then i wanted to dry them but you'll see in the next clip where i decided not to dry them because all right so i couldn't pat them dry because the stuff from the paper was getting inside so i'm just going to wait to have them sit here and dry if he's still cutting the other ones and buster's crying right buster okay so you're gonna need a couple of spatulas also and then i have some two bowls so that we can microwave the chocolate we're going to start off with some chocolate and then we want to make like some green ones so we're going to mix we're going to mix these two to make it like a light green kind of like the grinch cocoa bumps okay so i'm gonna pour some in here you only need a little bit because you have to start off with a little bit if you put too much and you melt it too much they're not going to work so i put in just a little bit and i'm going to microwave it for like 25 seconds stir it and then i'm going to see if it needs 20 20 or 25 more seconds okay all right so after 25 seconds this is what it looks like i'm gonna stick it back in there for another 25 seconds all right so now this is what it looks like after 25 more seconds i'm gonna keep stirring it your bowl is gonna be kind of hot so you have to be careful and just keep stirring it and it'll start to melt more so we're just going to start off with this one never done this before so let's try it okay so the first thing we did was we started using the spatula to put um the chocolate on the mold and we kind of thought that um it really wasn't working i don't know it was our first time so we were just kind of playing with it we didn't know how thick to make it or how much chocolate to put i'm telling you i watched so many videos and everybody does it differently so if this works for you good if it doesn't i'm sorry whatever you just gotta play with it okay so as you can tell we put some chocolate in the mold and um we just kind of spread it with a spatula but we kind of felt like the spatula really wasn't working so we ended up getting a a brush and so we kind of started brushing the chocolate inside also and so then we put them in the freezer we put them in the freezer for about 10 minutes and then we decided to make some of the green wafers so again i melted these for 20 20 to 25 seconds and then you stir it and then you got to put them back in the microwave again for another 20 to 25 seconds and i would probably say that the green wafers or whatever were the ones that worked the best so here in a little bit you'll see where we actually took one out and this was our very first one and we were super excited because look how cute it was all right my other sisters on there just got here and she brought lucky charms marshmallows she brought some more sprinkles these cute little merry christmas cups baking cups and some more chocolate and brianna all right and the next thing i did was i got a tray and i put some wax paper over it and we started putting um the cocoa bombs here um this was brenda my sister she actually found a very good technique where she was just kind of like rolling it back and forth and so that worked very well the ones that i got from dollar general i honestly didn't really like these molds but you know what it was our first time we were trying so that's what we were doing here i'm showing you how we popped out the green um cocoa bombs and they were really nice i think that honestly these ones came out the best i think it's honestly because of the wafer that we were using um worked really good and look how embarrassing this was our very first cocoa bomb so that was pretty embarrassing um but here i'm showing you how we're trying um to make a second one and this one is with the chocolate the chocolate that we used was the chocolate chips and so then here i'm showing you how you're going to take a plate you're going to put it in the microwave and it's going to get hot so that you can melt a little bit of the rim and then you're going to place it on top i'm going to show you here in a little bit how we're going to do it again but this was our second one that we made and so we were pretty happy with it but then if you can tell i started drizzling it and look what happened it kind of like sunk in so i was pretty disappointed and so here in a little bit um i'm gonna show you uh the very next day i woke up and i said you know what i'm gonna try it again because i was not very happy with it so here i'm showing you this is the next day um we had the cocoa bombs in the freezer so again i had a plate and i put it in the microwave so it can get hot and so you kind of put the cocoa bomb on or like you know what i mean you put it on the plate and you put some cocoa powder the marshmallows you take the other half and you put it on the plate so that you can get some perfect little edges and i was pretty pleased i mean look at these i feel like they came out super nice and so that was very exciting um and then here is evie she wanted to try one so we these were the mini ones these ones were the purple ones and so they were a lot smaller and she did a very good job of making them again like i said you got to use that plate and make sure that you put in the microwave so that it gets hot so that you can melt the rim or the edges and so that it looks um perfectly fine and not like rough edges and this was actually the next day so i was pretty excited with the way they turned out and what i did next was i put them in the freezer for a little bit longer so that they could sit and dry and then i'm going to be showing you how i drizzle a drizzle on top i'm not a perfectionist with this but i had to put it in a little sandwich bag so that i can drizzle the cocoa bombs and here i am drizzling them after i drizzle them i put a little bit of sprinkles to decorate them i didn't put a lot of drizzle because i feel like the the second cocoa bomb that we did i put too much drizzle so i feel like maybe that's why it sunk in and as you could tell one of them had a kind of like a dent in it it was just because of the way that it was in the freezer um it started to freeze that way but look at the little ones they were super cute we were so happy with the results here i am putting a little bit of sprinkles on top you can put whatever you want this is what we just had on hand and i think they turned out really cute i don't know let me know down below comment down below tell me what you think maybe i need to do something better you're probably an expert i don't know but this was our first time doing it so i was super excited with the way they turned out i'm here in a little bit i'm going to show you how we put it in a mug and all right so now i moved them over to one of these cupcake pans i put them in these cute little things and then my sister also got these cute little bags we could put them in and then she also got these ones are super cute these ones are super cute what do you guys think for our first time well i don't know if i like that drizzle right there i mean i think they look okay yeah all right guys and that is it i hope you enjoyed this video i was really pleased with the way they turned out please let me know down below what do you think i could do better um let me know what you think i honestly didn't like these ones the ones from the dollar general i don't know i just feel like they just it was kind of hard to make them and um i don't know i just kind of didn't really like them but whatever we were just trying so here i'm putting the cocoa bomb in a mug i'm going to be pouring some hot milk over it and it turns out super delicious i'm telling you guys you have to try making these i know it's very time consuming but overall it's super fun maybe you can give them to one of your friends whatever blah blah blah but if you're new here

"ktSRJY384M0": "hot chocolate hot chocolate hot chocolate hot chocolate shall we make hot chocolate bombs together hey guys so this is what your kit comes with silicone mold premium chocolate buttons your two piping bags you got your delicious hot chocolate mix mini marshmallows unicorn horns eyeballs these marshmallows are for your ears so please don't eat them got your marshmallow for your nose and mouth assorted sprinkles cases to hold your bombs additional tools you'll need a spoon scissors parchment paper wet towel and paper towels an angled spatula and toothpick okay let's get started we're going to microwave our dark chocolate melts one minute up to 900 watts this is ready you're going to give it a stir and you're going to get this kind of very syrupy consistency this is perfect and i'm going to show you a very cool technique that's very neat and tidy all you're going to do is coat the back of your spoon and just put a thin layer into each cavity don't worry if you see some open or bare areas again this is just the first layer so trust me your bobs are going to come out nice shiny and smooth no matter what you see now even though it's really ugly and kind of like spotty this is exactly what you want to do okay we are going to continue on and fill up the entire mold all right starting from the edges and i always start from the edge because i always find that the chocolate will slowly drizzle into the middle anyway first layer is done check it out at this point if you want to fill in some bare open spots go ahead but remember back of your spoon very thin layers okay and we're gonna take a spatula and just clean up the edges a little bit let's put it in the freezer for about five minutes and we just brought it out check it out i want to zoom up close and show you look at there look at there are some bare open spots i'm telling you it's not a big deal because we're going to put our second layer right now okay same way that we did the first time if your melts have hardened you can put it in the microwave for about 30 to 50 seconds and heat it back up all right let's do the second layer same way back of your spoon coat it right in there nice and easy this technique is great because number one a it's pretty much mess free number two kids love doing this with this method it's the easiest way for them to do it just layer by layer it's like painting a picture and that's what you're doing you're painting the inside of your mold take your spatula scrape off the edges and back in the freezer for about five minutes here it is second layer check it out you can always touch it to make sure it's all dry that means it's ready i mean it's from here on out it's a home run okay guys the third final layer okay from the edge in and this is just to make it extra secure to make sure that your bomb does not crack when you peel it open okay we're set we're gonna scrape off and it's looking pretty ugly right now on the inside and we want it to look really ugly this is perfect and it goes in the freezer last time and cut your marshmallow ears you're gonna cut the smaller ones diagonally to make ears and then the bigger one section it into four cuts here's one two three and four and you're done we're gonna take some dark chocolate melts in a toothpick and add on the nose the nostrils and any kind of fun face like mouth features you want like an o or smile now your bombs are set look at this it looks absolutely crazy bad right now but trust me it's gonna be amazing there we go now we're getting ready to peel check it out we're gonna start pulling it in right in between each cavity you stretch the mold and it's super satisfying like this part i love because you're gonna start to hear a bit of like crackling noise it's awesome and i mean basically from here on out it's easy you push from the middle of the bomb and ta-da oh yeah it's shiny it's smooth it's amazing you're awesome here's a close-up from the middle push out and pop it is that simple guys and the kids love popping these bombs out great job team we are on our way to hot chocolate bomb heaven your silicone mold upside down and use it as a holder for your shells and we're gonna fill with a tablespoon in each shell there you go and then we're gonna fill it with all these little mini marshmallows [Music] basically squeeze around the rim of the cover of the shell and then i get my little guy to help me out any leftover residuals that squeeze out just take my finger glide off and then you're done you let it set another method is you heat up a pan you make sure it's not super hot but warm and then you take the top of the shell glide it over melt it just a tad and then you stick it on top of the bottom of the bomb this method i find you need to press down a little bit just so the top kind of presses against the bottom so you got to hold it just a tad let's decorate so you're going to melt your white melts for about 50 seconds 900 watts fill in your bag give it a stir put your bag in a cup and then you're going to fill your bag then you're going to sit the top and you're going to drizzle it add those fabulous sprinkles and then you're gonna put the horn on here are the ears these are the marshmallows you cut put on the eyeballs oh he can see baby and then the cute little nostril the mouth we got these little candy cupcake cases that come with the kit put it on top and you're set of course you want to see how the little guys do it [Music] now for the ketos i love to squeeze a chocolate on the parchment paper and let them dab it on it's easier for them [Music] here we go [Music] oh [Music] cheers you", "_knw68n7SaA": "good morning it's like 9 00 a.m finally rolled my butt out of bed thursday my first vlog is going up i'm so excited

we melted these down out of um dark chocolate chip like charred chocolate okay [Music] chocolate chip chunk so we're gonna correct we're gonna start by crushing more uh candy cane for ourselves it's messy so we've crushed up some candy cane for ourselves we've melted down some of our chocolate chip um into this beautiful creamy deliciousness we didn't have any silicone molds so i looked up a youtube video and hey the people really do come through this girl was making molds out of tin foil so we made little tinfoil circle molds out of our christmas ornament we just wrapped our christmas ornament around the tin foil and you got these little molds so essentially the chocolate's going to go in there like this so first thing you want to do is coat this am i right chef so coating inside your little tin foil pocket if you have silicone mold obviously go with that but if you're like us and don't have them on hand take a look-see see if there's any holes looks pretty good one little hole you can kind of see the hole yeah you wanted to get nice even layers but don't forget to do the other half [Music] we're gonna get another layer on to there too paint your first layer in put it in the fridge for five minutes freezer freezer maybe ten minutes if you want to be ambitious and then pull it out shove it full of stuff no we're going to paint it again paint it again freezer five minutes yeah 10 if you're ambitious if you're ambitious now shove it full of stuff okay so we got our first layer done it's been five to ten minutes we're gonna paint another layer into our tin foil babies um but they have seemed to harden nicely that's the stuff that's the stuff just the second layer is just thickening it up right yeah you're just thickening up the walls so you can handle it properly so we'll let the professional handle this half he's so much faster than me back in the freezer for another five to ten minutes make it look like it's going into my hand okay we're ready the chocolate has set and so what you're gonna do is you're just gonna peel the sides very gently yeah very gently and just peel them peel them back and there you go so it's gonna be very like this will probably melt in your fingers so just try not to hold it that much the edges aren't that straight the edges aren't going to be that strange as you can see so what we're going to do what we're going to do is we're going to take this hot pan it's very hot feel it against my face and just slowly oh my god that's amazing melted down and then now you have nicely even chocolate bits yeah oh my god it smells so good and then nice and even what am i an idiot sandwich my hands are really chocolate this one has a big hole in it see no that's fine it's fine it's all right chocolate powder chocolate powder in the indigo it's like a bath bomb this is how they do that lush pretty sure i'll take a bit of our candy cane more candy cane thank you you want to jam this so yes it's heaping but what we're gonna do is we're gonna cover it so we'll take our pan once again get it nice because you want it to be melty so we take this melted chocolate pop it on there and you can see i like to smooth the sides out with my fingers and then you have your chocolate bomb right there we'll take a spoon of our chocolate you want to just drizzle oh my god drizzle it out it looks so good just just dust it dust it and there you go layer of your peppermint chocolate bomb damn i got too high i got way too high i'm way too high damn i got too high i got way too high i'm way too high all right so trev and i are going in with our hot chocolate balms now and we decided to use hot water instead of hot milk just because we didn't really feel like we needed that much dairy in our lives and it pretty much ends up just as delicious if you ask me so here we go just plop them in and let them work their magic [Music] [Music] [Music] my mug is ginormous so it is taking forever for my bomb to go off but it's finally happening look at her go she's so beautiful all foamy and delicious it's like a tiny bubble bath for your hot chocolate balm to melt it don't forget to stir it stir it real good because you want to get all that delicious flavor mixed in and all that chocolate thoroughly and evenly melted i will say though after i noticed there was a lot of peppermint chunks in mine still so that wasn't exactly thrilling but don't forget to top it off with some marshmallows don't be afraid to go to ham on it like i did do it for the gram if you know what i mean and don't forget to have one for a [Music] snack [Music] i really wanted this to look so cute like i wanted this to look so pinteresty so i went like crazy with the candy cane chunks and just like kept crushing some in there but even though there was a bunch left in the bottom of my hot chocolate i regret nothing all right and there you have it two beautiful homemade hot chocolate balms fully decorated and ready to drink thanks for joining us i could just eat all the marshmallows off the top couldn't you oh they're all melting like take a spoon and be like oh they're so good i think it's time for a christmas movie elf yeah let's do it okay how cute this is good too [Music] too high i'm way too hot one day yep the camera just fell on my head [Laughter] [Music] so sorry", "z7DxujWx054": "[Upbeat music playing] [Upbeat

bombs chocolate bombs hot chocolate balm sorry hot chocolate bombs not to be confused with bath bombs don't eat bathroom bath bombs probably not very tasty but they make your water colorful they make your water colorful and this these these will make your milk colorful we have a bunch of different chocolates that we'll get into later we have two different molds what are do you say look what i have here so we have the lovely dreidel one uh for anybody celebrating the hanukkah not that these need to be um one the hanukkah monika right you can use the spheres here for christmas morning for everybody they don't have to be christmasy um they don't have to be for christmas they are just a fantastic way to make hot chocolate these little silicone guys and this one you can find on the uh the old internet website that sells everything that's right amazon now the only problem is um due to the current global situation i think there's a bit of a run on these there's different sizes these are the smalls really i wouldn't think those i don't know yeah why do people want that because there's a lot of people making these bath bombs no they're not hot chocolate bombs you could make bath bombs with that i'm trying to figure out okay let me finish my first thought these are small there's minis there's mediums and there's larges i think the largest are work the large would probably be like the size of this rim yeah like you'd have to have like an extra large cup of coffee um i've been trying to rack my brain around if you can do these without them i think you could like any silicone mold you have like if you have a muffin tin you can make it work we have the little cupcake ones you could do those if you're using a plastic mold you have to make sure it's got some depth to it so that you can fill it with some cocoa which we'll show you in a minute um but yeah i really feel like you need to go out and buy one of these other than this abby are there any other ingredients um yes there are you can find them right here and at cookingwithdavid.com and cookingwithabby.com where you can also find the video but at the end of the day at the end of the day whatever chocolate you have um cocoa powder sugar powder and like toppings and your uncles there you go um grampy's brother well there you go apparently we're referring to him um rebecca should we get started my dear we shall oh lovely first thing we need to do for our chocolate bombs i think we're calling them right because they're like bath bombs but they're for milk we are going to melt up our chocolate now we have how many pieces of chocolate before us here well we have lots of pieces five five different kinds abs go through it uh um milk chocolate milk chocolate white chocolate butter scotch peppermint and orange so totally not chocolate but could probably taste good because everything here we're keeping in mind is gonna taste nice in milk any chocolate that you like eating go for it we have a separate thing of white that we're gonna add some food coloring to later um but you can buy um pre-dyed free colored chocolates but they're not really chocolate so you know this one likes eating them because they're sugar we all like sugar but you really want to look for listen you do you if you're making these as gifts go to town get really good chocolate otherwise don't worry about it just buy real chocolate uh baker's chocolate works as well obviously keep in mind if you're getting uh really dark chocolate well that's gonna taste like kind of bittery milk and not everybody's like 70. chocolate hot chocolate so the other thing and yes abby's right these are far higher in the cacao range so you don't have to just use that and we'll get to that in a minute we're gonna melt this in the microwave we're gonna get going and doing all of that now uh we're gonna making melting into the microwave one don't turn it into a liquid in the microwave go in kind of fits and starts right so do like 15 seconds at a time stir it if there's still a lot of chunks do another 15 seconds stir it and see if you can't get it to melt on its own versus bring it to a liquid in the microwave because you're we're not tempering chocolate you want to temper chocolate you go you temper tempering chocolate is getting it precisely two and i'll put it here if i'm wrong but i'm pretty sure it's 90 degrees fahrenheit and when it dries what happens is this is tempered chocolate so now it's hard when i do this it snaps so that's because it was brought to the correct temperature and it was tempered properly i don't really care that much because we're using a mold and because we're pretty good at milk so who really cares anyway enough blabbing we are going to cut to some other footage of us melting all these chocolates and then get to the fun part of doing our first coat in our mold [Music] boom chocolate melted that was totally easy didn't take long at all again the milk chocolate one whatever the butter or scotch whatever that's not real chocolate so that melted very quickly the the milk chocolate we melted that was like a really good example of seeing still quite a few pieces of chocolate in there and not melting it completely so that's what you're after the white chocolate did well these two we're not sure which is which anymore i can smell you can smell it one smells like orange orange pepper in it all right so we have our molds we have a whole bunch of spoons you you can go hardcore right away i did i did some test batches where i just went with one thick coat and boom went in i think two things one if you have a whole bunch of little paint brushes really good idea to use some paint brushes so what i would do and i'm going to do a couple here i'm going to show you guys and then turn it over to you guys so i'm going to put in quite a bit of chocolate here and then i'm going to come up what we're doing what we really want to do is is relatively even coat though it doesn't really matter if you see any of the mold at the bottom you want to try make sure you get chocolate all over the mold what about the little handle in the little handle as well that one which pretty sure the handle is gonna break and what you're really looking to do is come up to the edge now this mold is a lot more uh intricate than than the other uh than the round one and as i mentioned the round one they're a little hard to find right now because everybody's going crazy so we got i think these are the simplest small these are the smallest um different sizes different things so boom that's with a with a brush and if you're using a more intricate mold like this guy that's what you want to do now if we're using a spoon and let me use one of these guys mint so what i was going to suggest i think i hinted at earlier if you're doing um like a darker chocolate what i'm planning on doing with these is we'll do half the dark chocolate half the milk chocolate same with the butterscotch so that we don't have to do all of it with a darker chocolate so here coat your back your spoon get in there okay and again the idea is get solid coverage make sure your rim gets your your corner here that's not a corner what is that looks like the top the edge make sure the edge the top get some chocolate because what it's going to want to do is fall into it so yeah that's it the only thing you have to remember with this guy is make sure you get the right one at the right spot the other thing is as your chocolate what what what i did last time around do these as is put in the fridge for like two minutes and then come back and bring it up to the edge and that'll build it up so what we're gonna do we're gonna fill all of we're gonna use all of our chocolate here we're gonna use it all up as much as we can we're going to put these in the fridge we're going to let them set while they're sitting in the fridge we'll come back and we'll show you a couple other things but uh first things first let's get cracking on these go which one do you to do [Music] i lied people i said we were going to use up all of our chocolate we're not we're going to use half of our chocolate because this is just the first pass right we're going to come back and we're going to do a second pass to make our walls a little thicker wait does it do i have to like add extra like for this one doesn't matter what order i put it on no just kind of remember and try keep your chocolate in your mold because that's all wasted oh i thought we had to bring it up there no you want to bring it up to the sides not over the sides uh another thing to note folks should your chocolate suddenly feel as though it's getting a little too thick guess what microwave it again now when you really melt it obviously it's already pretty melted so you really only want to hit it for like a few seconds in the microwave not very long at all it's thickening up all of it yeah so another thing the brittle ones we're gonna do them all white um we could do a white one over here as well and we'll definitely do a couple of white ones over here as well just so we have some variety but again you do you man whatever you think is coolest and something i told abby is um and i may have fast forwarded through it but you want to make sure that the you get the chocolate in the holes and not all over the rim because really can't do anything with the chocolate on their own listen you're going to get some on the room it's fine we have a heart we have a heart look at the heart isn't it beautiful oh my goodness what is our heart made of it's made of candy canes we got some marshmallows we got some candy canes we have some cocoa and we have some sugar nice our chocolates uh first coat is in the freezer setting up we'll re-melt the chocolate after add our second coat while we're waiting what we're going to do is we're going to get our our insides ready so who doesn't love marshmallows in their cocoa so we're going to cut these in half because they're a little big so rebecca's going to cut those in half and they're the minis if you buy the big ones you really want to cut them small um we're not going to put them in every one of them yes absolutely we have some candy cane we're going to break that up as well now a word on what the else we could spill with these um your imagination people whatever you want walleye sugar jabber cocoa pure cocoa taco taco sugar cocoa cocoa cocoa cocoa modern people um so i'm making my own sort of uh whatchamacallit here hot chocolate mix regardless of what you stick in you want to put no that's not loud at all regardless of what other goodness you put in or what color your chocolate is or any of that fun stuff you definitely want to put some cocoa powder in here right there as well i don't know if i would do the chocolate syrup now i have been thinking about doing an adult version of this with some baileys in there i'll let you guys know how that works out because that's totally going to happen so in the milky foot bailey's or in the super bailey in the middle uh speaking of adult versions uh definitely drop a couple of these in your coffee because that's yummy anyway coffee is good for kids too dude watch your thumb man coffee is not for kids i drink coffee no you don't you've had coffee once more than once uh half this size you can't what are you talking about you're gonna slam it weakling [Laughter] and we're going to come back and we're going to assemble our we're going to go to the hospital and get some stitches on her that's going to be separate i don't recommend blood in your balls and your bombs bombs i was looking for the word bomb when i saw she's gotten off her fingers lovely job i can what are you doing ladies and gentlemen boys and girls how long did we put these in the freezer for you buddy i don't know but it took us 10 minutes yeah important thing to do that i didn't do make sure you de-mold all of them and then put them back in the middle so de-molding is very easy on these you can go see what i did i don't want to no you can't so here you can't poke from the middle damn those look good oh now i said they no don't leave them back where they were just make sure you get them on [Music] uh so we're gonna unmold all of these we're gonna come back we're gonna do our final assembly look at this one i know they're cool they highly recommend the tiger stripes ladies gentlemen boys and girls the unmolding we had a casualty one of these went flying it survived this guy broke a little bit in the corner did you do a close-up the dreidels are a little more um finicky fragile fragile not fernicky these are weird here's what i'm going to do i am going to take one of these over here now a teaspoon seems to be the right amount of cocoa as i said we made our own we also have some of the old little store-bought variety here which is just as good so take a teaspoon uh figure out who you want to be your bottom put in your teaspoon now i'm going to do one of the powders here on this guy this is unequal bottom top bottom top bottom top top and you want to get it all on the inside now if you're doing other thingies on the inside as well so we're going to put a couple of marshmallows in this guy i'm going to put a couple pieces of dust in here and if you just let me finish this then i will say go for your question what's up um are we gonna do like half half like white and your question is a beautiful segue so you want to do white so now what we do is we take out one of our whites our other half's here he says so we're going to do it this way and y'all do you you could what we have here is a frying pan this frying pan is warm oh maybe it's too cold now yeah it's too cold now we got to warm up our frying pan stay right there don't go anywhere no no stop it don't go anywhere you didn't go anywhere did you or was it this hand i don't even remember anymore our pan warm hot not hot not scolding take your your half your um dome put it on top spin it a little bit you want to melt it that melts the chocolate not too much then you come over here and put it in and boom you stick it to your other half applying some pressure and look what you got now that's half of a half you can come in here and you can spin it around if you got some edges you gotta find the sweet spot for our temperature here because our pan you don't want your pan too hot you don't want it too cold either now i'm just spinning it around in the pan and boom bob's your uncle the other thing you can do before we get stuffing is our edges aren't that clean so before you do your bottoms you can just hit your bottoms a little bit to make them um smoother so i think that's what we're going to do first actually put that back we're going to do all of our little bottoms here or half of them no you guys are going to do it i'm just showing you what to do so that your edges are nice and clean not that it matters because this guy looks pretty pretty bomb what you just lost something i did lose some because i didn't have a great seal and that's that's okay because it's gonna taste good it's coffee it's not coffee it's hot cocoa what are you doing you could add coffee to this you could add instant coffee that would be another excellent variation ready we're gonna warm this up we're gonna do some close-ups and we'll be right back boom we're done we did them all what wait we did them all some with varying success all with chocolate all over ourselves my apron is covered with chocolate wow is that like the first time we use this here we have some food gel why gel you say because chocolate doesn't like liquid so we can't really do the the normal food dye you get you kind of have to get the gel one now this what's this for ooh in addition to blue you could do any color under the rainbow oh blue and white rory g bibbs these really look like yeah and i don't know if that has a view so you want to get it kind of dripping a little bit you want to load up your spoon listen there's no rules here people we should spin the dreidels then once we win it we put it in our hot chocolate and then we're making up all kinds of games that was bad that was just a big old clump on that one that didn't look very nice it's okay these are for us we don't hear about looks sure we do totally affect the taste the other thing you can do is if you have any other leftover chocolate get it again flowing a little bit i highly recommend the tiger ones people they look fantastic and as far as i'm concerned they're coming out way better than this guy yeah all right we're going to warm up our our milk of choice here and we're going to come back regular milk and half hot chocolate hot cocoa regular milk's the best ladies and gentlemen boys and girls the time has the time has come to sample and have a little cocoa action we each have to take different ones i'm going to take drinks beautiful mug look at this beautiful mug look at my beautiful mug i am enjoying a little soy beverage due to the lactose intolerance i kind of feel like the dreidel one has to go in there but yeah the dreidel has gone maybe we don't just spice it up no no no it has to go in there i i just want to highlight that the next time we do it the drizzling on top cute the drizzling before is the way to go i will you're dropping it all over you sorry uh apparently your seams you know need to matter a little bit uh but totally totally gonna do these tighter eyes which one do you want rebecca here let me hear rebecca oh well i was going to give that something for you i'm just going to give that to him i'm going to go oh yeah i'm going in all right i'm going to go this one um you could listen this is definitely not full it's only half and all of them are a little low oh the butterscotch good idea oh i made it so i wanted to try it oh you know what we're going to have to do we're going to have to do a zoom in for you guys in the stirry stirry on the cookie i feel like i want two me too which is totally an option we also get to tell the difference between the tim horton's hot chocolate and our hot chocolate enjoy [Music] [Music] we're making more white chocolate ones this is amazing the butterscotch which i thought was going to be nasty i don't know what did you think it was good i don't you don't like soy milk apparently no one loves the soy milk so you didn't even try it i did i tried it that one which was just the butterscotch so good butterscotch and milk totally do that one oh i just got this has no this went back to white i just got a little piece of um mine was the orange chocolate one ball two ball experiment can i add another one gifts uh no we're not gonna have any more balls should be two bombs they're not balls they're bombs um totally you again you gotta go get the molds so if you can't get the molds you can't really do these but go find the molds they're inexpensive they're awesome melt some chocolate this is like totally a fun thing to do on a saturday afternoon um i would wake up in the morning i would make these i make them a friday night so i can have them go play in the snow for an hour come back inside warm up some milk drop in some bombs slurp some hot cocoa what's not to love oh we're so happy in the winter we're still having frozen running zombies these are going to be in the freezer at all times and you probably keep them in the fridge but the freezer will be better you guys come over you guys come over to our house i like your your workstation here which is completely covered in milk everything thank you very much for watching uh we're going to come back with i think one more episode this may be the last of the season but i think we'll do one more thank you for watching share with your friends if you like this um subscribe subscribe and turn on post notifications no one really cares about all this thank you for watching bye bye see you next week", "LK-kiHvBnJg": "hi friends this is Susy your candy crush guru starting at the very beginning of candy crush on the new platform just to show you folks of the basics here so this is our screen we have got probably sound right now some music I don't prefer playing with the music this gear allows me to turn off the sound and the music if I have questions about the game I can press this whether I'm in or out of a level and then when I'm actually in a level there'll be another button here it's a red door and then let me get out of the level if I have made a move on this new platform I think it lets me get out without any loss of life if I made one move that I'm effectively quitting by losing so that's the gear that can help you we've got our life meter here we've got our gold bar counter here and we've got our envelope here where our friends can send us lives and also we will have mini games listed here so let's jump in and see what this game is all about it's called a match-three game on our first level we need to get 300 points and six moves and we do that by matching the colors of candies and of course you could say the shapes of candies if you're colorblind okay this is mr. toffee and I'm gonna skip him and I'm just going to show you it says that it wants us to match this red here with these two red so we pull it over but I could just as easily do the orange here or the yellow here or the green here or the any any three that I want to match or more I'm going to do this one because it's going to set me out to make another match with the yellow notice now I have five lives and they still have the target of 300 and I've got this meter to show me as well now what happened here is four got matched together and it made a striped candy this is vertically striped so when it detonates it will take out this entire column if I get one horizontally striped it'll take out a row so we're just going to make these moves we got our three stars and now on the new platform I talked about being on the new platform it's an html5 platform that's the coding that's used it's not a flash platform like there used to be and they've made differences to the game and one of the differences is that when we beat a level on a very first try we get a golden crown to mark our spot so I'm not going to share with my friends actually don't have any friends on this account it's a new one to show the new platform okay so there's mr. toffee and now this should turn into a golden crown level sometimes it doesn't do it right away and I need to actually exit before it'll show that there's a little crown here it's giving me my 3 stars and I go on to level 2 as we progress we're going to have different things we need to accomplish but these first few are going to be the same we're going to have to get points 1,900 points in 15 moves so now here mr. toffee is saying that there are specials that can be made instead of matching 3 he wants us to match 4 we're going to look around the board but yeah that looks like a good spot to match for now we saw a vertically striped candy this is going to be horizontally striped because I'm pulling this across so that makes a horizontal stripe so it will take out that row when I go ahead and release it it's showing me it wants me to do this move but I see a different move I want to move this purple up here because I want to make what's called a cascade it's when I make a move and then at least one subsequent move is made and hopefully even more look at that look at all of those moves created not only that but we got some specials created as well this is called a raft candy we've seen what a striped candy can do a raft candy explodes this block of 9 and then it kind of drops down and makes another explosion but even more than that I've got the last kind of special that we can make on this board available to me that's when I match 5 together all in a straight row I'll have to show you how to match these these were just kind of divinely dropped in our lab but this is how we make a color bomb a color bomb is this this chocolate sparkly ball and if I push it with this purple then it will take out all purple on the board and the reason that's so effective is with one less color on the board everything else is more concentrated and it's easier to make more matches and specials but instead what I'm going to do is I'm going to match it with this other special with this wrapped candy because what it's going to do is it's going to turn all of the orange on the board into wrapped candies and you'll see the explosions that happen on the board because of that so these explode and they take out those blocks of nain and look what happens we got another color bomb so let's see if I can show you well we're making specials I'm going to try to line something up here but it's tough to do to create specials oh there we go we got one but I don't see a good opportunity to drop it in with this one ooh here we go this is what I'm going to do so now I have these yellow here and if I pull it across like this it's going to make one of those stripes right so now combining a color bomb with a striped candy will turn all the yellows on the board into stripes and if they're striped vertically they'll take out columns horizontally and they'll take out rows all right so that is the second level here you're getting the concept of how to create specials look at that and I'll show you just one of these exploding I could go ahead and make another wrapped candy as I do this oh I didn't show you how to make the wrapped candies wrapped candies are made usually by an owl or a tea so you see how there's almost a backward L here I could do this or an upside down L I could do this and then sometimes it's a tea formation and don't have to show you that when we've got the opportunity so I'm going to do this out and that makes another wrapped candy and then I can make another color bomb and the color bomb when it just takes out one color it concentrates everything else so more specials are likely to be made like that okay that's level two and there again I get my passed it on the first try awesome wonderful thing here alright let's see if it's going to give it to us on the map screen sometimes it does sometimes it waits until we come back in that's not going to show us on to level three again we've got 4,000 points in 18 moves that's what our goal is and this keeps track of our moves and we can see visually where we are on the points meter here okay and I'll show you the red door - there's the red door and here's the question mark that tells us about how to play and the next one will tell us all of these various specials I'm teaching you about so if you need a refresher you can go there okay so remember how I showed you the L this is the t formation we almost have a sideways T here if I move this purple over I'll have a T of purple and that will give me that wrapped candy okay and now we've seen what C we've seen what the stripe does on its own right it takes out a column or a row I'm going to take out this column and I'm also going to set this up now watch what happens when we combine a striped candy with a wrapped candy instead of taking out a column or a row well let's do this if you match a stripe with a stripe it's going to take out both a column and a row if you match it with a raft it's going to take out three columns and 3 rows now I'm going to use these two together and they're both in the same row so it's going to take out this row the row above and the row below it's also going to take out one column the column to the right in the column to the left but these two are in different columns so I get to choose is this going to be my pivotal color do I want to take out this column then this one in this one or do I want to take out this column and this one in this one generally I want to go for the center so I'm going to use this is the pivot and that means I'm going to push this red one into this purple here and that will make this the center column so all three of those get removed and you can see it's a big bonus for points so here's how we make stripes you see these four just about ready to line up I push it over but sometimes I can try to make color bonds you can try to drop this purple down and then this green would put be put here but unfortunately that would match with all three green so that's not going to work but I always look for those opportunities when I have the ability to make a stripe I look for opportunities to turn them into color bonds if any of them here's another stripe I can't get a red here so I'll make another stripe oh here's our wrapped candy again so I can show you now the same thing here I can choose which way to send it off actually I'm going to go ahead and do this sometimes when I don't take a move that I have available they lose the opportunity to use that move at all because something will explode so if I want to use this I should remember how the one to the right is the one that we used as the pivot now I'm gonna push the purple into the red and it's going to shift everything over a bit let's see those three columns are removed make a few more stripes here and this is how we match up the candies and go for those [Music] those combos and those specials okay so now I finally have the opportunity to put two stripes together and this operates the same way they're both in this row so they're gonna take out this row and I have to decide do I want this column or this column removed I want this column removed I don't know why just on a whim so I'm gonna push this into this one there we go and that can be really crucial on some of the advanced levels when you're trying to reach specific areas of the board to determine which columns or rows are going to be taken out we're going to try to fly through the next two while this recording is going there we go I think this is the color bomb one we need 4500 points and 15 moves oh no it's going to show us what we already know how to combine these guys we don't have to take a suggestion but we can and now what I'd like to do is make a color bomb you see how these green are almost operating together but I need that green down there so when you get this yellow down here but then I'm gonna get this green down here oh well it didn't quite work sometimes that happens too I could still keep trying to get a green but unfortunately there's another green above it and that's not going to be helpful to me but it doesn't really matter I've got all the points I would ever need on this board so now it's just a matter of kind of playing around with this to see what we can do here we go here's a color bomb no more stripes what I would like to do is maybe make another color bomb I couldn't quite do it with the blue let's just keep making more stripes here oops there we go wasn't paying attention to how many moves they had left once I've completed the mission I kind of ignore everything else okay so level five and I guess this is going to be their color bomb get 5,000 points no oh here we go to match five candies to create another special candy we're going to create that color bomb and now notice that we've got a much smaller screen here it's more difficult to make matches and specials because we've got a limited area if we've got a caller bomb on the board we can always have a move because all we have to do is combine this with anything and we'll take out a color if points were important to me I would count to see how many red orange and blue I have and I would take out the most prevalent color on the board to me it looks like it might be red or blue I'll just take out all red concentrates the colors and when that happens oftentimes I get another color bomb or other specials because I've let's try to make another one here because I've concentrated those colors down I'd like to show you how to combine these guys together but in such a limited field it's hard to get to color bombs together so that's going to have to be for another video and notice them playing pretty quickly because I've already met my goal so there's no need to do anything else now something else I want to show you is that when the game is all over and all of my moves have been used I still get the points and the reactions of all of these specials I have so I still get the opportunity to reach my three stars if I wanted so that is the first five levels of candy crush if you have any questions please put something in the comment section and I would be happy to help you as quickly as possible if you'd like to see more videos you can subscribe and as always thanks for watching", "HvxANDRMADo": "[Music]", "CPPflSI3pvY": "[Music] thank you for purchasing your holiday limited diy box in this video i'll be showing you how to create your very own chocolate bombs for part one of this video you will need the mold the chocolate wafers a microwavable bowl and a mixing spoon first you're going to take the entire bag of chocolate wafers and place them into the bowl you're going to want to microwave this for at least 15 second intervals making sure your string in between you're really looking for a thick but smooth consistency so this is about 45 seconds in the microwave but the time may vary depending on your microwave settings if the consistency is thinner than what i have let the chocolate cool down for about a minute and it should thicken up now taking your mold i'm gonna fill each one of these with about one tablespoon of melted chocolate now carefully spread the chocolate with the back of your spoon you're really going to focus on the edges because this is probably the most crucial part of the entire chocolate balm so see how i have little um holes here what you can do is you can use the paintbrush provided and just kind of paint it over so it's a little bit smoother and that you covered all those little spots kind of push the chocolate up to the edges a little bit more now it doesn't have to be smooth because once you close this up you won't even see this [Music] so when you're done spreading the chocolate you're just going to place this in the fridge for about 10 minutes to set once your chocolate molds are done gently pop out the chocolate by slowly peeling the silicone back look how nice and smooth that is so when you're done you'll notice the uneven edges but we'll clean this up by placing them on a hot plate to heat up a hot plate place it in the microwave for 60 seconds but be extra careful because a plate will be hot make sure you use oven mitts or ask an adult to help once you have the hot plate ready take one of the halves and quickly twist the edges into the plate this only takes a few seconds so you need to move quick look at those edges you'll do this to three of the halves and once you're done you're gonna place them in the fridge to set [Music] now that the three halves have set you can start filling them with a hot chocolate mix and marshmallows depending on the size of your mug you could use one to two tablespoons of hot chocolate mix with one tablespoon of marshmallows feel free to add a little bit more depending on the size of your mug once your bums are filled we will now connect them to make it whole to seal them together you will twist the other untouched half onto the warm plate and place it gently on top of the filled half making sure that they are aligned once all three are done place them in the fridge for a few minutes while you're waiting prep your station for the decorating stage so we've just taken these out of the fridge and now here comes the fun part the decorating included in your kit are red white and green candy melts which i've already microwaved for 20 seconds each we've also included three types of sprinkles and a bit of cocoa powder using the stir sticks provided you'll give your candy melts a quick stir paying close attention to the consistency it should be a lot thinner than the chocolate wafers that way it glides onto the chocolate balms a lot smoother once your glazing is complete take your sprinkles of choice our favorite is a candy crush and sprinkle it all over as you please now enjoy by adding a cup of hot milk and a sprinkle of cocoa i hope you enjoyed our video and thank you again for purchasing our diy kids for

product that i have not worked with before and it is called the flexi pat sphere tray the reason it is different than what i've used before is because this is a hundred percent platinum silicone has no woven glass in it so it's more sturdy and the sphere shape is going to help me today to for the first time ever to create hot chocolate cocoa bombs so what i have done is melted in the flexi pan which does have woven glass and silicone in it i have melted chocolates and just chocolate chips in my microwave for one to two minutes and i'm using the magnetic measuring spoon and the tablespoon size and i put once one measuring tablespoon in there before and just let it kind of dry air dry here on my counter and then i'm taking the second one in and putting some more another layer of chocolate going around the sphere with the back of the measuring spoon and then i am going to fill it by turning the magnetic measuring spoon around and filling it with a tablespoon of a hot cocoa mix that my mom used to make and i'm going to put that in there and i will make a recipe so you can enjoy that homemade hot cocoa mix as well and then i love mint so i'm going to add some mint chocolate chips into this one as well then i'm going to take the chocolate and go back over and close all of these spheres and then freeze them pop them out and tomorrow morning i will pour hot boiling milk on it and have a homemade hot chocolate balm one of the things i love the most about working with the bun cook products is they allow me the courage to try things that i've never tried before and to make them at home to put in the ingredients that i want to put in and i always enjoy the process and have success and with very little experience i can add any flavor to these as i would want i was thinking salted caramel would be wonderful melted peppermint raspberry i was even thinking one of our balsamics maybe a little bit of a blackberry balsamic or the blueberry to add a flavor to these chocolates as well i'll let you know in part two how these turn out for the very first time ever thank you for joining me here at cook with jody", "twVXbdC71dQ": "good morning everyone welcome to break time cravings and breaks and cravings for the heart i am so excited to share this new recipe it is absolutely fantastic and extremely popular i will be sharing the chocolate balm recipe with you guys today i've been waiting for this molding for about two months it's been out of stock everywhere the ingredients that i will be uh working with today are marshmallows i have a chocolate powder i have crushed candy canes peppermint um that was leftover from december this here is a flavor burst of cinnamon streusel and this is the dark chocolate that i will be melting in a pot you know what let's start making this recipe and making deliciousness for our friends and our families to enjoy valentine's day first thing is to melt these chocolate coins with low heat when placed on the stove let's go to the stove here's our melted chocolate i'm just going to place it down for a bit so that it cools off in the meantime i am just going to get this molder prepared for the chocolate and i also want to talk to you about saint valentine because i myself celebrated saint valentine's as you know a day of friendship being very thoughtful with those that you love which is a great thing but i never knew the actual story about saint valentine who was a catholic priest and uh during the third century the emperor was recruiting young men for the military and getting married was actually very discouraged during that time however saint valentine was able to marry these engaged couples secretly and once the emperor found out this was happening st valentine was incarcerated and he was asked to renounce his faith in order to keep his life uh but saint valentine did the total opposite he decided to keep his faith and earn life in the eternal kingdom of god and that is the story of saint valentine that is what we celebrate on february the 14th now for the fun stuff this chocolate is ready i'll do two spoons two scoops and then i'm just gonna spread it over make sure that the edge on the top is thick when it firms up it it won't crack in the edges now that it's all ready we're gonna place and refrigerate for 10 minutes and then once we take it out we're gonna include all these ingredients stay tuned here are the chocolate balms i just removed them from the fridge and here is a heated uh plate i just heated it in the microwave for 60 seconds because what we're gonna do now is very important time to remove the chocolate bombs let's see how it came out see oh so cool and that's the inside this is the hot plate so what we're gonna do is melt the edge i'll leave it there for a little bit while i remove the second one so that seems to be good enough now let's fail while this one is melting we're gonna start uh filling in the the inside uh so i have my powdered chocolate i have the peppermint candy cane we're still very festive here okay the cinnamon and the marshmallows so cool oh this is so nice and i have forgotten about this is very melted now so i am gonna seal this chocolate cutie there we go [Music] i've placed our chocolate balms uh in the middle of this upside down cupcake pan with parchment paper oh let me shake up this food coloring which is a pearl color and let me start spraying oh they look like snowballs now oh so adorable i love it i love it i love it okay i guess we'll let it dry these chocolate balms are ready for packaging so i am gonna place them in this parchment paper adorable this is the packaging that i have arranged for this chocolate balm i can't wait to try it i hope you have a beautiful valentine's day and see you next time", "1HgS8QmnrrQ": "is it a boy is it a girl the suspense is driving me crazy so today i'm going to show you how to make gin revealed chocolate bombs using some melted chocolate in white pink and blue and some other tools that we're going to go through right now here's my mold and i have a plastic toothpick that i've dipped in melted blue chocolate and as you can see i'm dipping it onto the mold to create a dot pattern so i'm going to continue to do that in all the cups there and since this is a gender reveal themed chocolate balm i'm going to add melted pink chocolate to add to the theme [Music] now that that's all done i'm going to put this in the fridge to harden all right it's out of the fridge and now i'm going to add the white melted chocolate so i just took a dollop about a tablespoon and i put them in the cups i'm actually only going to work on four of the cups not all the six and i'm going to try to move around the chocolate but as you can see it's not really budging so what i'm going to do is take this tablespoon and gently work the chocolate to cover the entire part of the cups so you want to do this gently so you don't take off the dots that are on the mold so just continue going on add some more chocolate to make sure everything is covered you want it to be covered throughout the entire cup of the mold and it's very important to add some extra on the outside as you see me doing there because this is going to be very important when it comes to putting both pieces of the chocolates both halves of the spear together and then wiping it across like that helps create that ridge very very important so that's the finished product at least so far next you're going to want to flip the mold upside down as you see me doing there and put it in the fridge to harden so i've gone ahead and done those steps and now i'm going to turn it over and i can see the cups okay so i'm going to very gently loosen up the cups there on the mold and then release the chocolate half circle so there is the first one okay now in a separate container i have some lemon extract and i added some pearl dust this one's blue because it's going to be a boy gender reveal chocolate balm and i just you know mix it up and i painted it to the cup so this is nice and glittery and it will add to the surprise the gender reveal part of the chocolate pop all right so let's let it sit down for a bit and dry maybe you know five minutes now it's time to add your hot chocolate so i've got some white hot chocolate here so i'm just adding it now i'm going to add some blue marshmallows again with the boy gender reveal theme so if you need to adjust marshmallows i suggest putting some gloves on as you see i have here and now i need to melt the edge of the chocolate pop so you see there this is a hot pan i have that melts the chocolate and i'm going to very quickly put it on top of the other half of the bomb so i did this very quickly because that's very important now it's good to go so i'm gonna put it in a cupcake wrapper and place it in the fridge so we can harden a bit more isn't it adorable [Music] i have some hot steamed milk ready to go let's watch this thing pop do so thank you so much for watching my gender reveal chocolate pop video make sure you check out my other chocolate pop videos coming up and subscribe to yay fun times see you later", "MIwCVNZ8szE": "hey what's up guys my name is sanjay and welcome to the gentleman's plate the new thing this year is michelada if you've been anywhere on tik tok you'll know that mitchell bombs are trending i actually did a video a couple of days ago with a fizzing mitchell bomb since that video i have been doing more research there are a lot of people selling round frozen mixture bombs you know it looked like more like a hot cocoa bomb but for your beer turns out that they're actually just frozen michelada mix so the way i'm making it today i don't know if it's gonna qualify as like a bomb i'm calling it a michelada pinata because when it opens up there's gonna be lots of surprises inside but if you stick around with me we're going to learn how to make the shell the filling and the chamoy that goes on top so traditionally micheladas are made with clamato i'm a vegan so i'm using vegetable juice or v8 juice first i'm going to reserve a cup of the juice because i'm going to leave a little bit of head space in the bottle since we're adding a lot of different ingredients you want to get yourself a nice big jug so we have some space to mix everything into and then the first ingredient is this class tamarindo uh fresca powder it's basically going to give us some sweet and sour i'm going to do two tablespoons of that tamarindo power followed by tahin which is if you don't know one of the best seasonings ever we're going to do two tablespoons of tahin and next up we have chamoy chamoy is basically a sweet and sour plum sauce we're going to do two tablespoons of chamoy now to add some meat we're going to add some tabasco sauce you can use any kind of hot sauce you like i like the scorpion sauce because it's nice and spicy so two tablespoons or according to your taste and then i'm going to add a dab of this insanity sauce this is a ghost pepper sauce just a little bit and for flavor we've got maggie hugo sauce which is maggie's latino version of a seasoning sauce this is similar to gold amount sauce we're going to do one tablespoon of that and traditionally we're going to use pepper release two teaspoons of black pepper and celery salt which is very common in michelada we're gonna do two teaspoons or try to do two teaspoons of celery salt now to add the sourness and a little bit more you know michelada oomph we're gonna do two bottles of these lucas this is lucas mango flavor you can use any flavor of lucas if you'd like and for extra sourness we're going to do the juice of one lemon and you want to give that a nice good stir when it's done we're going to pour it back in the bottle and give it a good shake now that reserve juice that we had on the side you can put some back in if you want to mellow out the flavor or you could just drink it basically now here comes the fun part if you are a part of the hot cocoa bomb craze over the winter you'll probably have these silicone molds if you don't that's okay you can grab these on amazon for fairly cheap there's going to be a link in the description below because they're kind of flimsy i'm going to put them on a cutting board to keep them stable now i chilled my mitchell out of mix earlier so it's nice and cold and we're gonna fill up each cavity because the silicone molds are not so stable you want to just try to get it to the top as much as possible if it spills over a little you can just adjust the mat and um fill it over if it's a little extra more than the mall you can cut that out later now once you get this cavities filled you're gonna go and put this in the freezer for no more than two hours you can do one and a half to two hours that's the magic number to get it when it's just semi-solid two hours later of course my camera died at the most crucial part but luckily i have this footage but basically you just want to get a spoon and start scraping now this has been frozen for an hour and a half and so it's soft enough to scrape but also strong enough to hold its shape um you just want to start getting in there and i find that scraping through the sides is the most efficient way to do this of course pick up any of the leftover bits and put that to the side and again the circular side to side scraping motion is the most efficient for me now of course you want to be careful because it's all a balancing act you don't want to go too slow because you don't want these to melt the more they melt the weaker they are but you also want to make it deep enough and hollow enough so you can fit more stuff in there if they end up cracking for some reason you can fill it up with a little bit more juice to kind of fix that crack but you want to be as careful as possible so you can see here i think i did a good enough job but i might have gone too deep you know the the bottoms have to be strong enough to hold pressure later so what you can do is you can take some of your leftover juice or some of the bits you just scraped and just simply just pour a few drops in just for pour a few drops in because that the base is gonna you know be the most important part that's what we're gonna press down on so now our hollow shells are ready for the freezer you can freeze them for a minimum of three hours but i'm going to just go ahead and do them overnight just so that they're perfectly ready to handle later now we're going to make the chamois chamoy is made with bulbarindo which is a tamarind paste candy you need 12 pieces of bulb burrindo volporendo comes in different flavors including watermelon and mango so if you wanted to make a watermelon you would use watermelon bulbrindo with watermelon lucas i put about two tablespoons of water just so that i can get it going we're going to cook it on medium high flame just until it's mushy enough and melted enough we don't want to burn this you want to keep going until you feel like it's nice paste consistency and then you're going to follow that up with a half a cup of chomoy and keep cooking that until you can break up as many of the lumps as you can next up we're going to do a half a cup of tahin and for lucas we're going to put three bottles of lucas powder again if you want to make just a particular flavor use that flavor of glucose now you want to cook it on low flame just until the point where it's thick and you can taste it and adjust the flavor so i've added two tablespoons of sugar because it was a little too sour for me and it continued tasting and adjusting as needed again i'm doing this on a low flame and you can check the consistency by running a finger through the spoon you want to get the consistency to a point where if you run a finger through it's not going to immediately set back so here it's nice and thick and you can see with the spoon test that it worked you're going to put in a glass container or something while it's hot now it's important to note that this paste will thicken up as it's cooling so you want to get it to that right temperature and you'll know it's done because you'll see how smooth and velvety it is look at those ribbons of deliciousness all right now let's stuff this pinata so i've got these pika tamarindo candies they're little bite-sized pieces of tamarind covered in sugar salt and chilies and then we've got these hot cherry locusts which are basically the same thing but they're sweet cherry flavor nice uh nice size here on these guys very tasty and then we're going to use the pulp burrito from earlier we're just going to use some kitchen scissors and cut them into bite size pieces now you can put whatever candies you want i found these sweet heat skittles for a little sweet and spicy and then you've got these scandinavian swimmers they're basically sour candies i'm a vegan so these are perfect for me you can use any candy you want these tama rocca candies these are a little straw type of thing so they're going to be perfect as a swizzle stick they're made out of tamarind they're also sweet and spicy you guessed it [Music] now for garnish and extra stuffing we're going to use some lime pieces we're going to cut some small pieces to put inside of the bombs themselves that'll be a fun little surprise and then some for the cup now when you take your pieces out of the freezer you want to work quickly this is how we're going to assemble it here you can use the side of the silicone to basically just pop these bad boys right out and you get a nice perfect shape here i'm gonna put them in little um bowls here you can also put them with little cupcake liners to make them nice and and pretty and then you can just start stuffing them with your candy so a little bit of everything here make sure everyone gets a little piece and then your lime wedges now we're going to use chamoy as the glue so now that your is nice and thick and we're just going to use do our best to get as much joy on the rim as possible and it's as easy as that now when you first put it on it's not gonna look that great but you just have to use a little bit of force very gently to push the two sides in and um like building a house we're going to use chamoy as a mortar to make sure we close up those seams it's going to be a little hard because the ice is cold and wet so the chamois might slip a little uh but that's okay you can see there is a little crack at the bottom you can also cover that up with some more chamboy and there you have it nice and simple we're going to repeat the process here now if you're making a bunch of these i would just make them ahead and put them back in the freezer as i'm making them that way that they can all kind of stay nice and and hard there but you're going to continue going until you're done so these guys are ready they can be served right away or you can again if you're going to serve this later put it back in the freezer now when it's time to serve it you're going to cover it with just a little bit more chanuy this is kind of like the icing on the cake a little bit of lucas for effect and color and then of course tahini you can never have too much tahini now it's ready so we're going to rim our glass with the tomorrow itself and then some extra tahini did i mention we like tahini we like lots of tea and for the beer i'm using pacifico but you can basically use any kind of mexican beer or even a light beer you can use those eggies you can use corona etc now for this first time we're gonna put the uh the michelada bomb at the bottom and the beer on top and you can see here that when you do that it starts melting right away and you're going to have bits of your candy and your things popping up as you mix it this is really cool we're going to use tamaroka to just give it a little bit of help and look at that it's so great to garnish and serve it looks so cool it is picture perfect instagram ready look at that it's just so fun now we're gonna do a second one i probably would probably decorate these right before serving so we're just gonna do the same process here but this time we're gonna put the beer in first okay so we're gonna put the bomb on top just to see how it kind of explodes so right on top here beautiful look at those

i'm going to show you how to make hot cocoa bombs what is hot cocoa bomb hot cocoa bomb is a bowl made of chocolate and filled with a coco mix and marshmallow everything that you need to make a hot cocoa and then you drop that ball into a hot milk and then uh you make hot cocoa so this hot cocoa balm have been trending here i don't know if it's trending all over united states but at least uh here the place where i live uh since right before christmas people make a hot cocoa bomb even bakery sell hot cocoa bombs like for five or six dollars each so this is what a cocoa bomb look like all right so uh if you want to give it to people they wrap it in a plastic bag individual make it individual bags like this and then they put it inside of a inside of a box nice box and give it as a gift it's a nice gift uh for christmas as or especially during this time during winter time where people drink hot drinks right like hot cocoa it is not too difficult to make hot cocoa bombs as long as you know the tricks you can just make hot cocoa using a hot cocoa mix and hot milk and then just stir it right but it's not fun so making hot cocoa bumps is a fun thing to do especially with your family uh with your kids so i hope you enjoy the video okay so to make hot cocoa bombs we only need a few things we need a chocolate bar but i'm not using chocolate bar i'm using the chocolate palette but make sure you are using a high quality uh chocolate okay to make a really good hot cocoa bombs you need a good quality of a chocolate so this one that i'm using um is from a calabad it's a high quality belgian chocolate i am using khaled so i do not need to shave it if you are using the chocolate bar then you're gonna need to shave it first all right and you need the hot cocoa powder i i'm using the starbucks hot cocoa classic but of course you can make it yourself by mixing uh cocoa powder um sugar and a little salt all right um but i'm using this one this is the ingredients also pretty simple it's only using cane sugar cocoa and uh cocoa powder and um vanilla so make it yourself or use your favorite hot cocoa powder and we need marshmallow i'm going to use dehydrated marshmallow bits so i can put a lot of marshmallow in my hot chocolate balm but if you do not have it just use mini marshmallow but you cannot put too many uh marshmallow if you're using the non uh the non-dehydrated one and you need mold i'm gonna make six hot cocoa bombs so let's start by uh melting the chocolate remember if you're using the chocolate bars then you would want to shave the chocolate bars and then we need to melt the chocolate i'm going to just use all so basically you need one one cup of chocolate to make six hot cocoa buns there is two ways to melt the chocolate you use double boiler method or in a microwave okay if you use microwave you would want to heat it in a microwave for uh for 30 seconds first and then you want to mix the uh chocolate and then melt it again with 15 seconds increments until your chocolate uh chips or chocolate shave uh cf chocolate is totally uh melted okay but you need to check the temperature every time you do not want the temperature of the melted chocolate to be over 90 degrees fahrenheit because you want to make a strong uh chocolate shells for me i am going to melt it using double boiler all right so you want to heat uh you wanna boil water in a pot and then put your bowl of chocolate into this spot make sure that the water doesn't touch the bottom of the uh the bowl okay the bowl of chocolate so we want to melt the chocolate so it's melting uh with the hot uh hot air from the boiling water so not from the boiling water itself but from the hot air make sure you're using a low heat remember the water in the pot should not touch the uh the bottom of the bowl this uh chocolate ball and you want to check the temperature all right using the candy uh thermometer okay look at my thermometer it is uh less than 90 okay so that's it all right so i removed the bowl from the uh from the pot because you do not want to keep heating the chocolate the temperature of the chocolate should not exceed 90 degrees fahrenheit now let's start making the shell so i'm going to use half a tablespoon so either using spoon or using brass then you wanna cover the surface swirl the chocolate around make sure the chocolate covers the surface completely okay all the way to the rim so i'm using the silicon uh mold here but you can also use acrylic ones if you have that one okay so i'm done with uh one mold then i'm going to turn it upside down on the parchment paper and then work on the other mold you can use paint brush too okay but for me i find it easier to use spoon all right so i'm gonna turn this mold upside down okay and then i'm going to uh put this tray into uh the fridge for five to ten minutes okay so after five minutes take a look now i'm going to put the second layer okay we want to make two layers to make sure that the chocolate is thick enough but this time i'm not gonna add chocolate to all right away i'm gonna do it one by one because once the chocolate touch the cold uh surface is gonna get hardened really fast right it's gonna be difficult for you to spread it make sure you do it all the way to the rim so i i have an experience putting all the chocolate to all six at the same time and then starting to uh swirl the chocolate around and it was difficult because the chocolate got hardened right after you put it onto the cold chocolate onto the first layer that is uh cold okay so okay again turn it upside down and work on the other mode all right turn it upside down and then again put it in to the fridge or freezer for five to ten minutes all right so now let's start working on filling the shells take a look now we want to remove the shells uh from the mold right i have my hot cocoa powder or mix ready here all right let's remove the shell it's very easy when you're using the uh silk silicone mold and move it here to the other tray so i'm using um a latex-free and powder-free gloves so that i will leave fingerprints on my chocolate cells okay so i have with me a pan that i hit it on the stove for very short time to make it warm okay not hot just warm all right i'll show you what i'm gonna do so first i'm gonna put the uh mini muffin liner just to hold this uh the shell that's why i need the mold upside down so the first thing you want to rub the rim on the warm uh pan here just to smooth down the rim okay and then put it into the uh the liner just for a short time just to smooth down all right now scoop one tablespoon of uh your hot cocoa mix into the spear and then the marshmallow this is the reason why i'm using the dehydrated one because i want to put a lot of marshmallow you won't be able to put a lot if you're using the non-dehydrated one okay so get the other sphere and then again smooth it down on the hot pan and then close it like this okay okay let's do it again first hot cocoa mix and then marshmallow and then smooth down the rim and then close it just like this okay so i made two already so you can add uh whatever you want into your hot crocodile you can make uh you can put mocha mix uh you can put uh the salted caramel flavor so your favorite kind of mix okay you see if you see hole like this it's not uh completely closed you can use the melting chocolate to seal it all right okay so this is the comparison okay this is the non-dehydrated marshmallow you cannot put as many when you put the non-dehydrated one okay because uh they are too big so you probably can put six and then because you wanna make sure that you'll be able to close the chocolate okay now i'm going to decorate my hot cocoa bomb you can use the leftover of the melting chocolate or using a white chocolate melting white chocolate okay put it in a piping bag with a round tip i'm using uh either size two or size three the round tip okay the melting chocolate should not be hot or else you're gonna melt the shell just swirl it so i also have leftover of the uh semi-sweet chocolate that i use to make the chocolate shell so i put it in this piping bag with a round tip number two you can decorate your just make sure that your uh chocolate is not hot okay so it won't melt the the shell all right so you can add a sprinkle you can you can also smash peppermint candy and then sprinkle it on top of your uh hot cocoa bomb so then your hot cocoa bum will have a peppermint flavor right so you can decorate the way uh whatever however you want it so that's it this one i'm gonna make a double with the okay all right so i'm done making my uh hot cocoa bombs i have um six ounces of hot milk in my mug and joanna will drop in the one of the bombs there you go it's opened okay now we're going to uh stir the [Applause] hot cocoa join how's your hot cocoa it's super yummy and sweet it's super chocolatey too you", "Y6PQPfORk1Q": "welcome back to our channel now go welcome back to our channel so right now i think i'm praying for god every year because my problems dad died i mean sick like they're not gonna come back because i'm gonna stay there for a little bit weeks well that's not gonna happen like something i remember this video guys we did that one last year [Music] hi everybody and here's my helpers barbie and chelsea what are they gonna help me yes so today we are making to what are we making today hot chocolate bombs hot chocolate bombs are your side we got pink ones red ones okay so we have these silicone molds and they're bouncy and they're bouncy and they're bouncy to jump on made a mistake in ordered small silicone molds instead of the bigger ones i thought these were the big ones for the um hot chocolate balms but they they are very small so we would we might have to put two per mug you've got spaghetti sauce on your face hold on bouncy bouncy mom and this is bouncy i ever seen well there's big snowballs mom so we've got our molds and i'm bouncing on my little ones we have chocolate and we have marshmallows we have marshmallows and hot chocolate to put in each one first we're gonna melt the chocolate it says that you do it 30 seconds at a time in the microwave so that is what we're gonna do these are delicious mama [Music] mama don't need a bunch of chocolate right before bed you dogs 30 more seconds oh no i did my jumping jacks [Music] good jumping jacks chelsea thank you mom these you need some more practicing well you don't know how to do the skipping jack yes i do go back i got this chocolate from walmart it says choco maker and it's just this one's milk chocolate candy wafers for candy making ended up putting it in the microwave for about 50 seconds now we're gonna fill up our mold with can i do it can we do it together oh that's sweet now we're gonna fill up our molds with chocolate the instructions say okay go for it to just put i like the parts when we look the chocolate that's my favorite when you lick the chocolate yeah okay stop and let the chocolate can i let the chocolate mama after we're done we'll see because i love chocolate that's my batman oh she did scribble scratch there's just i'm just choking you this couple scrubs i'm just joking you did scribble scratch are you trying to go like the girl that was doing this i watched a video of another girl doing this to make sure i was doing it right before we started okay that's all you get for tonight okay that is so so good that's good right is it chelsea hey i'm the real one can you get chelsea so what she did in the video is once she put the chocolate in the mold she took a spoon and she spread it in the mold so i'm gonna take our camera so you can see what we're doing here hold on just a second okay so she just got her [Music] spoon and spread the chocolate up on each mold see if you can do that no don't stir it spread it with the back of the spoon like this okay yeah just turning because i can't do it on the other hand okay there you go i'll do the same thing to the other one [Music] and while she's spreading i'm going to go ahead and do the other mold here design this is mine that can be yours and you're doing it so this is gonna be my chocolate thing right mama and you're gonna have better this is mine forever right that was tasty did you drop the swing yeah on the floor yeah and then put it back in there yeah gross kendall all right so you spread it with the spoon in the mold mama that's right he's a p-r-y-o-r-n-g is it p-r-y-o-r-n-g yeah what does that spell dad no more chocolate next thing she did after she spread all the chocolate with the spoon is obviously there's holes and things like that she tapped it and just made sure that all the holes were good and covered what's happened i'm happy mama good job well if you're not getting tapped mama trying to get spread so don't hold on yeah spread it out and she said this was the trick in making sure that these were thin enough to melt as soon as you poured the milk on top that's the wine chocolate no stop eating chocolate well i need some because to cover the holes because you've been eating it huh yeah don't need more chocolate yes ma'am i'm gonna listen for it to you tonight i guess i am you're gonna listen tonight is that what you just said yeah good that's what you god wants you to do you gotta listen till you get presents santa knows if you're bad or good right now i did that let's put it over here so we can reach it okay so i think mine are good now then next thing she did when she covered all of these with the spoon is she flipped them upside down and let the excess spill out so i'm gonna go get some parchment paper parchment paper is our friend what about mine we'll do yours after i'm done don't do it okay i'm ready i think mine look pretty good so now after you get the excess out you put this in the refrigerator for five to ten minutes to harden so i think we're gonna have to maybe redo kindles because it took so long for her to handle no more chocolate it took so long for her to get her chocolate spread out in her mold that it's it's all already dry and it's dried too thick so we're gonna we're gonna re-melt this chocolate and start over with kendall's mold chelsea gave it to you so therefore you could eat it no i don't know how that works no she wants me to eat it well i don't listen about that well she puts it in my mouth i'm tears [Music] no chelsea look at chelsea's mom doing lucy now you can't have chocolate in each [Music] spot [Music] not supposed to be in the water almost about to fall for ketchup up don't get your feet in the whole lava yes mama there's all up on the ground uh-oh we can't walk you're standing on the hot lava i'm standing over here yeah you're standing on it hurry i'm thinking ah i'm thinking mama help me i already sleep so we have to carefully take it we have to carefully take it out of the mold and she said to touch it from the bottom and since the bottom is the thickest part and push it out from the bottom like that they're breakable and we don't want them to break just yet all right so we got kendall's or my six out and so as you can see they're very fragile when you're taking them out there's cracks all in the top parts of mine so what she said to do when this happens is to put it on the stove in a pan face down and melt the edges to even it out and so that's what we'll do next and then we'll fill them and put them together yeah does that sound good yeah i hear my butt okay so i've got the stove on low heat and you just gently twirl it around until it's got an even layer [Music] ta-da okay so i've melted all the edges they look pretty good these are gonna be super small so we're definitely gonna have to put two or three in one mug to make this work we're gonna fill them up with marshmallows and hot chocolate mix and then we're going to melt them together okay time to put the marshmallows in happy you look like a fish ready yes i want to do that we're going to do three marshmallows perv [Music] one so do three in that one and that's it all right don't do anything in these because that's gonna be the top parts now we're gonna [Music] [Music] we make sure we cover the marshmallows right so that would make sense that each ball is filled up with hot chocolate mix because if we put three in there that will be almost one full packet of hot chocolate and each of these packets goes into one cup of milk so okay dance teachers i think we got a day we're gonna even these out so now we're gonna melt the empty parts and then stick them on top of the full parts and they'll be done we can just put them in the refrigerator on my head dog she listens to nobody else just me with water what's water where's the water coming from oh where's that water come from i don't know where'd the water come from okay so it looks like we got one good one out of these three i like yours this one looks the best and that's more like um [Music] not a circle now can we eat it these have to go in the refrigerator to set and then they'll be a good now we're ready to make some let's go back to our channel again sorry we we didn't came back because our things we were making um what are these called again hot cocoa bombs um hot chocolate balms hot chocolate bombs were um what are we doing we put them in the refrigerator so they would get hard yeah we did that and we're going to smash them so right this one is not holding on all right so we want it to be hard because so much nobody breaks them let's do this we're going to warm up some milk in the microwave yeah okay oh yeah can i drink some can i drink i'll i'll pour you a glass of milk yes thank you mama [Music] here's the secret smell okay i'm gonna put y'all up to where you can see what's going on a lot a hundred alright so what we're gonna do is we're gonna put all of these hot cocoa bombs in this big can i put that one in mm-hmm all right be careful don't break it okay and now what we're going to do is we're going to pour the hot milk in you're going to help me yeah all right hold on here you go ready yes yes mama i'm going to help you do this hold on it's not the money you don't stop actually okay that's good all right here we go ready yeah go ahead like open it and they're open and they're opening there they go [Music] it makes hot chocolate that looks good doesn't it was it a success we need to make like the food so all of us like a family can eat this so i think that it'll probably taste really good it looks like it tastes good you wanna okay well i think that that was actually successful it wasn't successful in the fact that there was this big show and we had to put three in there which is bye i'm a puppet i don't i'm ally i don't know i don't think this was aesthetically pleasing to watch them melt like the big ones are and so i think that was a fail but the

you guys loved the video please like subscribe and turn on your notifications thank you bye", "D8ya4J8rJHs": "hey guys it's HCS Dave here and I'm going to show you this is going to be a tip to show you how to attempt to manufacture a a wrapped candy such as this one here and that's really to show you also what we're going to be looking for to try and manufacture it so the first thing that we're looking for is something like this here this is a obviously an obvious stripe so if you know how to create that and just move this into here and that would create a stripe like this it would also have horizontal stripes on it but if you have something like this basically this guy right here if we can get this blue down to here that would make a 1 2 3 once we move this one up so you're looking for basically a blue here a blue here a blue here and these two blues or you can have it that it kind of looks like a cross or a tee once you put it into it it'll just intersect like that it'll be then that's 3 3 3 3 3 3 so that's that's what you're looking for again this kind of looks like a cross when you have it down here we're going to show you in just a moment but so if we move this 3 if we move this purple down here what's going to happen is you'll have 3 gone from this row and this one is not going to be broken so we'll have if we take 3 out of this row 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 if we take 3 we have 4 which means if 1 2 3 4 the blue will be here and it'll be almost impossible to move it down here because they will have actually you'll have to two oranges here so it if a orange falls on top of that it may not be that difficult sometimes you know you may want to give that a shot but since we already have the these three in place we can just first move it down to three so that we have it fall right there all right so now we have this if we count them up again one two three four five six and remove the three from it we got one two three and that's where the blue will put me placed again once we got rid of those purple so now to make the wrapper you just go up on that and across the T and we made the wrap or you can do that same method again from the top down if you have one on the top two on the bottom is another good way to do it see if maybe we can get another one here so basically if this would be the same example really but if we get rid of this blue right here and keep these four intact which we did not accomplish on that so here is another one here again one two three four we have the cross this will be a tea it's just the sideways tea so move it in and you got yourself a wrapper those are the best ways to do it you can also make a right angled a right angle is another one so if that one that one that one that one and that one all three and three that would also make one let me see if I can make one of those here real quick I'm going to pause the video see we all right so we're able to looks like probably get one here we do have yes a a chocolate ball or doughnut or whatever they're calling that if we get five in a row certainly we can get that if we got here but if you don't want the chocolate balls you need to get the wrapped stripe the wrap now candy excuse me we can get rid of that as such and now we have a right-angled wrapped candy here once we move this one in so we have one two three four and then this one once we move it in we'll make three and three and we do have a candy stripe there so I hope that does clear that up and hopefully make things a little bit easier for you and the candy crush game", "8Aoo4k-h4sc": "I found out this

inside i put it 30 seconds so some of these are male but not all so we just stir it until it's melting it looks good i'm going to try it again so maybe i'm going to put one minute to make everything smelt for two minutes in 30 seconds and look at that it's perfect so now my mold is ready so all i have to do is just put it inside right now it's very [Music] melting i love it look it smells so good too if you guys have a dog you need to be careful that if you do this you need to put it far from your dough because this is dangerous this is for make them sick the chocolate any chocolate is not good for your dog so yeah look at that see if you guys can see but yeah that's inside my mold looking good super melting so mine i did two minutes and 30 seconds and then all the chocolate that i put on my bowl they are all milk like this one okay this looks nice i'm gonna add one more for this one i've been wanting this to make this one on december but it's hard to find a mold so i finally like on my store it's still out of stock so steve surprised me with my for the silicon he said he ordered it on the amazon so i'm happy when it like when i see it like yes i finally can do uh hot cocoa balm but mine i'm gonna do hot cocoa the hershey flavor and i'm gonna do the chocolate coffee i'm gonna try it on my just on my own i just wanted to to experiment and i'll let you guys and i let you guys know okay guys so now this is my milk chocolate inside on my mold so i let it dry for a while and my refrigerator so now it's dry and then the next tip is we need to remove it from the mold we use the hershey's cocoa so let's see what happens hopefully it turns out really nice i'm excited for this show a small trick guys over here so this one that the very edge of this circle is not really even so it's recommended to do hit the pan and then once it's hit we need to do this one inside and circle to make it even circle and attach to the other one and i show you guys the process all right so it's already hot now i just put like that and made a perfect circle and make it even see look they're heavy now isn't it really amazing okay and then i just want to add a hot cocoa inside and i'll show you guys after i already put the cocoa over there inside and made it full and take note guys you guys this is optional you guys can completely use and add a marshmallow in it but me i'm not a marshmallow person so i decided not to put a marshmallow so hang in there okay so this one so now we're going to do the other circle but this circle is not even so i put it in the pan and make it even see look and then you just attach it attach it look at that see that and you guys can seal that one with just leave it like that and you can sealed it with the leaf over chocolate if there is a hole in it just settle it ooh [Music] us i just use my finger because this is for me anyway yep look at my hat hers oh hershey cocoa bum chocolate balm so that's the first one proud of it so now the second one i'm gonna use this i love coffee so i'm gonna try to um experiment between the flea boy of this hershey together with the cold so this is a coffee so i just pour it inside perfect i worry it's not gonna be you know but look it fits so perfect and now make this one even again and perfect circle and you don't need just attach it like that look at that and just to sell sell the holes i just got that one because this one have a holes that's going to be interesting how i can fix this i guess i need oh no it's getting bigger come on i know it's warm oh no come on don't do that progress now they are a circle now and i show you guys the next one presentation time i'm not good with this oh girly girly [Laughter] looking goody goody looks like donuts yeah oh by the way i used this one they called it choco choco drizzle drizzler so you just like put in the oven and microwave it for like 40 seconds and it's milk and then you have to do is using with this one you can pick any colors so that's it okay so this is my finished product so i just want to do the very small and a simple design for my hot cocoa and yeah so that white one with that brown and blue star that's my coffee experiment um hot choco coffee bam and this one is the hershey coco pam so now i'm going to show you how it works this is the finish fried up i'm so fine so happy with it i decided to try one of each flavor but it's just like a regular kind so it's just a fancy kind all i can explain is like a fancy kind of coffee or a fancy kind of hot cocoa that you want it that's what i can explain but i like the coffee better than the hot cocoa all right guys hopefully you guys try it on yourself and see what happened thank you guys for watching don't forget to like and subscribe you", "b3V5Nz4tV4c": "hi everybody today's video I would like to show you is what I got from the bumper so a couple weeks ago it's a candy crush bombs candy and it tastes good I got to I want to box in event I'm here it's fun that game candy crush but this is candy and I'm gonna open this and I'm gonna show you what it looks like from the inside get one of this bag here it's gonna smell good chocolate and it has ice cream the astronaut side it is that's about it and maybe you could find one at the store it's not then go to the buns for fair and get one so I'm gonna try this tastes like chocolate and it's delicious yeah", "mrECZeSDKBM": "[Music] hey guys welcome or welcome back to my channel today i'm going to be making and showing you guys how to make hot chocolate balms so you're going to need a microwave safe bowl and any spoon works just fine i have some candy melts these are green for the grinch this video was meant for december but it didn't work out then i have some candy canes some marshmallows and two different kinds of hot chocolate i have chocolate mint truffle and just some milk chocolate then i have some silicone molds and i got these off of amazon so yeah so i'm going to start by taking my bowl and filling it up with as many candy melts chocolate chips or whatever you have just fill your bowl up to however much you want once you're done with that you can place it in the microwave and make sure to put a paper towel over it before you heat it up so put it in for a starting time of one minute then take it out stir it and put it back in for 30 seconds and it should be ready all right so grabbing my molds i'm just going to take a big spoonful and put it in each little silicone area i guess you could say you don't want too much but you also want enough that you have a pretty thick layer because you don't want it to break and crumble once you get like a good size spoonful in there just fill the entire mold and move it around the sides all right so i ended up using the second mold but i only had enough to fill up not even a third of that second piece so i didn't use that mold all right so i put these in the fridge for a while i don't know how long but i would suggest 40 minutes to an hour okay so i'm just filling these up with hot chocolate candy cane and marshmallows you can use whatever you want in there you can put sprinkles or whatever only do this to half of them then you can take your stove and put it on medium heat and put a pan on the stove before you start using it you gotta let it sit for a minute or two just to let it heat up then just set half of it on and let the edges kind of melt down a little bit so it'll stick then just place the two sides together and you are ready be careful while you do that because you can easily burn yourself all right so i have two of these hot chocolate balms that i've made i did have three but the other one looked terrible and i drizzled them well at least i tried to drizzle them with white chocolate so i just filled this really cute cup that i got from my friend i know it's not christmas but i love it so i'm still going to use it but anyways so i have water and i just heated it up for about less than two minutes and that works great for me you can just drop your hot chocolate balm right in there let it sit for just a second though so it can start to melt once it starts melting and you can see your hot tub your powder and your whatever you put in there kind of come out that's when you can stir it comment down below if you guys want me to do some more baking videos i'm taking it a step further by putting this vanilla creamer in there it's really good in hot chocolate we really just bought a whole box just to put in our hot chocolate okay so i put in more marshmallows than what was in the hot chocolate balm because the ones that were in there started to melt and look really gross so i didn't want that but anyway this is super good and i'm just gonna put that lid on thank you guys so much

and this is cannon and this is created by christy today we decided to do something fun and festive for the holidays everyone is going crazy over these hot chocolate bombs so crazy in fact that you cannot find round molds anywhere so i went shopping to see what would work um i bought we found square ones and like circle halves and michaels so that's a tip i happen to have this christmas village one that i bought a couple years ago on clearance at michael's as well and decided we were going to do christmas village cocoa bombs and then we also found like a little rose one so what we have here are the bombs we got four houses in the front and turn and the rows in the back turn around the little rose yes so um i poured the hot chocolate into the um village malt or sorry poured the chocolate into the village molds and then froze it and then put the hot chocolate inside and then we used the squares and i used a um just a flat square mold with the white chocolate so that it looks like the little house sits on the snow so i'm so excited we're going to pour some hot water over them and see what happens are you excited i'm excited okay so i've got my gingerbread molds all frozen and ready to come out and you guys oh my goodness look how cute that is cannot stand it look at that so stinking cute look at that so cute i literally bought this mold on clearance a couple of years ago and i have not used it yet but i was like how cute would it be to do the hot chocolate balms in the mold because it's stinking adorable so we've got those out i used white for the bottom so it would look like they were sitting on snow okay so our red roses are ready to come out that one came out super easy will they all come out that easy probably not actually wow that is the best mold i've ever used for easy come out so we've got our rose tops and our bottoms so we're going to add them over here to our platter and go to the next one my first batch broke so i'm trying to be very careful [Music] oh yeah so look how cute this is gonna be the snow that the gingerbread house sits on i'm so excited all right one can we do it dad gummit all righty all righty come on oh look at you you can do it you can't oh yep yep yep two woo hoo come on do i hear three please these [Music] oh yeah i got three snowy bottoms come on number four all righty ready there we go only elves get to put marshmallows in are you an elf yes alrighty here you go let's focus on the houses first good job all righty five in each it is one in the corner each and then one in the middle corner corner you're going free for those i don't know i'm just throwing in marshmallows isn't it like the more marshmallows the best i need four more oh my goodness you need four more one there and one there oh i got too many people look more marshmallows more marshmallows it's a mushroom you can never have too many marshmallows marshmallows are delicious alrighty so now we've got our warm plate coming and we are going to put on the other side of let's start with the roses put them on the warmer plate and then we're going to just push them together now can i put one together the middle um my mom there miss herself the first one why you got a tattle on me that one's gonna stick together and then we're gonna put that one on this one's broken i know that thank you so this is what i'm using to like make them soft on the other side i've got a candle warmer here and a glass plate and that allows me to put it down so that it will adhere to the surface so these are going to be kind of tricky because they're not round and they're not flat so it may take us a little more to get them flattened down so hmm okay so we have our hot milk and we're just going to pour it over i don't know if you guys i think you can probably see better in this one just pour it you know what it's exciting okay i had to bring you down let's see oh my house floats there we go there we go the marshmallows are starting to pop out i guess my

lola and today i'm going to be making something that i've been really wanting to try it's from robly's hot cocoa bomb and as many of you know i have a lot of allergies i'm allergic to a lot so i'm going to be making hot cocoa bombs today that fit my allergies best so instead of real milk i'm going to be using coconut milk by sodalicious and i'm going to be using dairy free hot cocoa mix and it's in here and then i have all natural marshmallows and i have dark chocolate chips and i have a measuring cup i have these little decorating brushes by wilton and i have these spoons i have a little mold with um circles inside and it's rubber and silicone so it's easy to like pop out and then i have these little cupcake wrappers and this little cookie cutter to set the shells on and this bowl to melt chocolate let's get started so the first step to making the hot cocoa bombs is melting the chocolate so i'm gonna pour a little bit of these dark chocolates into this paper bowl right here and you should probably microwave yours for about one minute to two minutes i'm probably gonna do a minute thirty so i'm just gonna pop that in there and then 1 30 start the chocolate is ready and oh my gosh it looks so gooey now i'm going to stir it around just to make sure it's all you know melted mine's actually a little chunky there so i'm just going to keep stirring and then i'm going to take about half a teaspoon mine is um mine is my mold is smaller and so i'm just going to use half a teaspoon and i'm going to put it in the middle i'm just going to eyeball it and then i'm going to take my large brush by wilton and i'm going to just brush the si brush this up to the up the sides make sure it's a very thin layer or else it'll just be chunky and then it'll like fall apart so just keep doing that until you've got it all in there like this and then you can just do that to all the other ones these are gonna be good now that we're done with that i'm gonna pop these in the fridge to chill for seven minutes i know it's a long time finally they're out and they're done but suddenly we have to wait and do another coat but let's get that done quickly so we can move on to the next step they're finally out but before we move on i have to go get something this it's my customized live love low latik board now i'm gonna take the balls out and place them on the board oh my gosh like that so now i've got my ball on a little cookie cutter to help it stand up and i'm going to add a teaspoon of the hot cocoa mix and then i'm gonna add some marshmallows don't be shy with the marshmallows and i'm gonna make a little marshmallow mountain right here and don't be just still don't be shy now i'm going to take this pan that i've heated up and i'm gonna put it right here and i'll take the other one i'll put it i'll place it on there for a few seconds then i'm immediately taking it off and that will just soften up the edges and then i'll put it on top of here and then you wait now i went ahead and did the rest off camera and they're chilling in the fridge right now but now i'm going to pour the milk and warm it in the microwave so i'm going to pour one cup into the measuring cup [Music] that was one cup now i'm going to pop it in the microwave and microwave it for one minute and 20 seconds start now let's wait i'm dizzy [Music] now i got the milk out and it's really hot like if you touch it then you'll like probably burn yourself if you touch it for like more than a second so i've got my bomb right here it's da bomb i would have spilled some mix but that's okay so um i'm just gonna put this in there place it gently there it is and then i'm gonna pour the milk over it let's see how it works [Applause] [Music] oh my goodness okay i'm gonna take this spoon i'm gonna stir it around to make sure that there's the chocolate is spread evenly oh my gosh this is amazing time this is delicious delicioso i should say and some people even like to decorate theirs like they like to they can put drizzle on it like you can drizzle frosting or icing or you could put sprinkles or even crushed candy canes i like mine playing because i just like the chocolate i don't need any of that fancy stuff well that was delicioso and i hope you enjoyed this video so much but before we end it it's time for the joke of the day why did the butter knife put on a bow tie because

today actually marks the one year anniversary of my very first cooking video now I was originally going to have a desserts and sweets channel so I thought I was only fitting that we have some sweet naughty recipes this week and also some fun ones so today I'm going to start off with some cell bomb pop rocks now these are so fun and so simple to make I really hope you enjoy this one so let's get started and I'll show you how to make them [Music] so the first thing we need to do is prepare our tingly dust to the icing sugar and the baking powder I'm just going to add some coloring and the citric acid and then mix until well combined now into a pan on medium-high heat we're going to add in our sugar and the glucose now just as a little tip if you spray your cup with a little bit of oil first that glucose will come out easy then add enough water just to cover that sugar and then mix until well combined now you just going to keep stirring this until it comes to the boil once it reaches that point then we're just going to leave it without stirring five minutes taking it off the heat then we're just going to add in our food coloring now be careful because this is still very hot so just take care when stirring so that we're then going to add in our flavorings and mix it through then we're going to add in the baking powder stir in till it's well incorporated all the way through then finally add in the citric acid and mix well then we're going to pour that straight onto a tray without tingly dust then before it's had time to sets sprinkle on the rest of the citric acid and the rest of our dust then all you have to do is leave it to set once set we just need to break it up into small pieces then you are ready to taste sweet and sour crunchy and fizzy these little rocks pack a powerful punch Oh tingly now sadly you're not going to have that real popping experience as you would with the store-bought ones because you will need special conditions to make those but you'll definitely have a tingly sensation that I think you'll enjoy now have fun with the colors have fun with the flavors and make that one your own so I really hope you enjoy it and you give it a go thanks again for joining me and I'll see you guys next time I'm cooking with karma [Music]", "HFFXtgEeLOs": "hey guys what's up it's a boy stupid stick I'm coming at you with a different kind of big juice review today this is a premium CBD eliquid it's from hip bumps CBD there's no nicotine no THC pure CBD and this is 75 milligrams I actually got this for like eight bucks so I'm curious to try it I'm gonna empty out what little juice I do have in here I don't have too much but I'm really anxious to try this I'm really curious it has no nicotine like I said it's kind of a downside I like makes me hard cold it it smells berry berry like Barry Barry Barry Barry go put that in there now you have about half a tank oh no oh I'm gonna feel about this or I might mix it with some nicotine so I'm getting nicotine and CBD it'd be really good hmm I'm gonna try to burn it at a little higher camp I'm gonna go up to six years at 55 [Laughter] hmm it does have a slight aftertaste you can definitely taste there's some sort of cannon Boyd in there I mean it puts out a damn good cloud - it's really smooth but it hasn't had an aftertaste what I've tried some gummies that had that same almost after case that are not explained it says blow insane clouds direction add to any vape device and enjoy no steeping required I guess some of them you have to steep it really

balms so let's get started the materials you will be needing are candy melts to like chocolate that you can melt mini marshmallows a circular mold a microwave safe bowl a spoon some paper towels and hot cocoa mix and before i did this i washed all my materials and i washed my hands so let's get started i'm going to be making pink so i'm going to add some red and some white and now i'm just going to mix it so that all the color is so now you're gonna go microwave it until it's nice and thin and creamy and you're gonna make it with it for 15 seconds at a time and then you're going to take it out and stir in between so i'm gonna be back once i melt it okay guys so now that my chocolate's nice and creamy didn't really turn up that pink it's mostly just red so now um you guys can come closer so i'm just gonna pour like half a scoop of chocolate into each mold or maybe a little bit more than that and then you're just going to spread it around you don't want to like fill it up too much because then you can't really fill it with any like marshmallows and hot cocoa mix so now it's supposed to like look like that i'm going to take a little bit out and make sure there's no holes in it so then you're gonna just do this for all of them so we're gonna make sure there's no holes so i'll come back once they're all done bye okay guys so now that i have all of my chocolate in my molds i'm just gonna pat it down a little bit so that there's like no air bubbles and so it like spreads around a little bit so now i'm just gonna pop it in my freezer for five to ten minutes so that the chocolate hardens so i'll be back okay guys so now now that they're hardened and there's like no chocolate coming off i washed my hands before this again so now you're going to gently pop it out of the molds you guys can come closer so this is about what it's going to like look like so you're just gonna pop them all out if you hear background noises we have a washing machine on right now so then you're just gonna pop them on but you don't want to pop them out too hard because then they might break but sometimes you do have to do a little hard [Music] and the last one okay now that you have all of your molds you're going to pair them with a partner that's going to be make them a circle so now you're going to take your hot chocolate mix and put about maybe half a scoop in one of them because they can't fit a whole one since you're going to be putting marshmallows in it but if you don't oops if you don't want marshmallows in it then you don't have to put marshmallows in it or if you just want marshmallows and no hot cocoa powder a little bit more of this okay so now i'm gonna take my mini marshmallows and i'm going to put like a couple in each one this side that has the chocolate powder in it i'm going to do about five or six in each one this one so now you are going to make melt some more chocolate but i had some left over i think this will be good enough and since i just washed my hands if you didn't just wash your hands then go wash them but now you're just gonna put a little bit on your finger and you're gonna put it on one side like the side you have the stuff in so that that can stick together and then you're gonna put the top one on and then you can like neatly smeared around it a little bit so and you want to try so there's like no holes peeking up because then the powder might fall out and like some of them that i've made the powder came out so then you're just going to do this for all of them so i'll come back when i'm done okay guys i just heated up some milk for 1 minute 30 seconds oh and i finished these and i smeared the chocolate all over the sides but you have to let those harden so i'm going to show you what it looks like with this one so you guys can come closer so once you have nice and warm milk you're going to take your bum and you're going to drop it open up there we go so it'll just look like that just with the other ones too but this one just was already made then you'll stir it up because there's like chocolate at the bottom it's gonna make sure that it's not hardened and then if you want you can add more marshmallows if they didn't fit inside i'm just gonna add a couple extra delicious now i'm gonna try it it's a little hot but really good all right bye guys don't forget to hit the like button and subscribe bye", "JbjaV9RQqP0": "alrighty then guys so it is march 14th 2021 i am still in the two-week transition to a vegan keto diet and a couple days ago on friday i posted a mini vegan keto product haul now it's sunday i went ahead and got a few more products and just like on friday i didn't know i was going to do this video so this is kind of just like uh hit record and doing a video um got a few more things here so extend keto energy this is similar to the other product i bought that has the exogenous ketones in it so like external ketones taking in ketones to help get into ketosis and check out these coconut keto clusters it's uh pecans almonds and pumpkin seeds basically in little clusters keto friendly 4 grams net carbs gluten-free vegan-friendly no artificial flavors of colors organic non-gmo closure and let's go ahead and open it here i already had some i already know i like it so that's what those look like that is good fat is good all righty then my video on friday i talked about fat bombs um this company says f-bomb and i like the vitamin shop i go to the vitamin shop all the time i even get water from there so this is vitamin shop water alkaline water and see it says fat is smart fuel f-bomb macadamia with sea salt i tried this on friday off camera because i didn't think about making a video it's pretty good it's basically nut butter with yeah just dry roasted macadamia nuts sea salt so i'm still learning the keto stuff i've been vegan for years but i'm still learning about keto apparently there's fat bombs so like nut butters like this just uh you like knead it and then open it and eat it as a snack but you can also make your own fat bombs or come up with your own creations usually like balls or squares doesn't really matter what shape they are you can have them as a snack or make big ones as a meal and have or eat it on the side of a meal there's basically just a way to get like a bunch of fat in at once um i guess to help with like if you're hungry just as a snack or as a meal i said so i stopped by the vitamin shop and i got this keto indulgence dark chocolate candy hazelnut flavor and it says one that gram carbs yeah it does say vegan the sticker's covering it up i didn't even notice that till just now it does say vegan on it so keto and vegan i really like products that say keto and vegan on the same package it's pretty nifty so there's four of them in here and there's 11 and two of them there's 11 grams of carbs six fibers so seven eight nine ten eleven five grams of net carbs divided by two well it says one what one gram of net carbs and serving whatever um anyway i want it i thought it would be cool because i already tried this off camera the other day i actually tried these off camera the other day too so it's not really a product review or anything but i thought it would be cool to like make a little coconut chocolate concoction or f-bomb fat bomb like a coco choco fat bomb so i'm gonna go ahead and open it whoa that's right there's two okay there's two of them in each package that's right so two up in each package gonna take one and i went ahead and got some uh i went ahead and went inside my apartment and came back out to my car because i knew i was going to do this video after i decided to do it i grabbed some coconut oil i was like this is a good idea for a video this is going to be my first chocolate coconut fat bomb all right so a little coconut oil got a nice big glob of it here on the spoon about a spoon's worth on the chocolate oh yeah okay i'm gonna try to make this look nice let's make this look nicer i might just have to use my my hands yeah just gonna use my hands alrighty then my first coco choco fat bomb hmm that is good fat is good i thought so because i always every time i take a bite of something i say that is good i thought about saying fat is good fat is good man i think i'm gonna like this diet chocolate coconut oil oh yeah avocados fat with a side of fat plant fat that is so um basically on march 20th i'm gonna go vegan keto i'm just kind of like in a two week experimenting uh trying things out making sure i really want to do this phase and then i'll start on march 20th the first day of spring where i live and um yeah basically high fat very low carb try to get into a state of ketosis burning body fat um i'm looking interest i'm really interested i'm i was kind of trying to combine i'm looking forward to it i'm really interested i'm looking interested to trying it um i'm looking forward to trying it i briefly experimented with clean keto in 2007 or yeah 17 and really clean keto in the form of raw food diet in 2018 both were very very short-lived because i didn't do enough research and there wasn't very much information on it but now there's books on vegan keto um i'm gonna use fat bombs and i'm still gonna i'm gonna do like dirty keto and still have processed food like fake meat and vegan cheese to try to hit the macros the the low the high fat very low carb and then our lazy keto dirty lazy keto gonna be a dirty lazy vegan keto no diet yeah dirty lazy keto vegan keto vegan that's right um anyway so i still didn't get the vegan ghee um because i didn't know i was going to do this again i will get to vegan gee in the future i'm interested in checking that out so yeah that's about it for this video just a quick show and a few more products and getting my first uh chocolate coconut fat bomb experience on camera i liked it i really like coconut oil um i'm just gonna like ignore the whole feed of plant-based science on the on coconut oil raising bad cholesterol and focus more on the weight loss aspect of it it helps you get into ketosis it's like if you're not doing keto like you probably don't want to put coconut oil on top of chocolate but if you're doing keto and you're fat adapted which means your body is in the state of burning fat as fuel or for energy then i see the point at it and it's pretty tasty it's pretty tasty so yeah um yeah so that's about it for this video i keep i was i wasn't even gonna post these couple videos showing stuff but like i'm so excited about it i'm i'm currently uploading some of my footage from 2017 and 18 when i experimented with vegan keto or i thought i was um or when i understood what keto was back then but uh basically i got a few more videos of old footage to post and then as of the 20th like i said in the first video i'll uh announce it go in keto vegan and then i'll take it from there with new videos so yeah man i like tasting stuff on camera i like i might do some product reviews and um i really want to like document like going from an overweight processed food vegan to like doing keto and losing weight uh vegan keto and losing weight and um like showing what i'm eating like especially with um like fake meat and vegan cheese and like products and stuff then if i want to do clean keto in the future i can cut all that stuff out but i'll cross that bridge when i get there anyway this video is getting kinda long again the first one was way longer than i expected it to be so that was like almost half an hour that was almost half an hour of uh of just um rambling about about the the vegan keto products and my plans um i had a couple shots of espresso before that video so i was um i was a little um like jittery and excited but yeah um i'm excited in general can't wait to like fully get going with this", "xKqOTE2d4ag": "hi there everybody today I'm going to do an unboxing video for you and it's from home cosmetics myself and my daughter

fat bomb we're going to use heavy creamer one cup of heavy creamer we're going to use white chocolate if you have dark dark chocolate you can use that as well we have our molds that we're going to make them in and we also have some oreo ice cream all right probably heat your stove on a low medium heat you're going to add one cup of heavy cream all right that should do it and we'll slowly heat that chocolate here let's see how much we have here all right uh one cup so that's gonna work out good [Applause] i'm gonna add one cup i'm going to bring that to a ball and slowly stir until all the chocolate is dissolved all right we're also going to use some hershey cocoa and do about a tablespoon sprinkle that in give that a nice stir as well that's your chocolate melts and once this is heated up and melted you can let it cool down to about 95 degrees before we put it in our molds all right that's looking good make sure you scrape the sides get all the cocoa mixed in with the chocolate all right now we're going to use probably about a cup cup and a half so we'll give that or about three or four big spoonfuls all right that should be enough just looking good and i think later today check out the youtube channel here we're going to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich the ultimate four layer peanut butter and jelly sandwich what goes best with a jelly sandwich big tall glass of ice milk all right that's looking good now i'm gonna finish melting this all right this is almost ready we're gonna turn the stove off set this to the side and let it finish melting and cooling down like i said to about 95 degrees or so and then we will pour it into our molds refrigerate overnight and we'll be ready for our ice cream fat bombs it's going to be delicious all right our chocolate is cooled down now we will take import in a measuring cup which makes it a little bit easier to pull into our molds and as you can see we still have a few oreos in there that didn't melt but that's fine oh that's a little bit too much all right then we'll refrigerate those i sit overnight but it probably take about 30 minutes or so or an hour to freeze up all right i have some left over here so i'm going to put these into my heart-shaped molds and you probably don't have to fill these up about halfway because they don't need to be all that big and this will actually be pretty good after it's made to go ahead and put a few strawberries or some cool whip on the top of it [Applause] and one more all right well one more just can never have enough of chocolate all right that's it and then

"lFXzex33McA": "howdy folks and welcome to the hillbilly kitchen today we're going to be making cherry bombs then cherry bombs are a kind of cake fall and cake balls are absolutely genius whoever came up with them because you use cake crumbs and when you decorated a cake and bakeries used to have to toss out their cake crumbs and they had a lot of them because when you bake a big cake like I've made a few wedding cakes and you have to level the top of each layer off and you have probably a third of each layer of your cake that you throw away so what they did is they took those leftovers the cake scraps and they added frosting and this chocolate cake is on Samantha's chocolate cake recipe that we just put up and she used it to make a strawberry mousse cake for Valentine's Day this is actually the leftovers from the cake that she decorated and this is our creamy chocolate frosting we have that video up too but all you do is add frosting to your cake crumbs until it kind of turns into a dough now to make the cherry bombs you have to have maraschino cherries with the stems the stem is your ma fuse and you've got to have some chocolate to dip it in and in the spirit of using up all the leftovers of the scraps for the cake balls I'm taking all of my chocolates and my white baking pieces that I had melted for my other candies and I'm gonna use them to get my cherry bombs in so I'm gonna dip mine and this is mostly these candy wafers it's melting chocolate pieces and I want to say when you buy these things you want to make sure that you buy good quality ones you don't want to get the ones that are like 50 percent paraffin because they taste awful these are dark chocolate and they're really a good quality and this is just white and baking pieces that I added a little bit of coconut oil to and this was actually leftover from two different candy recipes so I'm gonna use it and I'm gonna dip some of them in and it's kind of a vanilla flavor so some of my cherry bombs will be covered in chocolate and some in vanilla so anyways let's get started here you just want to crumble up the cake really good and this is a really moist cake so it should make good cake balls and we're gonna start adding this frosting right into it and how much frosting you'll need just depends on how moist cake crumbs are and how many cake crumbs you have of course there's not really a whole lot of measuring with this recipe okay that looks pretty good the frostings mixed in there it's sticking together and it is a dough consistency and you can kind of check it with your fingers and make sure it's like sticks together that's all you want you don't want to get too much frosting in there and I'm gonna melt my chocolate now now some of these I'm gonna put in these little baking cups and if you're making candy to give away these little candy cups are really good way to dress it up and they make it easy to hang out individual pieces of candy and some of them I'm just gonna sit them on this wax paper after I get done dipping them so you can do them anyway you don't have to have candy cups or you can use a candy cups so let's melt this chocolate I'm just gonna stick it in the microwave I'm gonna do this start in about a minute a minute we'll probably melt it because it's not all real real hard you know I said this is just some white baking pieces and I put a little bit of coconut oil in them what the coconut oil does is it makes it really shiny which is pretty if you're dipping candy in it or in this cake cherry bombs okay that's melted pretty good too so we'll take it over here and we're gonna start making our cake balls I'm gonna use a cookie scooper to scoop this out with mainly just to measure it and you're gonna get your fingers dirty doing this but you just scoop out a scoop and then kind of mash your cherry in the middle of it and get it all the way around your cherry and I did drain these cherries you definitely want to do that because it's gonna be hard to get it to stick to the cherry and if it's covered in cherry use it's definitely gonna be hard to get it to stick to the cherry that is all there is to it dip it in the chocolate make sure you get it all cover good and lining it a little bit and put it in a cup now out of all the candy that I have dipped in chocolate in the past two days these are by far the absolute easiest because you have the cherry stem and all you have to do is just kind of twirl it around in the chocolate and it covers it now except for the cherries these are all leftovers that a bakery would have and that we had from making our Valentine's Day candies and videos and bakeries are selling these as gourmet items and they're just their scraps and they're charging upwards of $10 a does in the forum so you see how easy it is to make them at home anytime you're doing dipped chocolates or these are actually or this is actually a vanilla but when you have two different colors like this if you're using white chocolate or you using the vanilla pieces it's really really pretty to drizzle your stuff with the opposite color and drizzling is really really easy you just start outside of the area where you want a drizzle and kind of sling your spoon across it now if you're doing this dip in your candy or you're trying to drizzle your chocolate and your chocolate starts to get too firm just stick it back in the microwave for a minute and melt it again and that's all there is to it you have decorated cherry bombs thanks for joining us again in the hillbilly kitchen don't forget to click like and subscribe and we'll see you next time", "SdJMJZvENQs": "hi everyone you're gonna need about five to six bags of hot cocoa white chocolate chips milk chocolate chips some um sticks for spreading things around marshmallows some candies of your choice and i'm going to empty all of these hot cocoa packets out and we're going to use the hot cocoa packets as our mold to make our hot cocoa bombs a lot of people use like a little circle molds so it's like a perfect circle but we're just going to use our bags and of hot cocoa and put them to use and use those to make our hot cocoa bombs so to prepare ahead of time while your chocolate is melting in the microwave for about a minute and a half you have to stir up to it so it doesn't burn you can set up a plate of all the different fillings that you're going to put in there that's what i'm going to do so it'll be easy and we can pack these hot cocoa bombs when it's ready so i'm just going to put marshmallows some of these candies and i have some chocolate chips there and these chocolates melted in about a minute and 30 seconds and be careful because sometimes the mug can get hot so i'm going to put about two spoons of this melted chocolate right into the little hot cocoa bag and since the hot cocoa bag has that kind of silvery lining in there we don't have to worry about the chocolate sticking to the bag it'll peel off very easy so i'm just squishing the chocolate all around and then i'm going to open it and all i'm going to do is make sure that it's coated very well and stand up straight so i can have a hollow center so i can feel it when it's cold you can use the popsicle stick to spread around any areas or to pop any chocolate bubbles that may have happened and use another container to set them up now i'm just going to repeat the same process using my other anti-hot cocoa bags so i let these freeze for about 15 to 20 minutes and now i'm going to go ahead and just peel back this wrapper a little bit so i can stuff these with some filling and then i can put some melted chocolate to trap everything inside wow oh so when you're all done you want to freeze them for another 10 to 20 minutes and i'm going to put the finished hot chocolate bumps inside of this uh pretty little gift box i just put some coffee filters at the bottom and it's time to unwrap these and if you notice there's any like little cracks and you see any hot cocoa spilling out you'll probably have some melted chocolate left over just um swipe a little bit of that over the hole and then it will seal it up [Music] [Music] so now it's time to go steam some milk nice and hot and drop one of these hot cocoa bombs in there i'm gonna surprise my daughter and see if she likes it it's really fun when you studies up and you see like the hakoku powder coming out and the marshmallows floating to the top and it just gets so fudgy and delicious and like a really rich hot chocolate this smells really good like i'm serious if it smells really good i'm gonna give it a taste that's also really good it's so good i'm serious about that that's how good it is here you go you know what's in there yeah you got two three more chocolate bombs

right now i'm going to actually show you how to make the keto chocolate balm what you'll need is some coconut oil just a little bit and some lilies so we are actually using ghirardelli milk chocolate and with some coconut oil since lily's chocolate did not seem to go so well here we go filling our these up our ice ice tray molds and they come with a little top these are bottoms [Music] gonna spread it all the way around and make sure it goes all the way to the top in the freezer for it to mold a lot quicker i got it's on amazon two bags like this for six bucks delivered to my door can't beat that um and they are low carbs and sugar-free so i am going to take the leftover chocolate which isn't much i'm gonna use some food coloring i'm gonna use some green some red for christmas and just drizzle it on top what i'm doing is we are actually dumping these out but we need to flip and push from the very bottom because that is the strongest point there you have it [Music] then at least one let's see how many won't fit all right now what i'm going to do i'm going to come over here melt that top stick it right on top and seal that edge together right here we go for the actual fun part

from Toys R Us they had a couple of different candy crush's candies truth be told spot doesn't even play candy crush I don't get the appeal that's just me I don't get the appeal I'd rather play plants vs. zombies but then again that's just me it's color bombs I guess that's a dinosaur on the side of the box there says natural and artificial flavors on the back of the box candy crush this guy looks familiar I think he's like what the spokesperson for candy crush was like thank you for playing my game I really appreciate it you can follow candy crush on Facebook and Twitter though it actually doesn't give you any names it just says Facebook and Twitter just just the symbols looking at 180 calories per 24 pieces some ingredients as well this comes to us from Lise Lise entertain that anywho let's open this up see if they're gonna be any good I've lots of friends who play candy crush you know well let me know down below guys if you play candy crush let me know down below down here let me know and opening up the bag Oh even in the bag inside says candy crush that's very clever it also tells me to tear here while I'm fine to listen to instructions let's open that up and inside I'm gonna open up just a little bit more inside we got just kind of look like very not boring i boring such a horrible word to be using but they're just like chocolate medallions covered with sprinkles and I whenever I think sprinkles I think of more like the the sticks like little stick sprinkles not just necessarily the ball sprinkles but let's give it a try see if it's any good the candycrush color bombs here we go let's give it a try yeah chocolate is nice slightly maybe semi-sweet chocolate it's kind of like the chocolate that you would come to expect with like like a Smarties possibly these sprinkles definitely add to it the rainbow rainbow sprinkles I could say raindrop rainbow sprinkles they're not bad they're not bad but I almost feel like you can almost get these like a bolt barn or like a dollar store or something like that you simply just put candy crush on it and everybody's gonna be like crash but me realistically the things inside it's not bad but you're obviously paying for more so because it says candy crush on the front they're still good I'd say worth picking up or buying them for somebody that really loves candy crush they probably would say okay the garage but they're not that they're not bad candies today's candy spot we were having a look at the candy crush color bombs stay tuned guys sponsor you have more candy crush this heading your way no well

don't have any lumps we'll put this back in for another 40. our chocolate will be good to go stir it up no lumps you want to kind of make sure that it's runny mmm chocolate goodness okay what you want

you want to fill them keep going you want to fill them up a little just about halfway okay good do the other side here's the shadow there again one more there you go okay perfect now what you want to do is put your a layer of parchment paper down and you want to flip your mold over go ahead caleb flip it over to drain out the excess chocolate see that give it a little shake a little shake good all the excess chocolate which we can once it gets hard and we can reuse that and re-melt it okay flip it back over [Music] scoop it on the side you don't got to be so neat there you go good that's it perfect okay you want to pop that in the freezer until the molds get hard for about five ten minutes all right so we got our molds out of the freezer so what you want to do is while they're still cold push from the bottom of the mold and slowly push up do the same on the other side slowly push up and there we have two halves so next we want to do is okay we want to throw the cocoa mix in there two teaspoons of cocoa mix i'll hold the half for you [Music] one and then you can put a couple of marshmallows in you can put a couple of chocolate chips in what else graham cracker crumbs sprinkles okay

on top and then with your finger you can kind of just smooth it this is the fun part right smooth seal the seams and there you have the ball so next what you want to do is you want to take a cup of milk like so two minutes to get it nice and hot so caleb might should go in so our milk is nice and hot and calen is going to drop our hot chocolate balm in the cup just like so then you want to take

uptaking baking today i have a friend with me say hi santa okay so today we are going to be making the famous cocoa box yes that's right so let's hop into it the first thing you're going to want to do is add 1 4 cups of chocolate any kind into a bowl and melt it in 30 second intervals [Music] the next thing you're going to need are silicone molds you can use any i'm using these cupcake molds um you can also use sphere molds which will make the bombs the next thing you're going to need is a paint brush now you're going to make sure your chocolate is all smooth make sure there's no lumps and you are going to want to start filling your molds with this chocolate as demonstrated here [Music] and it comes out every single time you're going to want to get it all over and do this to every single mold now you guys can use sphere molds or whatever mold you want i just decided that this mold was the best one that i was gonna use today okay now that all the chocolate is brushed off the side you are going to want to freeze this for 10 minutes and then you are going to want to go ahead and apply another coat of chocolate to the to the molds and then you can go ahead and read those the next thing you're going to need is cocoa powder i made mine um i will leave the link in the description for the recipe for this now you're going to want to fill each mold with a fourth of a cup of cocoa [Music] powder [Music] okay now that the two molds are filled with cocoa powder [Music] and once that's done you can go ahead and start popping all of your things out of the mold they should just slide right out of the mold you're not gonna really need to use any cooking oil that'll kind of just ruin the chocolate you're gonna want it to be nice and glossy also i wanted to mention that this recipe was all dairy-free chocolate you guys can use you guys you can use regular chocolate dairy green chocolate like i said any chocolate even white i think my favorite is definitely white so oh that one's not done we're gonna put that back in the freezer but we can go ahead and pop the rest of these out [Music] now if you want you can decorate the top of yours so here i am going to just paint a little bit of chocolate onto mine and then i'm going to go ahead and place some round ball beads green and red onto here and then it'll be a little decorated and it'll be so cute and you can also do anything you want so like sprinkles crushed candy canes which you'll see i will go here next when you're putting on all of your decorations you want to make sure to brush the top with a little bit of chocolate first so they will stick as you saw one of those candy balls okay so i crushed some peppermint on the side here so that i can put it on my little cocoa bomb and it's gonna be really cute and the next thing i'm gonna do is i'm gonna do some sprinkles [Music] i really hope you guys like this video if you did make sure to like and subscribe and i hope you guys are able to make these

that we can all do a mess up the camera so all you can see all of us and then i'll get close-ups of us each of us doing this all right so i have to explain what we also need here we are going to need a mug obviously and some hot chocolate mix and we're also going to need some chocolate chips as well we chose white chocolate i've seen a lot of the tutorials where they had the milk chocolate but i figured because this was already milk chocolate i figured that we can use the white chocolate and see how they come out so my daughters and i went on a scavenger hunt today we tried to look for the silicone molds so what we're going to do instead is we found these ornaments the diy we just pop the top off and we can put these apart and we're hoping to use these sorry if you hear my dog in the background and we also found these cute things at the dollar tree they're shaped like little candy canes and little pieces of candy so maybe we can try to use these as well we'll make different colors and see what we kind of come up with all right guys so we're all kind of sitting here together and then i'll kind of zoom in where we need to be zoomed in so each of them have a glass bowl and we're going to go ahead and fill them up a little bit with some white chocolate we're going to put it in for 30 second increments and then we're going to go ahead and i think everyone's going to do different colors so we'll go ahead and start heating it up little by little all right guys can you pick our did i get everybody so i'm gonna put this much in there and then what you're gonna do is i think i might put too much in there for you so we're going to take turns okay guys yeah one at a time we're going to go from oldest to youngest okay yeah you're going to be so who's going to be first okay nope are you first or less what are you last or first good job all right so we're gonna go ahead and put these in the microwave for about 30 seconds like i said we're gonna go from oldest to youngest that way there's no fights and arguments um so go ahead madison you go first oh my goodness already uh miley what i'm going to need you to do is go grab some spoons and this is going to be your color for the whole thing okay we're going to mix it yes and then there's also sprinkles that we're gonna put on afterwards and then we got these so let's start popping these open too so first we gotta go wash these really quick i'll be right back okay so we put them in for 30 seconds and it is enough time remember you don't want these to be too hot you'll burn the chocolate and then what the kids are gonna start doing now is mixing in their colors okay so what they're gonna do now is grab toothpicks and they're going to grab their color of choice all right go ahead grab a little bit i can't you got it you need help yeah it's tough [Music] i know you like green honey but damn i just put it in there yeah go ahead start mixing it i'm gonna do basic white chocolate with mine do you need help dude yeah oh no not in myself black or red here here each other [Music] all right once you are happy with the color you have chosen what you're going to do is grab the mold you're going to use okay you're going to watch me first do it okay guys yes i know you want to do it yourself but you need to watch mommy first okay okay we're gonna grab some hot chocolate or some we're gonna pour some in there and then with your spoon you're going to lightly cover the little the chocolate mold okay i mean the ornament mold make sure it's a nice thin layer go ahead grab a mold and once you're done putting the chocolate into the mold guys you're going to go ahead and let it drip down we don't want too much chocolate on these okay or actually make sure it's thick enough okay i'll put some soda on here okay thick enough okay not like that you have to like swirl it around [Music] your looks like a baby blue [Music] [Music] okay so um is this what it's let me see yeah but make sure you see how you see how thick marlies is you want it to be nice and thick okay yeah i wonder if we should have sprayed your house we'll see what happens if it doesn't work out okay and then we're also going to fill up some of these chocolate um these molds that i found at the dollar store with whatever chocolate we have left over of each of the colors [Music] you wash your hands buddy yeah all right here i want to hold the spoon okay we're going to put in this one right here first do that shake it okay and then we're going to put the spoon back and now hold on now we're going to go like this we're going to move it around go ahead and move it around but make sure the chocolate doesn't fall out okay as you guys can tell my kids love doing these crafts that i'm always doing or these baking hacks or whatever they've always loved doing these things with me you guys got to put those in the freezer the mix space [Music] so what we just did is pop the chocolate molds the ornaments the balls themselves in um the freezer okay so since we just popped those in the freezer what we're gonna do now i covered some of these little molds i'm gonna put these in the freezer we're gonna go ahead and finish these up go wash some of these dishes and then we're going to go ahead and make some cookies to go along with this hot chocolate mix i'll tell you one thing guys these can be very messy a because i'm doing it with four kids but if you decide to color them these can't be messy we're this is our first time doing this all right so what we're going to do next is make this i have this already um baker's corner sugar cookie mix and we're going to go ahead yes you're helping me we're going to go ahead and do this hold on all right so what we're gonna do next is we're gonna go he's gonna go ahead and help me with these cookies while the other three are washing the dishes go ahead grab the box and throw the box in there the bag in there i mean get it go ahead oh oh in there in there good job okay so what we're gonna do now is go ahead yeah no no no no you're gonna slightly tap it and then you're gonna hold two corners and then you're gonna oh you're gonna let it just fall in there go get the whisk yeah tablespoons of butter look it look you see this part and then you see this side let me see you see this one and now you see this the last thing that we we also brought some pre-made cookies and it's one of those what you expect versus reality things see and then where's this all right marley we're gonna all right so what you're going to do is start massaging it like that does that make sense yeah we're going to analysis do you know what you're doing yeah so what i'm gonna do is go ahead and start mixing these and get the flour going so we can go ahead and start making some cookies all right we're gonna check back in we just threw one batch of cookies in the oven we got about 11 minutes on those we're gonna check on the chocolate molds the chocolate ball molds so once we're done with that we're going to go ahead and start stuffing them with things so we're going to focus on this and then we'll be right back okay so now we're going to go ahead and attempt to take out these chocolate molds i have the ingredients that we're gonna put in there we don't need this anymore so i have some i only had large marshmallows so i just ripped them up and threw them in this bowl and then i got the hot chocolate ready and we're gonna go ahead and pop those up the freezer real quick all right so let's see how we're going to take them okay so that one didn't work so we're gonna have to bang them like okay what i'm gonna probably do is get some hot chocolate and get some hot water but then it's gonna melt i'm gonna go ahead oh wait a minute wait a minute oh i think i got it [Applause] i got one bomb guys if you guys want to try and try to take yours out but just be careful all right we're trying to go ahead and perform operation with some of these a lot of these came out good so the ones that came out good we're going to go ahead and try to mix put them together okay so what we're going to do is grab half of this this is how they're looking like oops i don't know what i just dropped so i threw a packet of these in there and what i'm going to try to attempt to do is go ahead and somehow melt this on there so we have our bomb it's so far they're looking like this okay so what i did is grab the hot chocolate bombs and i already threw them in the mug for each of them as you can see okay my camera died so i'm recording this on my phone now so what we're going to do is i brought we came over to the counter top what i'm gonna do now is grab all the mugs and pour them one by one so you guys can each see the different colors that comes out [Music] [Music] so this is how the blueboard lights now they're so much chocolate at the bottom now so how does it taste good all right and then masons he turned the red one but it has stayed well there's all the chocolate at the bottom so make sure you guys stir these really good okay okay okay okay so we finished them up already and they are super sweet so if you guys can try and figure out how to go ahead and minimize the sweetness i made the mistake didn't realize what time it was it's 9 48 p.m and the kids should have already been in bed um but they're definitely enjoying them do you guys like them yeah of course yeah of course they do because it's chocolate right so we have there's some cookies done so we're gonna go ahead and enjoy some go ahead and let them calm down for a little bit so yeah that's pretty much it we tried them personally as a parent i think they're a fail because they're just way too sweet i think it'd be maybe as an adult beverage you can add like baileys or something to it and make it um with alcohol in it um but for a child of course they like it don't mind that's my oven going hot with the cookies um so so yeah so that's pretty much

has heated to desired temperature we're going to give it just a little bit of a stir to um get the film and the bubbles out okay there we go looks good so we're going to take our right here and we're gonna set him inside the band and watch him slowly melt in the directions say when olaf starts to melt you can start to uh whisk or stir the pan for your hot chocolate he's starting to go timber i don't know if you can see the bottom of uh olaf fell out here and he is full of hot chocolate powder so we're gonna start giving them a stir all the powder falling out [Music] he's really melting now oh this smells delicious like you can almost tell this is just a probably a higher quality of cocoa powder i will say this smells very rich very very rich all right we're gonna use a whisk to try to finish off the edge here [Music] all right it has completely melted now final product is very good looking smells phenomenal okay so we're ready we have our hot chocolate now we got our spoon we got our cups our three marshmallows the next instructions were to um spread evenly over the cup so we're gonna give this a little bit of a stir it is still very hot steam is coming out so we'll start right here with little elsa this might be a little too hot for her she's still only four so we'll give her a little half a cup because it's probably gonna be rich and you don't like marshmallows do you unfortunately no so we won't put a marshmallow in yours okay okay can i put my spoon uh yeah she can go to marshmallow we'll give grandma some this smells amazing all right put a marshmallow in and then since you don't want a marshmallow do you want to break one in half you want to rip one in half oh there you go all right we'll give grandma half of a marshmallow we'll give daddy the other half of the marshmallow sound good okay now daddy's gonna get some what gonna get a little i bit wait i can't feel very hot all right so you put that in there and then you grab your marshmallow star you each have one put it in there all right that is so thick and rich i'm very probably going to have to dial it down with some milk yeah you could put more milk in it it's very it's more like melted chocolate ice like hot chocolate melted ice cream it's high quality very high quality you could very easily turn this into four six maybe even eight cups of hot chocolate because of how rich it is yes you put ice cubes in yours okay did you taste it cool it down i didn't taste it because it was way too hot from my mouth it's melting the marshmallow it's so hot yeah and yeah you could also put some ready whip on top or whipped cream or homemade whipped cream yes um that would be good or um if you're feeling real adventurous you could put some uh baileys or kahlua in it if that is more of your uh speed or a pepper that'd be good peppermint stick would be good especially like those uh ones from cracker barrel the little the soft ones the soft ones like a little stir stick this would be really good yeah it is really good you could definitely that is really good for me out of two servings give it two thumbs i could double the milk and make it into four servings and it not chocolatey enough i think i might be drinking all that you'd be up all night on that hot chocolate won't you look it's so good she even has the hot chocolate eyebrow yep the unibrow don't you we'll get you cleaned up oh my gosh and the marshmallow just puts it over the top when you get some of the melted marshmallow in here it is melted sip well i don't know i didn't get a marshmallow grandma grandma this is going to

you know that I finally completed the candy crush saga nightmarishly hard level 3394 last night as I said in the video that I posted yesterday November 29 the best way to beat this level is by creating and using any of the powerful combinations of two color bombs - wrapped candies one color bomb plus one wrap candy one color bomb plus one striped candy or one wrap candy plus one striped

bomb from scrubs bubbles I keep screwing the name up I hit corner scrubby scrubby scrubby zand it'sit's grubbles bubbles so let's drop them in he smells really good he smells like like almost like a blueberry candy cane you ever see those around Christmas time I'm like the blueberry candy canes even like you know Dallas deutscher like that it smells like that so it's a nice sweet candy ish tight blueberry smell oh you think now I don't know if he was supposed to sink he might have been he might have not have been but who knows there is luster in him oh I see it sparkles pleased pleased I really care that he sank really I mean it's cool when they float cousin they put on a really cool show but if they're not floaters and they're sinkers eight to each their own so let's hold him up and let's see if he does anything cool oh he does kind of like a foaming aspect to him so he's not just a basic phizzer okay I'm gonna go ahead and drop him and let him do his thing always got different colors all in him too i can see some line like my meanie honey color coming and his little purple on handy shuda so you kind of see the purple breakaway a little that's pretty awesome awesome alright guys i'm going to drop them and let him do his thing and then we will check his moisture is sent so far on sent so good i mean this one is nicely fragrant the water is turning a really pretty blue my hand smells really good if the hole in him it is a nice sweet blueberry sent it's not like a headache you sent at all it's just a nice sweet like candy tight blueberry scent I like this one he's a movie he's really fizzling man wait he's like I you got no little waterfall going on there I do like the foam aspect on the top I think that's a nice touch anytime you see the foam come up on top it makes you feel like you're slipping into like the creamiest Biff going whether it's that that makes out moisture in it or not if I sea foam I'm thinking I'm getting some luxurious cream back it does something to your mind like psychologically it makes you think like you're like sitting in a data cream some people wouldn't want that I want that I wanna go swimmin in pudding and yes rich is here with bugs right now it is the middle of the night and rich is getting ready to go to work he had a grab a suit and booths does not want to go to bed nor does he want to sit straight up in his little seat he keeps flipping himself upside down so we have to drawing stop her from doing that so far scent is nice and strong pretty good pretty good here some people do their bath bombs and they want them to sink um some people want them to float I personally I enjoyed floating bath bombs because it gives it like I like more of a show you know because if there is little specks of colors and things like that when it floats you can see them pop out you can see things happen so I don't know if this was meant to float or not meant to float I do you know the ones that I had previously from her they floated I believe I don't know yes I believe one did float um but I'm gonna have to recheck that video just to make sure so I'm not sure I mean who knows it still smells beautiful Wow now the last time I tried her products a little backstory for you I was not happy whatsoever these things had no scent they were all different sizes they were supposed to be the extra extra large bath bomb it was just a old big disarray didn't know what the hell I had in my hands had to go back on the website so now uh uh uh in a few of my videos i stated flat-out draw it on a magic manga and she did that so thumbs up for that hell yeah scribbles bubbles lady so I am definitely liking that I know what products i'm putting into my tub so i can tell yous and I'm definitely liking the more stronger scent now I got to say she beefed up the scent on these bad boys and they smell a lot stronger I did previously have the strawberry Jewish debris fields forever BAM I believe that's what it was strawberry Beth Ballmer Strawberry Fields bath bomb and it was virtually scentless pretty much you know no real good color on it no nothing like that but I believe it did float and it was funny yeah but it really wasn't anything that really allowed me and I don't know I wasn't happy the first time around so I was like yeah you know this is just not the company for me I'm done now we spoke and she wanted to basically redeem her company so i said i love redemption videos sure let's see how you do please go ahead if you'd like to let's go for it as you see what other companies they some of them have gotten reduction usually what happens is a company will open they'll start sending out their product and if somebody doesn't like you or anything like that they decide to go in and they revamp the formula so perhaps she went in and revamped a formula and made everything really dinner and really cool and now we're left with this really awesome product which you know everybody knows I love a floating bomb but even a sinking bomb can be just as luxurious and dress was beautiful so it's not really bothering me per se that it's synced to the gram although I would like to see the pretty pic today like you know phone thing that happens like see what it's doing right here and the last level like right before it does it I would have liked to see him do this on the top okay see I usually like the blue and a little bit of purple coming out of home you know a bunch of little flakes of stuff around him but he is on his end right now hope you feel so cool so why he's finishing up let's check out our water you ready this is a very very beautiful like cottony blue so the color is a definite one hundred percent improvement it was not meant to be a dark-colored bomb it just meant to be a pretty blue bomb and that is exactly what it is it is a beautiful pretty pale company type look I am very much liking the color IC luster silver li little sparkles everywhere so I am loving the luster the friggin light is washing it out on me do you see it can you kind of see them kind kick it up and sparkling it's hard to pick up on camera but I assure you there is silver glitter all through this so this kind of reminds me of like a nice cozy like wintry tight damn you know it kind of reminds me of like the movie frozen and it sounds stupid the frozen day long from lunch doesn't do it tonight but the blueberry bath bomb from scrubs bubbles reminds me of snow okay now i am seeing over here we have a nice depth of foam let's see if we get any sort of bubble coming out of it nice multi-layer let's do bubble drink to that Wow in press and press I'm each other's water off okay so impressed with my nice creamy layer of bubbly foam on tile impressed with my watercolor impressed with the silver Sparkle lustres in hands a little shimmers pretty impressed with the moisture to I mean if I gotta go scale of 1 to 10 I'm gonna say this once about a good I say so it's about good five maybe six she did really well on the moisture with this one you know so i gotta say i am pretty freakin pleased um first go-around was not all that great but i am very happy i really do like this one okay so i have a few others to do we also have a bubble bar to test out and i'm not going to say redemption yet but i'm sure you guys know i'm leaning towards it i'm really happy with us I really am I like of a blueberry bath bomb I like the new type ish formula i really like whatever she has done man so fixed on and make them better I definitely think these are good oh yeah oh let me try my hand let me see if the scent slinger I know that's really not how you're supposed to do it but that's the best way I could think to do it fast off like this rather than like stopping the video bathing getting back online that's just kinda like a painting estimate not a thing I don't want you back on wit use but you know I got a kid I kind of got a you know what do things I smell it all over my skin Wow my hand is bone dry right now and I can smell it yeah I can smell it on my skin I can smell emanating from the water so it didn't dissipate it didn't lose its scent it's actually really really nice I am very very very pleased with this I definitely like this one is a thumbs up one hundred percent okay so i will drop the link if your scrubs bubbles this is once again was the scrubbing bubbles blueberry bath bomb coming up next week to have the white tea and ginger bubble bar which tank the first I'm around so let's bring a gun it doesn't take this time but i would say bath bomb wise i really like this I really do I really like this look you can see the sparkles I grab them well you can kind of see them on this finger area she's got some blue sparkle in here very faint blue sparkle and the rest looks like they're like silver Sparkle can't really see it I'm nominated healing one of my fingers but can you kind of see the sparkle shimmer through here it's so pretty my Henkes going in the phone and then Garrett focus dammit I want you guys to see that silver must assume they're all through the water then just like blink idea yeah it's really nice okay I gotta say I really do like it I'm gonna get bugs and I like the moisture in this too this is really good this is a go oh look you Jesus you could see them oh via see the sparkle up against a wall here they're all through the tub all through the entire town these are like little sparkles to so these are not anything that I would be like upset with see like did I gira destiny see I wouldn't be upset with this or anything like this she did pick the right glitter she did pick the right colors and the scent is really really really nice so yeah I say this is a really nice bomb I really like this it is a very nice sweet candy tight blueberry not like the actual blueberry itself oh my talent show it is lingering on my skin I really do like it all right guys tell me what you think in the comments down boy what do you say do you say yea or nay I'm going to say a yay on this particular one one hundred percent I really enjoy this one I think it looks cool it does make bubbles and these are lasting cuz i am happy there alright

"hey everyone welcome back to awesome or pop valentine's day is right around the corner so treat yourself and your loved ones to some hot chocolate bombs these are a delicious and cozy way to spend the day i can't wait to show you how to make these but before we jump into it if you're new to this channel be sure to hit that subscribe button and turn on that notification bell so you don't miss any awesome videos [Music] all right so here's all the ingredients we'll need [Music] some white chocolate food coloring hot cocoa powder some sprinkles of your choice and some mini marshmallows let's first melt the chocolate i'll be making three chocolate balms so i'll pour in about half of this bag let's go melt this in the microwave for 20 second intervals until it's nice and melty there we go once it looks like this you can add any food coloring you want i'm going to leave mine white though now move over to your molds and scoop in half a tablespoon [Music] use a brush to coat all around it don't worry if it's not perfect we'll be adding a second layer in a bit do this for all of the spheres the reason we're doing this in two sessions is so the chocolate doesn't pull at the bottom this way you'll get a nice even shell [Music] once your first layer is done pop this in the refrigerator for five minutes and we're back time to add the second layer [Music] now put this in the refrigerator for 15 minutes so that it completely hardens once it's out it should look like this give the silicone mold a little tug to loosen the chocolate from the mold then gently invert the mold and pop out your half sphere look at how smooth that looks let's get the rest of them out [Music] now it's time to fill three of them up with a tablespoon of cocoa powder and then a handful of marshmallows it's time to close this up i microwaved this plate for one minute to make it hot this will help seal the spheres if you want you can put on some gloves that way you don't leave any fingerprints on the chocolate so grab a half and press it against the plate you can see the chocolate melting already [Music] [Music] and now attach it to the other half like so [Music] going back i would have pressed the bottom halves on the plate too before filling them that way it would have made the halves really even and easier to attach but it's too late now since i've already filled them you'll live and you'll learn i plan to make more of these in the future so drop a comment and let me know which themes i should do maybe rainbow bombs the possibilities are endless [Music] [Music] all right so now i'll put these in a cupcake liner for presentation while that's in there grab some more white chocolate and melt it for decoration i'll add some red food coloring to make mine pink [Music] that looks perfect i'll add that into a piping bag so we can easily drizzle it [Applause] [Music] let's decorate i'll add some heart sprinkles to mine and here's my final product what do you guys think hit that like button if you want one [Music] it's time for the big reveal i've got some hot milk here and it's time to drop in the bomb [Music] whoa did you guys see the marshmallows explode out that was awesome it smells so good in here this was really easy and fun to make i hope you guys enjoyed this video hit that like button if you did and don't forget to subscribe to see more thanks [Music] you", "npEzZEN_2A4": "[Music] hello and welcome to cooking with abby today we are going to be making hot chocolate bombs these have been all over social media and we are going to make them today so that you can make them at home the one supply that you need that you might not have at home already is a silicone mold it looks like this you get three of them in a pack go ahead and order them i'll add them to the link i'm going to share with you the recipe after this so that everyone can go home and make hot chocolate these are the supplies you need a silicone mold this is from amazon you get a set of three you need some marshmallows some hot chocolate mix i did a mix of milk chocolate and dark chocolate you need a paintbrush you'll see why in just a minute it's a nice new clean one that one that you use to make an art project with a spoon and a plate um and a trusty microwave step one put the chocolate in a little bowl we are going to microwave it starting with 30 seconds and then in increments of 15 seconds we don't want the chocolate to get too hot we don't want it to burn and we're doing something called tempering the chocolate i don't really know what that means but i know we're supposed to do it okay ready [Music] okay your chocolate's not gonna be soft yet but it's important that we stop it give it a little mix and we're gonna put it back in for 15 more seconds [Music] okay okay we're getting there we're starting to get some nice melted chocolate we're going to do it one more time we're going to wait a quick second so it just doesn't get too hot it's very tempting to eat the chocolate at every step uh try to resist unless you're just making them for yourself then have a party [Music] okay there we go nice melted chocolate it will continue to melt because i'm using a ceramic mug and the mug holds some heat now you are going to need your mold and your paint brush okay you are going to take a big glob of the chocolate put it right there in that mold and literally paint it it's gotta go all the way up to the edges so that you can seal your hot chocolate mug when you are done so you're gonna do one nice thick coat on all six okay when you're done pretend i did all six when you're done this goes in the fridge uh the internet says it only needs to harden for five minutes i don't trust it i did it for upwards of an hour um so that i knew it was really set step two so here i am back with our melted chocolate i decided to do four of them you're going to take more melted chocolate and do the exact same thing when you're done you don't want to see any of the mold through the chocolate you need to be nice nice and thick so i'm going to show you how we're going to pop them out of the mold in step three so just completely drop it on in there do a nice paint job all the way up to the edges that's very very important [Music] delicious right step three this is where we get to have a little more fun we are going to pop our chocolate out of the molds what i like to do is either put it in a cupcake holder um uh or take a little bit of chocolate and paint it in your plate because it's gonna hold it in place like glue okay here's our two coated chocolate molds you're just gonna stretch it very very gently and watch what's gonna happen ready we're gonna pop it out oh hello chocolate dome so i'm going to stick it in there and it is going to hold it like glue we're going to get our hot chocolate mix um use any brand that you like now um these are smaller than some of the ones you'll see in a bakery so we don't have a ton of space for these and marshmallows so i'm gonna put some hot chocolate mix into my bum i'm gonna show you what that looks like you just pour it in you've got your own little scoop now you see then if you have space which i'm saving some space you're gonna take some marshmallows and put them in right on top you got it see okay now we have to close up our bomb we have two ways to do it when i'm at my house i put a plate on a pot of boiling water and it kind of warms up the plate and i take the bum my favorite part is popping it out of that mold and i warm it up on the plate and it kind of melts the rim and i stick it today i don't have a double boiler system i'm going to close the bun see it looks like a delicious ball of yummy scrumptious chocolate and i'm going to paint around the rim with that melted chocolate we have now here you could have even more fun with this and you can decorate them melt more chocolate i i when i was making it for my teacher friends i uh melted dark chocolate on top so it looked like dark and milk chocolate together you could put sprinkles you can uh stick i'll show you what we'll do we'll stick a marshmallow right on top and then because we're making this at school i'm gonna deliver this one to jenny in the office because she really helps me out and i think a little chocolate would brighten her day okey-dokey ready i'm gonna put a little marshmallow on top and show you what it looks like boop oh yeah hot chocolate bomb i'm going to make one more while i have a captive audience because you know i like to perform a little bit did you know that all righty glue again glue down it's not glue it's chocolate pop out your chocolate dome um if you are my daughter you like to just eat this skip all the next steps it's delicious anyways all right then the way you eat these you put it in a mug you warm up some milk you can do that on the stove in the microwave depending on if you're with a parent or not um pour it on over and what happens is it pops open and you see all the marshmallows float to the top and then you mix it and if you're lucky you eat it when it's just the right temperature that you're having delicious hot chocolate and then you get a bite of yummy melted milk chocolate so so good um and so your goal is obviously what my goal was to give these all away and but i ate like 10 of them so you know thank you everybody for joining me today for cooking with abby we'll have to do this again sometime two delicious balls of hot chocolate i'm so excited to see you next week bye [Music] you", "LotI62wGFfc": "hey
