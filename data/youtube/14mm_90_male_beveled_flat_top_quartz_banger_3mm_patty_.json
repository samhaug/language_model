{"wXx9VerXxiU": "make a nice smooth cut on some pipe there's some cups I did that one has a little nick at the top I'll show you why I got that nick at the top there's a good one here Nick the inside see that that liquid metal didn't have the easiest path resistance in the angle of the bevel instead it cut to the side they got deflected a claw hammer works pretty good for this this you know you'll do this a lot if I wasn't trying to save this pipe I just come back here and cut it but I'm trying to get as many coupons as I can [Music] we should build a no problem so right now we're set up the bevel this way so we're gonna take this this is called your bridge number one tip we're gonna tighten it down down like so you're wondering why I have duct tape on my pants there's holes and I don't want sparks going here you have the bevel angle so we're at a thirty degree bevel it just be good for what we're doing tighten that down notice I'm just using hand tightening you know if you get a little crescent wrench or a pair of pliers on these if you start doing that this beveler is like very very new if you start doing that it'll make it so you always have to use a pair of pliers or vise grips which gets a little annoying so try to only finger tighten these you know until they get really worn out then start using a pair of pliers now we're gonna come over here and you have what's called your journeyman spring on this bellboy the bigger bevel is over two to four sighs have a journeyman spring which is a chain there's a chain that goes around the pipe and inside that black tube right here this black tube has a spring in it and that clamp tightens the beveler so we're gonna come off the edge of the pipe here and now we're gonna plug in our oxygen acetylene which I have koke Clint quick connects which I don't know you say kooky quick connects everybody in the oilfield and gas industry has these on there with these quick disconnects the reason why because you have a short barrel torch a long girl torches I'll show you and a regular cutting torch and you have to swap in between all these and we don't want to spend time with our wrenches and then when we roll them up on our reels we don't want to have a torch stuck on there I have to take the torch off every time so this is my long barrel torch much longer than the short barrel towards these are made by Victor we got the big one is for the acetylene they're two different sizes we got the small one for the Ark's again sometimes just get a little dust in them and they you want to make sure they click and then you can pull them back so they stay so on these barrel torches you have an F an F for fuel and an O for oxygen so you're gonna turn your fuel on and normally when you set it going it's going to work just fine if I almost open it wide open [Music] we'll get white boy I don't know unfortunate okay so that's why you set the flame now you got your crank handle here and you're going to want to gauge the crank when you start cutting we're just gonna pretend to cut inside so you're gonna start cutting right there make sure your hose is in a spot [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so slowly moving the torch that's going to give me the best start I try to demonstrate that for you let's see oh the other thing that's important is preheating your plate which it means turning your flame on and running around it with the with the acetylene oxygen set this preheating the pipe will help you have a smoother cut no more preheating it the buttery smooth cut you achieve the other thing you can do if it's a painted pipe run around with the oxygen on with the flame set and that'll pop all the paint off of it we're gonna coating here you go [Music] flame on oxygen stone [Music] now if we want to we go around just like so creating the place but I think I'll be just fine considering I've made a few other cuts I'm gonna start going towards the camera right now I got that spot made slowly rotating flipping action all the way on and now coming back the dress and I just carry on around the pipe now if you look here we made a nice starting for finishing spot of sardis that's our finish is going to be and there's nothing in the pipe for the molten metal to deflect off of so we're know we're gonna have a nice level you can see it's cutting really food now the only other have to worry about around [Music] [Music] [Music] any slack sometimes that left damage from the bubbler being cut down on the heart so now we've transferred onto that other gear a spot where all the fenders travel speed increase too much [Music] so now they sort your homies independent at the end make sure that the policeman we got a bouncer dropping them because it will pop a hole in there and your average torches you're using won't be happy in there - your own you probably very happy we're coming the car returned and there we go that's just a little internal slag it'll clean up really nice once we put a land on there that's how to use a bubbler with a short-barrel torch Sam deal with the long-barreled torch Jake Scofield taught me how to do this when I was his helper so check out Jake Scofield channel and be blessed guys", "aEaXO0LdoUQ": "[Music] hello everyone and I'm Dave with smokin J's and smokin J's calm today we're going to be getting some information on our thermo chronic quartz bangers so let's start with what is or how does thermochromic pigment work so as they temperature of thermochromic pigment increases the color changes so for example the best one is going to be the yellow the yellow pigment as its temperature increases it gets more red so it's gonna go through the orange spectrum and finally land in that red spectrum when it has full heat applied so as you see we have a couple other pigments though the blue the teal and the red the red and yellow get you a true color change as they're heated up red shifts to a nice dark purple and back yellows like I said goes to the red but the two blues less of a color change more of a color you forma t so more blue essentially but you can with a keen eye tell when it's hot versus cold so let's go into actually how to heat it up and how to use it so my heating process I take my butane torch I kind of start with a couple passes along the side that way I know the walls do have some heat applied because the majority of your heat is going to be applied directly to the bottom you want to make sure you have even heat or even color across left and right and front and back or front and back and left and right of the thermochromic pigment and also when you're heating it look directly down because you'll notice the bottom pigment is going to be more red and then the tops going to be more yellow so shoot for top and bottom being close to the same color once you have it to the full color shift cut your torch let it cool to your preferred temperature or call color range for me I shoot for a nice light orange kind of like this little more yellow than this dab tool here once you're at temp you'll let it melt off of your tool apply your carb cap a bubble cap does work the best for these bangers and then take your two fingers that way you're not going to be covering the hole and you want to keep it moving around so the goal of carving is to restrict the amount of heat excape insulting or heat are the more hot surface area that your oil is hitting so that's pretty much it it's as simple as heat it up until you see a color change let it cool until it's to your preferred color drop your dab in cap it inhale until there's no more smoke now enough of me on the thermochromic bangers for more information on all sorts of glass info or dabbing info hit or hit up our other videos on smokin J's com [Music]", "QuyibQl-yLU": "what's up guys today we're gonna do a product review of a thermo chromatics and bhangra so basically the football chromatic said is that yellow stuff in there see it was around it is a thermal bagger meeting it's double walled so clearly sans not coming out the idea behind the thermo chromatic stand is that it changes color temperature so the space is a lot easier to temperature your banger leaving a better smoking experience at low temps which most prefer for flavor so what happens is as you heat the thermo climatic sand it turns from yellow to red and you can also tell how to even the heat banger which is a great advantage so so you got a sports torch here and already it's starting to turn from that yellow to red a perfect example here so as you can see we're heating this side it's real while the other side and the middle is still yellow so if you're regularly torching your banger like that that's actually what's temperature is as you can see one side is gonna be harder than the other and that's hard to see with the eye but we'd recommend also a bubble cap here with this type of banger fits right in like that twirl it around again you want to heat it up most people heat it red clean it off of a q-tip or whatever you're using and then at the end of the day you're left with a grade low temp smoking experience cheers guys", "c-P0oTOvgSs": "loyal up y'all I'm Steve with elevate presents and I'm here today to talk about how do you know if your glass is really quartz well it's really simple you heat it up throw in water if it doesn't crack it's quartz if it does crack it's probably borosilicate and if it cracks while you're heating it it's probably soft glass we'll talk about that so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and turn our torch on and talk about it so we're going to heat this up for a minute so I can get it as hot as possible can be I'm going to just heat it up heat it up so kourt's what is it quartz is pretty much pure silica sand it's also called fused quartz because they just the stuff fuses together the silica and then the next thing is borosilicate well silica is made of silica as well about 90 percent of it and then they add some boron and a little potage to it and that causes something to it I'm not a chemist so I don't fully understand but it definitely causes something to the chemical composition of the glass and borosilicate can melt about half the temperature of quartz and then you got soft glass soft glass melts that even a lower temperature than borosilicate but it is actually more dense than borosilicate so that's a neat little thing so what is thermal resistance thermal resistance is how quickly something can heat up or cool down soft glass pretty much goes like this borosilicate in my opinion goes like this or maybe he goes like this I don't know I just made that up but quartz glass let me tell you it goes like this being a me and me and mam it can do a lot it's very thermal resistance it's really cool stuff hence why bangers are made over made out of it and whatnot so that's the little history on that and and here's a neat little thing so where cost keeps crystals are not crystals they're actually glass most stuff you see out there that they call crystal it's not crystal because it does not have a crystalline structure it's just glass so they've done a really neat marketing trick on you but anyways this is what we've been waiting for we're going to drop it here but a big bottle Bank could've shot out at me some water but you can see it boils it up there that heat is coming out of the glass into the water really really quickly water is great at sucking out heat and yep the glasses the water is actually warm there this is still warm good enough to where I can touch it but it's a steaming off a little bit and that's how you know it's quartz when I say when elevate says this is quartz you can dang well guarantee it it's quartz take it to the bank if you got somebody else that showed you some quartz and that stuff cracks then they're lied to you or they didn't really know what they were talking about so peace y'all have a great day have a good one [Music]", "9DbQJS6M2Yg": "let's talk bangers that hurt my head a lot Oh what's going on everyone TSM ETS 7:10 here back in front of our art wall today we have kind of a product review / giving you my insight into the world of banners no we're not talking heavy bass drop beats in a nightclub we're talking about ports bangers what pretty much every stoner that has a heavy piece of glass or just any dampering owns and honestly it's one of the most depressing things to go out and buy because you can go out and spend almost I think this is a $300 banger $300 banger and you can see it's all jazzed up you really can't see through it so they have a lifespan you spend $300 on something that only lasts three months when you could be spending a hundred dollars on something that lasts three months there's gonna be a big difference in audiences here of course there's the people that want to just up their Henny rigs and they're gonna spend as much money as they can to make give me everything look the best they can and honestly I do that too I have pieces that I love seeing these up you a truth Tech and binary bangers on but for the majority of people they're going to be looking for a sub $100 bank bag and let's talk about just the general things that we look for when we go for bangers number one is the price I think the majority of people are always gonna be interested in the price whether you got a [ __ ] a lot of money or you got a teeny little bit of money and you're going out and spend that on a banger I believe a lot of people are going to be very interested in the price second is gonna be heat retention and vaporization a lot of bangers are very very similar in this aspect especially a lot of the new ones such as wave club bangers Evan sure mayoral Courts Toro and highly-educated are a lot more on the high heat retention side and then like waves and Evan short titty bangers are more so on the low heat retention maybe a minute 15 cool down and then like a minute 45 cool down and somewhere in the middle of that lies this perfect heat retention to vaporization level that everybody's trying to get and I think a lot of these banker companies have I really do think that these binary bangers were the flat top equivocal bangers are a very very good way to go but they are a little bit pricey so if you were to scoop one of these up that wasn't fumes just a regular clear banger they are $170 which is pushing it that's really pushing it for me if you get one of the ones that have the engraved lines I think you're pushing it up to $220 then if you go above that this is a $300 binary binder and same with Evan Shores truth Tech's are really really spending a lot of people are gonna be asking about Toro and finally educate it I'm not really gonna touch on those too hard in here because they're not the bangers that I use these are for people that like to hit those really low temps and they're more so about taking one or two three really good dams throughout the day I don't have that type of patience and honestly Mike you might think I'm just stupid you're sitting here saying that 45 seconds I don't have that much patience but I really don't want I'm ending and doing my work I'm going to take a DAB and I pop over a three-minute youtube video and by the time that's done if my dad's not done I'm back to work I literally have to be on a train of thought at all points in time and if I'm sitting there waiting for a minute and a half two minutes three minutes to heat up and cool down before I even get to the dab it's really not what I'm about but I know there aren't a ton of people out there that love Toro and love highly-educated them I'm not here to bash them whatsoever they're both fantastic companies I own bangers from both of them people all the time [ __ ] talk me out I borrow you don't have to try these I have a v3 highly-educated gavel I have a Toro core reactor I have a Terp slurper I just don't use them as much because they take a lot more time and effort to get the heat in the vaporization out of them [Music] and going back to what we were saying price heat retention I think it big big new thing that people look at for bangers is will they shred her pearls just spin them around in a tornado of high-velocity turf Wonderland and a lot of bangers don't because their necks are too deep or you have to have a cast that goes way down in them that works correctly with the banger but I have found the end-all spinner tap and it is these D nail change glass caps these things are fantastic if you use these oil can't get pulled down the neck they spin faster than anything I've ever used and it's a big-ass solid I dropped one of these onto concrete and it just cracked it it still works fine if you didn't even crack a piece of the glass off it just has a crack in it now they are insanely strong and when you match them with a Nevin short TD banger a binary banger something that has this general shape and form of banger you can even see the binary bangers way way smaller the teddy bear from a store over here is a lot deeper which allows for a lot more oil to be put in there forget this all such kated check this out hmmm you guys needed to see it in there look at that how insane is that terminal velocity has been hit people I own for these caps all of them spin exactly the same as long as you use them on a banger that has straight down walls a flat base and it isn't too deep these things work fantastic so this is what the cat that we're gonna be using today when we go over a couple tests of these bangers and I'm gonna show you guys [ __ ] saved it I'm gonna show you guys a couple different points I want to make on why I think these Evan shorty bangers are the way to go I know I really haven't touched on that yet but let's go ahead and bust into this banger right here because I think you guys are gonna be amazed these run for $100 and I have honestly seen them on sale for 75 to 90 dollars if you watch out for a sale on these you can easily cop one for under $100 I want you guys I'll take a look here I'm gonna use my black shirt as a background here take a look at this bag just tell me just by looking at that right there how old do you think we're talking of albania come on clear up there I am there we go there we go so you'd be right it is three months old and I have been using it pretty much every single day since I got it I for the longest time was using right here every short bell-bottom bangers and as you can see on this guy right here it's pretty fogged up you see all that fogging in there I have found this to be a major issue with these bangers they last for about a month and a half and then once that fogging starts it's over personally I have no clue I'm not a scientist but I think it has something to do with the fact that they're bending the quartz at the bottom and maybe it's not structurally stable so it's I really don't know I'm not trying to [ __ ] get in the science [ __ ] here because lord only knows I ain't the one [Music] poor boy so when I started using one of these tinny bangers I was pretty sure I'd like cool I'm going to get about a month and a half two months out of it and it's gonna start chatting over two months comes two months goes and we still have one of the crispiest bangers that I own and it's not just this one I also have a 45 degree or two 45 degrees that I've been using on my mic Luna cloth and my bonsai tree from Lew glass a lot of my pieces have that 45 degree joint and that bangers even crispier than this one I wanted to use this one because there's a tiny bit of spotting on it so you guys could really see after three months that's all fits happened blown away so when I bought these bangers hundred bucks a pop okay you can get three of these for one of these or you can get two TV bangers for the price of one clear qcb and again I'm not trying to bash qcv I love qwave I really want to get another one of these binary bangers because they are so sick and they've been driving some of the coolest designs but [ __ ] this joint the majority of people out there aren't going to be paying that money so if you can find a sub $100 banger or right at $100 banger that performs just as well I think that's gonna be the way to go I've already showed you guys the Turk pearls we're gonna go ahead and just take a nice normal dab here I'm going to show you what just an everyday dad looks like then we're gonna zoom in and get some melt shots and I'm gonna show you guys how the oil sucks down the neck because I know a lot of people are really interested in that first things first though we gotta get this bitching up we've got a little bit of Kim for from my brother primo about buying about couple times in there wait to be sucked down also got the derrick core oh boy gold groovy Mediterranean crushed opal faceted I don't even know how you can get that many cool things on a piece yeah the [ __ ] heater that we've both picked up from stash box class gallery and then we Dinu PJ and slum glass collab over here just gonna be taking a couple dabs going over a couple things that I would really want to hammer home about these bangers and a kid guys I'm not here to bash anybody's bangers have you found one that works for you game among like I said this is for people that are looking for a banger home what we'll call it or a place where they can know that they can go buy a beggar and it's gonna be the same thing we're looking for the McDonald's bangers I fly into Hawaii and I break my banger I want to be able to go to smoke shop and be like boom I want that Evan short Kitty banger right there because I know exactly how it'll function one more time just because this is [ __ ] sick let's pop this on here and take a listen to the terminal velocity of this turf spinner so that's pulling as hard as I can here's just a normal down pole yeah that's right you stop [Music] so you can really see the difference between me actually trying to rip a lung out through the piece and me just taking a normal dem you're really not gonna want to be sitting there going it's not really effective way to take it down but some people out there do and for those of you who do this is the setup this is setup scoop me out a little just puddle here oh hello there why hello ladies would you like to see my baguette oh you would I thought so oh [ __ ] Anne instead timer whatever got our D nail change glass cap and we're gonna be going in cheers everybody [Music] little low temp but you can see that turtle is spitting in there not really having to put any extra force on it we got a nice load yeah probably about three or four hits I really wish might sometime I'm gonna drill that one on my head but in team small nerfs fashion [ __ ] time there we go who's starting to pull that chem flavor out - I got nothing just all [ __ ] planted herbs down low there oh so you got the reed you definitely see I am getting a lot more paper production Oh something I also want to point out anything about using what these Dino capsules if you use another like bubble captor anything like that this bag heart will suck oil down the neck just like any other banger out there will but if you use that D nail cap there ain't a drop of oil that went down there oh my god so you're gonna conserving oil and you like to spinners - pearls - spinners whatever you want to call them this is the way to go Evan short TD banger turbo foam and the D nail change class collab at caps so that was just a nice normal everyday job that's what I do if I'm just looking to take a dab in the middle of my work or just got home just pop a quick dab that's exactly what it looks like and this banger honestly I need drill it at the right time which I didn't would go for about a 30-second smoke sesh I mean you you get a fairly decent amount of vapor production in here now something I know everybody wants to see is a nice close-up black background melt shot of that turn pearl ripping around in there so I'm gonna try and set that up here so I don't have to move us around everywhere but that doesn't work I will move us out to the garage let's go ahead and get this done and try to see some turkey terms to spin well I definitely wouldn't say that this is a professional setup it's a chair a cardboard box a towel and a rig but we did get a nice black background shot I don't I haven't used this camera a long time I don't think it's gonna focus but you guys can see there that we have a nice shot all crisp tin so I'm gonna heat this up and we're gonna take a quick spinni dab all right I know there's a couple hairs on the dabber just ignore them [Music] gabs going on with spitting some terms [Music] oh my god [Music] [Music] it's a great setup removing dirt it really is no oil goes down the neck it really gets up to speed quick and eat it with oil in the banger it just don't Reds the Terps I absolutely love it and for $100 I really think this is 100% the best bang bang for your buck on the entire market I help people out there now say I don't wanna toss 50 boxes does the same I really really think guys from my experience in five years of heavy heavy damage for cost - length of life to vaporization and heat retention this has all of them it has all of them retains heat for about a minute 15 seconds and that's right we're gonna drop a perfect tab you can go a little bit earlier take a nice potty and it will [ __ ] go through it guys it will power through that that's how we're gonna this video office with a nice fat half gram just to ruin my day prove it it gets Pinterest it's got some good heat retention and you can really throw some oil down on it get the get the most out of your thick deep Evan story city banger today I'm definitely thinking though that we swap over on the dirt boy oh boy - just want VJ come down a little bit didn't since you keep the camera right and we are also going to bust out a very special titty beggar this is from Evan Shores Carbon series and that is a banger with a fuckload of black [ __ ] on it just slam it down through it not only slamming yeah we're gonna slam a half grammar through that how cool is that black net though it's really it's something like I've never seen it honestly he's released a couple new different styles I think he has the air and fire also now I was like a okay cred banger and an opaque white banger mind-shattering to see I did not expect it whatsoever but he is telling these new texts for the courts let's go ahead and get those heated up we also have our J s glass spinner cap over here this thing is phenomenal it matches this piece pretty damn well so I'm using it today here calling that good right about there into this jar of Anthology Oregon over here let's just get ourselves a goober I'd call that one [ __ ] fatty where is my focus down there focus up here just quit doing weird [ __ ] there we go I'd call that a nice big fatty probably bordering on a half gram come on all the way there but I'm always mom I'm always one for the first scoop over the you know perfect scoop we're gonna be going pretty hot Big Damn definitely don't want to let it cool off all the way we're not gonna get anything but flavor and no vapor kindest thing hits so what freakin well I love it no splash at all whatsoever nothing on my lips I it's a great piece it's a really great piece this beast splashes more I mean straight tube over this recycler style so probably should we're gonna go ahead and drop this damn right here right now people just each and every one of you watching thank you so much for stopping by even if you're new here I love appreciate you guys give me a reason to make these videos let's get it cheers just think that one through did not think that one through this is insane you guys gotta see this so it's just spinning the oil that's why I didn't think about that since this is a special one and probably one of the prototype ones he didn't it's not as wide of the normal TD bangers are so this cap didn't work this is the one I wanted to use though because it matches the rig Punda bucks I really think it's a solid investment in the courts team there's a lot of other magnets out there they're 150 plus that are really really nice bangers but Evan Shores proving here that you don't really need that much money before a high quality of american-made or it's product they sing the last forever I'm three months in without a spot of chance it's crazy how solid these bangers are I really recommend grabbing one of those Dean change glass caps - it's just even if even if this Bangor thing means nothing to you one of those caps is just gonna blow your mind they're so [ __ ] cool I love them I think that's get around up though I really don't have any more to say I am Gooden bakes that half gram definitely could have gone better I probably definitely should have used a bubble cap but as we saw that was not the way things were going today thank you all so very much for showing up to watch to my patrons a very very big special thank you to each and every one of you guys that keep us supported December was one of our biggest months ever and it's really gonna make this this coming Vegas trip with a gay king at the end of this month a lot easier and a lot more fun so thank you all I really really appreciate you merch is all on sale if you guys want to check out every single thing on the site is on sale until it sells out we're gonna be doing some restocking on some stuff here so I'm just trying to get rid of it www 710 works if you'd like to check that out and have a great [ __ ] day your own beautiful wonderful amazing people please remember that and as always please [ __ ] be kind to one another just be nice I love you guys Cheers [Music]", "ARLiX2FEayA": "yes going on people's time for new video in this one we're gonna be looking at courts bangers and whether or not they're any good I've done a lot of Courts binaries it's basically a nail that you can dab with it's a different kind of nail though it's almost like a bucket shaped you heat up the bucket drop your dab in and obviously that goes into your rig and hit like you would any other DAP I've also got a really clean capture to go with it if you don't know what really clean catcher is or what reclaim is in general basically when you dab you end up with oil either going down in this case it'll go down the stem of the banger or on my other nail my Madam's nail it will just go down straight into the rig itself this catches that stuff because reclaim is still good you can use it in edibles because after dabbing it it's been deep decarboxylated and you can read a bit as well because it's still got potency and it's just leftover oil so if you haven't got one of these probably a good idea to get I can't say that I recommend wouldn't yet because I haven't used it in order to find out whether or not there's any good so yeah but not waste any more time we're gonna get straight to the video have a quick look at these two parts loader put them in the rig and then hit fat dabble for them alright so here it is guys up close and personal you've got the glasshouse reclaim capture obviously with silicone bottom that's where our reclaim is collected and then you can remove so remove the bottom it comes with a cap you'll reclaim will be in there and you can do as you wish with it that just sits on the bottom and any other small sized silicon pots that you have for holding your oil will fit this so it's somewhat universal now as far as the actual banger goes the only thing I'm a little bit iffy about was the fact that this joint is a slam blasted obviously as you can see here see here this is a lock idea this gives it a little bit of grip and helps it become air tight now with the inside of this being sandblasted and the inside of any of my other stems of my rigs being sandblasted it's not too much of a problem because it does still core it just not as much so I wouldn't say it's a negative but it's not really important but one huge positive if you have a look at the bucket on this the thickness of this quartz I mean there's gotta be four or five millimeters thick and for something so cheap that's quite surprising to see and knowing that it's gonna retain a lot of heat so I'm quite looking forward to giving to go but other than that I mean there's a good little thing considering this is probably paint on other websites and I got this on which less than 20 paint including post room packaging which I mean half the cost when you buy a glass one which is the ship in now this compared to it don't know this is the nail from my other rig is covered in [ __ ] reclaim it's nasty basically that sits into the top of your rig when you get this in and then your dome sits on top of that now it's a great regular great nail the problem is this does not retain enough heat for you to have a decent sized dab off okay it just doesn't so it's good for little hits and that but I think we're starting to outgrow it so we're gonna heat this bad boy up put it in our welcome to put our rig first then we're gonna heat it up then we're gonna rip a [ __ ] doub out of it so stay tuned for that right we're almost ready we have got our reclaim catcher I'm Bangor in the bomb that we're gonna be using we're gonna go with the daily driver we got a nice and clean for it using the banger and using a different torch which I'll show you in a sec we're gonna be able to take a much fat at that because their nails gonna get hot it's gonna retain heat for longer so we have got a fatass tab where my standards are fast at before some of you flee me out that's what we're gonna be hitting as much bigger than a lot of the dabs I've taken I'm not sure if that's focusing so fingers crossed it is if not I'll edit I would put a picture of it in but yeah that's what we're gonna hit and yeah this is the torque we will be using obviously this is constable normally use it's got a little flame for the domes nails but these big-ass nails we need something like that so we're gonna be using this again from wish I think I was like 7 pound and a couple of quid delivery cheaper than anywhere else again so yeah a lot of stuff I've got recently has come from wish and there's a couple more things coming from wish because I went a little bit mad so expect to see a few more things featured on this channel from that website all that apps sorry so yeah I'm not gonna waste any more time I'm gonna start heating this [ __ ] nail up and stop oh one thing I forgot to mention guys as well is you should have been able to know it's already there should be a quality difference in this since upgrade and win and that I'm able to now record in 1080p at 60fps rather than 720 at 30fps so she'll be a lot smoother and a little bit more crisp but obviously you guys have to tell me I don't actually know yet whether or not it is but there's nails getting hots [ __ ] I think you should be alright to go in a minute but I don't know so I'm just gonna get it really hot and then let it cool down a bit for you to this torch is doing work thank you wish this video isn't sponsored by wish by the way none of my videos are they just so happen to have the cheapest [ __ ] I think this is gonna be hot enough okay [ __ ] pills [ __ ] me yeah feels warm okay oh [ __ ] alright alright if I wait too long I'm gonna waste my dab but if I don't wait long enough is just gonna [ __ ] vaporize and I'm gonna end up Ness and I I still [ __ ] hot and I let it cool down a little bit hopefully this will focus into the banger for you you'll be able to see Cheers that was far holy [ __ ] huh even with pool in a diamond I think I'm still a little bit too hot cuz when I tried carving it I mean it might be where it's not actually a carp cat but it didn't do [ __ ] off that's what I think the oil was already done before I even got to there so that was that was definitely a heart and hurt you dad oh holy [ __ ] and smoked anything today either guys so that's like a [ __ ] punch in the face oh definitely the biggest table I've ever taken that was nice oh that was really nice I mean I'm happy with that banger that did good man literally I see people they sort of put it on the side put the oil on the side of the banger and let it sort of drip down so that's what I did and it worked perfectly like I said carbon it did not go well but I've got a carb cap on the way from which and we're gonna give that a go but it turns out that that's pushpin [ __ ] don't even know what to say anymore [ __ ] I guess one thing to say cause bangers are definitely worth it just off of that first hit there oh [ __ ] me it was really nice the fact that you can take a fad as a before there is a big bonus to me I love the little rigs it's like a little flavor condenser you just get straight terpenes when you use a rig like that you know I mean you get every flavor of it it's gorgeous but this one you do get the flavor it's not as intense it doesn't coat your mouth as much but the [ __ ] size of the DAP but knock you on your ass so if you want to go wine tasting get yourself a little myself a Brig if you want to get [ __ ] smashed get yourself one of these bad boys other than that I think that's what I've got I say I'm already super high and I can feel it sending more and more and more so before I get so [ __ ] that I can't even finish this video off I'm gonna sign that now guys if you enjoyed this video like subscribe comment all that fun stuff I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next one soon", "_vQRXtsdwb8": "all right so that you guys can see the dish is completely covered in oil but the bagger is completely clean what's going on guys my name is Jeff also known as popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe we got a lot of little videos on the way like today I'm gonna be showing you guys what quartz inserts are quartz inserts are little quartz buckets that you drop inside your bag to prevent your banger from jazzing using this fish keeps all of the oil residue inside this bucket rather than getting inside your banger and it also will enhance the experience of a low temp tab and since no boil will be touching the Banger itself it won't get chest and won't get worn out now these little inserts can still get chests but it's way cheaper to replace this little dish than your entire bagger personally I always recommend changing a bag and once it's chazz because you're losing a lot of flavor and also the aesthetic look of a chat banger just is no good to me now I'm using a cloud products banger as always though my preferred brand and they make inserts themselves so if you get a cloud products banger on their website you can also buy inserts that fit perfectly for your better now there's two ways you can use quartz inserts that offer a better low temp experience there's the drop insert technique and there's the longer cooldown technique let me show you those now the drop technique is my preferred method so I'm going to show you guys that method first first what you're gonna want to do is give some concentrates I'm dabbing on this East butter from G leaf right now it's a brand new processor in the States I don't know too much about them but so far I really have not been disappointed now you're gonna want to put like a moderate sized bath in your insert not too much because if you do it will overflow and residue will get on your banger now it wouldn't be all the oils so the insert is still serving a purpose even if it does overflow but if you don't have any owner flow your banger will basically be brand new forever now that you have your insert you're gonna heat up your bagger alright so I just started my timer with the drop technique you only have to wait like thirty five seconds before dropping to insert into the bag so that's why I recommend pre loading it so you're not rushing in this period because typically when you let a bagger cool down this is this thick you wait like a minute minute and thirty seconds alright five seconds you guys so we're gonna drop it in and we're gonna put a bubble cap on top and see if I can give a little loose a few guys it's starting to melt and once it starts to smoke up a little bit is when I hit it alright so now you guys can see the dish is completely covered in oil but the bag is completely clean cloud products also makes these silicone tip tweezers which make handling the inserts so much easier another thing you're gonna want to have is a little dish of rubbing alcohol I recommend just getting a shot glass or a bowl dweet jar cuz it's always good to recycle we're going to pick this insert up it's still hot but we're just gonna drop it right in the rubbing alcohol and now while it's sitting in there it's basically cleaning itself and it's no longer hot because it's submerged fully and cool rubbing alcohol bow-bow that soaks if we take a look at our banger it doesn't even look like it was used i still recommend wiping it with a q-tip dipped in rubbing alcohol just to be safe but there's essentially no residue actually on the back so this can keep your bag of brand new and even if you take your bath too hot you don't really have to worry all you have to do is let the insert and rubbing alcohol and if it's Chaz's all you do is take a torch to it and bring it off now if you do that repetitively it will CH as the insert but as I said in the beginning of the video it's better to replace of ten rather than a $40 product there's definitely a learning curve to this but just like dabbing there's a learning curve to finding the right time to death and once you master it you're really gonna rarely find yourself having a puddle to reheat or having your dad get burnt up too fast and honestly it's nice is if you do take a big dab it really gives you a wider range of a perfect glow test at time so if you're taking a big dab you want to have that perfect time for the longest period of time to keep getting your hit all right now let's take this out of here so you see you guys I did go a little hot on that and all I got to do is wipe it off with a q-tip other eye so just coming off okay you know what I took that a little hot all I do is clean it without the alcohol now it's not a great flavor out of that but you can wait even longer and give like a much longer low temp tab where the first few hints you don't even really get smooth you just get a great flavor but it builds up into a great hit because the bag is still cooling down while you dropped it in there but it's at a very hot temperature for the next 45 seconds it's going to still get progressively hotter so you still have a big window to enjoy your dab again it's more intense and more intense so it can start like a really low temp label hit and then it just keeps getting progressively more intense and all of a sudden your five hits in and it's just this big milky cloud and you are lit it's really fun to do it this way I feel like because you get a full flavor experience while still getting it nice and pets hit because sometimes for flavor you have to sacrifice the intensity of the high alright so the next way I'm going to show you is called the longer cooldown technique what you're going to do is you're going to drop a clean insert into your backer so now it's just sitting there so you're gonna heat it up [Music] start your timer and this has basically created an extra wall of thickness for your bangin like a four mil thick cloud baguette has just become a six mil banger but the bucket is smaller that you have to use however instead of waiting like a minute 20 a minutes that are used to take your dab on this type of banger you're gonna have to wait like a minute 52 minutes the point of doing this is just like having a little shield for your banger but still dabbing the traditional way so if you do that too hot you won't chance the banger itself just the insert will get all prepped up the longer heat retention is also nice because if you time it right you'll have a longer window to get that perfect tenth tap so I'm just going to drop this right in there and this is a like a minute fifty guys and interfering up oh yeah [Music] now that was awesome that was after a minute and 50 seconds it's just about all the dab got burned up that was honestly a perfect 10 pip I really can't complain the flavor was on point it had a nice nice cloud to it and just like I did with the drop Tekken sir when I pick this up and get my rubbing alcohol I'm just gonna drop it in here it's gonna repeat the process now Klout sells these and packs of one three or five so if you want to buy a five pack you can keep the sets going by just dropping one used one in here letting it so it's good you can just load another one up right away keep the stuff going it's always nice to have actually you know not for any banger you can get inserts that are that size all you have to do is find out what's the diameter of the bucket and then get an insert that's smaller than that that'll fit but it's really cool that clock has these because you can buy the banger and then just buy an answer if that's gonna fit perfectly for so let me know which one you guys like the drop in technique or the longer cooldown technique both have the purpose personally I like this drop technique because it gives you a lower temp it first and then the heat consistently rises within the insert so you kind of get harder hit as you're smoking when typically when you're taking a dab on the banger it's cooling down so every hit is less intense nonetheless but with the drop technique it's the opposite and you can start slow and then it builds up to a way more that's it but for either technique once you learn how to time it right you should be experiencing a wave all intensive and you're used to on a typical banger and when I do this I feel like I have less oil residue left behind on the insert than I do when I you just hop the banger so I feel like I'm getting more for my money out of my dad's when I do do this but you don't have to do the drop down technique it is also cool to have the longer cooldowns because you do have a bigger window of the perfect type that once you land at a time at night I took that dab at a minute and 50 seconds and when you do it normal Babylon club banger like a minute and 30 is still a nice low temp that so it added an extra 20 seconds if not 30 or 40 to the entire window of the dab let me know which way you guys think is better in the comments down below and check the link in the description to check out claw products banger line they basically have everything you need for dabbing and it's a really great product I stand by it and I personally recommend them to everybody they ask me what's a cheap high-quality bangies I'm pretty soon guys I'm not gonna lie this is a few Gigli definitely does the job that's makes you guys look like and subscribe appreciate you watching my name is jeff peace [Music] yeah I need to go after [Music]", "5kUDSQq67mE": "you know what's going on people is time for a new video and in today's one I want to go over something that I did quite a while back but didn't go over as properly as I should have and that is turn pearls otherwise known as tur peds and they basically age your dabit experience you don't know what they are we'll explain in just a second I do want to let you guys know why I'm redoing this video so when I did the video originally I was just excited that adds a new [ __ ] turn up I wanted to make a video on air and realistically I didn't exactly pay homage to Tara pearls as well as I should have so we are gonna go back we are gonna revisit these and we are going to talk about them my opinion does stay somewhat the same however I will go over why and I will really explain exactly what I think of these and where I think they're best suited now I'm sorry for this video being late there has been some complications once again however are literally I've gotten from work about 10 minutes ago I'm sitting down and making this video now and I'm getting uploaded to 9:00 so if you're watching this video right after it's released just know an hour and a half ago I was sat here doing this so shout out to you guys enough of that you'll hear the term promise let's get into it no don't know what they are they're little balls that go inside your bang around the heat up along with it and when you drop your dab in as long as the second word temperature you put your carb cap on and that syrup for a well spin or however many you've got in there it will spin and it will drag the oil around the banger and it will make use of all that residual heat that's around the banger because where you drop the oil it immediately starts to cool that hot glass or quartz tank and if you've only got your with in one spot you may have a scorching outside of the bank and the Banger that's cool them down covered in oil you want to make use of it all and that's what these are designed for now I do you obviously have my dad rig with my banger don't know if you can hear or see that but there is a little chapel in there all this black [ __ ] will be gone once we heat this [ __ ] up now the problem that I have with these things is that I am so terrible we're getting the right temperature dad that I never get it Bob on to make full use of these Tara pearls I feel like the only way that I personally can get my temperature just right is when a cold start now the reason I don't call start dad with Tara pearls is because around the bottom is great it will drag it around how ever when that little bead gets full of oil uncovered in it it drags it around the edges now unless you've heated up the edges just enough to be ready for that oil it's just gonna drag it around it isn't gonna go anywhere it's not gonna vaporize and you're wasting half you adapt so you do really need to heat up the entire nail if you want to use terral's i'll say that you can't cold start with syrup rose but I am saying that if you're gonna do that you do need to be careful about getting the rest of a banger heated up so you can actually have your dad but I [ __ ] it up to go along with Charles there are a couple of different carb caps you'll need and the carb cap is what makes things things work because they don't spin on their own you need some things as I rep the air to get them to start spin it now there's two different types of cough caps that I find there are other kinds however they serve a similar purpose is to another one I've got get weird but you'll see so this right here is a carb cap that is designed for these things this is the cheapest basic most piece of [ __ ] called cap you can get a tops or [ __ ] brain because when I was dabbing [ __ ] bong resin I did that for a video use this car cap because it is useless what it is supposed to do is go on top like that and the angle of this little bit at the bottom is supposed to push your beads across as you can see it doesn't [ __ ] work it's [ __ ] and I should I should expect it because this is off wish what we need in order to make these things work properly as a riptide carb cap now I'm gonna clean this [ __ ] off this and the oil and I'm gonna show you up close up so you guys can see exactly what makes this thing work the way it does it's in the top just like that and as you can see around the edges it's got little slits in that angled and this is to push the air in a specific direction which in turn makes the bead spin so as you can see there's a big difference over this car cup and this sheet little things so if you are going to use to have pearls or something you want to get into this is a must-have or anything that does the same with the turtles you can't get little marble car caps which are basically bubble caps however when you put them in instead of it just being a little straight bit down it is again angled and it pushes the air around and it spins spins your pearls for those of you wanting to know what her pearls are and how they work that is it but we're gonna use these [ __ ] now I just wanted to get that first by the way for the people that weren't too sure and as you see the things that I did want to say during this video so what I'm gonna do is go stick my pizza in the oven get hurt I'm already blaster [ __ ] this get higher [ __ ] finish the video down I need some food so I will be right back and now we'll be heating this banger up as soon as I'm back though the nail is currently scorching the hot we heated it up enough to completely eradicate the color that was on the side of the banger as well there's all the black [ __ ] that was on the bead or the pearl and also one thing that I did [ __ ] up with as well was the soda the size of the dab that I took so we're not going to play any games we're not going to hold any [ __ ] punches we are gonna take a phat glob of some star dog oil this stuff was being shown however it is battered up so uh yeah now I just got nice little bit star not buy beautiful stuff has been expertly produced and I could not be more grateful oh here we have it guys I'll try and get a nice little close-up for you guys so you can see this I'm gonna cough my [ __ ] guts up oh but Cheers so yeah I was too hot I do need to express it was the heat and the size of the dub they provoked that reaction the turbos [ __ ] Oh as you can see was too hot they still did their job a little bit that's right oh my god Oh guys I've had you this how do you debit it to recover vamonos wipe away my tears of joy compose myself and I'll come right back angle I took a minute to get myself composed or a cover a little bit and I should be able to speak to you guys now there are a couple things that I want to go over and thankfully I'm not going to be judging Tara prose as a whole off of that last tap that that was too hot it wasn't too hot to be using pearls however to make the most out of them it was too hot the thing is I'll mention these things a while back in one of my videos and the reason that's taking me so long to actually get around to making this video is because I've been testing these things I I've been trying different things with on different temperatures different oils and I've wanted to really get a good feel for them before actually made up my mind and said something on camera and [ __ ] up the video once again something that I find is yes it does with the perfect temperature dabs bring out the flavor a lot more however only really find that is worth it when you've got premium oil if you've got anything that's a little bit subpar or anything that tastes like absolute [ __ ] there's nowhere to go so well thankfully the show dab does taste good however personally I feel like it doesn't make enough of a difference for me to want to do it all the time like I'm gonna be honest like though it isn't that much extra work I just love my bubble cap like I just that's why I enjoy using so that's what I use now with the dab that I took just then the way that the turret pearls did help is the fact that it was hot it helped me clear out a lot faster because I started putting hard those things were spinning they start going up the wall of the banger and they used the heat from all around the bang area and it just helps incinerate that wheel so it did go quick and it was too hot however those two pebbles did help in a way just for our hot tub and not a low temp on in essence yes they are worth it but if you do need to make up your mind yourself whether or not they'd be worth it to you because they do make a difference I'm not gonna say they're just some random thing and they do [ __ ] all they just look cool that's not the case sorry lost like they do make a difference and they do help it's just up to you whether or not you think that difference is worth there or not experience might be completely different when you use them really high-end rigs bangers and pearls a lot of my [ __ ] is fairly cheap at is China when I say it's fairly cheap I mean this banger that I'm using is just like a cheap Chinese mass-produced one as well as the pearls and I know you can get completely cost buyers obviously but the pearls as well normally that course but you can't even get ruby ones so there's a lot of variety there you can get some really nice share and whether or not that makes a big difference I do not know but I'm not gonna before can I like there's like 50 or $100 per pearl to get some [ __ ] Ruby Turtles I'm sorry but that has not happened in so yeah somebody wants to sponsor me and send some over and say dude they're [ __ ] amazing go for it but I am [ __ ] paying that much fuzzy Burl's anyway guys I hope this video has been a good one I'm sorry there is a revisit something that have a Ward have done however I did feel like I owed it you guys I have you that video to give you something a little bit more substantial because yeah literally watch in the back now it does make me cringe a little bit but it is what it is I will post the link of this video in a comment sorry on my other video so hopefully you guys there from all video come over and check this one out a bit of a new updated opinion I'm sorry this video is going to be late I was hoping to be able to get a two-night however if it's probably gonna be tomorrow mid morning afternoon time so I don't apologize on that however there is obviously a video for this week so it is coming out there will be another video on Wednesday next week I'm not sure what it's going to be but we'll wait and see because I'm sorry that I've chewed your ear off for a little bit hopefully you enjoyed seeing me [ __ ] myself up on that dab because that probably was the only and it's handed back to this video I am sorry for that but hopefully I'll be able to do sound a little bit better next week darkness of that though I hope you have enjoyed this video I am sorry again there is Lee and yeah I'm gonna end this one here guys so thank you for watching and hopefully I sitting the next one soon", "625IRxCST5E": "what's up YouTube - boy some chef Josh how y'all doing tonight tonight I got a new piece we're gonna

about one more day at work I got three-day weekend yeah that's extremely hot so chill for a minute let that cool down I know it's a nasty habit but I gotta give it up soon [Music] think I'm a got nothing a little too hot [Music] feels like it's pulling down guys who's that set of timer but it's got to be good set that there well you guys go we'll see this milk cheers everybody [ __ ] who taught us [ __ ] now hey guys maybe oddities that my toil on that here [Music] who yes yeah learned if I hit it too hot boy had choked I don't like it you are big old puddle in there Oh how the [ __ ] do you clean it he's back up you better get off it there's still a [ __ ] ton of oil left in there whoo cheers doing good [Music] I'm using this wrong very cuz I was using the wrong guys Oh I guess you want this piece down in that so you move that I think I put way too much oil in there no idea I'm gonna [ __ ] clean that with a q-tip or how that even works well let's see what we got to do there [Music] yeah [Music] it looks a lot of oil in there guys his hot and sticky I'm gonna get that out very that is one hit lots of ways everybody on the videos I've been seeing been doing fat rip so I'm going to try to do a fat rip myself I should have practice time for it in this show but that's the high roll I want you guys see the learning airs you know we're all [ __ ] human we're all stoners yeah I don't know how you're gonna get that a little chunk out of the bottom right here but definitely experience [Music] I guess you just took it out of there and let's see if I can get this to hit right but I don't want to smoke that in 1/2 seed oil so I'm going to try to clean this [Music] water by eating this and we can hit that oil down the bottom we don't hit that with the torch let's check it out and see how it goes yeah maybe I used it wrong and I'm not really impressed why don't I have a thermal banger any day that was an abundance of oil normally wouldn't it hit that big butt all the videos I've seen on Instagram but that globbed in it and it's like circling through but oh I don't have the lung power like someone's got to do maybe it's the bombs too small to get that flow but definitely highest [ __ ] but that's to be expected when you take a half gram damn oh you real dabbers out there no the damn sweats are about well those two hits I got the [ __ ] Bab sweats guys oh definitely you got the extra money check it out it's called the Bangor Lube corpse crystal it's pretty cool as you see but I don't know maybe I just use it wrong do you guys have one or if you know anybody who does have one and post in the comments tell me what I did wrong tell me what you think about it y'all have a good night I hope y'all enjoyed the show smoke shop Josh peace out", "3fzwOlZ3Lqc": "what's good youtube welcome back to another fire video it's your boys with the smokes man and in this one i just got done literally heating it up man heating up the banger but as i can tell this is gonna be a video of taking dabs off the rig man so let me show y'all what we working on let me show you what we're working with real quick quadruple og man check it out man smooth smooth shatter like i said it is quadruple og so we're just gonna jump right into it tuesday everybody that's my fault babe the flavor is there i usually you know mess up the timing on the temperature right there but i think i just got it just right if anything it was a little bit too hot but overall the dab burned through and it was a good hit man a great way to start it off you know what i'm saying so let's get this reheated y'all know man that this piece the thing i really like about it is really that that just there you know what i'm saying that's what really caught my attention to this piece i know uh haas the uh the maker of this glass makes you know quite a lot of these but uh you know when i find that right damn hold on hold on guys my fault everybody i was not even in the frame that time but uh we back fixed it up you know what i'm saying so like i was saying uh i know haas makes a lot of these pieces but uh i'm gonna be looking for that you know one-on-one piece soon i just uh wanted something besides the bonding to be smoking out if you know what i'm saying so i like this one let's keep it a little reheat too spoons it's just so smooth on this i don't know something gotta happen i think i know what it is too is like i just cleaned both of these things before this video and i think something was still stuck in this one and it finally uh went through and it messed up all the dab but we basically already smoked it all so give me one second i'm gonna clean this up and we're just gonna jump right into it and i just cleaned it uh took me just a second i thought it would have took longer but uh just a second but uh let's get to this next dab uh already pre-loaded up you know what i'm saying all i gotta do is heat it up but uh when i was cleaning it out man uh the thing i could say about bare quartz uh you know my first time actually having them you know as a banger and what i can say about it is off the rib you see this like little spot right there i don't want to burn my finger but basically right where i'm pointing the flame to right there you can easily place a place like your your glob mop in there and it'll clean easy like and i was really surprised with that i think this is dying this is dying right now something always happening trying to trying to mess up the vibe of this video but give me one sec like i was saying before my something happened uh basically uh it's easy to clean on this uh bare cords which i really uh can dig can dig i really uh i really enjoy that y'all check it out y'all just see how super easy man all the other bangers i had were never like that you know if anything it was like lower i don't know i couldn't describe it but i've noticed you know that uh the bare quartz is uh a lot easier than other bangers so now go get yourself a bare quartz man a smooth smooth little banger but cooling off already i think i figured out the right uh the right timing like i said i do want to get an email but you know we're just taking some dabs right now three two one okay i was talking too long right there gonna heat it back up i thought the first one would have had more smoke i don't know just a perfect attempt to reheat it onto like it's really not burning me it's just it's just good smoke you know but yeah that's covered that one's done that was a good hit man like i said very smooth as y'all check how it is in the piece let me give you a little slow-mo stupid i don't know what i was saying but cleaning out the last dab your boy just been having a crazy video this video i don't know you're not gonna be able to see it but throughout this video just crazy [ __ ] been happening you know what i'm saying but we keep going because he's here sir hips are smooth man uh while i'm heating this up i can say that quadruple og is the truth uh it's very smooth i did have a problem on that second hit but a quick little reheat worked out in my favor and i felt like solved for the problem like there wasn't no problem in the beginning because it was that smooth so we're gonna be coming down to the last hit right here maybe maybe have an extra one i don't know depending you know what instead of having another one as y'all see this is the size of the third one so instead wait for that to focus so instead i'm gonna throw some extra ones what i don't know what i'm saying your boy going up to quadruple g but what i meant to say you know instead of taking an extra hit i'm just gonna probably throw that onto that so let's get it now we got this so the bangers should already be ready you know what i do i don't trust that especially after the last hit we're just gonna make sure you know what i'm saying but i hope y'all man dabbed along in this video uh i said it's been a crazy video i want to make sure there's no uh there's no water on this y'all stay tuned this cap will get replaced but i am really enjoying it man unless i find like a real off the wall cap i'm gonna just you know keep using this for now but i definitely want to be on the lookout you know what i'm saying but i just like like the turquoise i think that's what you can describe with the greenish on the top it's torque gorgeous like i don't know but is that the right word to describe that color i don't know but uh the color definitely is what got my attention plus this being just a black subtle subtle little piece why not you know what i'm saying so i think i've been talking about uh too long but the dab has to be ready so cheers see boys talking too long just a little bit that's what happens man you try to talk and but shoot everybody's gonna work hey it's all good though man still good taste to it that's the thing about these banger heads you gotta wanna you gotta wanna take his off the banker man okay you know sometimes you're just not gonna get the right temps unless you got the email but it's just that's just that's just the whole thing about it man then you get a smooth oh smack crazy hit it smack me over here looking at it i might have a little reheat i don't know but i feel like i reheated it enough so y'all let me know y'all enjoyed the video you know drop a like uh crazy last hit you know what i'm saying uh definitely uh definitely a good smooth piece whenever you find the right temps if you don't have an email expect to find the right temps you know when you're smoking on your banger but that's just the whole thing of it that's what makes smoking on bangers fun you know what i'm saying so uh thank y'all for watching uh don't forget to drop a like you know comment subscribe if this is your first time watching i appreciate you if you're already subscribed you already know what it do uh i appreciate y'all my og's my day ones y'all already know but uh hey thank y'all for watching like i said the quadruple og is the truth crazy video and uh let's see like i said the quadruple og is the truth and uh yeah guys stay tuned for more videos it's your voice for the smokes

people's time for your video in this one we're gonna be reviewing it Terp pearls sell it right that time set the tenth [ __ ] time dry and that basically the little pearls that go into a course banger and they do some cool [ __ ] we'll get into that a second I just need to say what I'm sorry about the glare you see to the right of me basically I've got my curtain shut because the light just messes up the way the video looks and this is literally the best I could do also I need to see that this channel is intended for people of 18 years and older if you're any younger than that I need you to click off the video also these videos were made for entertainment and educational purposes only you should not try what I do in these videos just because you've seen me do it and I don't want anybody to feel encouraged by what I do I just do these for fun but that being said let's get straight into this video what are telling pearls basically they're little ceramic balls that go in to your banger now paired up with a carb cap that redirects air these are supposed to spin the reason they do this is because when your oils melted it's wherever the oil goes in the Banger that part of the bang is going to start to cool down now with these and with them spinning around it should drag the or wearing the rest of the banger and make use of the residual heat that's in there so you should get a more consistent dab and you should be easier to hit lower temp taps in theory this is the only pet peeve I've got with this it doesn't actually spin as well as it should now I'm gonna put all this back together and show you a close-up I will try to get it spinning and it does work when there's nothing in there however I feel like when there's oil in there it's not gonna spin whatsoever so I've got a good feeling this is probably gonna fail but we're gonna see first time if it does or if it doesn't on youtube or on camera so let's see if we can get these spinning yeah so as you can see they do spin but like I said with oil in there the moist low and down then I get stuck to each other and they might not move as freely so don't expect this to go completely as plans I don't so you should him but we're gonna heat this banger up here the pearls up and just see what happens I completely forgot to show you what prolific Davin as well we have got some star dog rosin I finished pressing this out earlier got about quarter gram of it gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous rose in the color of it is perfect completely clear from another forward to getting a little dab of this because I haven't tried any of this obviously since bus let's meet you know I actually haven't actually smoked in dab hopefully you can see that decent size to it it's just a bit packed up I'm gonna pause our record in start heating this banger up because we're gonna try and get a low temp tap so I'm gonna be timing everything so I'll come back when we're ready to hit this thing Cheers [Music] holy [ __ ] as you can see there's a lot of residual oil in there a lot I'm disappointed because to me that's wasted oil as part of a dab there I've just missed out on it was nice don't get me wrong I feel like it just doesn't do why should you know I mean I don't know it's a difference having a little tempt out butter pools pearls then having a low temp down with a regular bag now to me it just gives you something else to worry about something else to focus on rather than that she taking the hit itself so I'd say just go a little bit hotter and then enjoy it dab rather than Alfred to do this [ __ ] but no coughed my shot off the side but it's okay let's see so my final verdict the way I see it is there's just too much extra stuff to focus on while you're trying to hit dab I feel like the more focus you put into actually hitting it and having it properly you'll enjoy it more than just by having something that spins and apparently gives you a better dab to me I didn't know it's a difference in hitting the dab I just know it's there I was spending so much time focusing on whether or not these things were spinning and working that I just ended up dying on the bomb and there's our lot of oil or the outside emotional high well the cameras picking it up there's a lot of oil in there so a little bit disappointed I do feel like I've wasted a bit of shatter using that so I'm gonna stick to the old bangers but if you want something that looks cool you want to impress your friends with it then go ahead and get one a lot mine I wish it was like seven quid maybe another couple of paint postage and packaging so you look at about a tenner it's not that bad probably is a real quartz so do be warned if you are got to go out and get one of these [ __ ] things but my personal recommendation just state to a regular course banner so yeah sorry I've got any better news than that guys but I wanted to give it a go see how that was and if it was worth it maybe is if you've got this perfectly crafted piece and all this [ __ ] but if you want to go with a cheap and cheerful option it definitely isn't anything special with that being said I'm gonna end this video here I love to thank anybody that's watched if you've enjoyed it drop a like and subscribe that would be great and hopefully I'll see in the next one soon", "SGkVik-kvww": "[Music] [Music]", "7URraPdxhVI": "in this video I'm gonna go over the basics of low-temperature dabbing and why it's the preferred method of cannabis extract consumption for myself and many other cannabis users to properly explain the benefits of using a quartz banger first I'm gonna go over the use of a titanium nail so we can compare how the experience differs when you're using a titanium now either the nail style or the domeless dish style acts on the same concept you need to heat them up to pretty hot usually pretty close to red-hot drop your dab onto the hot metal and when you draw on the rig it catches the vapor with either the pipe in the center of the dish or the dome around the actual nail style nail you're starting with an extremely high temperature and rapidly decreasing the temperature of the metal and to compensate for larger dabs you need to use a higher temperature a higher temperature that your nail is the more likely it is to damage the cannabinoids that exist inside your extracts you can see pretty easily on this piece there's a layer of carbon on top of the titanium that's called seasoning your nail and this shields the oil from the heat in the metal so this damage is your cannabinoids less than just burning them on a hot piece of metal but it's still less than ideal one of the main things that sets quartz apart from titanium is its temperature density this means that it holds its temperature for a lot longer than the metal does this allows you to have a larger window in which the courts will be hot enough to evaporate the hash oil that you're dropping onto it and in turn allows you to fine-tune the temperature that you want to evaporate your hash while at to conserve the most cannabinoids possible and to get in my opinion the best flavor possible out of your extracts carb cap is necessary to properly utilize a quartz banger because of that large temperature density and the fact that it holds its temperature for a long time you can actually let the temperature of the bucket dip below what is required to evaporate oil at regular room temperature and pressure by closing off the top of the bucket with a cap and reducing the pressure inside the bucket so for the same reason that water boils at a lower temperature when you move to a higher altitude because the air pressure is lower when you lower the pressure inside the bucket it will lower the evaporating temperature of the liquid inside the bucket some caps are just a flat paddle or a piece of glass that you can cover the bucket went and manually choose the size a hole that you want to let air in through and some come with a little vent or a little hole in it and this one is a directional cap so the air coming through the hole will move the oil around inside the bucket hopefully two parts of the bucket that are still warmer than the parts that have been sitting underneath the oil that's been boiling in them it's important not to drop oil into your bucket while the quartz is hot enough to actually burn it you do not want to leave a layer of ash on your quartz at all because just the same as how the layer of ash in the titanium nail shields the dabs from the heat in the middle the layer of carbon and roughness on the bottom of a bucket will act as a heat shield or insulator between your bucket and your oil and seeing as this bucket is going to be a lot closer to the temperature that you want you don't want to mess up your ability to gauge how hot you need your bucket to be to have a pleasant dab now figuring out how long to heat your bucket forth and how long to wait before you drop your oil on it is different for every bucket but the thicker the court says the longer the heat it will take to reach a temperature that you want and the longer that you'll have to wait between removing the heat and dropping your oil into it ideally after you drop your dad you shouldn't see the rig milk up entirely with vapor until after you drop the cap on top of the bucket you want to leave a little bit of a puddle at the bottom of the bucket after you're done your dab the reason being you can use a q-tip to clean it out not leave any carbon buildup to mess up your temperature density or temperature retention like I mentioned before now at first it feels kind of wasteful cleaning out cannabis extracts with a q-tip and throwing them away but if you're doing this properly is highly likely that you're wasting far less cannabinoids than if you're burning them using a high-temperature dabbing method if you're careful with your temperatures and diligent with your q-tip routine you can keep your bucket looking great and performing great for a long time now it's inevitable to get a little bit of brown or black stuff burned on to the bottom or sides every once in a while and to clean that out I just dip a q-tip in a little bit of rubbing alcohol and give it a scrub while the bucket is warm but not hot enough to evaporate the alcohol and then ice wipe out remaining alcohol with a dry q-tip I hope this video helped illustrate why low temperature dabbing is a preferred method of cannabis consumption for myself and many other cannabis extracts enthusiasts because it preserves more of the active cannabinoids and provides a better flavour than high temperature dabbing methods", "-CsX3ita75Q": "[Music] do what's up and welcome back green fiends today we're going to be shooting this new video i just went out and i bought this new quartz banger here from higher standards i also went to a local smoke shop and recently picked up this titanium nail right here with a built-in cap we pretty much had the idea to all get together try these two bangers out and give you a direct comparison between titanium and quartz we're all just chilling around right now drew and ever about to pull up and we're going to go ahead and get into shooting this video but before we get into that make sure you guys are sub to the channel and we really do a lot to make these videos happen for you and make sure you guys are in the discord because we're in there all the time and uh we're just hanging out and talking with our fans so make sure y'all are joined to that bro oh [ __ ] man's got the dab what's up bro everybody got pets [Music] yes sir oh [ __ ] i had to bring that bad boy in the live resin i may have brought the pack jacob can i take a test real [Music] so what's up guys we're now on the tripod everybody's pulled up we're here we already know what we're doing we're about to be smoking out and getting high a little bit of reviewing here and there but we're really getting high as [ __ ] most of this but uh we're all about to take a hit one hit each off of the titanium now and we're all gonna take one hit each off the quartz now we're gonna get a good comparison between the two we'll get right back to you i'll go ahead and mention that we're actually going to be smoking this titanium nail right here out of my new rig that i just caught this is a little recycler piece here about 12 inches tall with six chambers in it [ __ ] is insane you'll see a little close-up image of it real quick and a little bit of the airflow works of it but i caught this piece for like 70 bucks i gotta settle on it at a local smoke shop and it's a it's chinese glass i ain't even got a cap it's not name brand or anything but it hits amazing i haven't had one issue with it i love it so far great ass [ __ ] piece i actually talked about this earlier in the intro but it actually has a built-in cap on the banger the [ __ ] like uh it gets way too hot to touch yourself you have to use like your pick or your torch to actually cap it but that it's pretty cool that's built in i didn't see any smoke yeah i didn't either i was not honestly um see if i can really like left it on for too long i have no idea what happened [Music] a little bit a little bit i don't want to be that that i don't want that one to be my judgment hold on when using a titanium nail all you have to do is heat until it's red hot wait about 20 seconds then proceed with your dab see i thought this thing was supposed to last like five minutes so i looked i looked up how to heat a titanium nail just like first thing and it says get it red hot and give it 20 seconds then drop your [ __ ] and pull it we will try that next time so under rick's discretion we're now going to heat it up red hot and then wait 20 seconds for the cool down because obviously that was way too yeah i just wasted a dab right there dude that i'm gonna go ahead and get my dab out that hurt man that hurt my heart yeah all right so i'm about to take a hit of some of this key lime pie right now this is some crumble i got uh i'm actually gonna take a bigger hit like i'm gonna take a norm a bigger hit than i normally would uh just to see like i don't know if it would actually milk like i kind of i'm curious so i'm gonna put a little bit of a bigger dab on there for you guys and i'm also gonna like i said heat it up till it's red hot and wait 20 seconds we'll do that [Music] that's some milk yes there you go [Music] how smart you use a lighter oh damn how'd it taste so honestly i will say that key lime pie jared you know this for a fact you have to get a good temp out of that key lime pie to get it at a nice flavor that tasted like i hit the puffcoat really remember remember how that puffco tastes sterile that's how it tasted like almost you only let it cool down like 20 seconds so this one must hold less heat yeah the glass shout out to jacob let me get some of this key lime pie too try this [ __ ] out on here is it five four three two [Music] one yeah i was pretty solid um i [ __ ] with it i mean i got solid smoke out it didn't taste like it was like coming from a titanium now or anything it tastes like straight dabs honestly but i don't know it's a little weird are you hitting keon yep well we're all smoking on the key lime pie okay cool [Music] i don't pass my time [Music] damn that's a nice hit yeah that's how you're good that titanium that was surprising a little bit because i honestly was gonna like i had very low like expectations for it going around but i felt a little punch i mean not enough to cough but i can definitely feel it next we're going to be smoking on this higher standards quartz banger we got here uh i picked this up online from their website for like 10 bucks it's uh apparently you know like really high quality quartz and well polished and everything and it's supposed to be very durable compared to you know like your average like this is probably something from like dhgate or something like that some wholesale website that's just mass produced they actually you know take a little bit of time into crafting their products so to compare this one we're going to compare it to a you know a little bit of a nicer banger um i honestly recommend you guys go check this [ __ ] out like for sure like for 10 bucks this [ __ ] is [ __ ] fire so far [Music] i [ __ ] knew it dude i took that [ __ ] way too hot yeah yeah you can see it charred up at the yeah i knew i should have waited bro damn well that's two [ __ ] [ __ ] dabs right there so i'm about to take a hit of some of this 92 kim wax from next one uh you guys will remember that [ __ ] if you uh watched our video on the 0.5 dab hit i still haven't finished this because it's kind of like you know when you drink too much alcohol and you have like a really bad hangover and you don't want to go back to that alcohol for a while it's kind of how i feel about these right now but i'm gonna try to finish off this little bit i got up [Music] left [Music] that's a good temp right there [Music] that's a nice little hit i actually have a lot left stuck on the pick but i heard a little okay i'm gonna start using that thing less now because it doesn't i know it doesn't every time burn like i when we first got it i was like i remember you guys being hyped as [ __ ] those types of pigs well one thing they're good for like actual like puff coats where you scoop it up and just dump it in there but the other thing is like those are supposed to be like where you can just like melt it on the side of your nail like just hold it up on the side your nail melt it off and then take it off and then cap it and then hit it like [Music] that's a yeah milkshake all right guys so we're back everybody took a couple hits off of both the bangers now so we're gonna all go around and rate these two off of a few categories uh we've decided the categories that would be best to rate the bangers on would be heat longevity flavor and the air flow so rick's going to go ahead and ask us what our opinions on it real quick and we're going to go ahead and tally up the complete scores and see which one's better so drew how'd you like the flavor of the titanium banger oh i feel like um my uh judgment is miss clouded by bad guy so i have to say the flavor is probably going to be like [Music] jacob how'd you like the flavor of the titanium banana i give it a honestly seven straight up because like i said it's really hard for me to get a nice flavor out of that key lime pie and i did so i'll give it a second everyone you feel about it um i gave it about a seven too i get like i got like a good taste of dabs i'd say but it did kind of have like a funky taste to it and that might have been a dab but at the same time like it had a little funky taste to it and i guess that's kind of the titanium there so yeah i give it a seven probably all right jared how'd you how did you like it bud well i think i may have taken mine just a wee hot because uh it actually punched me a little harder i didn't get as much of a flavor out of the key lime pie um i mean it wasn't the worst but we're also hitting them on two different bongs so i feel like that has you know something to do with it as well but i'd overall give it like a six the next question drew how did you like the airflow of the titanium was the titanium [Music] straight up all my [ __ ] smoke went into the ceiling yeah jacob i'll give the airflow uh i don't know i'm trying to give it a medium i'll give it a six i got a nice hit six give it a six we all did it correctly deborah how'd you i give it about a five i'd say um i got like some it looked like it got good milkage on it like a good solid hit but like it did not blow out i didn't really blow out that much smoke in the end so um yeah nah give me about a five honestly and it was a fat head too so it should have been better than what it was jerry i actually got a pretty good hit out of it i didn't put too much in there i put a fat cloud whenever i put on the capper so i give it a seven yeah i want to let you take a hit i'm sorry hold up real quick we're gonna we're gonna cut this into the video drew got a shitty ass hit out of this and i want this man to be able to give an honest opinion for you guys so we're gonna reheat it and i'm gonna give drew a dab hit to take out of this four two [Music] okay okay i will give that a solid a solid eight on flavor all right keep another zeroes up i'm asking so i don't have to click equal yeah um zero on airflow because like both of those dabs i could see the snug just rushing up to the ceiling no matter how hard i was dragging off that so yeah dude and the reasoning for changing the flavor oh dude the flavor well i didn't get a good hit off the first one um but jacob got it timed up perfectly for me and the flavor was uh it was solid dude it tasted like i was hitting it out of the puff coat bro like so i i [ __ ] with that man all right how'd you feel about the heat holding sierra man um i'm gonna give the heat holding like a four or a three i mean it shouldn't cool down that quick like drew said but at the same time i do like how it holds like a consistent like low temp like two to three hundred that way it's easy to reheat but yeah that's it um i don't even know dude like like yesterday when we were hitting it i thought it held really good heat like that was the one thing i kind of [ __ ] with about it where it was like you kind of almost can save butane because it's like you can heat it up and then you can hit it between like a couple different friends but like i don't know after this dude probably like a two or three like it's i guess a two i think two point five two what's the number well i said it two or three so i'll put a 2.5 like right i put yours as a 3.5 because you said three or four okay okay so yeah i say like a 2.5 i guess but yeah like i said i give it a solid seven because i mean it hit just as just as well as like he said the puffco like it had just a perfect down and it cooling down too fast doesn't really matter whenever i'm in on the perfect tent i agree then last one is longevity for the titanium and then we're moving on to the quartz cool i doubt you can break that thing i mean like that's got to be intended it's right here i have titanium all over my body that holds me together right now like literally titanium forearm i got a titanium heel titanium knee all types of titanium everywhere so i think that just goes to say right there like titanium is very [ __ ] strong and i don't see that [ __ ] that is made out of the same [ __ ] that is replacing my bones right now i don't see that [ __ ] [ __ ] breaking yeah yeah 10 all around the world yeah let's just go down real quick longevity opinions uh rapid fire ten ten for sure ten okay all right drew how do you feel about the flavor on the quartz banger um i'll give that [ __ ] a solid knife that's not judging off that hit i took today i had took a hit earlier yeah jake how'd you feel about the flavor tan i love that banger i'm sorry to say that higher standard finger is just on another level 10 out of 10 for that finger specifically denver how did you feel about it uh i get like a 9.5 10 i guess like i mean i just want to do the same thing as jacob but just say ten bro ten i mean yeah i just yeah tens that's a perfect score so it's weird but yeah dude the hit that i took off when you hit it at a perfect temperature like for real like like i just sit at a perfect temperature like that i out of all other quartz fingers like you can get some you know knock off graham quartz bangers and [ __ ] like that that probably aren't that good you know i mean you can't even get that good of a flavor out of it no matter how good of a temperature you hit on it but that right there was probably one of the best quartz fingers i've had so that was really far over jerry how'd you like the flavor 10. that's all i got to say how's the airflow in the courts there damn that shit's [ __ ] cool as [ __ ] it's interesting how it does that jay how do you think the airflow was you guys will get to see some melt shots after after this video we're gonna be recording a couple so i mean you'll just see bro 10 out of 10 that [ __ ] thing looks insane watching it's beautiful it doesn't like if you get it at a right temp you will not see any smoke to drop that cap on 10 out of 10. ever how did you feel about the airflow um i give it a 10. it caused like like uh they were saying um one thing like for me once again when you hit the perfect temp like it just melts down and like you can just watch it melt off your pick before you even start pulling on it just sits there at the bottom of the banker and waits to cap it and like i was watching jared hit his and like you could just see the smoke like building up in the banger like you i mean it was really cool so you can see firsthand like how good the airflow was working so like i definitely give it a 10. sure outlier still pretty good i mean it worked the airflow i mean i wouldn't say like better than any banger i've tried but i'm still yet to try some of those like even more expensive bangers so i kind of got to save it listen to bougie badass over here how did you like the heat holding in the cords 45 sec or 30 seconds on i recommend at least 45 seconds if not a minute off so that's like an average quartz nail i give that at least a average 7.5 it's decent you know it holds heat like a normal nail [Music] jacob how do you like the heat holding i have issues with the heat holding not the fact of it getting too hot the fact of it getting too low too quick sometimes so i will say for that fact that i will give it a six on that but still a great bear deborah how'd you like the heat holding um i don't know it's it's still a new nail so that's one thing about it like it's a new banger so you kind of got to break it in a little bit before you can really figure out how good the heat holds on it and stuff closed new bangers are just never really going to hold heat that well but um i mean i've had some instances with it where i've hit it like too hot and too low temps so i'd probably give it about like a six like jacob was saying like it's not perfect right now but it could like once we like really start to break it in it could start to get a lot better honestly like a good pair of shoes yeah exactly i mean now like that's not saying chasing it like that like you gotta take care of it and [ __ ] but like christmas yeah you gotta christen that pretty much exactly how did you feel about the heat holding um i'm right on port right on par with these two with what they said i i've had instances where it cooled down a little too quick i i had to reheat it i've had that happen multiple times actually so uh yeah about five or six give me a six how do you feel about the longevity of the quartz banner i mean this coarse finger is made of durable quartz and it's crafted for long-term use so stick as [ __ ] it's dude comparison right there [Music] it's much thicker i wish jacob would let me do a durability test but i mean we can't really judge it yet bro listen i dude honestly bro like listen this is my first hand everybody look out look out for what don't don't do anything stupid stop all right all right all right i'm gonna say 10 dude for for chords dude 10 right jacob how do you feel about the potential longevity of the quartz banner okay i'm just gonna say as drew said it's very thick compared to a normal banger not only the actual like bucket but the stem is very thick compared to a normal banger and also i've noticed that this one listen this is a brand new banger right here from a smoke shop that i paid five or ten bucks for [ __ ] chased already already i haven't hit it five or ten hits this [ __ ] stays clean it stays clean longevity isn't just like you know breaking that [ __ ] like that's how good that [ __ ] is gonna last i don't wanna chased out banger in a week i wanna bust an ass banger that's going to last me a year at least minimum so for ten dollars 10's all day 10's all day bro let's go how do you how do you feel about the longevity of the quartz thing um i'm going off experience from my cap i have a quartz cap that's like it was like 30 [ __ ] dollars um you know who saw like they sold it to me [ __ ] but well i mean it's honestly not [ __ ] my point it's like the most durable cap i've ever had like we've had it for almost a year now and like i've dropped it on my [ __ ] stairs and it hasn't broke so like if it's anything like that right there which is kind of saw like dude it's a tint for sure bro i mean it's it's not going to break like how do you feel about the longevity well i like the fact that it doesn't jazz very quickly but the only thing is is that it's not a full weld it doesn't look like if it was a full weld it'd be a little stronger so for that i'm gonna have to give it like a seven that's all the questions i'm just telling up the so the titanium banger had a total of 99 points out of 160 which equaled about 62 percent overall like rating okay the quartz banger had an overwhelming lead with 140.5 points out of 160 which gave it a total of about 88 percent overall yeah [ __ ] i like how you add like the grading in there like the percentage it's a b plus it's like a b so the nail got an f the nail got an f yeah there's no d above d it's 62 yeah that makes sense yeah that makes sense all right minus yeah let's try the the titanium now d minus the chorus it makes sense yeah so that's a good that's a good one so i mean i pretty much i think we all knew this was going to happen from the beginning yeah that the quartz now was going to win we still want to do like a good i mean even if the courts now won i would still say for as old as the titanium bangers are and as like you know old gen as it is they still hold up to the day you know even with the new stuff that we have quartz bangers and all this jazz i still say that if i was in a pinch i would use that titanium banger any day i mean if i really needed it i could see some people like actually liking the titanium now like i said like it's smooth it doesn't like you know i mean it doesn't really punch you that hard so some people kind of like that but at the same time though like i don't see i like that's like i was saying it's literally like playing on a playstation 3 nowadays yeah why would you want to do that i mean like you're going back in time

piece of glass question I get quite a bit as dude bro fam how do you keep your courts looking so clean and I'm like I just don't Chasma bangers fam I mean oh no how do you keep your so dirty so I thought I get the question enough I wrote a nice article about how to keep record screen and I'm gonna actually show you them so the first rule of not choosing your banger is stop taking hot dabs I know some of you guys like super hot dabs to where they're catching on the fire I'm not a big fan plus the more you do that the more of that carbon char you will get on the banger thick bottom china thermals I like to wait a minute 20 depending on how hot I get it and you can tell if you got a too hot by what your dad looks like after if it's all dark and Burt you probably got a little hot if it still looks decent like some nice reclaim that it was probably alright minute 25 on these thin bottom bangers you don't have to wait as long but you can't take as big of a doubt because it loses its heat a little quicker than the thick bottom bangers do I like to give these usually about a minute depending on how hot I get just to switch it up we're gonna go with the J read not for the third one a little different design all courts nice surface area for the dab to go on you don't take super big dabs out of these knots though cuz it just won't hold its heat I like to give it about a minute alright so we did the devs we got dirty nails ideally you would just wipe it out after every dab and it won't build up but we let it get kind of cold in there so and everyone gives me [ __ ] about this but I'll show you what propane torch it's definitely what's up when your torch cleaning so at first you just get it warmed up and this is the thick bottom one right so just get it a little warm you'll see a ring of oils start to creep up and you'll just wait these are awesome for this some people like to use alcohol I don't really I mean it's cool cuz when you heat it up it like makes a little blue flame [Music] repeat it again and you'll see another secondary ring start to creep up wipe that [ __ ] up now you should be good and I need to just torch planet this is what propane comes in handy [Music] do the same for this one the thin bottom ones you obviously don't have to get us hot first off like to get the ring started cuz and you're really just trying to wipe up any excess oil that's gonna catch on fire because that's where the char and [ __ ] is gonna cause the chance to happen once you see the ring stop coming up you're good to get it just hot as [ __ ] and torch you listener now for the knot it's just gonna be a little different since you're not dabbing in the hole some people do I tell the people about to dab around the fins there so all that excess oil you really just aren't in a torch clean it there's nothing you can really do about this is we're taking not big dabs the key is just doing it after every death and not letting that [ __ ] build up and not letting it catch fire and be all gross and [ __ ] and not taking hot dabs that does playing also helps Matt Lee Heung Boks other stuff stars like sweet piece of glass [Music]", "J8oK0fzvuUM": "what's up guys Matt from Green Dolphin here hoping to keep you up to date with the latest and greatest in cannabis news and content so today I'm gonna be breaking down my all-time favorite bang a few guys the 45-degree angled wide bottom Evan Shore banger so this cut up angle is from Evan Shore there Girton is coming out of Cali over in the United States they've got a bunch of awesome and affordable quartz bangers available for sale including Teddy bangers they've got thermal quartz core bangers as well as just these traditional bangers here so the 45 mil angle band I liked a lot better cos it's compatible with most discard caps and bubble caps I caught this one up a mate last year and I've been using the absolute hell out of it ever since so obviously you can see the little bit of residual oil sitting on there from a high temp dab I took this morning but all in all quality organ or oil in oil quality is looking and sitting pretty so this one in generalising 10 millimeter joint at the bottom so it's compatible directly with any 10 millimeter rig or if you've got a 14 or 18 you can simply pick up an adapter and it's gonna heat this in the traditional style for taking a low temp dab this thing just regulates temperature fantastically I can easily take one or have a mate hit dab right off the me and this thing will still be sitting hard to heat up this Evan short banger for a low temp table you're gonna want to hit it with this blazer torch for 25 seconds sort of moving all the way around the outside so in my other video I described how to use the quartz back for a low temp job so now I'm going to show you guys and describe the experience using my Evans short banger so right now I've got some piece water loaded up into my doctor Dabba 9 mil per rig so piece water as opposed to number water just contains some enriched manuals and nutrients which helps to keep your rig clean and free of any residual reclaim or oil you can see it's just floating around in the wall so getting rid of that is this simple it's just tipping out of this little ring so right now I'm gonna use my torch to heat up that now 25 seconds now people are probably using timers and stuff for this I generally just like to count in my head so you guys can count along with me and let's go [Music] that's roughly 25 seconds I'm a little bit longest to get rid of any of that residual carbon it's just sitting on the now so in the 45 to 60 seconds and you can wait for your banger to reach that low tenant dab sort of temperature you can just prepare your dad so I've got some New York City and diesel sugar wax here dispensary just load some of that up onto my Dabba and the meantime you can sort of after doing this for a while begin to judge the temperature of your now similar by holding a hand close to it so I'm gonna put my now and it's the bug Benelli or there's still a massive amount of heat radiating off the top so I know there's still at least 20 to 30 seconds before it'll reach that low technology so just a quick note on that low time and high ten dagger on since refers to the temperature of the nailer time you're gonna get a lot more of those essential toads and flavonoids what a high temp will give you a much bigger dab so a lot more instagram-worthy but if you're sort of a flavor fanatic you're not gonna be for you so it's judging now that's almost reached about low 10 all right bombs away [Music] mmm super tart rich on that one guys so with the Evan short banger as well there's wide corn is a perfect for collecting the residual or so if you've got a glob marble similar bamboo q-tip I hope and keep them now clean to see it's going to preserve the life of that now and it's gonna make your next tap dive taste that much better so that was pretty much thick glass

today with the latest and greatest and wheat content thanks guys you", "yrOdeT_HZQk": "Hey Guys welcome to Rew's Basement\nI'm Rew, This is my Basement Today I haven't Introduced well any-day i haven't introduced\nuh this little recycler right here OK this is actually my first dab rig i had ever got\nOK i picked it up at the Cannarail Station uh i got this little titanium nail with it\nbut i figured i do a little head to head against my first one vs my current favorite one kinda\ntell ya what why i choose this one over this one on a daily basis so first of all this\nrig is 10mm rig uh this rig is 14mm rig notice uh the 10mm rig accessories are quite a bit\nsmaller OK they don't take as much time to heat up they don't take as much heat ok the\n14mm accessories a little bit bigger OK uh this one works for an 18mm as well uh it would\nactually work for some 10mm's doesn't work for for this 10mm OK so i have it on the 14mm\nside uh the reason it doesn't work on this 10 is just cuz of this bar right here so anyways\nthis was my original dab setup ok i had a titanium nail on a double barrel recycler\nok 10 mm double barrel recycler like 5.5\" tall ok they're pretty much the same size\nnot a lot of difference here but i went ahead and upgraded because i just cant get as big\nof hits ya know the heat retention on this nail is just so much more than this nail OK\nnow that's not the only reason ok this guy is complicated I've got alllall alalal haha\nI've got a lot of uh just holes and stuff in here OK its a recycler I've got a lot of\nsurface area that is different uh different places for the reclaim to catch up on OK the\npercolation is a little barrel that is sideways with slits on each side that thing gets gunked\nup uh i gotta clan this thing a whole lot more than i do with this thing OK this things\ngot reclaim catches up on it but its got simple percolation OK 1 diffuser no slit diffusing\nlike this OK it comes out one end one end only and it comes down and just goes out OK\nthat's it I'm not loosing a lot of claim in unnecessary water i have to have the water\nfilled up to here or it doesn't work this one i can run on just a tiny little bit of\nwater and like i said the nail remains hotter longer OK so i pretty much don't even mess\naround with something like this it just doesn't even stay hot long enough OK even these 14mm\nglass nails i don't yaknow i don't mess around with these too much i tend to daily drive\nwith a titanium dome nail i like to leave it on this one because my big rig tends to\nkeep this one on it so anyways I'm gonna put these away just leave them right here alright\ni got everything i need lets go ahead and bust some dabs OK got some of that pie face\nfrom the other day ok we're gunna go ahead and bust some big dabs ok this is a really\nbig dab for a 10mm rig ok 10 mm rigs have a lot of restrictive airflow ok so not a lot\nof smoke can get though there all at once so we're gonna go ahead and see if this can\nhandle this big Ole glob I'm sure it can  that worked just fine uh the nail had started\nto cool down just a little faster than it was able to take that dab I didn\u2019t want\nto take that dab too hot but by the time i had let that dab er nail cool down any bigger\ndab and i would have had poolage i pretty much just busted that sized dab on that cuz\ni knew that was the maximum just from experience that this nail could take COUGH COUGH COUGH\nthat was not small ok now this is not the maximum this one can take but it's a bit bigger\nso we're gonna go ahead and heat this guy up\nbust that out that nail handled that glob no problem i had\nplenty of extra space where i could have put more more dab on that nail just the surface\narea that it had and that heat retention it was able to handle that dab no problem\nCOUGH COUGH COUGH Sierra: It made me cough\nit handled it more than i could alright well so that's the main difference\nhere is that just the surface are on these should be able to handle bigger dabs a lot\nof people are gonna wonder ya know why I'm even making this video obviously it's a no\nbrainer go 14mm know i made the video so i could bust 2 fat ass dabs on camera that's\nwhy i made the video so uh make sure to hit that like button subscribe smoke always share\ncomment down in the fucking that little box down there no body has been doing that lately\ngo ahead and do that uh now get the fuck out of my basement", "8h956-5M9Y4": "what's up what's up guys this is Chucky Fuego coming to you from Los Angeles California and today I'm doing another banger unboxing

"welcome to Granite monkey 101 right now real quick I want to show you how I make a quarter inch in bevel on a piece of granite now I just finished putting a beveled on this entire kitchen it's pretty big I wanted to make this video short I didn't want to put you through going through this entire kitchen because I just want to show you the basics so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna put a quarter bevel right in the front and that on the sides the left is the stove and the right is a panel so it's just the front so the first thing that I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take my pneumatic grinder with a medium cup wheel you do not want to use anything course this stone is actually pretty soft it's in a thinner cecelia family so if you use anything course it's gonna chip out now very gently all you got to do is put your hands somewhat at close to a 45 degree angle you can't you don't have to get it absolutely perfect to a 45 degree angle but as close as possible just work that stone very gently you don't want to really put pressure on it let the weight of the your whatever tool you're using whatever machine you're using let the weight of it do the grinding if you put too much weight on it you make make it too big the important thing is that you are at that 45 degree angle and it's consistent they keep to a good edge it's not just how shiny it is it's consistency if you make it all look exactly the same you're gonna end up with a really nice edge as you can see it's nice and straight now if you've never done this before just scrap scrap pieces and practice over and over and over again remember just be gentle then put too much pressure on it take your time and this is how I make my quarter inch beveled", "FCjuyalOzhE": "hey guys today I'm going to show you how to size your downstem properly to make sure you order the correct size and fitting for your application now in front of us here we have four different down stems and three different slides you'll notice that all of the down stems appear to be different lengths but upon measuring them and again remember we measure from the joint down to the tip you'll see that they are all the same length they are all four and a half inch the only difference between them is the fittings here now starting from the right we have a 14-10 which means it's a 14 millimeter male and it'll take a ten millimeter slide like this right here this size right here is a 18 14 so it'll take a 18 it'll go into an 18 millimeter female and it'll take a 14 millimeter male which is this middle size here this one is a 14 14 so it'll go into a 14 female and it'll take a 14 bolt which is here the last one here is a 18 18 so it'll go into an 18 female and it'll take an 18 bolt shown here now remember we always go by the female fitting first so we go with whichever one that goes into your tube first so if you need a 14 if your tube is a 14 it can take either this them or this stem and then you have to decide which slide you want to accept if your tube is a 18 female it could take this stem and this stem and then your only choices here would be to take either the 18 bowl or the 14 bolt so I hope that guy I hope that helps guys and makes things a lot clearer make sure that you guys get the correct size you need", "ZyRSV-I7pic": "hey how's it going guys welcome to my channel talkers notes where i take totes and you take notes today my friends i'm going to show you guys how to fix a cloudy banger as you can see i torch clean my banger which means that when it starts to get dirty starts to get resiny i use the torch to torch off all the impurities and get my banger clean but what starts to happen is the more you torch your glass the more it'll start to end up looking like that like a foggy uh messy glass that you can't really see nice and clear through so what i'm going to show you guys today is how to fix that now what you're going to need is a couple q-tips some of your favorite oil wax crumble shatter anything like that as long as it's nice clean oil and a terp timer or try to get yourself some sort of temperature control device where you can test temperature with laser okay so with these devices this is how you're gonna get your uh glass to be nice and clear again so what we're gonna do is we're gonna heat up our glass uh [Music] then we're gonna just get some of this stuff out of the way for a second because we need our turp timer in position here we're gonna put our rig and our banger right over the terp timer so what you to do is you want to get this down to about i say under 600. as soon as it starts to get under 600 we'll be able to do a nice dab so while cleaning your banger you'll also be getting a nice rip to help you get through the morning so we got our nice oil right here in our hand we're just waiting for that number to get to where we need it to be let me get my g west banger out too let's get the ball don't know where i put it oh here it is okay so this is a nice little g west banger that we got from g west we'll be using that today and uh we're almost there so i go ahead and uh rotate this out so that i can have it so i can take a hit there you go drop or oil in there and just take a hit like normal like nothing's different here drop your oil in watch that mount put your banger on see that nice and cooking i actually forgot to put a pearl in there so go ahead and clear your banger get all that smoke out of there get yourself a nice strong rip okay that's enough for me so go ahead and remove your banger and then take your q-tips and now you're gonna use that oil to clean the glass and you can see all that fogginess just comes right off use the actual oil that you just dabbed with and i'm trying to do this with one hand it's a real pain in the air all right so just turn this around so you can see what i'm doing as you can see look it's coming out so clean and use your pointed tip to get into those corners pick up the rest of that oil let me clean some of those spots i'm just trying not to knock everything down because i'm doing it with one hand as you can see all that cloudiness is gone it would be a little bit better if i could hold it with two hands but since i'm doing it with one hand that's what that's what we got right now but there you go nice clean glass and again if i did it with two hands it would have came out so much more perfect but all that cloudiness is gone using the exact oil that i dabbed with so i took a nice rip and cleaned my fogginess so there you go my friends the key to this is to get yourself a temperature control device like a turf timer from octave and go ahead and get that temperature down to about under 600 and do your dab which will liquefy your oil very very nicely and allow you to clean your glass while taking a dab peace", "Wap1_Fzb13k": "[Music] hey there buds can you believe it my shirts are made like I have shirts now these are on sale at buds and beards calm /op the smalls through extra-large Azure $25 and the double XL spur $32 plus shipping I came up with the design because I wanted something to signify that I have a lot of people who are following me online and I feel like no matter what I do or where I go I have a huge team like I have stopped using certain platforms and started using other platforms and no matter what I tend to do online it seems like I have this team of people who hop along and follow me everywhere and just support me and I really really can't emphasize how much that means to me as a creator it can be a really lonely experience just creating content all the time and it's really nice to know that I have like this huge network of people who number one like what I do number two support what I do and three are just like always there for me you guys are always a part of my team and so yes I make my shirts to kind of look like team shirts they look like team jerseys they're muscle shirts they're 100% cotton I press them myself of a video later this month showing you guys exactly how I made my t-shirts but yeah I made of myself and here at my house but yeah they turned out really really well each one has a different number on the back and just as buzz and ears across the back but yeah this is the back of each of them none of them will ever have the same number on them so whatever number you get will be your number like no matter how many I make so if I make 300 shirts and we smell 300 shirts somebody will just be number 300 on our team because each one of you guys are different and you guys contribute so much so much - just like my everyday life through the small little things that you do just by like having conversations with me or watching my media or sharing it with your friends or just like the support has really been amazing and so yeah these are the shirts they're available I was just live-streaming and somebody asked me a question that actually would make a really good short how-to video so I thought that I would just sit here and show you guys how to clean a banger because my banger is filthy right now they happen to ask how do you clean a banger and I was like well actually - filthy so let me just do a little how-to video for my friend on periscope the first thing that I do whenever I want to clean a quartz banger is take it out from the socket of your rig and I like to scrape out all of that nice reclaim in the stem some people use the reclaim for dabbing some people use it to make edibles with I tend to actually dab my reclaim if you're smoking quality concentrates then your reclaim tends to be pretty quality as well and so you might as well just dab it again so I always just get a scoop tap tool shove it into the arm of the banger and slide it down and when you slide it down you'll be left with a nice scoop of reclaim and I do this a few times around the arm of the banger just to get all of it out boom see that's a nice little hunk of reclaim and then you can put that in your little reclaim jar I have a little reclaimed silicon DAF container that I just put all my reclaim in so that on a rainy day when I can't afford dabs or I don't have a connection or something you know then I have this reclaim just sitting here on a rainy day everybody meets that rainy day stony supply mind just happens to be reclaim I think so yeah you can put that away and then after you're done scraping out the reclaim the next thing you're gonna want to do is soak this in isopropyl alcohol and get a q-tip so I'll be right back alright so I have my gallon of isopropyl alcohol because I buy it inside the gallon fill up a glass with isopropyl alcohol and just throw your quartz banger in there well don't throw it but you know place it in there you can leave this soaking for like 20 or 30 minutes if you want to or you can just kind of go to town on it with a q-tip I think I'm just gonna go to town on it with the q-tip this is 99% isopropyl alcohol the higher the percentage of isopropyl alcohol the better it's going to work because it's more alcohol than water so don't get 70% try to get 90% a lot of people say it doesn't really make a difference but I know that the 99% really does clean the glass a lot better like whenever I have like stubborn things to clean 99% I say anyways but you guys you can see it's already getting like a little bit cloudy in there and I can already see that reclaim like gliding out of the arm all you really need to do is like use a q-tip heavily dip that in the isopropyl alcohol and then just kind of rub around you could also use a brush a brush would probably be the best thing to use because q-tips can stick a little bit but as long as you're using plenty of isopropyl alcohol all of its gonna fall right out or at least that's what tends to happen whenever I did this brushes can be better too if it's like too hard to clean if there's something that maybe is baked on to your banger and you just cannot get it off sometimes you're using something with like bristles is really really nice I'll show you exactly what i use whenever i have a really hard to get stain yeah this is a bottle brush you can get a set of them on Amazon I will have them linked in the blog posts of this video wow I just hit myself with the fall brush it hurt but yeah you can get like a set of like I think 12 for like definitely less than I think 15 bucks and yeah you just dip that nice purple alcohol and it gives us just a little bit more resistance when you scrub yeah this works way better it takes everything off fairly easy so that if you don't feel like just sitting and waiting for something to so this is a really really easy way another expedite the process all right think I got that arm barely clean all right so now you're going to want to soak this in hot water because you do not want to heat something that is covered in alcohol and I'm gonna heat this up so that's how you clean that let me show you yeah one second all right this finger has been thoroughly rinsed with hot water now what you want to do is put that back onto your rig and you're going to want to heat this until everything is burned off of it basically that's how you can clean a quartz banger the best way if there's anything left over after soaking it overnight or scrubbing it a little bit heat is the absolute best way to clean your banger you don't want to do this too too often because you can heat stress your banger which means that the courts will wear over time and not retain heat therefore not giving you a proper dab or being too cool and then you'll have to refit your dabs so but I recommend replacing your bangers probably every six months that's about when I replaced mine three to six months anyways you just grab your torch [Applause] redhot like it's gonna go right but don't be afraid of and there's no way to really over intercourse banger they're made to withstand high temperatures so go ahead and torch it away to get out all baked on [Music] see how clear that plot is and after the Espada's other side [Music] if you ever get toward trip a lot of pleasure and this shouldn't take that long probably seconds or less I think I've been doing this and it is completely clean it is a little cloudy because this is an older banger but you guys can see it is crystal clear now just let that cool and then you can take a DAB on it I always like to let this cool for like probably 60 seconds to even 90 seconds before dabbing on it if you're gonna take a dab based on the cleaning Heat if that makes sense it really does take a while for it to cool down by heating it up red-hot and getting all of that baked on concentrate off of it you really have to heat it to a really high temperature and it takes quite a bit of time for that to cool down anyways let's take a DAB I have some Northern Lights sauce we'll take a nice hefty dab sauce Northern Lights is my favorite strain and this has been the absolute best concentrates I've gotten since being in California very flavorful very smooth but yeah this is exactly how you clean your board Stanger wow this is still really hot like I can feel the heat on my chin from right here I'm just gonna let this cool for another 30 seconds and then I'll be right back all right I think it's cooled down enough hopefully this won't be too hot nice hefty dab of sauce Cheers [Music] oh my gosh the temperature was absolutely perfect [Music] [Music] mm oof I love a perfectly timed app where it pulls up nice and well now you just take your q-tip this is how you keep it clean take a q-tip while it's still hot or not like super hot while it's still warm and just soak it soak all that up and then just take that q-tip other end rub it all around that banger and there you have it your banger is still clean up here to have and as long as you q-tip your banger after every use your banger really won't get that dirty I just tend to either forget or yeah I just basically tend to forget or get lazy but yeah having like a q-tip holder something like this I got this on Amazon for like under $10 it's really nice I keep it on my desk right where I dab so that I always can at least have a q-tip at hand that doesn't mean I'll remember to use it but I'm getting better about it anyway so that's how you clean a quart stinger if you liked this video give it a thumbs up subscribe sign up for my

we are here we are back in the dad dungeon and today we're bringing you a tutorial video once again on this channel today we're gonna bring you a tutorial on how to take a perfect gap and mind you starting right now let you know right now every dab nail every banger is different all right everything is different everything that has its own life I guess you could say technique or you know how we Mexicans like to say guy that goes at the innocent mind you you know what I'm saying and each thing got its own like you know its own method you don't to sit there you go you got its own method some nails you know you have to torch them more than others so we torture less I'm you wait more for them to cool down tell me wait less it's it all berries bro it just all berries on what you got you know and in my tutorial I'm gonna show you guys how to take a perfect nail or get ya how to pick a perfect nail [ __ ] y'all tryin to get nailed figure that out on your own but I'm about to show y'all how to take the perfect dab from my nail and there you guys can kind of you guys can just see the type of technique that I use and anybody can apply the same like method to their nails just different times you know like I'm pretty sure you guys know how your how your nail works like by having it for so long that I'm pretty sure you know you [ __ ] you know I'm pretty sure you know her and you know how long you need to like let her cool down or you know or how long you need to torch it for because some people have methods that others don't use for example I will torch my nail for 40 seconds always time it type it for I'll do it for 40 seconds and then I will wait another 50 to a minute in 15 seconds I like it just a wee bit more so I will take it at about 50 seconds usually and the way you know you took a perfect dab is okay people might be thinking there's still some blanks left over no no you ain't a dabber [ __ ] out my channel you don't know what the [ __ ] going on if you're thinking like that then you're a child get out get out you're not 18 get out the way you take perfect dive is when you take a dive there is supposed to be a little bit of that wax left not a shitload just a little bit and the reason for that is you need that little bit so when you have whatever you use use a towel cotton swab whatever you're using that wax is left over in there so you can use that whatever you're using to clean your banger with and once you wipe it off your nail is perfectly clear and it's like Brad [ __ ] knew because the thing is if you just torch that [ __ ] or if you don't decide to clean it and you just [ __ ] start eating it up again it's gonna turn black and then you're gonna stain that [ __ ] and then what's gonna happen is it's gonna get all chalky and you're just gonna waste the quartz off of your nail and then it's not even gonna be a quartz banger no more like you just wasted the quartz when you have it all chalky and [ __ ] trust me I would know like when you're young you go through that kind of [ __ ] I've gone through hell in heels Pro but like I said I've had it I'm not even gonna lie to you guys I got a cheat nail that I've had for months and it's working fantastic bro so I've had it for months and it's still clean like barely and there's no chalk on the brush so I'm just saying like everyone has their own method so enough talk let's show you what I'm talking about I'm going to show you how to take the perfect dab I'm going to show you guys a tutorial and y'all can choose whether to follow that or not you know what I'm saying everybody to their own to their own [ __ ] you know everybody's got their own opinion and if you don't [ __ ] with it then you don't gonna do it but I'm just giving you you know my take on it so without further ado it's [ __ ] early in the morning I'm ready for my first dab let's get this [ __ ] poppin this is how we put the nail is hydia all right I don't like you I circle it around can't just be a one certain area and like I said 42nd 10 for me 40 seconds fortunate all the way around [Applause] all right we got the 40 seconds ready and now just a chill 40 seconds on the clock starting now and what we were about a dab are some [ __ ] loud Cali gold eight plus diamonds cocoa puffs that's right cocoa puffs hey it is the morning you know what I'm saying I gotta have my breakfast all right and before I started the recording of this video it's already been about 10 seconds so it's been about all right guys Cheers [Music] so there's still some in there [Music] as you can see still kind of eating cooked but it's not hurt in there it's not like staining so immediately uh excuse me I'm dead immediately after I usually tend to cleaning the suit alleging undeath so I do not have any cons web so I'm just gonna I personally do it like this because I can get more putting in my pick you know the pigs have like that they're sharp and veggies so like you can get look at that beautiful okay

"cvkQxkqJblQ": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "qxaXiVuSfYw": "what's going on guys it's your boy the Loki legend how y'all doing today I'm doing all right and we are back [ __ ] we are back with a brand new episode of stoner tips boys y'all thought this series was over hell nah just took a small little break on it but I realized a lot of the tips that a lot of the videos I upload in general on my channel are stoner tips but to have it specifically zoned down to a subject of a series where I can specifically just talk about that feel like is always helpful on my channel so I'm gonna be talking to you guys about dabbing out of quarts bangers versus titanium nails so you guys are new to dabbing there are many different methods of dabbing when you have a rig the first thing I guess there would be is just a regular nail they give you the the glass nail that comes with most standard rigs my personal opinion I'm not even going to talk about that because I don't ever I never really had to be able to hit off of one of those as soon as I learned that there were other methods of dabbing I was instantly on it I wanted to definitely get the most flavor when I had my kit I want it to be set so I had a titanium nail that was the first thing I ever dabbed off of when I got my rig bought my rig and of course it came with the standard glass nail but I just replaced it with the titanium nail so I was dabbing straight off of titanium right off the start which is pretty good in my opinion because I never really had to go to that cycle of using a glass nail because I heard that they are very annoying and it's in your best interest always to never use a glass nail if you can have other methods of dabbing like a banger or you know titanium nail those are preferred you get the most out of your dab that way I feel like I felt like when I did hit it out of the glass nail once or twice it just wasn't it wasn't as flavorful as it could be you feel me it definitely got me high but it just didn't get me as high with the amount of wax that I wanted and out of a titanium nail when I first did start dabbing I thought that that was the best instrument the best little [ __ ] you know piece that you could ever the best nail to have on a dab set up because the perks about it is I mean the downside of it is it takes a long time to heat up so you guys sit there for you know 30 plus seconds heating this thing up and as soon as you're done heating it up you got about a 5 second cooldown time you feel me so you got a pretty much hit that [ __ ] right away you gotta have you know your dad ready and that's just how I feel with my titanium nail if you wanna because I personally out of titanium nails I like high temp dabs I don't ever like to use low temp on nails but on buckets you know like if I had a quartz banger then you know you get a little more interesting with it you could use the bank the carb cap on it which is why I personally love that if I'm trying to get high I will I will use a titanium nail that can range for they can be pricey but if you talk to dude down this dude had a fifty dollar titanium nail he was trying to sell me at the store and I was like bro I can get it online right now for twenty dollars he was like I'll give you two for twenty five I was like that so copped me one of those and now I'm dabbing off of that again but I was dabbing off of a quartz banger for a minute and let me tell you guys about quartz bangers those are very very useful to dab if you're trying to get flavor if you want the flavor of your wax you want to just you know actually taste that [ __ ] and enjoy yourself getting high definitely prefer quartz bangers there's a lot of different methods of even using a quartz of banger a lot of different times and a lot of different bangers which is really cool you can get thermal ones that's what I have right now it takes a little bit longer to heat up but it's a lot lot longer to cool down which is really nice I also have to invest in a different banger real soon but definitely the better quality banger the more flavorful your wax is gonna be the more the more slow it's gonna burn now bangers can range from five I've seen bangers go for $100 sometimes depending you know depending on the brand and it's just all in the cooldown time you will you guys might look at it and be like dude this [ __ ] piece is a hundred dollars like now [ __ ] that I'm gonna get a $15.00 one well if you were to get that hundred dollar one you definitely will notice a difference with the carb cap the way the airflow every little perk about bangers and the cool downs with the cool down and and heat up times it's all they're all different for each banger which is very unique and you could set it more to your preferences which is why I like bangers I don't know that's just my personal take on it though bangers are the way to go if you are just trying to get that flavor if you're trying to you know learn heat up cool down times it will take a long time to learn how to dab off a quartz banger especially with the heat up and cool down times like I said compared to other things where 99% of the time you're just taking a high temp dab anyway and you kind of just don't know heat it up for a certain amount of time and then once it's at a perfect temperature then you take that Deb and I swear to god it's nothing like taking a quartz [ __ ] dab like that with the carb cap and everything you get the full experience it's [ __ ] dope let me know what you guys think though dabbing off a quartz versus titanium personally you know if I'm trying to get high conserve weed I'll use it nail titanium nail but that if I have you know if I bought a lot and I'm just chilling I want to taking you know

I'm gonna make a video on how to season it this is my favorite thing to do but it's definitely necessary whenever you have a new banger or you eat clean your banger at least for doing cold starts you want to make sure that you season the banger before you use it so what you want to do is this is the only time I'll heat up a banger before I put the concentrate in it [Music] have to be crazy huh you just wanna hot enough to melt the concentrate then take your q-tip and rub it all over the bag or just like that that's how you see looks the reason you want to do this for cold starts is because if you don't for some reason the quartz when it's super clean like that the concentrate has is way more likely to burn to the sides and get all gross so just something you want to do it's pretty easy step so that's because you have to waste a tiny bit of concentrate but it's well worth it all right guys", "Xfa4uWvuNYg": "[ __ ] what's going on beautiful people 1570 at 7:10 here back in front of

this thing's about four months old that I've been smoking out of it pretty much daily for the past four months a lot of people out the question how do you keep your bangers that clean I'll tell you guys it's super [ __ ] simple all you need is this [ __ ] dirt crystal clear just think so it really doesn't matter which one you use the dark crystal clear isn't much more effective but even if you use the ISO and you're really good about cleaning all the [ __ ] out of your banger after you're done using it it's gonna last a lot longer so basically the main two techniques here are take a damp q-tip the oil out after you're done as long as it was low temp enough then dump a little iso or dump a little dark crystal clear in and then q-tip that out or have a little dish somewhere sitting there filled up with ice over dark crystal clear dip your q-tip in the dish then you got ISO on it boom if you tip it out it's all done really fast and simple that it's all gonna change for all of you guys today let's dig dab and I'll show you the method that I'm talking about right now and then we will go into the method or the product that makes this so much more simple so obviously with this product I just look at it I'm like really doesn't really need this and then I used it and I was like oh [ __ ] yeah we need this one billion jillion kazillion percent got a nice diamond dab of dick sauce over here so for our first damage you tip it out normally how I would and then we're gonna bust out this new product sure you guys saw called the clean pump and you guys tell me what you think I think it's pretty [ __ ] snazzy little design here let's [ __ ] get it guys cheers going in on the combo give it the old daisy dukes so now if we take beat guys there's a bunch of leftover oil in there that we need to get rid of so the way most people do this is you just have q-tips laying around you q-tip the oil out that's step one simplest easiest procedure so what you doing this finger does look fairly clean you can't really see that massive puddle of oil anymore I'll show you the q-tip that we just used it's nice and too tippy yellow on both sides it obviously pulled some oil out let's grab another fresh q-tip and what I'm gonna do now is take this little mini jar of dark crystal clear it's a little squirt model I'm just gonna squirt us in a couple little puffs Fatima foams up bubbles all around the banger getting all of it all covered now let's try cute simply medicated and the banger looked fairly clean what [Music] look at how much [ __ ] that pulled out guys there that mean there is black [ __ ] there's brown [ __ ] there's so much [ __ ] that was left over in that banger now we are left with a quite clean looking banger I mean it's definitely see through you could see the chasm that's happened over the past 3-4 months what it's a lot cleaner than it was after we just did the first pass with YouTube so there's your second step that really really helps keep them prolong the life of your band I thought I was looking for now I'm gonna show you guys the Queen pump which really just makes all this so much easier and a lot of people are you sit there like wow I don't need that I could just get this at a bottle that's fine but so the people about heady glass just want to pull down and set up a station to dab in front of you need one of these this right here is cold bleep up all it is is a little glass container down here a little press top thing on there and as you guys can imagine all you need to do with this let's take my self or your dark crystal clear which we need to have a little asterisk next to go over in a second here put your ISO in there and now all you have to do is just pop a q-tip out there's a couple times there we go boom now I have a q-tip totally soaked and I so the second I'm done dabbing swirl it around flip it over to use the dry and swirl it around bangers clean it might only knock like [ __ ] 30 seconds or a minute off the cleaning process but I'm telling you guys right now you [ __ ] need one this literally I think we've ordered a bulk mass [ __ ] order of them for the Pacific Circle just because of how nice they are people just look at they're like oh I know what that does and I'm assuming there's [ __ ] ISO in there all you have to do is label it this is iso or dark crystal clear I do really quite want to go over this I put dark crystal clear in mind there is a little bit of a problem with their version ones and they working on a new one that is specifically made for dark crystal clear I have noticed zero negative effects from this whatsoever but over time those are crystal clear roads away the metal in here or something in there and it turns the dark crystal clear a bluish color I have noticed no difference in cleaning properties I think it does the exact same thing I have literally there's nothing different about it except for the fact that it's blue so if you're okay with that order one it's blue [ __ ] dark crystal clear honestly looks kind of cool it looks like a barber side type of thing and there's no there's no difference in cleaning properties though if you order a regular one you're a sub type of person if you work fine it's just as you can see it just holds your eye so right in there we're gonna take another dab and go over the cleaning process again with how simple that is don't you tear up these things cost twenty bucks and it's a good way to spend twenty bucks like I love out my buddy Fremont he always said twenty bucks is a fun together anything good should be worth at least one punching this is one fun to get a long-term the thing that's gonna last you I mean it's not gonna break anytime soon some metal components on glass dish it's gonna last you a while and it's something that you need if you doubt it but you need it going back a little bit into the keeping your bangers cleaning part I really just want to reiterate to us only it need is q-tips you don't need all this extra stuff you don't need it I so the DC cleaner you don't need the [ __ ] clean pump you just need q-tips take your dabs at a low enough temperature where the oils still left over there but you still get enough vapor in your lungs that you're happy you're satisfied and then q-tip all that leftover oil out that's what's gonna keep your banger clean the part that makes it dirty is when there's leftover oil and you torch it again and all that burns on to the banger that's what we call [ __ ] as effective Chaz's the banger over all right let's see you lastly they have a dick sauce here bada-bing bada-boom all right got our q-tips got our clean pump got our combo [ __ ] you get this guy's I almost just leaned forward to put my [ __ ] mouth around the banger I was I was trying to tip it out I was like here we go I'm high cool cheers guys appreciate you all showing up to watch this little review here love each and every one of you [Music] doesn't app a lot better on that one still we have our leftover puddle of oil in there that we need to take care of bottle bottle bottle bow tie and you wink you dip one pump scrape all the iso out I'm gonna use the dry end first get all the loose a little out flip it over to the eye so we in and boom you've got one crystal clear banger look at that look at how [ __ ] nice that is guys I can't tell you how much I recommend grabbing one of these clean pumps if you're into like like I said before having a dab station your rig your dabbers over here your stuff this is just a great [ __ ] addition plus it does help it is a good [ __ ] thing to have you never have to think about where's this little ball where's this little bottle do I need to [ __ ] get more ice oh no you just look over there oh it's go full still gonna work clean phone I love it go give them a follow on Instagram check out their internet site I'll leave a link down below preciate nope breezy I need to know every one of you

"crFAV0M585s": "all right so what's going on guys when I end up happening is it's kind of like fate I guess you could say in my last what was made what has major burns been doing video I don't know if you saw I cut my hand and when I ended up happening is that my other rig was down here and I heard that you dabbers know what I'm talking about eventually after you know a while of Davin you get a bunch of melted oil that comes down here I guess you could say it's called reclaim or whatever but it got stuck on there and as I was trying to pull it off it broke on me and completely sliced my hand open and this was this is last week on Monday and I've it's healed up by now but it stabbed me probably about a 3/4 of an inch glass went inside my hand right here and hurt like a [ __ ] I bled all over the place for a couple days but anyways so yeah we got this really amazing honeycomb wax that I made mmm real white and blind but we're gonna um we're gonna blaze this out my buddy came over and hooked me up with a new piece and I don't les corts he's like alright uh next one here you go okay so I'm like thanks man man it really rips nice and gives you a good good smooth hit so let's get it on I'm also gonna take you downstairs and let you see the garden a little bit just see what the plants are doing um I threw a whole [ __ ] ton in flowering so should be good but all right let's get this dab on ah yeah dad dad dad what you gonna dab you guys are dabbing telling what your dad and I you're smokin tell me what you're smoking right I want to know where are you from how much your stashes cheerleaders become what you guys paying for an eighth out east or dress up fire for an ounce I was out there's probably like 400 ounces fire fire all right let's get this damn on here man I'd say you can really feel the heat off that quartz some fierce see if we can't get a little dab don't know if we can go there I don't know the way but maybe you can show me yeah all right Oh mmm so good that's the hmm that's the good stuff right there all right so I'll take you downstairs in a minute I'm going to upload this video and then we'll get at it peace", "0Up6UZkCvmY": "all right Park my dude in the end get some rest let's take a DAB oh I haven't season this now yet all right so let's season it what's up everybody King pong here today I'm showing you how to properly season the nail before whenever you first buy it now before you can use it you should always season it you don't just take it straight home brand new and put it on the rig and start hitting it mainly because you don't know where this thing's been or what it's been through or what they did to it when they created it and also because you want to get anything that's gotten on it off of it system and just get it taste and write so whenever you take your dab it tastes right anyways let's get started with seasoning our now so first thing you're gonna do is get your torch you're gonna need that second thing you're gonna do is get your rig cuz you're gonna need that third thing you're gonna want to do you're gonna want to get to some type of source of water your sink will work fine so the first thing you're gonna want to do is you're going to want to get your torch and this is super easy you're gonna wanna white it and heat it after you've heated it for a few seconds because you cannot tell whether it's hot or not would you basically give you you're gonna get water in it you let it boil that out [Music] like to fill mine up [Music] [Music] again you're gonna do this you know two three times you see what I'm doing what I'm kind of doing is I'm just heating up the quartz with water in it and that's kind of boiling anything out that we don't want lots of different ways to season here now this is my particular way [Music] [Music] [Music] that's pretty much how you season the know [Music] after that your nail is good to go that is actually how you see the a quartz banger so let's go back over here and take a DAB grab my little swab get some of that a little bit of leftover water out now let's take a dab of some of this Gorilla Glue for enough to get a dad out of [Music] and you set my timer let me heat this quartz back up and then we'll set the timer [Music]", "mZZnkOvcwnE": "yo what is up guys nothing like poker back here again welcome to another video man in today's video we're going to try out an experiment man a STONER experiment something new something different I just wanted to record this to see how you guys liked it going upload it let me know what you guys think down in the comment section below after the video so in today's video ma'am we're going to test out this whoo dollar banger that I bought off of wish and we're gonna put it to the test we're going to see if we can bust out a nice hot glob of the dab so we're going to see if it can handle a record dab compared to a regular banger if you are a new dab you're watching this video don't do what I'm doing do not buy China bangers trying to bankers or [ __ ] in the next couple of weeks I'm going to have the video out China bangers versus American bangers something like along those lines but this is how a normal banger should look if we put these side-by-side you can tell this finger right here which I got from the hen per box last week is three times the size compared to the China one the China bigger is super [ __ ] thin and I honestly think it might crack after you're just dab or the [ __ ] bucket might fall off or something so all right enough talking man let's just bust up this big ol [ __ ] fat-ass dab and I'll talk to you guys after you're busting out the dad so I'm going to set up to do a close up a function shot for you guys for for this challenge to see hey if this $2.00 banger can handle a hot nice glop of the death so be right back I did not weigh out that's death by the way I think it's a little um near the half gram side side probably like 0.42 0.45 I would say so I'm going to be right back going set up everything to do a close-up and then won't take this nice hot stab and I'm going tell you guys what I think about it afterwards so what's get into it yeah [Music] all right guys let's go in Cheers what's get lady [Music] oh [ __ ] me [Music] Oh what [Music] Oh [Music] holy [ __ ] no I have the absolute oh I'm going to everything back up real quick he tell you guys what I think about the beggar so just be right back so guys huh to be honest I kind of feel like I wasted a little bit of wax with this Chinese or with the China banger because it's usually with a big dad like that the wax will sit on the bottom and and you know the once you put the car cap on it it'll start spinning and I kind of noticed when I put the car cap on it everything what flowing down the tube I just realized the close-up video that I took and that's how I kind of looked like to me if you guys do not know I can only see out of one eye I'm visually impaired so I could be kind of wrong but that's kind of my first take reaction with it like to be honest like it hit pretty good I'm really [ __ ] big right now like to be honest like I do have the dab so it's like well like it did hit me but I feel like if I used a regular banger I would have bought in the regular banger you know what I mean it I probably would have had a little bit of a better experience TBH but overall man would I buy a $2.00 banger off of wish again the answer is no okay so hopefully you guys like this different kind of style of video I'm probably going to call it the stepping stone hair experiment experiment series where we just buy a random [ __ ] or try out random [ __ ] and just start up a whole different series on the channel I guess but but but yeah guys if you did enjoy

Leona's [ __ ] this one try to check out a few sample joys yeah I would agree when you studies that mean you know these doing sugar up it's their farm and also on the top talk about an unusual question a lot of courts should always put a life of you brush the olive oil in there but it needs to be dipped in rubbing alcohol you know they can look like that Ashley and because you have to smoke because if you consume oil no that's that hot then that means you're smoking up everything that you don't want to smoke it should be heated at a proper temperature so you're able to mop up the

Eddie barber let's go born at the side of the head I got my father's ear on all the time my kin away from the head I'm using straight-up awesome fed and I'm going to try to start making that shape of the flattop of them work my way around on this other side I seen your smartphone's up to time dad I'm going to be getting the middle every flattop I always begin and then just touch yourself a guideline move back that would have to be perfect because in that straight it doesn't even have to be even at this one so you just have to get some semblance of what's going on and you're going to use your eyes to see what's going on here so I'm just going to go see it's a little bit crooked on that left side now I'm going to go back through and I'm just going to clean that up little by little I'm going to shape this thing in the same way that you might trim a tree or a bush or whatever you must kind of the way I look at it so just little by little don't take too much at one time keep looking at what you're doing and you're going to use these techniques so what you not notice in probably if you watch them is the pinky on my left hand where I have the poem I'm possibly bracing my pinky off to the side of the head this helps me to maintain my leg so that people read that I'll put you right on point with my life I don't have to move too much it enters me it keeps me steady and you're going to actually see that I use my pinky a lot and I always use some kind of anchor this helps me with consistently this helps me with consistency this helps me maintain the ability to duplicate great haircuts over and over again regardless of what day it is so you're just going to see me lifting the half against the grain in different ways everybody's hair is different it's always going to lay different so this is some freehand clipper cutting you can use that if you see something you can zip it off you want to just be really careful move really slow and angle their head around get down on the eye level with it look at it real close make sure that you're not missing anything um you're going to see that as you start to go the color starts to look more and more quaint a lot of people start by putting a little bit of product in the hair just to get it to stand up that's a foreign technique I used to you know I like to ask the clients if they do wear product on a day to day that will give you a better idea chances are if they don't let products it probably want to cut it a little bit shorter so it naturally stands straight up so you see me getting down on an eye level just really looking for anything it doesn't look even its technical not pretty nice now I got this one little spot about Union but really it started to dial in and shape up in the way that I wanted and I'm going to scale it entirely down I'm not going to spend too much time on the fade as I said I'm trying to departmentalized this learning I wanted to just put focus on my free hand clipper cutting on the top and click over comb on the top to make that nice black shape so if you have a mannequin or anybody to practice on if that's the type of stuff that I want you to really be complicated on the fade is another thing we can get into and plenty of my other videos I can show you how to clean that up but on a flat top it's usually pretty easy I'm just going to spin the sides with a bicycle flats by electric shaver andis families and I'm going to clean it up with the env a little bit I got the paper opening close and I'm just looking for any shadows and I'm just going to clean them up a little bit I'm not really looking to dig into my work I don't want to take away from the flattop I just want to make the favorite as clean as I can and I'm going to retrace my steps combing it out every which way making sure that no matter how this client combs his hair get that hair it's not going to be on uneven no matter how he shan't pulls it or whatever so I'm really Farrell with pulling through it a bunch of different ways just making sure that I'm not missing anything the end clean these are great for some some freehand clipper cutting they're very light they felt really smoother than using my laughter that's a little bit heavier so I actually felt like I had a little bit more control when I use the MDS and as you can see his flattop coming out pretty good this one is a little bit different this is the flat top for this guy this line he asked for it to be rounded around the edges so what that kind of means is the top is going to be flat but the sides are going to be handled so much you would handle a regular fade so I'm just going to go around the same thing kind of coming off the top of that going up straight keeping that flat shape and you're going to see the difference that's going to come in when I use the cone so let's just get this thing into the rough shape of what we're looking for and anybody can do this I'm not doing anything special I'm just holding it flat moving it up the side of the head getting rid of all the ball and at the same time I'm accomplishing a small portion of the fade which is not going to be perfect like I said we just want to get the rough shape now so now I'm just going to wait a full on a little fold flat on the side of the head I'm going to be careful not to dig too deep into it just one of my little taking a little bit off notice that as soon as I start to cut I start to move this means I expect to cut with the clipper over comb process I start to move I'm not going to get too in-depth with the clipper over comb in this video I have a whole other video dedicated to just that where departmentalized in orange so I'm just trying to show you how to cut some basic shape again starting in the middle moving my way back creating a guideline much like that what if I was cutting the top with food and I'm just going to continue looking at it and watching it and seeing what effect each stroke as and making sure that I'm even in the full top lock a lot of guys like the worry about these haircuts to watch a lot of people don't do I don't any other standard I mean I think that they're actually really easy if you actually looked at the amount of time it takes me to do a flat top even with a skinned face if you compare that to just a normal fade with an edge and a kid and all that and it just takes maybe I would say 1/4 so it's a great thing to know he's just going to have to continue picking it up against the grain and shaping it in use it's a freehand clipper technique and you're going to see that if it's not going to be that difficult you're going to be able to get it and don't get discouraged maybe some point throughout the kite they're going to struggle you might have some some trouble getting certain areas I mean that's fine that's all part of the process and we just got to keep looking for those imperfections and perfecting them a little by little I don't know if I showed it in this one but I did put a little bit of I did put a little bit of product in his hair to help it stand up a little bit so that I could really have a little bit more control and again just like the other one I went in with the NV and I'm straightening it up a little bit just clean up the fade like I said we're really going to get into fading and stuff in some of the other videos I got a lot coming to you but I'm just knocking out any little shadows because these are a little bit different than your typical fade because if you go ahead and chase every shadow you're going to start to destroy the shape of the flat top that you put in so with respect to how clean you can make it look you want to look as perfect as possible but don't destroy the work that you already get we're going to get into some shaving we're going to get into some different techniques I got a lot of videos coming down the line I have a lot of different techniques that I want to show you and this is one of them one is the scissors and I know it's kind of hard to see I don't really have a great angle on it if you're going to use the inside of the scissors the closest part to your hand to cut you do not want to do much cutting with the tip of this visit because it's really easy to drop it too into the air and it cut a good gouge and you don't want to do that so just the beauty inside of this is a small little moves in any little hairs that you see sticking up you can really go right out with that technique and you start to see if this laptops are looking pretty good there was a few little hairs that were bothering me there and the beginning weren't there but I started to get them under control and really happy the way these please to five tops turned out I want you to get American I want you to give this a try stay tuned thanks for watching and I will see you in my next video real soon [Music]", "oiUMvR06xFU": "but beware of being a to that man use more only if you dare but watching oh I got love yeah what's up guys we are here today to give you a demonstration on how we season the daisies domeless course snail bites e to Custom Creations available at dab farm comm you can find us on instagram @ dab farm we're going to just give you a quick demo here because there have been a few different techniques touted but really the best thing to do when seasoning your course is the as follows we're going to go ahead and heat this up for quite a bit of time just to make sure that everything's copacetic in some ways I would call this sterilizing now the most important thing you want to realize with courts is when you are heating it up when it's brand new especially you will not really be able to tell that there's any redness or really you won't get the the visible signs of it getting hot so a you have to be very careful not to touch it and be you have to know that you're making it this hot because you don't want to flash your oil or what I call just you know flashing it is basically you put it on it's too hot and it just flashes into a smoke it doesn't turn to vapor it just burns you don't want that it's bad for you to smoke it killed the THC and it also makes your cords dirty so you're seeing that we're heating this up for a really long time this is obviously very high quality German ports we don't settle for any second rate stuff it's also very thick nice ports you can't really get better quality than this on the market we fully heated it even when I do a DAB after the nail has been seasoned we would wait a pretty long time about 10 seconds a full 10 seconds after but of course when you season they're going to be a couple of dabs originally that you do that won't necessarily taste as good as the other so you want to keep these a little smaller you want to make sure that you don't dab them at too high of a temperature to burn the oil they will puddle and that's normal and you want to just spread it around so the bowl is cooled a little bit more and let me show you this is clear concentrate normally we would use shatter but we are out of that today there you have it we have done a full dab first one on this nail as you see I haven't burned anything obviously if left no residue but this is extremely clear concentrate and we didn't burn it that's the main thing you want to know again that you heat the nail for a very long time and you let it cool for a very long time you do not want to immediately place the concentrate onto the nail that is the most important thing what you've seen done now is something you could do one or two more times I would say a total of three or four times with fully seasoned your nail after that point you are ready to go do big dabs do small dabs little warmer temperature a little cooler temperature carb cap no carb cap but for the first few times you want to do just what you saw there use whatever concentrate you have hopefully it's clean happy dabbing kids remember the Daisy quartz domeless nail is available at dab

got coming up here in the future on our Channel and also when he figures out what he wants to do on his you know what we did are gonna do on his channel but for right now I'm gonna heat up this nail and he can tell you a little bit about the videos that he makes go ahead John yeah so uh like I said um my channel right now is Colorado basically just kind of documents I guess like daily routine work in the garden how I mix nutrients had some stuff on there I made like songs and motion also as part of colossal concentrates there's gonna be some videos of me making rosin and you know showing people my steps and processes of doing that oh yeah so okay not only are we be talking about future things that you guys should be excited for we're also gonna be talking about the sugar cube banger from mad Rob and yeah I got this I got this heated up you wait about a minute to a minute and do a minute and 20 seconds on cooldown so basically I'm just sitting here talking waiting to that cooldown happen sugar cube bangers I mean like any other banger at this point there or at any other well made banger at this point they're great by they're nice and sticks that's a positive the heat retention a lot longer than a 2cb I go at about 50 seconds for its UCB being run at 50 on this you'd be going way too hot you can get it they also started coming out with thermals you can get it with like a 2cv or where they got the talks to it like angled or you can get flattop like I got you can get a couple of different things I'm about to go in on this day of doing that widget John already primo nail huh around the same price as a terrible P or a club club banger basically yeah I believe they retail around $180 basically if you are looking to buy a nice nail by a wall man company you're gonna be spending at least over $100 some people you know might say that they don't like that there's nails that are over $100 some people may not agree with why you know some people might say well my 20 dollar nail hits better my but I love that well okay that's your opinion in my opinion it's if I'm gonna be spending a nice amount of money on blast then why put it on a banger that may not be huh I mean may may or may not last you join the piece does I mean if you take care of your bands of course they're going to last a while but this you did consistency quality and yes you are paying for a name I'm not denying that all right so we got this rig heated up for John here there you go right oh he's gonna tell you once again check out here I got that for him check out Colorado compassionate

drop in banger bucket here and as you seen this is my octopus rig my wife got me this thing honey just set the camera down [Music] now with these they're a lot of fun I like to heat it up good drop in my bucket she's right here drop that inside there you see a good little chunk in there you drop it in just see how many hit you can get now I noticed that you can usually get pretty good sized chunk about 10 hits or so it's kind of crazy it's a lot of heads to be taken for one person so I mean you don't have to go wild with how much you put in there you want to heat it up for about 30 seconds or so and then I usually give it a cool-down period about five or ten seconds after then drop it in and it's a little slow acting at first it takes a second start melting and then it'll start smoking and act that let the fun begin so I'm gonna start heating it right now like I said about 30 seconds all right now get a little bit of the cooldown period don't forget to grab your carb drop it in let it start melting I got some GMO diamond sauce here straight out of Michigan it's bubbling Chris hits usually pretty weak after that it gets pretty good it's three his third one's better than the last one there's four don't be afraid to play around your car while you're in there your size six looking a little weak I think there's still some give it a little reheat for about five to six seconds I lost count I think that was about nine maybe a pull oh yeah there you have it that's how you use a drop in mayor bucket let me know what you think", "DFsiMUnnk1I": "I don't mess you that I'm wearing embarrassing everyone I don't care hey everybody turd smokes back was gonna add today we're going to be doing a nails tutorial we're gonna be talking about the difference between titanium ceramic and quartz nails and the pros and cons of each at the very end we're gonna make our judgment on which one is the best nail to use for dabbing alright so let's start off with the titanium now so one of the big pros of a titanium nail obviously is its durability you can do whatever you want to this thing talk check it across the room stomp on it run it over with your car whatever you're not gonna be able to do damage to this thing and that's one of the big big big pros of having a titanium nail is when you buy it I mean as long as you take good care of it you can have this thing for a hell of a long time the next pro is the heat time on this thing this thing heats up and about anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds this is the second fastest nail to eat up right behind quartz um that's really really nice if you're trying to conserve butane or you just don't like waiting for your dab and heat retention is also a huge huge blush because it is metal it does hold heat really really well second best out of any of the nails we have the only thing that really beats it out is ceramic but we'll get there and that's pretty much it for the pros let's go ahead and move into the cons now so one of the big cons of using a titanium nail is the fact that you have to season it for those of you who don't know what seasoning is basically what you have to do is you have to take a torch and blast all around in this area because as you can see there's a shiny outer coating and when it gets really hot that encoding starts to come off and you don't really want to be inhaling those vapors so what you're gonna do is you're gonna hit this blast it with the torch for like fifteen to thirty seconds get it red red hot and then dip it in the cold water and roll it around in there and basically what that's gonna do is that's gonna make sure that all of the extra like gunk and [ __ ] that's all on this nail gets wiped right off and then at that point your nails seasoned and you're good to take your first stab moving on to the second con the taste a lot of people really really don't like the taste of a titanium nail after a while you do can tend to get like a metallic e taste on it and also this is a good thing to note if you don't take proper care of your nail you leave it wet you leave dab on and all that stuff over time it can start to oxidize and at that point you're probably gonna want to look into getting a new nail next up is gonna be ceramic ceramic is a really really great option um it's really good for heat retention when you heat these guys up I mean they can stay hot for a very long time I'm talking over a minute of still like dabble temperatures on one of these nails that's incredible on top of that you also don't have to season this nail unlike the metallic titanium one that you have to season um this is made out of food grade materials so you're good to just plop it right in your rig heat it up and take a dab out of it once you get it but a lot of people really like about ceramic compared to titanium is the taste you get a lot better taste out of this and you would on a titanium now and I mean durability wise you can run into some issues with this though and that's gonna actually roll us right into our cons durability is a huge issue with this over time there can be heat stress and heat fractures on the ceramic because you are gonna have to blast it for a really long time to heat it up that and also if you drop it hit it on something too hard ceramic does brick and you'll be real sad if you break it and the final con for the ceramic nail is the heat time it takes a very very long time to heat these guys up and in that process you're gonna be using a lot of butane so I would recommend that you either have like a multi flame torch or just a big supply of butane if you don't really care about that but aside from that it's still really solid now and a really good choice and finally we have quartz now of course is really good for a lot of reasons um one of the biggest ones is the heat time it only takes about five seconds to heat this thing up from like super cold so like [ __ ] red-hot which is really nice compared to you know the titanium time especially the ceramic time so you can definitely keep this up a lot faster and the tastes on these are phenomenal absolutely phenomenal if you're looking for something that you're looking to chase turps or you're looking to get like really good flavors out of your dab this is the way that you want to go you want to take this heat it up let it cool down a little bit drop the concentrate in there cap it off with a carb cap and you're ready to go on top of that finally the base one of the best pros for me at least is the price tag on something like this compared to the ceramic and the titanium nails you can get one of these for like $8.99 and my shop compared to like 20 bucks for a ceramic now and 20 bucks up depending on the titanium nail um so this is definitely a more economic choice I really like it for the taste and I really like it for the heat time but moving into the cons now we've got heat retention does not hold heat for very long nothing nothing at all compared to the ceramic or the titanium in terms of heat retention and obviously durability is a huge issue with these over time stress fractures can be created from like using like super intense heat and stuff like that also if you just drop it or pull it out of your rig too hard stuff like that you can just break it right off so you do have to be careful about the durability you have to be take good care of your nails if you're going to go with quartz but I would say overall I quartz bangers are probably my favorite option they just give you phenomenal taste they have the greatest heat I'm so you don't have to worry about [ __ ] burning through all your butane the price point is absolutely wonderful and honestly it's the taste I like it I like them I'm a Terp chaser I like the taste anyway I hope you guys really

anyways you can see this then it's pretty jazzed up a lot of burnt stuff on there now all you need to do is get this thing it's called bar keeper's friend it's available in the hardware store I got mine at Canadian Tire referring Canada you know that's still open so take a look anyways it's pretty easy process all you do is you dip your banger in some water just drain that out I already happen to have some of this bar keeper's friend powder ready to go so you just add it like that and then you just take the q-tip and you're just rubbing it around you can see right there that stuff's coming right off this stuff is oxalic acid it's where it's been around for a long time it works great at removing caked on minerals and stuff you can use it on metal or all kinds of different surfaces and believe it or not this stuff is actually found in some foods like chives and other foods have small traces of oxalic acid in it anyways you can see within a couple minutes this thing's coming off so look at the bottom like you can already see there's a clean spot there so yeah just just a couple minutes of elbow work and you can get your stuff nice and clean okay so this is just a few minutes later after just some light scrubbing with the q-tips you can see all that chart is gone there's a little around the seam on the inside there I was just trying to rush it through to show you but you guys can see what an amazing job that does it cleaning so going forward definitely use the q-tip tech but also consider getting some of this because it definitely will be your friend", "-0zjfGalW6k": "welcome back to the training facility of beveler USA today we're going to go over the instructions on how to operate and using 30 stationary ieadership the capacity of the machine is point 10 inches to four inches typical use for this machine is for small parts and production all parties now we'll go over some of the features of the machine starting with the bottom we have a chip tray quite chose to keep your workspace clean woken up the machine to see how the cutterhead is adjusting and rotate the drive assembly out of the way let the table up and we at now we have access to the cutter head the cutter head is just mounted directly on the shaft of the motor can easily be easily replace to adjust your angle the simple lever on the side of the machine can adjust from 30 degrees all the way to 60 degrees and you can see that the motor and the cutter head or no tilden the appropriate angle here we have a set of gauges that comes with the machine these are used to set the machine to the appropriate angle and want to do on your workpiece you can see we have 60 degree and 30 degree showing here there's a number of gauges they're two sided we determined that we need to do a 45 degree bevel on this machine so we will go to the 45 degree gauge so now we found our gauge for 45 degrees if you look on the gauge a which is the height of the bevel the maximum is 14 point 1 millimeter so if you look on the gauge its the lines are indicated as 2 millimeter spacings it's 2 4 6 this is the maximum again the maximum bevel the machine is capable of so if we're going to do the max bevel on our material we have to do it in three passes these lines indicate first pass second pass third pass and in a moment we'll show how these lines are used to adjust the machine you're wondering maybe the clip on the widest clip words angle is here on the gauge that again that just indicates what the maximum bevel is 15 so it's visual indication but the important steps are we use these lines to set our first pass look at the game we set on the flat guide plate in the material plate the material right side we have the back against the vertical guide plate you'll notice the gauge here there's a large zero with it with an indicator line so what we need to do is our first pass maximum is this dotted line so we need to line up both of those lines and that will give us our first pass it's very easy very simple on this machine to set just turn the knob you can see the vertical fence backs off now we've lined up the two lines see where line and your first the drive assembly has the ability to move away from the face if you wanted to do angles or GL so you have clearance behind the drive you also have the ability to adjust the pitch of the drive wheel to make short holds the material close to the fences is driving through ability go over the controls on the control panel for the machine we have main switch yet power indicator light just like this on a drive assembly the on/off switch for the drive assembly and an on/off switch in the cutter for Justin speed-dialing we recommend 500 and for products like brass or aluminum non-ferrous material we recommend from 1500 to 2500 your applications you'll get a better feel for the quality of the metal as you get used to them another important point of the machine is you speed your feed rate and we'll go over that here we turn the sheet on your head speed you can see a female is rotating by turning the wheel and increase your feed rate material there is no set adjustment for your feet ray mm we need to adjust the height of our drive we want to drive hater hi it won't engage the material when it comes into cutter head it may stop it won't give you a positive drive across the face your drive wheel was too low mechanism is extremely happy and also provide weight it's too low it won't let the material we've done our first notes and if that's adequate for your application we still need to hire all of the instructions that we provided you today are also written operational detail please refer to that if you have any other questions", "LuJj-QeVsgI": "what's up everybody just taking some dabs off my new nail mafia quartz banger it tends to hold the heat for extremely long time it's the thick bottom on it so I can heat it up and probably talk for like I don't know a good 35 45 seconds before I can even hit it it's

here we have a you know heavy glass female 14 fits like so here we have a drop-down collector this normally is a reclaimed collector it would have 14 male to a 14 female with a 14 attachment here we have a 14 millimeter male that has a 14 millimeter female banger and then you got an 18 millimeter male that will go into the female like so got a variety of different types of bangers collectors got different types of connectors and dropdowns like this one isn't an adapter it takes an 18 female and make it fit for a 14 male so that it are going your rig like so okay we have a thermal these

pipe notcher for sculpting and concaving tubing pipe up to three inch or 76 mil diameter we're forever uh looking at increasing the strength and the build quality of our machines and this tn 76 ticks all the boxes massive heavy duty baseline as you can see there as well we've also included as part of our machine seven formers so you've got the range of basically uh nb tubing pipe formers uh rod ups the large one there down to the smaller ones that's about a 20 nb uh we've got a 25 nb uh for me in there at the moment which will sort of show you how the machine works later on so about a thousand dollars worth of formers included with the machine so that's fantastic uh heavy duty three kilowatts uh 415 volt motor there we've also got um a pull-up uh lining sort of face there so you can do your deburring and finishing and general finishing so it's an all rounds tube and pipe notching machine that just meets the market big time running around the machine we've also got a quick action release handle here so when you're changing your belt simply move that forward that actually pulls the motor forward so you can actually change the belt and making the belt uh felt changing easy we've also got around the back here we've got a lift up face there as well so you have three three uh three lining faces uh it's also this one here and which also has a extraction point down there as well so we've got the rear one we've got the top one here and around the front we've got your uh tube and pipe notching station now how this works uh there's a a variety of sort of different sort of features we have here so we've all we've got the standard sort of manual clamping there we've also got a quick action clamping system there as well so when you're doing ongoing multiple pipes you can actually just quickly uh clamp and unclamp your piece we've got a side uh positioning sort of handle there as well so you can actually sort of uh move your your linishing uh grinding sort of point right across the belt so you're getting maximum wear out of your illumination belt it's 100 mil wide belt and as i said we keep all those belts in stock from 40 60 80 and 120 grade as well now one of the key features on this one here we've got a quick action just over here we'll listen it off and you can actually adjust your approach angle so that gives you also total flexibility as well on undoing all your tubing pipe notching so we'll just nip that back up again so we've got uh we've got a bit of 30 uh 25 nb pipe just over here so what we're going to do is put that over here i'll just bring that back over there and lock that up so i'll back it off and then we'll just use our clamping sort of system there so we'll just quick action clamp that in there and i'll come around the side here and we'll put that on we've also got a two-speed motor so you've also got high and low uh that's in the um in the height at the moment and we've got forward and reverse so we'll just put that on and you can just hear the strength of this machine so here we go [Music] so this handle here brings it in we're going to print it in now [Music] you here over here as you can see there and that's ready for welding we can just finish the edges of that just to tighten it up again but that just shows you how easy it is to actually uh scallop and concave your tubing pipe for any sort of fixing

path your path to a beautiful home in landscape we are back at the granite yard right here in colfax louisiana last week we had talked about the different types of granite marble different countertops that you can purchase this week we're going to be talking about a little bit of the upkeep that you can have on these different types of surfaces that you put in your home now this one actually is a quartzite which is one of the hardest materials that can be purchased today it is a little bit expensive but as you can see it actually is a beautiful piece of stone these can come in a different number of different colors but the upkeep on these is quite simple but the thing to remember about cleaning your granite is that over time it is going to dull a little bit so different fabricators suggest that you seal your granite or your hard surface countertop at least once a year if you clean your counter tops with things that are acidic or harsh such as Windex or Clorox things like that it is going to dull the finish and once that finish has been dulled you can't get it back so it's important that you do clean these surfaces with the right type of cleaner it's not important to have someone come in and clean these things for you try to repolish them it just cannot be done so the key thing to remember is once you have your beautiful countertops put in make sure you take care of them in the right manner and they will be what i call the jewelry in your home it just adds a beautiful touch to an overall interior in your house so I'm Debbie Aaron's thank you all for joining me I

show you how to clean all of your pieces in a snap now we're not going to do that it's not going to be as easy as a snap but in just a few steps i will show you how you can clean all of your pieces why clean your nails well clean bangers provide a better taste look nicer and last longer than dirty quartz if not kept clean quartz bangers become dull cloudy and yellow after each dab allow the quartz ample time to cool so that way the puddle is sufficiently solid to stay in place but liquid enough to lift away about 30 seconds or a minute use a q-tip dipped in alcohol to gently remove the residue and use the dry side of the q-tip to mop up any extra alcohol never use bleach or acid-base cleaning products instead use that high percentage iso alcohol next never use rough abrasive tools to clean your quartz spangler instead most stabbers use a q-tip or cotton swab low temp dabs 400-600 degrees are also essential to keeping your quartz looking and tasting great use a combination of a high percentage iso alcohol and coarse salt in a ziploc bag to create a powerful solution for cutting through dab residue put your banger in the solution overnight to loosen the residue then remove your quartz banger and rinse thoroughly under warm water wipe off any residue once the residue is softened in the alcohol solution use a soft tool or similar blunt tool to scrape off the excess heat up the banger after the worst of the gunk is removed and it's time to heat your banger up to around 600 to 800 degrees fahrenheit this should turn any remaining residue to ash and loosen whatever's left for removal wipe bowl with alcohol soaked q-tip and allow the banger to cool enough that it's safe to run an alcohol soaked q-tip around the bowl this isn't an exact science and it takes some practice to get the right temp yellow residue and fresh puddles should come off easily without being too sticky or too wet use the dry side of the q-tip to remove excess alcohol and repeat until you can no longer remove any residue how to properly clean ceramic step one pour enough isopropyl alcohol to soak your nail into a bag or container and then mix in roughly an equal measure of salt seal your container with your nail inside and give it a little shake to get things started one way to improve your result is to take the salt and to push it into the hard to reach areas of your dab nail to get some abrasion that can loosen up some of that resin let your dab nails soak for 30 to 60 minutes minimum letting it soak overnight is the best way to do this rinse off and remove any remaining particles and remove your nail from the cleaning solution and rinse it off with water be sure to always rinse your nail off thoroughly with water after soaking it in your cleaning solution because it can be very very dangerous if inhaled rinsing with water for two minutes will do the trick how to properly clean the email temperature control box and cords we recommend cleaning it every three to four months unplug the device from the wall and remove the power and heating cord from the temperature control box preferably with an alcohol wipe or something similar wipe down all of the connection ports cords and temperature control box removing any dust and residue making sure to avoid any cleaner solution in the actual device reattach all the cords and plug it back in some general maintenance

Angeles today we're going to talk about some dab rigs dab rigs are essentially a water pipe for concentrating almost anything you can get in flour you can find the extract of it and it's essentially just that the extracted concentrated form of your favorite plant or your favorite string a lot of people choose concentrate over flour for cleanliness you're vaporizing it you're not smoking it the high is completely different it's a lot more of a rush first we've got the traditional dab rig it is simple sleek it's usually just involves a glass nail or banger and a little percolation device to cool down the smoke and a mouthpiece and so essentially you fill it up with water the smoke passes through just like your typical water pipe or bomb important to note is the fact that you're not using a traditional lighter with this you're actually going to be using a creme brulee torch or you know propane torch or something with high heat to just heat up this glass make it as hot as possible to vaporize the concentrate so there are a lot of creative spins on the traditional dab rig one that we have here is going to be a silicone beverage and this is interesting in the sense that it is not going to break you're gonna have this for a very long time very very portable this is for your on-the-go dabber somebody that may or may not have experienced the heartbreak of dropping your rig and your friends garage floor so number two we have the doctor Deb ER switch this is an electronic a brig very cool in the sense that you don't need a torch to heat it up when it's on it's heating the element and the center heats up and you just add your concentrate or flower to it same as the other one but instead of a butane torch or any type of torch it's all contained the battery heats it up itself no more open flame and a lot more control for temperature even the e rigs do have a higher cost upfront but I like to think in terms of all the butane that you're not buying and the trips to the gas station just to buy butane with all that factored in it will eventually pay for itself one cool thing to mention about the switch is that you can use flour or concentrate in it so you've got a two in one thing right here another variation on the e rig is my favorite the puff Co peak this is super convenient same concept as any other ear it push a button it heats up no torches no butane none of that it's just charge it it's a battery and it's hot ready to go I like the puffs go peak because it's so tiny it looks super stylish it's like a lava lamp they are super convenient and portable I like the fact that you can just take the top off to clean it or exchange it for another color so the puff Co peak has a two hour charge for a full battery it also heats up in about 20 seconds which is super convenient just push a button wait 20 seconds and you can take it up so next up we've got the designer dab rigs like with all glass pipes and bongs there's a lot of potential for creativity and dab rigs are no different this is a piece by Mathematics glass they do some really cool work and we've got a couple of their pieces this one's a gumball machine you've also got an adorable Sunday another one we've got is a nitrous oxide tank for those of you that are into the fast and the furious maybe and next we've also got the spray-paint dab rig it's stylized like a spray can and so what's cool is you can find a dab rig that fits your individual style anywhere you can look online you can come into the pottery you can check Instagram there's a lot of cool artists on there that just do custom glass art and another really cool thing to mention about a lot of these glass rigs is you can just take your banger or take your nail out and put in a classic flower bulb and the only difference would be it just gets it dirtier that's it you know you live your life you spent $300 on this thing you however you want to [Music]", "j5i0OdATZO4": "how do you picture YouTube shop teacher and today with the rather mundane lesson strictly talking I'm making no chips and I'm covering the Jacob stapler just exactly what is a Jacob's taper a Jacob's taper is the short taper that's on the end of an arbor or a shank into which the Chuck will be fastened now these are self holding tapers the same as a Morse taper as a self holding taper let me back up and talk just a little bit about Morse tapers first most of all of you that have been around a shop are familiar with a Morse taper and there are eight of them in all they start with a number zero and this is a number one two three and a number four and they go up to number seven very seldom will we go any larger than this you know regular shop and I don't even go any larger than a number four when I talk about self holding tapers and what I mean is that the taper can be put into the machine spindle tailstock or whatever it is and it will hold strictly by friction but in larger diameter drills it will slip and we use a tank to prevent that on some machines or in some applications there is a threaded hole in the end of some Morse taper tools and a drawbar is used to hold them in place but they are self holding as the jacobs taper is as opposed to steeper taper such as this number thirty milling machine taper that is not self holding that is without a drawbar it would fall out of its corresponding taper so what is it Jacob's taper first of all I think everyone knows what a Jacobs drill chuck is it's just a big company that's made drill truck for many many years is probably the dominant chuck company in the United States maybe the whole world I don't know but these are standardized tapers as the short taper again they're self holding and the purpose is that they can be installed into the Chuck for instance this is the number two it would be driven in and pretty much stay there for life the very little likelihood of them coming out and there's many different sizes of chucks and of course there's going to be many different sizes of the Moores tapers so you can get just about any combination of Arbor that you want with a Morse taper or other taper on one end and then the and it might even be an r8 taper and the ubiquitous jacobs taper on the other end there are nine different Jacob's tapers that has nine different sizes I'm going to show you a chart in just a second but I do have some samples here I do not have all of them but this is the smallest and you can't really see it here this is a real small chuck and that is indeed a number zero Morse taper well why am I even covering this subject because in the following video I'm going to remove this little Chuck and install it on one of my little camera and drill presses so I'm really leading up to that but continuing here it's the number zero very small this is a number one with the number two Morse taper there's a number two with a number two Morse taper there's a number 33 which is a very popular one and you're gonna find that on many many drill presses there's another number 33 only with the number one Morse taper here's a number three here's another number three but on a very large arbor and you can see that's all chewed up and ruined it must have spun loose which is really rather unusual that's a number for a more steeper and then finally here although I'm not going to take this off this is a German chuckle rom which is also pretty popular brand and number two Morse taper here but if you can see here this is a number four jacobs taper which is one of the larger ones now let me show you the table you can find all the information you need on Morse tapers in your machinery handbook and in this wonderful little black book but you know these are copyrighted so I'm very hesitant to zero in and show you that I'm going to show you that information in another way here in just a moment this is a page out of the Jacobs catalog quite an old one but you can find this information on their website as well a little description there also on what a jacobs taper is and then here are all the tapers with the different sizes I'm not crazy about this chart because it's kind of confusing they have the information both in inch and metric which doesn't mean much to a lot of you so I'm going to show you a chart from little machine shop company that I think is better than this so if you want to go on to the website for Jacobs if you're interested in this you can look this all up because some of you may be wanting to identify your Jacobs tapers in order to identify your taper in some cases it will be stamped right here on the Chuck but I noticed it sir isn't very consistent and most of them are not marked as such remember that the rigid supreme chucks are also quality american-made one and they also use the Jacobs taper because it's pretty well standardized also on some of the arbors you will find this is a genuine Jacobs and it is marked someplace here yeah number number 33 and a number two Morse taper so you might be able to find that but in most cases not you're gonna have to measure it unless you've got a very good eye here's a number two way Chuck still in the box and it's the mount is a number two Jakob paper but it is not marked yes it is it is marked some Jacobs chucks are threaded as you know usually they're used on portable drills the electric drills but not always but more than likely if you need to get a shank for that for instance here's one that is also threaded and it's the number two so there's a wide variety of these arbors available in any machine shop catalog such as KBC here's an older arbor still in the box and it's clearly marked on the end and it's the number two Morse taper for Jacob's Chuck series number three number brand-new Arbor and it's also marked right here if you buy one that's an import it's probably going to be marked like this Morse taper number three Jacob's taper number three and they're not very expensive that's probably only a ten or twelve dollar item most of you are probably familiar with little machine shop comm and you can go onto their website and they have a paper catalog as well and pretty reasonable prices I do not think they will object to me showing this because I did get this off the internet and printed it out but this is a nice chart here for the Jacob taper because it again shows the different sizes from zero to number six close to the number 33 and there are dimensions if you need to identify when there's the large and the small end the lengths of it and then it tells the tape of her foot now they are not all the same in taper per foot but again neither arm or tapirs also it tells you the angle and the jacobs chart does not show you the angle not that it matters to you but these small angles here two three four degrees are self holding I don't know what angle it is where all of a sudden that it would not be self holding but this is an interesting shirt and you can use this again to identify your taper should you need to for instance if we didn't know what this taper was we can take our caliper and measure near the small end and I'm getting 334 for the small end well there we are it's the number one and I could also double-check it here on the larger end and it's about 377 a little bit of difference there 5,000 depending on where the caliper is on the taper because it's going to vary greatly of course as far as the length of it we can check that too but I don't think that's necessary it's just a pretty easy her to determine that this is a number one Jacob's taper let me explain to you what prompted me to make this video I came across this Jacob's Chuck some time ago and it's brand-new you can still see packing grease on it but I needed an arbor and has not marked as such as to what this taper is so I went through my different arbors here and you can see that a 33 doesn't fit and the number three is too big so I came up with the idea well no big idea real he was I checked it here with the calipers and on the large end it's approximately six six five so looking at the chart error you can see that it's a number six and I did check the depth it's a little hard to check the smaller diameter but that's the number six so I will order and Arbor and that's the entire reason I did this video I would like to order Ann Arbor for this remember it's a number six Jakob stapler and I believe I'll get it in a number two more stapler so in the KB seat catalog you see that there's an entire page devoted to arbors for Chuck's so let me zero in on what I'm going to order and there it is highlighted number two Morse taper to a number six Jacobs taper and how can that only be three dollars and ninety cents I might as well order a dozen or I could buy the genuine Jacobs but look at the difference in price it's $24 if I get the genuine I believe maybe the Jacobs is hardened and the imports are not here I am over at the drill press now to talk just a little bit about this there was a video that I made some time ago and here it is it's tips number 384 on how to remove a Jacob's Chuck from this type of spindle because this Chuck again even though it's a number 33 has that threaded collar on there I don't believe they make them that way anymore but you're gonna find plenty of old drill presses around that have that taper and even though the number 33 is a self holding taper they put that threaded collar around there to make darn sure it wasn't going to come off I'm over at the Bridgeport Mills to show you just a couple things I'm getting a little sidetracked but here is a big Jacob's Chuck with an hour 8 shank on it they will fit right into the Bridgeport spindle and this one is marked right here on the arbor as a number 3 Jacobs taper well the thing I really wanted to show you here is that there are still people that insist on using a drill chuck in a milling machine along with an end mill and that is not correct you need to hold your end Mills in Kalos because what happens here is as you feed into your work you're putting side pressure on the little Jakob taper and there's a good chance that these will come loose and go rolling across the floor so same thing goes if you're on a drill press and you're using a sanding drum or something like that they can come off but that I think is why they equipped a lot of the older drill presses with that threaded collar because it would prevent them from coming off but a word to the wise on that there may be times when you wish to remove the arbor from the shock and how can we do that well there's about three different ways number one is to drive it off and looking at this picture from Jacobs you notice that very seldom does this hole go all the way through in other words it's a blind hole where's my flashlight so what you can do from this side is to drill that out and there'll be a little space in there you'll feel when you break through and then you can drive it out with a punch the other way is to drill a hole and drive a pin through the shank the arbor rather and then use the wedges this is the correct way to use wedges but if there is no shoulder like there isn't right here to drill a hole drive a pin through there then the wedges can be used and will grip between the Chuck and the pin let's take a look at those wedges now there's a close-up view of what the wedges look like as old as the Egyptians or older Jacobs and other companies make wedges and here the are the three different sizes that's number one size there's the number two size and the number three size and there are about $15 a pair now regarding the small number zero taper in the next video I'm going to make a set of wedges to remove that so that'll be part of that video if you want to order wedges here they are and the Jacobs catalog you'll also see a page like this and any other supply catalog but notice that they offer four different wedges I have a number two or three and six the number one fits the number one Jacob's taper but remember in the following video I need to remove a number zero Jacobs taper the thing is that Jacobs tells you what taper it can be used on but they really do not give you any of the dimensions of the wedges that's why I have three sets of them because I would order a set and it wouldn't fit and then I would order the other said it was all by trial and error so I'm going to do something here that no one has ever done on YouTube and what has no one ever done on YouTube and that's to give you the dimensions of the wedge and so here's the number one and that's four hundred and sixty-five thousandths but number two is five hundred and eighty eight thousandths and the number three eight forty seven and those are approximate I hope that helps someone I could have used that information a long time ago so one would have to determine what size wedges to use well the number ones don't fit in the number three is way too big but the number two it's just right and you use one up against the other I'm not going to remove this and you can see this one's already been pretty well dinged up it might help to put just a little grease on that on those two surfaces and then fit them up like this now you can squeeze them in a vise but I found that doesn't work real well it needs the shock because some of them have been in there for 50 years so if you would lay this on an anvil and use a brass or copper hammer it's gonna come off but I don't guarantee it it can be very difficult so don't damage the chuck and make sure you hang on to the chuck and then this piece is probably gonna go flying unless you've got somebody to help you hold this end and I don't recommend that if you're wielding a huge hammer but that is how to remove them and I think you can understand now if there was no shoulder there that you would drill a hole and drive a pin that would give some purchase for the wedges back to this big old rom chuck here if we wanted to remove that you can see that there is no shoulder this is the taper right here so in using the larger ones well even that's not large enough to go on there you might have to grind it out because I don't believe they make a bigger size than the number three but since there would be no shoulder that's where you would have to drill a hole across hole and drive a probably a hardened pin in there to get it out but probably a better alternative on this would be and you can see that's a blind hole would be to probably put this in the lathe and drill as large a hole as you could in there and you'll again feel it break loose or break through and then use a good punch and straddle this over a vise or the anvil or something and drive it out but it may not be easy how do you reassemble an arbor onto a chuck because I did remove this one earlier just for the purposes of instruction well I cleaned the Jakob taper real well as well as the hole and be sure and back the jaws out of the way in other words we don't want to drive it on with the jaws sticking out you could damage it like that this is a lead plate we know that won't make a mess again they're nice and clean copper hammer and that won't come off make sure there's no chips in there I said earlier I wasn't going to remove an arbor but I think I will so you see how it's done and this is one that will come off easily because I had it off before this is the one that I drove home and install a few minutes ago so that will require the number two wedges they go in like this bring them together and then on an anvil or some real good surface I'm just going to strike it with the copper hammer now if it's been on there for years this may really go flying take one of your wives washcloth and lay it there when you hit it if you don't have this somebody around to help you and tap it off now I'm gonna take this off just lay it here we'll see how far it goes but I want you to see what happens and it didn't go flying because it wasn't really on there that tight but that's all there is to doing that if you have the right tools and let's put it right back on that concludes this video on the Jacobs taper hope you liked it hope you found it useful in your machine shop be sure and watch the following a video where I will talk about that little number zero taper and I will remove this hopefully and install it on my camera run

with the sawyer beveling machine got bryce montgomery from ohio and david hype from new mexico uh we're gonna i'm gonna teach them how to use this brand new sawyer eight inch beveling machine we got um from our tree our christmas tree we got these guys are on advanced pipe they're doing a little bit of fabrication bryce montgomery's headed up to minnesota next week to start his job in a sanitary sanitary uh food processing plant we're getting a little bit of pipe fitting skills we're fitting pups here and so we're going to get started um we're going to cut we're going to get the prep and clean the tip and get to cutting some pups what i start out doing um i'll just run this sucker this file right here it comes on this tip cleaner and you're going to just file on that tip and you don't need to get it super clean just kind of knock off the grime all tips are kind of little some burrs and stuff one trick i was taught is actually take this file and kind of file off the edge of this tip a little bit and it seems to cut a lot better and it's a see the secret is the sharp torch they say and this seems to help keep a sharp torch it's real nice when you're cutting and make sure use less gas more efficient better move more better and fast faster so i clean that edge around there like that now i pick out a little over these little round fellas and we clean out each orifice goes into each little hole here and fold it back don't go crazy with this just real nice and easy don't jam it if it if it doesn't go in all the way there's something in the way need to take the tip off take the tip off and figure out why it's jammed should just do real nice in each hole if you have a clean tip your torch is going to cut a million times better than a dirty old tip even a brand new tip isn't going to be a clean tip if you clean it up clean these orifices be gentle with it it'll cut a lot better you'll get that sharp torch it'll be way more efficient so there's usually six preheat passages you're gonna wanna clean all six and then you're gonna have your center high pressure your pierce pressure you want to clean it too you got six exterior holes and one center hole we're using a double lock tip got our pressure set accordingly on the regulator now we're just getting prepped and clean that last hole the last hole there is the most important to stay clean oh if it's clean when you fire it up i'm going to show you how to tell if it's actually clean and if you got your orifices cleaned out just right there all right now we're going to fire this torch up and we're going to actually see if it's clean and that sharp torch i was telling you about how the the tail on the torch when you give it pressure how long it is and it'll make a crackling sound if you got that crackling sound and a long tail it's actually a good thing um and it's actually being efficient and it's blowing it'll actually blow your slag out of your weld or your molten metal and that cut will be ten times cleaner so we'll just fire it up here always turn on just like in all the videos we've had you turn on your feel first get it to where the smoke goes away now if you look get a neutral flame you can hear that torch is real loud and crackly and it's real long you can feel it down here that means it's gonna it's gonna cut real clean and blow all the molten metal out of the cut and have a clean cut cool okay we'll slide this bad boy back get a clamp down float turn high pressure on we're doing this putting the high pressure as a preheat and the blow off all the coating on this pipe this coating is a coating for underground piping and it helps with corrosion resistance on underground pipes all right so our pups we're going to be making are going to be 14 inches long um we're going to measure them out i'm going to show you a little trick on how to get that cut just about perfect on standard wall pipe this trick with the striker and that's all you need to get that tip lined up perfectly and you can get a real precise cut with the correct measurement we're going to do a 14 inch long clock all right grab your tape measure mark 14 inches okay so draw an arrow you know all right hold that striker and now we're going to turn our torch around now you take that striker slide this torch over here now this line you don't want that in the middle of the torch you actually want it right at the end and square with the end of the tip we'll take that striker you can take this striker here and you hold it right here with the end of this tip kind of square like that and that's actually where your end of your cut's going to be and it's just because it's at an angle don't mean the center the back of it's where it's going to be it's going to be right here square that's if you put your mark there and come off that tip square with this striker that's all you need and you'll be a perfect measurement okay um one other thing i learned there's a little trick you take an old file and you can actually bend the end of that sucker you take that file and you can pull out the slag an old man taught me this take that file instead of beating on it right here with a hammer like that take this thing like a dent puller and it'll pull out that slag there and it's super fast super efficient to get that slag out of there instead of beating on it you just go like this and pull it from the inside out [Music] let's see it isn't always necessary but i i like it because it weighs less pipe because if you leave this crap on the edge here you're gonna have to cut back even farther but if you can pull that crap back like this you'll have left less weight more [Music] efficiency [Music] [Music] [Music] all right everyone i'm gonna leave this pipe for the students to bevel tonight if you like this video should give us a like subscribe to our page on the youtube channel and instagram until then we'll see you on the next one you", "_ed7IY4ucug": "what up y'all I'm see with Ella Bache presents and this is Theresa and she's the lovely elevate doll here today to help us do a cold temp this is my favorite way it gives you the best flavor I believe and it also allows the fats and lipids to stay behind so what exactly is it you start out and what are you going to need you're going to need a torch a carb cap a banger a rig a dab tool some tiny tips some alcohol and a little bit of dabs or CBD concentrates so the first thing you're gonna do is I go ahead and I guess you can use your thing and drop it in there and this is why it's called a cold start DAP because you start out cold and then you just put it there and you're gonna use your DAP tool or your torch not dab tool your torch to go ahead and heat it up and then once it starts Bank or melting a little bit after that you're going to go ahead and then start to inhale it so you can see it melting up right there and that might be hot enough and if you don't get more you can always add a little bit more heat so that's good and that's a really nice low temp dab you seen right when it started to melt that's right when you can do it you're not going to get a lot of fats or lipids up and it's you're gonna get more hits but less smaller ones and this is the closest thing the vaporizing with to all vaporizing but this is a nice true vaporization lot smoother a little bit better flavor a lot better flavor and you don't have to spend a lot of time heating it up wait for it to cool down guessing what it is with all these variables you can see it right when it's ready right there it goes it's more efficient better flavor all around I think this is the best way to do adapt and then when you're done with that I think the next thing you do is you just take out your alcohol clean that up a little bit and you can do this with alcohol in your piece because it is quartz and it will not break and the next thing about low temp dabs is they are a lot easier to keep your your banger sorry your banger a lot cleaner and clean that up every time good maintenance good flavor good DAB [Music]", "nk8MKyFjAwY": "[Music]", "HVtBI7YGXzc": "welcome to Granite monkey 101 today I want to show you how I do my inside radius is

half I don't like to use a 3 inch backers so I get a 4 inch backer and I cut about a quarter inch of the outside for that reason I want my pads to overlap the backer this way I don't have to worry too much about turning in my radiuses and you'll notice that some going that I don't really turn to much I go from one side to the other because the pad is already flexing to go to the with the contour of your radius even if it's a small radius big radius it doesn't matter this has worked for me for many years now if you notice you have to look at when I'm on the left side you have to look at the left side of the backer and then right here the right side of the backer notice that the right side there was not touching the stone it's just my inside radius the rest of the kitchens already polished so this is my first pad as little aggressive so I want to be careful how deep I go and I don't want to I only want to concentrate on the radius I want to be really careful that I don't alter this side right next to the radiuses sometimes especially when you're starting to learn you have the tendency to kind of dig into the stone a little bit if you change the backer this way you will avoid all that one thing that you also notice is I am constantly running my fingers through what I'm doing because the stone is wet everything I do is wet so I want to make sure that I'm not altering the edge and I'm I'm not missing anything as I'm going along I want it to be smoother and smoother so I'm gonna work my radiuses I'm constantly checking my work running my fingers through looking at it with every step to make sure that if I do something wrong I can stop and correct it right away you don't want to continue if you make a mistake and think that well as long as I make it shiny it's fine because you want your your Reyes to be to look straight to look really really nice you don't want it to look miss shape now this edges a quarter round edge or round over however you want to call it so you notice that I'm going up a little bit that's that's the reason why I wanted to look like the rest of the kitchen and that's a very important thing when you're doing your radius is that you don't miss shape it and make it look like you know a different edge bigger or smaller now as I'm going along I'm gonna speed it up a little bit so I don't make this very video a little too long but you're gonna do the exact same thing with every pad you're gonna come in from every each side and you know like I said try not to turn your polisher inside there because you're gonna dig on the wrong side so just go from one side to the other and if you make your backer if you alter it to to about three and a half inches or so you don't have to turn you can just go from one side to the other because the pad is going to flex right in that inside that corner so right there is all done it's all polished just what you can't really see it very well but I'll show you in a minute what it looks like clean and dry so here it is as clean as dry it's nice and shiny beautiful it's it's not you see that it wasn't looked different from one side to the other it's not bigger on one side and I didn't dig on the side of the radius it's nice and straight and that's what you're looking for I strongly recommend that you take a 4 inch backer and just cut about quarter inch of the outside and it will help you and this is how I do my inside radius", "caw79dpL8nI": "hi i'm randy bourdelle and i'd like to show you a quick and easy upgrade for your glass grinder I'm gonna replace the sponge and the brass bit that came on my inland twin spin grinder with this aqua fuel system and a quick fit pit now this upgrade is only going to take a few minutes to accomplish and the only tool I'll need is the allen key to remove the old bit the aqua foam and quick fit bit offers several advantages that I'll point out as I work my way through this video however one of the key advantages is the promise to reduce glass edge chipping so before I remove my old brass grinding head and sponge I'm going to grind a piece of red opal glass so I'll have something to compare after I have the new system installed so let's do that first I'll grind this section with my brass bit and as you can see I did get some chipping along the edge okay let's begin the conversion first take off the eye shield and put it to one side then remove and discard the old sponge then lift out the grit top surface the only tool we'll need for this conversion is an allen key to loosen and remove the old head unfortunately the brass grinder heads can get stuck on the grinder shaft and you may have to use a little persuasion to get it off be sure the locking screw is sufficiently loosened then pull straight up if it's stuck you may need to give it a shot at wd-40 or other penetrating oil and let that soak in then give it a couple of taps with a handle of the screwdriver be patient and be careful you don't want to damage your grinder trying to remove the old bit the good news is this is the last time you'll ever have this problem since the quick fit that is made from a polymeric material that won't fuse to the shaft once the old head is detached you should take some time to clean the grinder believe it or not this is an old grinder that we've been using an hour shop for many years this is what it looked like before we worked on it for over an hour the glass powder residue was really stuck to the floor insides of the reservoir and half of the grid spaces in the surface were clogged shut now it looks almost new now that the old parts are removed and the grinder is all cleaned up we can put it back together with our new components first let's take a look at our new quick Fitbit it's available in two sizes three quarter-inch nineteen millimeter and one inch 25 millimeter with a standard grit diamond surface both sizes will fit on my twin spin so I'm going to use the one inch twenty five millimeter size fit rings are available separately in fine standard and rapid grind options when you open the blister pack you'll find the bit holder and the bit ring let's take a closer look at the bit holder the body is manufactured from an industrial-strength paul america material while this lower housing is made from a soft elastomer that flexes to secure the bit ring and absorb vibration while grinding to install the quick fit bit simply slide the ring onto the shaft all the way down to the stop rim now match the flat side of the grinder shaft to the flat edge in the bit opening to make lineup even easier you will find an arrow on the top of the holder here now slide the bit onto the motor shaft then flip down the orange lever to engage the locking device this clamps on so tight that I can pick up the hole grinder by holding the bit ring only now flip the leaver up and bit slides off the shaft what could be easier than that I need to put the grid table on for a minute to show you another cool advantage nobody wants to waste any part of the diamond surface with the quick fit fit you align the lower edge of the grid area with the top of the grinding table then as this section becomes dull you move the grinder head down an eighth of an inch three millimeters to a new area that's not new but this time you don't have to search for the allen wrench simply lift the orange leaver move the head then push the lever back down and that's it then when you have used up the bottom half of the ring simply lift the locking lever remove the head pull the ring off and flip it over reinstall it on the grinder shaft align the lower edge to the grit area with the top of the grinding table and your bit has a new half life upside down you can't do that with a conventional brass bit okay enough about the bit let's take a look at my new aqua flow system the package looks like this and you have to be sure to get the one made for your grinder model shown right here this one is for all inland mop the text here says it's an innovative system providing continuous water to the grinder bit and this is an important difference a conventional sponge has a tendency to dry out as you're grinding and the water flow stops to the bit this in turn clogs the sponge with powdered glass that is very abrasive and that wears down the diamond particles reducing the lifespan of your bit this is true no matter if you use a conventional brass bit or a quick fit bit the aqua full package contains three main components a brush a base holder and a d-shaped insert the first step is to insert the brush into the base holder now here's a little trick place the holder over the table edge or the edge of your grinder as I'm doing here then push down on both ends with one hand to bend it slightly now the brush will easily slide into the track replacement brushes are available but this one should last for a good long time now that the brush is secured simply slide the narrower end of the holder under the grinder head and push down on the opposite end until it is fully seated let me show you that from a side view as well slide the narrower end of the holder under the grinder head then push down on the opposite end notice how the bristles fan out across the diamond surface of the bit now we'll fill the reservoir with water or grinder coolant until it just touches the bottom part of the bristle the aqua flow system uses capillary action to constantly deliver a flow of coolant to the brush and directly on to the grinder bit as it is spinning this coolant flow along with the scrubbing action of the brush will flush the glass residue away from the bit down into the waste reservoir as a result the grinder bit will last longer the glass will grind away faster and the edge will be smoother combine this with the vibration reducing properties of the quick fit bit and you have a powerful grinding team okay so let's finish by reinstalling the grid surface then position the d-shaped insert into the track around the bit now check the grinder head position and if necessary flip the locking lever and slide the holder on the grinder shaft until the bottom edge of the diamond grip is just below the top surface of the grinder place the ice shield glass back on and position the splash guard across the back and we're ready to grind some glass so here is the red spirit class that I ground just before removing my old grinding bit remember there was some chipping along the edge so let's regrind this same area to see if we can remove that chipping and leave the glass with a nice smooth edge I'll dry off the glass so we could take a close inspection I was pushing the glass into the grinder quite firmly and as you can see the result is very smooth and the surface did not chip along the edge so the good news is both of these modifications are very inexpensive the quick fit fit holder and ring set costs about the same as a conventional brass bit the one I used cost less than 17 us and the replacement rings are a lot less expensive than a new brass fit under $10 the aqua flow system costs less than seven dollars and I think that's very reasonable considering it helps my diamond business stay sharp and lasts longer as you can see this entire conversion took less than five minutes not including the cleaning of course and my old grinder is better than new the quick fit bit is easier to adjust and I can switch from standard grip to coarse or fine with the flip of the lever the aqua flow system is hassle free I don't have to keep wetting and repositioning the sponge to keep the coolant flowing and chipping and micro fractures are a thing of the past be sure to ask your local art glass supplier for these fine grinder accessories or visit technical ask.com website for more information HAPI glass crafting you", "PMUSFPUfgRU": "blanket metalwork january 28 2021 the objective of this video is try to cut this steel bar diameter is 0.4 inch which is about 10.23 millimeter diameter for a relative size comparison here is the 16d nail with 4113 millimeter or 0.162 and this is a 3 8 inch reebok and the pen there you go now she said well nine millimeter the cut through using this bar here this is a 12 l 14 is which is almost similar to 10 18 mile steel but accept this one a little bit more brittle and doesn't have much elongation which is mean a little harder but that's okay because i can buy the things of the internet and the objective of the challenge is to have an edge with certain geometry i will tell you geometry and start with an asset cut print the paper and after cut to the bar it would still able to cut the paper without tearing the paper meaning that you don't have uh ugly nasty damage to it so let's start with this one this is w2 63 rockwell fairly high angle here i will start out conservatively at 22 degree per side 44 degree inclusive thickness behind the edge is point zero two two inch twenty two tau and again get die two instead of using one cut all the way through then have to deal with a lot of wedging and also with setup this way i can avoid all the setup need and i can also successfully cut through [Music] check because i don't want to cut the all the way through and to the base i will use the aluminum so i can cut through so that it don't damage the edge [Music] that was uh even that that's what i'm saying why are you aluminum back in there okay clean up quick visual there's something here i don't know i saw a little lint there's something right there i think but now do the paper test now it cut right a meter so i would do slow and something there is a hesitate tiny bit actually you can see the reflection there it's a sometimes that's when you slam on down to something and do more damaging than actually the cutting itself but i if i do fast that okay here diving in it's not tear the paper as far as i can this is for this one i will try another 20 different steel i think there's some aluminum stuck on here take a picture and then the macro picture the w2 this is uh this is 136 thickness here that thick this is just this is 10.95 22 for side here 20 thou i mean behind the edge thickness and the hardness of 62 63 64 and because really hard to get accurate but the very thin blade very thin one it's only up there going down that that is 85 thousand let mark show a target let me do it right here then why the around here ah when i up shot like that i put this i pried it so the edge got shifted one side sometimes you make a but i will use the same area [Music] sam [Music] time to use aluminum [Music] [Music] a little better the edge all got ripped a little bit you can actually see the ripple but the actual apex apex got a little bit uh again i mean because again this is a little thinner than the other one but also i made a mistake want to bend the thing sideway so but let's test paper cutting ability i enter the part unaffected you go through the affected part okay that again and i didn't tear the paper even though i look ugly so for this geometry actually this thing again the objective is able to slide the paper and pass that objective now let uh if you want to reduce the size this thing getting smaller okay let's try 20 degrees per side and this is 1085 63 rockwell my heat treat is 5e here so i got different label 20 20 degree per side and time this away all right [Music] sometime i miss hit i can feel it [Music] didn't pass i think i put it uh that's a mishit is not so this one failed not able to do it at 10.95 [Music] okay i think this too short now let's try another 18 degrees psi 1095. this is 1085 here thickness behind the edge is 21 thou and the hit rate is 5 g 63 rockwell this thing a little longer back aluminum have it blunted a little roll i doubt it's going to pass this test 10. i'm making this again all these blade the main objective is a 20 degree percent because the main challenge is that the replica would be like the rich frank richtek his demo knife at 20 degrees per side so i will try to make let me switch to another 20 degree per side i guess i will try it play only one side once what i would use this thing is the 26c3 63 rockwell this is a little bit thicker here at style behind its thickness [Music] i didn't like up i'm not very good with my hammer control but that's okay i'll switch side again [Music] all right i do a little that's not careful here but look like i tried to come close over one more and then i will switch to aluminum block look like uh yeah that's not cool when look like about like a row big roll i got here try to tear up the edge it was doing well until um so that this one didn't do it because he got that damage i got one steel not that thick i think 120 thickness here is again heat treat latex 360 263 rockwell or 64 i don't know 20 degrees per side 20 000 inch behind its okay [Music] so [Music] sometimes you go in and they go left and right and also an angle incorrectly it looked like it didn't enter straight [Music] and i don't want to pry the edge and look like i already have a little bit of roll [Music] well you have it's rolling for sure here so it's so much over but all right i will finish the cup [Music] finish and it's all ripply up so i mean when it ripples like this rather than little microchips or something i mean possibly they could use a little harder i mean between 62 and 64 here the 20 or 20 degree is too not strong enough but let's go for 18 degree per side this thing at 20 tile behind the edge thickness i i don't know when this is where there is uh i i marked the steel type under the handle i put the handle on forgot to write it down so either 1085 or 2063 or the remaining blade first cut first try was off so not cool so there's a little ripple and again they're looking for and if they say oh the edge is tough well you have to be strong enough tough is not good enough right because if you're not strong enough and then and this one helps steering issue they're going this way i think is it bad grind i mean the a little bit uh it dive in that way [Music] well it's mango up the edge and you can see it enter and crook it and game over for it one more 18 degree push side 20 tile behind the edge thickness sometimes the bar too short also problematic but that was a previous one with grind issue try to do this one slow and it's still coming look crooked but it's not too bad yet where is it yes [Music] i don't know why i did lousy with the grinding with this thing play [Music] and it's ripply so the apex is not strong enough so it's over for this one it's already there i don't want further damage i want to continue to test more on this thing so i don't want to make a rip a big hole out of this let me grab [Music] one of these 20 degree beside blade to cut finish cutting through this one and with this big blade here so that i can use the ball oh boy wow there's no wonder it didn't work many which way you know one you have all this ben anyway it's kind of hard to try to get cut through it [Music] yeah when you're going in there now you're going to get like think of like a knot it's going every which way here so they damage the edge here but cool thing about it is you don't see it's like a chunk out of it and get bent plenty toughness when did what for sure it will fail 15 degrees per side 20 behind 25 behind the edge it's uh all right just uh i will be careful and slow i'll be careful no answer is no this thing is horrendous really big for 15 degrees per side it's already crumbled the egg just crumble over and i might well pretend that get out of jail i have to use the rest of this edge i made we'll cut through this ball let's see i can make it just curiosity and get the rest of this [Music] well when you go into the same place everything steering become a major issue here so it will damage the edge severely from the twisting aspect of it but i need to get out of jail [Music] no i'm a fugitive anyway i think this is a 2063 but should i end here why should i use it 22 degrees per side that first one that passed for some additional whacking this w-2 the w-2 look too good don't you think yeah let's throw some other challenges come on what about this guy oh this guy's bigger how about oh wait i just gotta go one more this is half an inch this is 0.5 inch it's a 12.7 millimeter we give it a shot in this video the video was too long and i got missing somewhere but this is half an inch thick bar and this is w2 22 degree per side [Music] too bad [Music] superfly green now i call it nano green but when they're enough hidden this will happen it's because and it breaks not a straight line here is that there are a lot of when you have work hardening over time so you can see the edge is fine actually edges still look pretty good ta-da but the whole blade collapse because walk hardening all right so i will continue finish it and it will finish here i will finish you what uh there's my 22 degree percent it is with the another 22 review percent here things and let me go to the front here [Music] all right [Music] all right let me go through this simple crack [Music] usually the damage when you go deep like this and that was happened because a lot of steering and twisting no weird thing you look like i stuck right now so i'm going to commit all the way through so the ending part here that way torn up in the middle a little bit of the core and this one is all rippling up [Music] that half inch size well i guess uh take a week or more of my work and i still have to play two blade to play with but that for now thanks for watching", "_Tpm7_qnGbw": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "ZHpeyGZkwqI": "welcome back this is the CM 50 DS double-sided plate beveling machine from Bailey industrial this machine has a bevel capacity of 50 millimeters or 2 inches it's got a varying degree angle capacity of 15 degrees up to 50 degrees it requires 220 volts of three-phase power that drives us massive 5.25 horsepower for kilowatt motor it's tied to this industrial grade gear reduction system that goes right to the cutter head here we have the operator control panel on here we've got start and stop for your feed and then we've got start and stop for your cutter head the actual feed control on here is tight to the speed pot so you can speed it up or slow it down if we come down here we've got your adjustment for the plate thickness so we can go anywhere from a quarter inch up to 2.75 inches or seven millimeters up to 70 millimeters I've got two independent drive units for feeding on the in feed and feeding on the out feed here you've got your your feed rollers and in between you have your cutter head the cutter head has carbide inserts that can be turned up to four times now let's take a look at this machine in operation all right now we're going to take a closer look at this 3d manipulator cart first thing you'll notice is it's very portable allows you to move it around the shop or move it around that plate I'm you're lacking the feet really quick we'll show you the three axis one axis is your height adjustment level it up or down depending on the plate height the second axis on here would be an adjustment forward or adjustment backwards that'll allow us to square up the machine to that plate third axis allows us to flip the entire machine instead of flipping that metal plate so we would take the Machine and just flip it over in a matter of seconds and here we are didn't have to flip that plate now what we're gonna do is we're getting this table that will allow you to do smaller pieces of material all right now we've added this nice feed table for those smaller pieces of material it's real safe and it allows these smaller pieces to be beveled on this large machine so I'll bring my piece of material in and get right up to the feed rollers and adjust my height and right from there you just let the Machine take over and it'll put in that perfect bevel every single time so if you want to find out more information on this great product the CM 50 DS double-sided plate beveling machine from bailey industrial or any of our other products go to WWE you", "SbyMvtSqjAc": "hello youtube family James green short series shenanigans so in today's video we're going to talk about what's behind me here recent tool acquisition something I picked up it is a 12 inch three-in-one it actually is a roll a slip roll press break and also a shear so I just want to go over it real quick it's something that you know I don't need a really big big one because I don't do a lot of stuff to where I need to you know roll huge long pieces of material or bend them you guys have seen in my other videos and well my little pan break that I've got and this has fingers you can remove there's four or one there's five of them and you can just them accordingly and then this year you know now I've got a open throat shear but this one is actually pretty good if I want to do some 12 inches long now this machine is rated for up to 20 gauge so one of the reasons I got it was I was looking for just a slip roll okay I don't need one very often and when I do it's I don't need something very very long and I looked at getting just a slip roll I couldn't find just a slip roll for me that was reasonable so I got to looking through looking around found one and got it company had this online and I'm guessing they probably wanted to get rid of them because the cost of course this video is going to be on YouTube for a long time so the cost was very very very reasonable and it was shipped so it was like wow and they only had a couple of them left so I jumped on it um this thing isn't light it's 115 pounds so I had fun getting it up here on on this deal I actually dropped my knee all the way down picked it up got on there and raise it up and I went through it just like anything import you get it has that protective all over it so I disassembled it it does come with a basic manual you know as far as very very rudimentary gives you basic safety precautions it gives you you know everything's pretty much broke down in metric measurements and imperial as well unpacking it tells you what should be in there what shouldn't be and I will say this because of how it was put in the box with styrofoam and it's 115 pounds it beat the styrofoam to death there actually holds in the Box the allen wrench was missing but you know what and I think two or three bolts fell out of the package but you guys have heard me talk before about my pitfalls and having to deal with getting stuff shipped not a big deal common metric six by one point thread pitch metric screw they were twenty millimeter long not a big deal I had him other than that everything was fine there wasn't even damage nothing was messed up nothing was like beaned or twisted or whatever fortunately you know the worst thing that happened was dis got tore but I can live with that no so it's not you it gives you an idea of parts description parts list and an exploded view now there's no place obviously to order parts for this like if you're missing something this is just a description so if something is missing it's like well you either make it or you or you make it you know but for the money what this cost what I do it was definitely worth to people it was it was under $300 I'll say that and that was a heck of a Parkin and that's shipped delivered to my front door I've been needing to make a the front guard on my surface grinder I've got the face please piece made but the piece needs to go around the outside it's going to be aluminum well I need a slip rolled to curve that because I'm going to be using aluminum now I know it's it's 20 gauge and I've got some 3/16 aluminum I'm gonna experiment with and try heating and bending and being real gentle and it's going to be a learning process I'm going to see if I didn't do it I've got some other thinner aluminum but I want to see if I can use the same gauge material so when I go to weld it all together it'll fit so then that will be another video series but we took it all apart you know disassemble because when these come here's the thing a lot of equipment import stuff when it comes it's not put together tight it's always been my understanding the reason for that is number one they put because you guys have have shipped anything or you've been around the coast or you go over seas the salt encaustic environment eats metal up so that's why they put all that stuff on there it's the understanding that you're going to disassemble it clean it and reassemble it and and then line everything up so that serves two purposes number one you get to know your piece of equipment whatever is number two you give it a good cleaning and then you could put everything together when I first got this everything was loose and it wiggled and wobble that's fine it's not a big deal I've heard people comment in the past about certain things man I got it was loose as heck and everything that's falling apart and I'm like well it's even when I got my lathe because you don't want to ship everything with it too stiff because you know the package get dropped something will broke break or you know get broken so anyway taking park cleaned it up you know this roll you twist this and this one slips out whatever you need to slip a long piece out or whatever and what I do what I thought was funny was and you know have what you will I'll show you from this side here look blue the camber over here so what I did was you can notice hair on the end there on both these on the top there's grease certs well you actually pull this slide this and then this little arm comes off on both ends and you have to do that in order to get you know everything open and because I needed to slide these off to pull this and tighten the main tightening pieces actually behind this jaw down here so it was disassembled it you know and that that's where you ended up lining the whole thing up when you tighten adopt a deal in the back not you can't see them here but they're in the back anyway so when we put it back together I thought you know I wanted to do grease or oil and when I had this roller out the little bushings that are in there they're a pressed metal bushing and and by pressed I mean it's like a powdered you guys have probably seen them before and I thought okay you know what let me just go ahead and use how many of us have a can of you know anti-seize sitting around you can tell that's pretty old I got to looking at the date the other day is 1998 and it's still good it's sealed it's just general-purpose anti-seize lubricant copper base height to 1800 you know and so how many of us have a can that's really really old of never sees or anti-seize floating around and I thought okay well that'll work great because number one it will kind of help everything work in and I put it on the gears and so for me and everything and I thought let's do it so instead of and I'm not I left those in there I'm not gonna ever pump grease in there but I will use the never sees and so I put that in there and also on the gears and all the little bushings because I had it all apart and it just rolls really really really smooth and of course when I put it back together I had to adjust which i think is pretty neat whoever thought of this design it's really really cool it actually has on the back and I haven't set it up but here's a little stop so if you're feeding items through for example to set this up here and you want to see something through at a certain when you're when you're set up because here's how you adjust for when you're using your break because you actually bring the bottom jaw cut okay so to adjust for the thickness of material and desired bin you loosen these and you come in with a six millimeter I believe yeah six mil Allen and then you drop this down and that's how you set the height for the thickness of whatever material you're gonna bend and you can just you know and on that on the handle here on the end you can you can put it on either side but you can actually adjust it to where you can get your leverage for the desired functions when you need for general purpose I just leave at the middle so and then so if you want you don't only go through so far that's what this centerpiece was that I slid through on the back and it's a it's the dead stop so you only so you know you're going through so far and you're doing a lot of pieces or you know like I talked about before you have your marks on your material you can mark it you don't even have to worry about that and you know I'm going to go I need to do and you and your marks are on the edge of your material so pretty good pretty simple pull this up here so this is pretty cool while having this apart the two hard jaws the guillotine you can set up and it's actually set to where it's closer on this slide and wider on this side so as it comes down it's a guillotine sheer action so you can just you know you get up here and you get the piece you need and I'll demonstrate up a little piece of this is 26 gauge galvanized sheet metal now what this is for to demonstrate is you got a hard jaw here in here and you adjust it it's actually got adjustments where you move this in and out these just how you know the blade so there's there it's pretty cool there's some adjustments so you can get everything set up let me grab this here so here's some 26 gauge sheet metal and so that little piece on the front there you slide it in I'm just going to cut a piece and you just the idea is to move quickly and we've cut it off in the little pieces that fell down in a key way back there but that's fine anyway you get the idea and so this actually when it comes down it keeps the metal from popping up because if you don't okay and it just slides in and out so if you don't you'll actually see it will try to stand up on the end and that's what you don't want because that's how that's how jaws get damaged is is instead of being held in sheer as it folds up and that's how you damage or and you don't want to damage your jaws these two pieces of metal are definitely hardened I hadn't test the hardness something but and they're very very very sharp they have the ability to even pull them off and if you need to you can set them I could set on the surface grinder and regrind and so like I said this was actually a pretty smokin little deal so when you put it in there and you pull down you notice how this little spring-loaded piece so even if you went slow that it keeps the metal from kicking up which is what you want so the other thing I like and the reason I got it was for the slip roll now to all dem it and here's how you can adjust your tension or your fitness for whatever material is going through initially now I set them back over there anyway so I'm actually gonna make I thought about it and I'll probably make me a little lever but right now just got an Allen screw right here and I will leave you guys over this side so you can see what I'm talking about okay and I'm leaving you at a white piece you guys get a good look at it so there's actually a little allen screw in here right now alright and again that's one of those things you get tools you always want to see how can I make them better so let's plot a five mill and you just put it in there and literally all you do and there's an area there may have been something that fell out and packaging I don't know I haven't looked at it and I'll probably make something that'll make a little twist knob that goes in there more than likely and that's probably what it's supposed to be to see how that's loose okay alright so what I was doing is you just slide this over and then that allows your piece I had this set let me loosen it there we go and that allows your piece to come out so if you've created a big round item and you can see the little bushings on the ends there there's one there and one there and I was very liberal with and I also put it in the socket well not on that side but over here where the gear side was and you slide it back in and then you just reverse procedure I can get my no one ranch lined up there so yeah I will make it is its threat it on the top here I'll make something that screws into where it's a little knob that's where I can open and close so I'm gonna back you up just a little bit so we got room and I'm just gonna demonstrate now also one other improvement I'm gonna make on the back here the adjustments they've just got double in threaded rods they're both right-hand thread but on the back end all it had was these round plastic knobs and a lock nut you know me with my lathe when I got it one of the first things I did was I made brass handles now I'm not gonna make brass handles but I do have some hacksaw I got some short pieces and so what I'm actually gonna do so it's easier I'm just gonna make some nuts and thread them on and it's metric 10 by 1.5 I'm just gonna make that's what hex talks for just cut off a couple pieces face it off drill it tap it call it good and then I got the lock nuts here so that is gonna be and the knob and what that is that adjusts the height of your roller at the back to determine the amount of curl and it's got RT it's got pre-cut slots here for some different sizes it looks four or five and six mil is what I'm guessing so it is a metric item and you can adjust like okay well that's only bending so far and then you reach back here tighten that down I'll help okay so okay all right well we want it we want to even be more aggressive so we'll give it about a full turn there and you know you just keep working it to get your desired Bend I mean you can make it to where it's into a full circle if you want so if you wanted to really pull this off let's say you were doing some square stock you could easily pull this it comes apart real easily or you could even do it in the top one if you wanted to you know you'd come step over here and create some you know square bottom ones or whatever you know if you wanted to you can make a whole nother say top jaw really easily or a roll or cylinder in here and so like I said for for what this was and I know generally they're they're well over five four and five hundred bucks like I said this one it was it was a phenomenal phenomenal deal it has a cover that was on the top and for me I went ahead and left it off it was just it was a cover to where you could cover this and it looks nice but for me it was just something that was always going to clunk around and be in there and when you open it up it just fell off so I took it off I left it off matter of fact it's already in the recycle bin outside I just don't need it one thing I will say if you're gonna be moved if you have a dedicated spot and you get one of these then on the back here just on these you have this wall ago the little pump stop I am NOT going to leave that on all the time the reason is you've got these two rods that are sticking out I'll show the camera back here a little bit and you guys will see what I'm talking about so you know me and my garage I'm always having to move stuff around so I'm cognizant of that anytime I go to move something so you can see from the back here these sticking out all the time would be a problem so they just thread in really easily so to not have to worry about accidentally breaking them and they've got little flats where you can tighten them in I'm just gonna leave these out and they will be fastened together and they will be in it they'll find a special spot okay and that way you don't have to worry about you know you can see the handles back here where the adjustments are and for everything that's got mouth you know mounting poles got a serial number and a build date this was built in April of 2016 and so that way you know it's got a serial number on it so let's say for instance you know you're one of those people that likes to friend for insurance purposes you know a piece of cereal you know insurance companies will prove you had it what's the serial number of pictures so it's got a serial no that's a good thing you know I would never worry about trying to warranty anything on this cuz you know it was import not a big deal but for me for what I'm doing and the garage guy you want to be able to do like artisan work small stuff man it's you know these are handy and like I said for everything that's that's there it's very cost-effective you can get these at all industrial tool supply they've gotten like I said when I was shopping around and I found that I thought you know what that was just too good of a deal it was a no brainer that's one of those everyone said well you ready to it a really good tool deal right here those are really good tool deals but all industrial hasn't and they're very very well priced trust me they're out there and for pricing contact all industrial talk to them and they'll let you know like I said they are over 70 pounds I believe the shipping weight on this was a hundred and fifteen pounds so it's gonna be a freight item so know that when you if you get one of these and you get it you're gonna need a dolly to move it around or unbox it and disassemble it where it's at and carry piece by piece which is kind of what I did when I had the deal down here I took it apart in the floor down to manageable size pieces and I just reassembling it up here to get it together and once I have it together I'm gonna find a spot and it's going to end up on that side of the garage over there by the bench grinder on the floor for right now but I am gonna have a feller main-floor have a wife make cover that sets over it just like on my I had her make one for mine you got either I've had people ask what's in the big blue container that's actually a square master just like stanczyk offski uses I have one it's a big cover the wife made for it you know my granite plate has a wood cover over it so that stuff sitting on top of my granite plate is actually on a wood cover that's about that far above the granite plate so I'll actually have a cover made like that that'll slip over it that's just a it's marine grade material like for a tarp really great and it'll just sit over and it'll be that way sitting on the floor it's covered up any grinding media or dust or whatever will not get into and mess things up so anyway I hope you guys enjoyed it that's kind of what's been going on I've been busy the last couple of weeks you know I always always say on my channel when I get out here in the garage and do things this is after I've taken care of all my family obligations and taking care of myself I can't stress that enough you know I had a little scare and had to go to the VA actually I was at the VA when it happened long story short I found out I can't do contracts to pay for a CT scan had a bit of a scare and it really I still don't feel really really well I feel like I'm about half throttle and I've talked about on social media on Facebook when I do my facebook live posts but so I'm always doing Facebook live posts at times I'll come out and it's uh you know open anything goes you know you gives you guys the viewers and my friends on Facebook a chance to ask questions and that's why I do those it's another form of just being able to sit on Facebook and being able to have a conversation about stuff like that and different things and it's ly unedited unlike on Facebook here there's a certain level of decorum because everybody out there all age levels so it you know it gives you another chance so if you guys want follow me on Facebook I've got a Facebook page called Eagle dust off 37 that I do and I'll post videos and stuff but mainly it's on my personal page I'll do the live feeds I'm also on Instagram and I'll post videos on Twitter if you guys have any questions my public email address Eagle Dustoff 37-inch email comm thank you for watching I really really appreciate it I noticed I've been picking up a lot of viewers and it's greatly appreciated you guys I love to hear about constructive ideas and things like that positive comments are encouraged I enjoy intelligent conversation click the like button spread the word about my channel and again we'd like to give a big thank you to one of our channel sponsors all industrial tools supply as well as American rotary you guys if you're looking for and you want to get 3-phase equipment like you know Bridgeport mill or a surface grinder or even a big lathe that's the way to go it's a lot less headache than at having a VFD my personal opinion a VFD doesn't you know give you give you warning when it goes out you have to fill around and you got a root wire and refit gear and you actually lose horsepower I learn in the process talking to a contact I'm at American rotary they'll answer your questions and here's the other thing too guys they have a lifetime warranty on their rubbery phase converters you don't call them for more information talk to them there if you have any questions they got all sorts of stuff I'm a real real big fan of it you know I even got a I don't have to walk over there they you know wire remote start so now I can sit here if I want to start my rotary phase converter I don't have walk over there because it's it's cluttered I can just right here and then I can start my mill you know turned off and actually it's not real out at all so give them a call you know they're great people it's an american-made product in Menomonee Falls Wisconsin so anyway you guys gals thanks for watching I really appreciate it the channels growing thank you to the the hardcore viewers that have have supported my channel for the last couple of years it's really really grown and I'm really really humbled by it so I sincere thank you to my viewers and everybody out there in YouTube land and social media thanks for watching you guys I really enjoy doing the videos and I'll I've got a lot of projects on the on

Mexico in United States of America everybody out there and until next time and I truly mean it take care of yourself and take care of your family because remember at the end of the day you your families all you go until next time you guys get out in the shop the garage wherever you're at if all you've got the living room start you know playing with your tools having fun and make something neat we'll talk to you guys later bye bye", "uUOEMe6Ppyg": "welcome back this is the CM 15 DS double-sided plate beveling machine from Bailey industrial this machine has a bevel capacity of five eighths inch or 15 millimeters there's an adjustment over here for the degree which can go from 15 degrees up to 50 degrees here we have a plate thickness adjustment the thickness can be between a quarter inch up to one in five eighths or six millimeters up to forty millimeters talking about the motor and say 220 three-phase motor it's a two horsepower one point five kilowatt industrial grade system that actually feeds a direct drive gearbox the direct drive gearbox is tied to this blade and an idler role now this blade is similar to a can opener so it's actually going to peel the metal off at speeds up to eleven and a half feet or three and a half meters a minute now let's take a look at this machine in operation okay now I've dismounted the machine from the 3d manipulator it's got handles on both sides of the machine so two people could pick it up and put it on to a piece of plate it's also got real nice bracketry here which is extremely heavy and that's for bench mounting the machine so now let's show you how easy it is to hook it up to the 3d manipulator simply push the manipulator in it's got some guided posts I'll just bring it in slide it in place turn these brackets it'll lock it in and then I'm gonna just start cranking I'm gonna bring this up to a bench height all right here we are up at plate height so that is one of your accesses another axis that we would have is for squaring up the machine to the plate third axis one of the biggest complaints in the industry is do I have to flip my my plate to bevel the other side but with this 3d manipulator you simply have to turn the machine and voila you're able to champ for a bevel on the other side put it back to the other position here you go so this is the Bailey industrial CM 15 DS double-sided plate beveling machine to find out more about this great product or any of our other products go to WWE you", "DKifg7_yMc0": "in this video I'd like to demonstrate how to cut a hole in an airfoil skin in your f whale skin using a router bit the router bit it's just a rake looks like a regular drill bit but it actually cuts has these flutes which are tapered down to cut out cut a hole I'm gonna be using this high speed grinder here you're gonna be you could be using your high speed drill bit here but for my purposes for demonstration I'm just going to use this one because it has a side exhaust the hole that you will be cutting in your airfoil skin can be located by using centre lines on the airfoil skin to locate the work to be and then place your doubler on to the airfoil skin and line it up the center lines and then transfer the hole that you've already made in your doubler onto your airfoil skin remember it's important when you're using a router bit or any cutting tools power cutting tools that you remove all the protective plastic and masking tape from the area where you're gonna work that glue and that will just gums up the tool so it's important that you don't come up your tool let me grab the airline plug in my cutting tool you notice I've got my safety glasses on I'm wearing hearing protection very important you might also want to wear a full face shield it's a good idea because of the amount of swarf that the cutting action produces now this one here it's meant for late lumen 'm it's operates just like a drill so you can start anywhere I suggest you start somewhere in the middle and pull the trigger make a hole now when you're operating this tool here you'll want to make sure you have a firm grip on it even put your your arms onto the table some ways support the tool remaining very you have to very steady and very firm pressure you can do a lot of damage with this tool so it's important that you have it under control at all times good opportunities to practice in the middle of the cut out to get confident and I'm going to try and go forward along this red line and then I'll come back down along the red lines just trying to keep the cutting action nice and straight you'll want to lean the tool slightly in the direction that you're traveling and if you do have a slight up-and-down reciprocating motion to it that would be even great if you don't want to do that that's fine but the upward and downward reciprocating motion will help keep the flutes from getting too bird up the other thing is that the trigger is pulled wide open at all times so it makes a lot of noise and a lot of swarf is going to be flying and just stay in control [Music] so there I've done a little initial cut feeling the force of the tool how it wants to drag in one out in one direction and I was able to keep it nice and straight and along the line so I have confidence now that I can approach the blue line and cut out my shape I obviously would not want to cross the blue line but just come up to it and leave a little bit for filing for later so I'm just going to demonstrate the advantages of this tool because being able to cut Masons and sharp corners and everything [Music] that's all there is to cutting with this tool you can see I did slip out the tool and two spots here to demonstrate what could happen to you if you let it get out too far and that's typically what happens creating a lot of damage so keeping it down nice and deep is a very important the reciprocating action if you start cutting near the tip you run the risk of doing what I just did here for demonstration purposes is putting marks on your skin and that's all there is to it remember hold it firmly keep it in control at all times and a little bit of practice and that's all there is to using the router bit", "kIuxX2jg45Q": "so we're topple down and straight waiting in line straight lady girl I think about her in the a kiss idea maybe to mana cheese burrito you know

stick piece of trim board or something we used it several times before 15:8 in circles I went out seven and a half inches a little Center punch here and I got my pencil here and I'll run my pencil tie work down so the pencil line will get wider and I just put a little Center punch mark my chest to see I could have been a little closer to this edge but rather waste a little medal and be too far out here so that's how I make a circle you can always go back over it you could always drill this to fit a sharpie marker or something magic marker so I just keep going my pencil tie work now I keep my pencil sharpened so it's kind of a stubby it's kind of a stubby little point on it so you don't break the lid there you go and I'll show how I make my 8 sides like a stop sign so when I chop it and then it actually cut it 16 times because I'll make other little chops but I'll show and I get it all sharp II doubt if I don't look for pictures of it when I have the marks on there ready to cut oK we've got four and a half inch grinder safety goggles gloves I want to show this for I'm getting ready to cut my square out first cut a pass in here so that pretty deep you don't have to go half way but cut up half in here all the way across so your cutter blade can follow and it will cut faster it's better to spend more time cutting this groove which might seem slow but when you cut through quarter-inch thick I want to be at least a third of the way through it will cut easier your blade has something to follow next we'll go down this direction so you get the idea but make your path in there wear your goggles wear long sleeves because your grinder I know safety things you don't have the guard off that Harbor Freight has a little trim thing that fits on grinders little metal thing I have not tried it wear safety goggles long sleeves I have a heavy sweatshirt on it has saved me I've never had one of these shattered unless it's gotten caught and I've been lucky a couple times the pole to switch off because it was found in a piece of metal but it's all at your own risk you can see that is in there little ways okay on with the show that way you know how I've cut this out make your grooves first then when I'm done I will come across here which would make my eights I'd save these they make great gussets if you use your square and did pretty good these will be good enough justice for a project these triangles so this metal will not go to waste this will make nice gussets if you have to embrace something someday so these will go into my little scrap bucket and be used even if they're not exact size you can all he's grinding them down and make them in exact size I recut them so this is not waste this is usable material so let's show that yeah four nice little triangle left over okay get back to work get this cut into a square then we'll cut it eight sides then we'll actually cutting this is what it would be sixteen sides when we mark this and cut it we want to get it eight first mark these with our marker and cut this off before we start grinding the circle for staying away from this because we're going to be pretty aggressive with the grinder we want this as perfect as we get it so we're staying away from it okay here we go you", "jTj8JVWDV6Q": "hi Santa Costa Mesa R&D today I wanted to share a little tip with you on making a torque plate a lot of people use a hole saw to get most of material out and it's a lot easier than doing a whole bunch of holes in here having chips go everywhere the trick is to do a hole like this so that your chips have some place to go and we want to show you how this is done I've already drilled a hole on this last piece of where to cut just to show you how this is done once you get your hole saw centered you can go ahead and go it out we use a little kidding oil on here without the whole but have these chips all trying to pack up in here I've made a real mess and that's all there is to it now

"V5NaiAjl8hk": "welcome back world tube family we're down here on the set of weld tube we've got a special friend peter zilla from zilla industrial repairs we're going to have a go at pulsed and double pulse mig on plate and pipe with aluminium so this here is a propulse 300 with a water cooled gun with a water cooler the machine has a all four rolls for aluminum geared feeder they all they all drive there's grooves in every roller so there's eight contact points all eight are driven we're running a 4043 wire 1.2 millimeter 364 diameter and the water cooled gun is good for 500 amps 100 duty cycle so here is a part of a menu list it shows different wires black stainless the purple is aluminum 40 43 364 100 argon pulse here is a symbol for double pulse manual so the machine has some hot start options crater fill options here's a wire speed rate material thickness and this is like a trim function of arc length and clay and i agreed on a manual double pulse setting and although there's pretty elaborate and sophisticated hot start options you can actually pick the hot start time through a timer or trigger control and you can also pick your hot start intensity and crater fill parameters but instead of going through all this programming and committing to numbers before we do this all we're going to do is install a remote control on this gun and this way we can make our own hot start our own crater fill and adjust our settings on the fly as we go by the looks of the puddle uh it's a 14-pin enthanol kind of like a miller yeah but the potentiometer is a 10k and the pin out is different than the millers so in the way how you do this is you see it's the r for remote control is on and you do much like a tig machine you set this all the way up and now you set your maximum that you want on your panel and then the remote will go from whatever the minimum of that program is to the maximum if you want less of a maximum because you want thinner material you dial this down and then it will go from whatever that maximum is to the minimum i've always thought about putting one on a a stinger but never a mig mig torch what um what machine do you run what engine drive do you're on just the big blue 400 it's not a problem you get a 1k you get a 1k slider with a 14 pin you just plug it in yeah it'll work it'll work um i did one with a 10k for like a lincoln ranger or vantage i could just make you one for uh um for a miller so we've got some quarter inch coupons five inches long here we're going to do some t fillets maybe a double pulse on one side single pulse the other but all manual settings okay so peter will run through that with [Music] us yeah yeah that's candy yeah that's handy huh [Music] started getting a bit squirrely and you heard yeah you heard the you heard the background just a smidge correctly yeah but i'm not gonna raise the arc voltage anymore that was a function of this being an ice cold piece of aluminum now that the heat that it's warm when you weld the other side there's going to be no crackling on the background okay stop back at full yeah not quite full like right about 400 yeah right about there so now arc shot [Music] looks good i like that it's that controllable and you see how the background wasn't correctly nah that's all heat driven we didn't preheat the part and on the front side it came to bite us on the back side where we preheated by welding the other side our settings were spot on that's we're there that slide control is invaluable you can just especially as it heats up along you're going to want to drop your hands but you don't want to stop yes especially if you have an area of poor fit up where with a spool gun you're just gouging the walls of that hole or that gap you have and with this you can dial it down enough to fill it real nice sputter it in yeah all right so now we're turning double pulse off so now it's single pulse only single post single pulse is a little bit harder so instead of starting at 440 i probably start at 400 on the front and then start at like 375 on the back or so uh [Music] action a little bit sooner yep and go a little bit lower and hold it there it tilts it nicer i mean it's yeah hoses and then try to do a arc shot on that one shot yeah yeah that's good i think i like the single single pole the single pulse is more controllable yeah especially if you want pipe yeah the double pulse just looks nicer yeah and also the double pulse if you have large thin sheets that you don't want to put too much heat in for warpage the double pulse is cooler than the single pulse so you have less workage and distortion yeah you get that double pulse function yes you get the double pulse function of less heat input", "fci0w8kvaTg": "[Music]", "b0T_RgbP_mE":
