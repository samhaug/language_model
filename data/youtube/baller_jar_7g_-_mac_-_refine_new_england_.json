said i don't buy their products often and it's not because of the quality it's strictly because of the price and i'm a boy on a budget so it is what it is but when you can get it for the right price hundred percent worth it at all cost every time i get their sand whenever i can usually however this time i did pass up the sand because i bought this that's how much i wanted to try this stuff and as good as it is i'm so glad i got three and a half great jar oh yeah it's not very often i can truly stock up so i'm grateful it's so smooth it's truly a unique flavor i don't even know how to really describe it to be honest with you i just really like it it's sweet without being overpowering it's not so mildest to be unnoticeable but not so strong is to be just crazy in your face nice happy medium for flavor very smooth no throat burn not really any tickle i do enjoy that i'm already getting a nice buzz going to dab in and i'm i'm happy now to be fair i did vape a bowl of flour before i did this but that's it that doesn't really affect me like dabs do i don't do flour that often so it's definitely the jesus og kicking in which is sweet i'm glad i did it worth every penny so with that said thank you very much for tuning in for watching i appreciate all the support i've been getting all the feedback it's been awesome uh instagram facebook all of it i hate facebook so i don't get on

and hang out it's just got done prepping for another hash wash damn it getting cold in here too because of that I might have to go grab my jacket but um yeah got the AC cranked to 62 degrees that the ice-cold water in the reservoir I've got a bag of ice for the washer and I've got six more bags ice out in the freezer I need to get a bigger freezer and all the materials well so later tonight after I get the kids down spend some time with the wife I'm gonna come back out here and knock out that bubble hash run uninterrupted probably gonna do somewhere between six to eight runs on it depending on how it looks and how everything is coming out [Music] anyways let's go ahead and get a - go in here I hope you guys are having a good day [Music] that was not clickbait by the way for those of you this joint this is a 104 grant or 100 Ford's a hundred grams now mixed strain hash frothing some cookies some sweet cream some zukie and what else sweet cream cookie sweet cream zoo keys and orange cookies that's what it is [Music] sorry I had someone from work pop-up I don't look out real quick [Music] all right cool [Music] anyways let's go ahead oh it's so good yeah I need to go ahead and fill up a little bit char with that [Music] this was some 60 micron parabola for edibles [Music] this one still has a cush cake in it and this one has on a fish cake so those that's my head - cooks cake in a jar [Music] earth is [ __ ] cold and her alright so I would like you yet in my day did you imagine dabbing that whole thing just like here we feel [ __ ] half the Banger ease and the easily I wouldn't even try it it'd be a waste and a half that's good enough for me enjoy that for the week [Music] the 160 press was man very little in there so that's what that looks like when I end up putting it in the jar and then a lot of people would ask me how did you get that [ __ ] rossington to stick to the bottom of the jar look so neat [Music] here's I take the glove and you're just going to push it down around the edges towards the center you're doing a cold room that's good rosin a clean glove and just like that now it looks like that [Music] with that's hard to see but yeah that's how that comes out when you end up doing that push it down it comes out real nice and clean looking perfect for grams or so it's upload a bird [Music] all right so I gotta move my dad station over now I'm not pressing it back over here well I like it Kiyo is : grab yeah you can do with parchment - I have a little bit more control with the glove I feel like and it rarely gets sticky but parchment works to a more sticky stuff I will use parchment I'm gonna go grab a hoodie real quick [Music] [Music] whoa [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] whoo my tears my eyes [Music] Oh [Music] oh man the big dads always get my nose my eyes [Music] Oh [Music] about three days away from the harvest yeah we're on day 54 honestly I think I could pull them down tomorrow or the next day I want it probably gonna go ahead and harvest them on Monday [Music] today's Thursday tomorrow's Friday yep I'm go ahead and harvest them on Monday [Music] five six out of the gate 58 [Music] [Music] I got some pictures of the plants I haven't even posted to Instagram yet pausing to share them with you guys real quick [Music] [Music] turn down the lights already this whole side is just [ __ ] Mileena should be up here these ones dried back a little bit too much almost too much but not too two months still prosti of [ __ ] 12 cars black out there my Spade going over there [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so that's the current status in the Guardian you know just like oh my flesh for usually you're about seven days it's that but you know [Music] I had issues this run just like Ross Leafs his issues because he's in cocoa they're harder to detect early and so he faced the consequences of the buffering that cal-mag provides in coma cocoa I wasn't in at nursery iam so I was able to turn my issues around a little bit faster but you know basically what I'm saying is you know I had issues this run and the crop is still coming out pretty good so next run you know those issues will be corrected I'll make a video covering the issues that I ran into this grow and how I plan to correct them and I'll throw it up on the patreon hopefully you guys can learn from some of my mistakes you know I talked about on the show doing your own research and shape one of the things I researched if I should have used top-down broward rivers and when I talked to mango tech Abadi he told me to use two gallons per hours to avoid clog and that's what each use is but then I ended up getting water channeling that is too fast on the float and I cost a lot of issues I never really fed high enough of an ECE to have the easy build up nor did I ever push the plants that hard to cause them to have any lockouts it was all because my irrigation was wrong from the get-go with the water swim [Music] are you taking off right now that's one of the changes I'm implementing is not only am I going to get rid of the 2 gallon per hour but I'm going to go all the way down to like a point 3 gallon per hour dripper that could eat drawstring and stuff up here so yeah that'll fix a lot of issues right off to that that I believe uh Charles and pastor [Music] that Daffy got me hired balls rolling in on me now [Music] oh my bad I look here looking up and showers my phone [Music] there's no broad my issues going on in here all it is is either a they were different cuts or they were microclimates right he talked about the water channeling so you know phosphorus deficiency can learn to purpling stems and the plants that express themselves differently also has purple stems where I was the ones that didn't have the red bugs didn't have purple stems so I think it was more of a microclimate issue water channeling issue causing different uptake different nutrients and it just got exacerbated due to the lockout because of the water channeling so next one I'm doing is with wedding cake and I should be getting those clones in about two weeks so I have about two weeks to prep get the plants chopped harvested and everything I'll flip them right in the room that they're in right now I'm basically going to push the tables to one side of the room and then I'll go in and use a light rail for this up against the wall and I'll cut down on the one plant out of time and hang it on a trellis hanging from the ceiling and then I'll just hang all the plants from one light all right [Music] when my moustache hairs on the know it wouldn't happen I got trim my mustache geez so yeah basically just go one light at a time right down hole lights worth of plants hang them go to the next one cut those down hang out on a different trailer that's there the next one so I'll have three trellis nets hanging on the side of the room I'll have to retry this netting on that side of the room so after I cut down the whole left side of the room and those plants are hanging up there on that left side I'm going to disassemble the tables and walk them out of the room and then I can push that whole other table completely over to the middle of the room hang up all those buttons on the back side of the room or wherever in the room right and then basically I'll be good to go I'll get everything hung I'll turn off the shaker fan I'll just keep one of them on probably maybe turn it down to low or something and I'll just have to DEET you and AC going in there I'll be able to scrub down the you the four by twelve that's in there now scrub it down and get it reset and start making my adjustments to the room while I wait on my new 4 by 12 American Girl products they're probably they told me it was going to be issued early June like June 8th or 6 but they might be able to get it in sooner so I mean worst case scenario the room will be down for about three weeks while I wait on the new table but I'll just match all the plants on one table while I'm doing that perfect and then when I get my new table in I'll be able to go ahead and transition the plants over throw up my trellis mats and pretty much switch so you know that's the plan and like I said I'll document all the changes to the room it said of everything that I'd be like want to document the changes and yeah my keeper fee no cuts from honest genetics should be here in the next two to three weeks and solved a whole room full of wedding cake in there veg and flour that while I have a child my keeper he knows from our genetics and my new keeper you know caked up cherries wedding cake crossed with cherry something f3 I'm going to do the three-tiered setup but I'm waiting on him to send me the updated invoice for the new poles and as soon as I get those I'll be able to set it up and I'll have pretty much what I was thinking of doing them what happened to rekey poofy nose and I could basically put all of them on their own tier if I wanted and then have clones next to it or I could just put all the moms on one and then since I'm doing two tables at a time I'll just pick you know I'll have two tiers for clothes you know cherry cookies have three thank you thank you thank you I never remember like my keeper he knows from honest I don't remember what I was are either blue hurricane 27 crossed with white sunrise for the blue lion keeper and then scarlet sure is chocolate frosting crossed with something I think [Music] I trust my man on his genetics he tells me yo this is a [ __ ] you should run for a hash let's fire fire fire legs all right now you got it [Music] like I remembered it enough to purchase it and you know that's all that matters now that's all that matters now I need to show up in the garden [Music] so stoked I have I'll have the blue Hawaiian which is gonna have exotic super crazy unique blue Terps it's gonna be highly sativa dominant as far as the high goes and then the truck not the truck cherry but the cakes of cherries that's gonna be my cherry Fino right there so I'll have a blue of a cherry and then I have the gassy out of scarlet shirt so it's gonna be dope [Music] this is real the kind of light that I use for clowns are right behind either the raging raging kales and I actually got sponsored by science LED yeah so I will be getting now raging candle LEDs probably twice a year during two biggest ways that I do and it couldn't be [ __ ] dope it can really know and then every other month or so I'll be giving away a bunch of science LED swag hats ashtrays shirts things like that all be put on there grower spotlight on their homepage pretty shortly here I have some pictures that I have to take for them and type up some some information and what else asked me to leave to help them do research spectrum tuning and hash production so I'll be doing that so and then also the big thing I'll be an authorized reseller for their lights on my webpage as soon as it's up in a few days so as soon as the page is up I'm going to try and get them on there and I'll be able to resell a life through my page so that way you know they don't do they don't do coupon codes like people in the industry you got to use to coupon codes because of for flex and all that but what that does is it makes it so that you can't sell that product in brick-and-mortar stores anymore and in the hydro industry almost need brick-and-mortar stores still surprisingly to you know expand and survive because still a big commercial facilities go through these hydro stores and you know direct to these manufacturers a lot so they don't do coupon codes they're like let's say they offer a 10% discount code here in California right and somebody purchases a light from you know from me and using my promo code but they're in Oregon or something and or somewhere else where they maybe don't charge sales tax and now not only are they getting the 10% off but they're also getting like seven or eight maybe taking even up to 10% off of that because of no sales tax right whereas if they were to purchase it in the store you know the store would be able to make a profit but in order to compete with that price that they would get you know from using the coupon code the brick-and-mortar store would basically have to not turn a profit so it doesn't work out for them to be able to give people who coupon codes stacked as representatives of the brand so instead I'll be able to be a reseller and then just a very very small portion of the profit that they would make from that light will go towards me instead so I'll be an authorized reseller and then basically helping do research and you know passing that information you guys like I have been this whole time so anyways this is what we're working with they bought this is delicious delicious it's called cookie dough and it's amazing [Music] I don't suspect this is gonna last long you won't need a code to let them know who sent you because you're gonna go through my website to purchase they're working on other programs like referral codes and things like that but [Music] yeah I guess I should keep this on camera so people don't think that I'm like lying and I say I got a grandfather drive here we did well today it's real I wouldn't had a couple more but honestly you guys want to get jars of the grape Cosby and literally all I have left of this [Music] that's it but in this drawer it's maybe maybe seven grams six seven grams of the grape Cosby I think the other jars been scraped empty already yeah scraped empty great cause be gone on that one and then the hell a Koosh cake [Music] there's like maybe two to three grams to scrape out of here [Music] and this one I think is scraped completely empty yeah there's maybe like point two in here it's empty so there was 70 72 grams of the La Push cake and 60 grams of the Cosby [Music] but every time you come in here you [ __ ] promotin be real oh no no no who was it last time it wasn't beaver oh it was your boy the other one that's not good Bernhard that's who it was last time [Music] about your ass sorry yo for real alright here's the funny story that's how you guys are quick so the reason this one got called rape Cosby because [Music] my wife and I dabbed it and she got so [ __ ] high off of it it was like she got roofied like straight roofie I could have done anything I wanted to so I was like mother kali shake great cosby it tastes like grapes and knocks you the [ __ ] out like you did this it was between grape Cosby and roofie colada you know think of work 12 but you guys got to make sure you do it right [Music] it's great cause be like that lowercase G Capital are [Music] all right let's get [Music] a little credit given to me I need a label hood [Music] it's not for grams but whatever [Music] you know [Music] so we're gonna get some cookie dough on there a menace [Music] they push tape on there [Music] [Music] [Music] me up a man popular science [Music] my episode 5 right there alone [Music] [Music] there was a five [Music] [ __ ] bones knock out maybe this is episode [Music] all right hold on okay [Music] but right now it is [Music] but few days that idiot that ain't the one all right well [ __ ] it I'll get it uploaded I was trying to do it right now but I'm having a little bit of a hard time finding a you write for [Music] oh here it is [Music] [Music] that's not it either I have like a lot of different files in here that I have to go through [Music] that's three lighting maybe this is the right here number four [Music] okay yeah here it is and as this little my everybody [Music] alright I'll go ahead and get this uploaded to YouTube right you know [Music] I'm kind of done editing these I'm just gonna start uploading the RAW files and if people don't like it they can kiss my ass I don't have time to edit them together anymore that's why I put the PowerPoint how I did you know if I do the PowerPoint I don't have to worry about putting an intro and all that into the video it's just boom okay boss [Music] alright crap dude my science for plant nutrition are a cool description I'll edit that later now don't care playlist crafted science done no it's not made for kids don't have to restrict [Music] monetization please do [Music] public [Music] boom what is instant premiere oh [ __ ] we could watch it together at the same [ __ ] time let's [ __ ] do that right now I did not know we could do that that is really cool we can watch the video together yeah three minutes five all right it's 321 I'm gonna go in at 3:45 and help the wife for the day because that's the way it is [Music] I find on finishing of the loose jars oh that's the one section of illustrator [Music] this is it makes a great Cosby and Kush cake [Music] I don't know what I did mother two minutes [Music] okay a little poison for 30 minutes okay no accident since a wait okay I'll be in by say like 3:45 okay okay [Music] 59 seconds left [Music] very good dogs very good slowly giving them a little bit more freedom and hoping that they don't [ __ ] pee anywhere [Music] green jeans with Superdome [Music] Greenjeans was sooo Oberto 11 seconds 8 seconds that's called your video will premiere what's uploading and processing finished as well as the hundred percent uploaded is 95 percent process I have no idea how this is going to look for you guys I don't know how this works I've never done this before it is [ __ ] top-down so we're gonna check it out oh my god dollars people my DM right now [Music] all right you guys let me know what happens on your end when this is done hopefully I mean it doesn't take forever right now it's an remember you two processes videos one definition at a time so the low definition stuff is going to process and then like for whatever and then 720 and 1080 [Music] my phone right now it's just doing the load F [ __ ] the standard definition version we'll see whatever the [ __ ] back [Music] I'm really curious to see what this does though man that was such a good [ __ ] good [ __ ] episode and then episode 5 I'm glad we took a break because we were really [ __ ] burned out both of us and we needed a skip a week we came back and we didn't even have a PowerPoint or anything but it was still an amazing discussion Garrett jumped online from science at levy and he just [ __ ] to talk about what we wanted to talk about which was great just you know [Music] we just talked about troubleshooting it was [ __ ] awesome you know he get his perspective on things like walking into like a huge commercial facility and how you would troubleshoot their [ __ ] to figure out what's going on why certain part of the crop might not be doing its good versus another part things like that so it was really cool to get his perspective because you know as far as lost leaf goes he's a commercial facility but he's a one-man army and it's a small commercial facility it's the size of a house basically a one-story house and so and that's that's no diss whatsoever [ __ ] it's amazing what he's doing I wish I could be at his level but in the realm of commercial grows it's relatively small so you know his perspective is one and then Maya the home grower is another and then Gary brings a whole different perspective being that he's kind of more on the large large scale commercial and so it was really cool you know and go with it so unfortunately during this whole Cove 8:19 thing all of the HD recordings for webinars are being limited and only being allowed standard definition so this is not going to be best of qualities for the uploads that are going on right now from the webinars and there's nothing that we can do about that so you know [Music] check it on the patreon real quick make sure you guys got your post real quick [Music] are you guys waiting on me to take another dab is that what's going on [Music] I guess [Music] it's not what you guys I feel like a little [ __ ] a dab [ __ ] for you guys it's all you guys wanna take your dad show me his plan it's never hey SB Andy how's your day go what'd you do today need some help no I'm just [ __ ] one shot I already forgot what this one is again that's the coach tasted positive and he's more paper towels real quick cuz my house got so high I forgot to clean the [ __ ] banger after the last job that's [ __ ] I I guess I Cosby myself whoever said don't cause be yourself I can't be myself go clean it out real easy paper towels to clean [Laughter] [Music] yeah all of the rapidly science episodes go on patreon pretty much the same day or minimum a week earlier than YouTube a minimum and Matt doesn't post on lost leaf as a poster or anything like that out of respect for my patreon supporters he knows he waits again he's a week two to three weeks even suppose I mean it's not that I don't want the information out there for everybody but I wanted to I want to give some [ __ ] love to the people on patreon and economic access all that and they can pick my brain talk about it on live sessions or whatever brain different [ __ ] you know [Music] all right the tip of my II now is 395 and I need to grab another roll of paper towels real quick [Music] [Music] damn [ __ ] oh yeah [Music] oh [ __ ] [Music] in the filter [Music] oh Jesus son 525 that is a very very high [ __ ] gasps Jesus [Music] [Music] so the reclaim catcher works by basically a when you draw on the dab it gets stuck down here because all that reclaimed can't travel back up pretty much so what you end up with really is just tiny tiny pieces of the vapor that condensed back to rosin in here versus a shit-ton of replaying and if you have a really good deep-dish banger and you do low temp doubts your your reclaim actually can look really nice how well that looks but [Music] seeing us a thing FPV not everybody's email setup is the same not all coils are created equal so you got to get you know a good coil setup with

up i think tomorrow i think we got another storm front coming in tomorrow so if you haven't gotten to the dispensary yet oh my god look how look at the nice the size of these buds look at this this is not the popcorn we've been used to seeing from a lot of dispensaries lately uh now granted they sometimes sell it cheaper but you know what nothing presses as well as these nice juicy buds they've been rehydrated with hydra stones for two hours so they are ready to go um the smell of this stuff is absolutely intoxicated just by itself uh gg4 is a strain everybody seems to know and love i don't know too many people that have told me hey man i really hate gg4 so this is gonna be fun to press oh okay let's get this nice and put in here make sure you can kind of see what's going on all right we're going to cut the excess off the bag grab some parchment [Music] oh yeah super it might be it might be i did find out with this newer press that you really have to [Music] uh have to put a lot of layers in here because this stuff will seep through at the kind of tonnage you're putting on it now it's got to make kind of a directional pouch here to make sure everything stays inside where you want it to be all right get this in here fold up our bag and put it in the middle of our little pouch right here that summer's right there thing is it isn't going to look real pretty on video because when these plates really close down we're going to lose everything on the video but wait do you see what it looks like when it comes apart again it should be super cool i'm going to move the camera a little bit i'll stay stay where you are give you guys a real good view of what's going on here has some happy trees here in a minute all right bring it right up here [Music] turning green to gold that's what we do here at astr's finest closed not available okay here we go and we're bringing the hammer down see what this stuff does so might be able to get us a little better view here here we go [Music] let's get this camera adjusted here for you a little tighter [Music] there we go [Music] i like that heat soaked in there as i bring up that pressure gently i'm looking for that seepage to start really quick because this is a really nice strain a lot of people are pressed gg4 pressing this at last time i pressed gg4 i pressed it at 200. let's see what it does this time i think it's gonna be [Music] beautiful oh yeah out of love gotta love that smell okay okay relax everything [Music] i like using the phone as a monitor because i can get it real closely until i hit a certain point this is right around the point where you're gonna stop seeing a lot of stuff on the video watch this [Music] just keep bringing the pressure nice and slow and nothing will start to move oh god yeah let's see anything [Music] so [Music] so here that is the sweet spot this might not be the most exciting part of this video but you're really going to love what you see coming off of this thing in a minute i can guarantee you that sure all right big shout out to my friends over at rise of monroeville my family up there hope you guys see this video this is the fire that was purchased at your dispensary today check it out we're gonna open this up here in about 30 more seconds and we're going to see what she's doing oh come on show me what i want to see show me that gold [Music] show [Music] okay oh [Music] what happened all right i'm gonna pull this camera out like ouch back over here all right like opening up a present on christmas day look at that isn't that beautiful [Music] oh look at that looks beautiful yeah it's a happy plant there was no overpressure no blowout came out perfect nice and different so if you want to see it okay do this in two stages i'm gonna grab a slick and deposit it all on here so i can squish it out and show everybody how pretty it is and then we'll put it into a jar we'll weigh it up for you to see what the yield is good nice brand new slick [Music] and make sure there's no cap air which is a hazard in this place all right skip tool my brand of choice when it comes to this type of thing i really like the way they work okay here we go oh look at that look at that consistency so glad i did this at 180. at 200 i think this is shattered up i really do oh [Music] beautiful day this fills the room that beautiful stuff yes sir high quality thc tell me you seen the water boy oh yeah [Music] [Music] just [Music] dude colors color is awesome color is completely what you want to be seeing that beautiful pastel [Music] well you're dealing with a variable plant you know it's different every every batch is a little different every pheno is definitely different you know so you can automate things to a certain degree but it still really takes somebody who knows what they're doing watching what's going on you know if i dress that stuff on there another minute and a half it would have probably shattered up you know that's what i mean it's just a matter of doing it doing it doing it until you kind of do it by instinct on this you know i i don't really like using gauges and stuff like that but uh do you find that maybe indicators produce a little more than sativa they do they do they do yeah as a general rule now the exception to that rule african tie i knew it and and malawi memory loss also for the crime those those are two straight indica or straight sativas that produce and behave like indicas on a press i've never seen anything else like um banana kush from from rhythm is another one that's really really nice and oppressed brownie scalp birthday cake great divide all of those excellent yeah you should check out my database i got a link to it that you know you can it changes as i add new data like when i add this it'll update right now so everybody who has a link can view it you can't change anything on it you can look at it it's only like my fifth dispensary flower press this year well the thing is dude you bring what you need for you you know this is about you i mean i love making it for you but this is about what strain works for you right i think i'm a little snobbish when it comes to me only because this is what i do all the time i don't try to press a lot of stuff under 25 percent for me but for patients hey that's your medicine man i'm going to try to get you the very best of what it will give but when you get below you know 25 the yields start to drop significantly so but this this is really really nice just came up very very nice and here missina is not happy to be excluded from the festivities she is a she wants that hey she wants what she wants when she wants it and that's just how it is with the caliper no she does she's she likes she likes to smelly sticks her nose in my raws and every time every time she gets the chance she gets man oh absolutely well here's the other thing too okay you know look i know you're not supposed to smoke it but most people who who who do flower they they smoke right so you take an eighth home that you just spent 65 bucks on or 60 and you're gonna get if you're lucky three joints or maybe two once out of that eighth okay that to me is half a day's worth of medication at most at most you take that same eight you press it the rosin press and get anywhere near a grammar rosin from it and grandma rosin medicates me to the same level three solid days that's why i do this because you save money and get better medicine because this is nug run not trim this is solventless in its purest form right off right off the plant right into rosin no intermediate work needs to be done single stage to medicine so let's get this kind of gathered up okay i'm gonna try to get this all together there we go now it's gripping oh it's broken now there this is mighty fine medicine okay what i'm gonna do is backlight it so you can really see how nice this really is look at that look how clean that is that is beautiful gg4 gti let's find out what our yield is now shall we because that's what a lot of people are waiting to see what did we get so started off 10.5 let's see what 10.5 turned into okay zeroed out get her in the jar oh 1.573 i'll take it any day thanks for joining me for this video stay safe stay medicated and be good to each other asher's finest on the case", "c9p8j4tiK0Q": "[Music] hey everyone eric here from peer pressure it has been a while since we've gotten a chance to do solventless review really excited to sit down with pyramid today and review their pineapple chunk live rosin pax pod it is great as a quick disclaimer as a part of our protocols we check everyone's temperature and do contact tracing so this interview was conducted without masks just wanted to explain that we're trying to keep everything above board so it's nice and safe for these interviews all right watch on thanks for joining us today i had the pleasure of reviewing pyramids pineapple chunk hybrid solventless rosin pod these pods are 100 hash rosin which makes the flavor profile and effect vastly superior to other ones out there that i've gotten to try the pineapple chunk is a really nice hybrid very middle of the road effect wise and you would expect it to be pretty fruity but in this case we found that it was really hashy when i was smoking it it really reminded me of some old-school bubble hash that we used to put on bolt hoppers so one of the coolest things about these pyramid pods is that they're actually taking advantage of paxpod's smartpod technology which means that when you connect it with the app on your phone it's going to tell you all kinds of cool things about the strain but that it's also got pre-loaded temperature settings right onto it so if you take a small rip it's going to run at a very low temperature preserving your terpenes or if you really want to go for it it can also ramp the temperature up so you can blow a huge cloud overall this technology is really really cool so the color is really nice the effect is not going to put you to sleep it's not going to get you up and excited it's a nice mid-time day high that you can kind of just ride out wherever you're going and like i said before the pineapple notes are pretty minimal what you're really getting in this card or at least what i found was a lovely hashy kind of sweet flavor that came through and just boosted my day it's a nice break from whatever's going on in your day at that moment and it's really easy to consume with these packs of vaporizers eric here with peer pressure really excited to have pyramid on the show we're going to do some intros and then start talking about hash canvas processing everything and then we'll start talking about these products so let's start off with jake tell us a little bit about yourself hey eric thanks for having us today um yeah my name is jake berry i started pyramid with my business partner coley walsh about six years ago now um i moved out here originally from texas after graduating from college and i um started off as a button in the industry um that was my first gig here and i quickly realized that you know what i really want to move into the extraction side of things and we i really saw a niche there that i feel i felt like we could kind of build a brand around now um at that point vape pens were really just getting started and it quickly became one of my favorite ways to smoke as a blood tender and i just saw the growth happening and you know coley was actually my boss at the dispensary and you know talking to him i was like hey why don't we why don't we look into this why don't we why don't we do this you know i feel like i can find the funding for us to do this and get this up and going yeah and um so we did we started looking around for different licenses and back then i mean it was nightmarish to find a new thing um you know to get into the industry was very difficult and [Music] just googling and going through different municipalities web pages i found the city of we ridge it was the second city i called um and asked them about it and it turns out they were having a lottery within 30 days so um it had just been announced and like happenstance it happened to stumble upon it started applying for and doing the application i had never done something like this in my life um and kind of had to quickly figure things out at that point cole and i were both still working at the dispensary while trying to do all this on our days off finished the app got it in and happened to win the lottery and here you are and here we are now that's incredible uh and matt tell us a little bit about yourself uh what got you in the industry and what do you do at pyramid i'm matt cease i'm the lab manager at pyramid i've been there for about a year and a half now i got my start out in the garage my cousin was growing and he just needed somebody to do some extractions unfortunately butane none of that was like an option so it was all just bubble hash and rosin started with a hair straightener and five gallon bubble bags and it's just grown from there wow cool so in your role as the lab manager at pyramid what kinds of extraction and processes do you oversee now supercritical co2 okay all the ethanol post extraction the winterization distillation we run white film and also overseeing all the solvents cool okay and you guys are mainly focused on bubble hash and rosin you guys do any sift we don't do any sift unfortunately we tried to do sift in the beginning but all of our product just kind of came out dark okay so not the way you guys wanted the route we wanted to go okay cool so jake you started as a bud tender now you're running your own company with coley does it look like being the ceo of pyramid put us in your shoes running a cannabis company what does that look like um you know i think a lot of people think it's this super glamorous job and you know it's actually a lot of work um you know i would say both of us um you know we're five years in now and we're both probably averaging 60 to 70 hours a week typically um you know i wake up at 6 00 a.m i am at work no later than 8 30 and i stay till you know six seven sometimes and so it's a very busy um job and uh but it's super rewarding and that's the great part like i go to work every day and i love my job and so i feel like i hit the lottery like the hours don't matter you know it's super enjoyable um but it's just it's also just exciting like everything like my feeling and my favorite part personally is launching these new products you know getting into uh the solventless side of the thing like of the industry was something very interesting for for me to do in launch this is just my favorite like parts of being the ceo is saying you know giving the company a vision and saying look this is where i see us going this is something that i think we want to do and launch you know and not everything works out you know you can definitely have those you know stinkers happen but um the rising line is going well you know it was something that we really wanted to get into and it's going great and similarly to us going into michigan yeah you know so no that's awesome and you know for a follow-up to that you know what are some of the pieces of advice that you would give to someone who wants to be a cannabis business owner you know what what would you offer to someone who's either trying to get into it or is at the very beginning stage you know now you're five years deep you know um don't get intimidated it's a very very intimidating um experience you know i was 23 when i got into the so you're very young yeah i'm 29 now um and it's very intimidating especially if you don't have a lot of that you know experience and background but just be confident and and continue to stay humble throughout the process because you're going to get hit honestly like along the way so just kind of like keep persevering and working hard and you know don't focus on the little things you know there's a lot bigger fish to fry in the day and like if you get caught up on every everything along the way you know it's you're never going to get there so just focus on what on your goal and and keep working towards it and eventually it'll happen well it sounds like you've built a good team around you you know are there any aspects of team building or like you know bringing on the right lab manager to do the work is there anything that's worth mentioning there definitely um the industry is an interesting place to work in um you know there's a lot of bosses out there that you know might not connect with their employees i think um and so it kind of goes back to that being humble part that i was mentioning yeah you know start this and and work hard towards it but build that relationship with the people you work with you know i'm no i'm nobody in this in the grand scheme of things you know like i i'm more showing up to work every day and working and you know i want to hire people that want to come to work every day that are happy and excited and can feel like that they can connect with me more you know they see me working every day yeah so hopefully that inspires them to also come here and work and show up and so hiring the right people is super key yeah but keep that family mentality um and that's something that i learned from my parents you know and like my culture of just keeping that cohesive bond between everybody and so you know i try to say hello to everybody whenever i come to work every day and um and um i would say people should do that you know if they're looking to start something yeah so word of the y's for everyone who's listening uh pay attention to your company culture obviously that can make all the difference honestly it'll make it break you your company culture is so so important um you know like our christmas parties are like my favorite thing to do every single year it's like we play good yeah we play um white elephant and it's just fun it's it's a good time to let loose everybody to just kind of poke from each other and that's the other thing don't take yourself too seriously i really don't take myself too seriously i mean look at my you know joke around with people you know have those experiences and and be be relatable once you think you're better than anybody else you're gonna very easily no longer be able to succeed especially in this industry yeah so no that that's great advice matt you know to shift gears a little bit tell me about what a day in the life looks like of you the lab manager managing all these different processes all these extraction methods and then you know solvent lists at the end of the day being perhaps your top shelf product you know what what is what does a day look like for you it is extremely busy i'll start off by saying that that's true everything has to be done very very particularly like very peculiar with everything that's done cleanliness i mean just that alone takes up a huge part of the day a lot of people don't focus a lot on that but anything that your product touches it gets on your product it's in the end product people are smoking it it's just not good for anybody but the lab starts off you know you turn the lights on you fire up all the machines and it's just making sure that nothing's broken first so like a lot a lot of our equipment's running overnight with a super critical co2 extraction you know matt is constantly like reloading the equipment setting it up for running it and then he has to set up a run for overnight so you know in order to kind of reach our goals and and keep up with the production of all of our sales you know he's got to be on point all day long you know a lot of people think that it's just kind of come to work and get high and hang out and no and that's like ass buster yeah yeah it's unbelievable yeah that's not the industry you know and so um if that's what you think is happening here you know that that's not the case you know everybody who works for a pyramid works incredibly hard and um you know and and we try to keep that environment going for them so we get in the lab turn on the lights make sure everything's still functioning properly and following that it's redoing the process that you did the day before all of it's the most labor-intensive job i think i've ever had i really i have a hard time even describing like where i start and where i end but it's always changing too it's like and there's always a new fire there's a new problem every single day that you have to solve it's like being a detective a mechanic and then a scientist you're definitely not a scientist right away you're not a chemist you come in and it's okay what's broken all right let me pull out the wrenches let me pull out the tools let's fix this machine and then as you're fixing that machine chances are something somewhere else is just not going perfectly so you bounce around the lab constantly it's like a ping pong ball and then introducing solvent list to our line actually kind of let me slow down a lot the process is much more much more connected i would say like actually getting to wash you know you're in touch with everything in tune with everything and then when you get to the rosin press it takes finesse throughout the press isn't something you go up to and go and pull the handle and get beautiful rosin it's actually a lot of finesse a lot a lot of finesse well that's really interesting and you know talking about connecting with the plant connecting with solvent lists you know why did you guys bring solvent lists on in the first place and i i'd love to get both of your perspectives on this i mean i'm sure you were advocating for it as someone who started off doing ice water hash absolutely no it was mainly the quality you can't you can't reach the uh the terpene profile on anything else in my opinion than you can with live rosin it tastes so true to the plant and it brings me back to kind of like the original days when i first started smoking weed it has that real true wheat taste when i smoke some concentrates they almost all taste the same to me a little bit like vho co2 extractions there's slight differences but each strain has the same particular taste to them with live rosin i've noticed it brings out way more of the flavors that you don't originally notice yeah and i would have to agree with him completely there you know i remember when i first started smoking you know a long time time ago now um it was so exciting to like experience the next the next bag the next pickup you know and um and just try something new and fill a different experience yeah and i i i kind of agree with what matt's saying is concentrates you can definitely notice the self differences but i think a lot of it's harder for people to with certain things that you just with rosin especially with live rosin um it's extremely pronounced exactly essentially and i'm immediately pronounced um and you know everything every wash is different and you know and kind of going back to original question you know yeah you know matt was pushing for something you know and coley and i at the same time we're looking for kind of that we wanted that high-end option as part of our portfolio of different things that we offer and um with our relationship with pax and just like our vape experiences we felt like we could really kind of bring something new um and you know we wanted that that option so it was kind of a mixture of you know matt's experience with bubble hash prior to and saying you know this is something that's becoming a thing me kind of realizing that it's on the come up as well and uh saying you know what let's produce this new high-end product um for our consumers so that's awesome and you know when you're thinking about making a solvent-less product as the lab manager what are you trying to look at is it you know intense strain selection are you guys sourcing specific things from your own garden you know walk me through a little bit how you select the strains that you do that you decide to wash and process mostly it's trial and error unfortunately we do small test washes on things if we need to find out what the yields will be and stuff like that from our grow you know we had some really good things like cherry cake wedding cake uh we've been running this pineapple chunk that we were just playing here today was something that that yielded on the really low side unfortunately but the quality of it is just so good that yeah you can't had to go for it you have to yeah and uh yeah and and i guess you know i i do a lot of the sourcing in the material okay you know um and we've attended some of y'all's classes actually and um and and heard advice from you all you know you guys are the experts honestly at the end of the day you guys have been doing this for a long time and that kind of moves our strength selection um to a certain degree and but finding those relationships of those quality growers is difficult you know and so we have a very small grow um and uh our product typically that comes out of there washes really well i think a lot of that's attributed to the growing style and the lights that we use we use three fifteen watt leds we've got flour under them and the turkey profile comes you know at the end of flowers really really good and so um yeah the yields are very low but transferring that flower into rosin um it tends to come through exceptionally without it rises brings the quality up that much higher yeah that's why i personally believe i mean i noticed it on our other extraction methods as well is that um the lights matter so much um you know from outdoor to greenhouse to you know uh hbs lights to um lec's um there's such a unique difference that you kind of noticed from being in the industry for so long um and but otherwise yeah you know i mean we can only provide a little bit amount of what we produce so we've got to go to outside sources and find and make those relationships with different grow facilities that can provide us that high quality material so and when you get some high quality material that jake has said you know hey man we're getting the strain in you know let's go for it how do you guys decide which solidless products you're going to turn it into for example you know we've got pax pods with us we've got some grams of some live rosin you know do you make a determination beforehand of where you want that material to go we just started doing the grams so it's not even we haven't released it to the market yet all right everyone exclusive coming out in the next couple weeks realistically so we're actually going to start running and pressing a lot more than we have been um to release these these grams okay so it's been pods first and now we're getting into grams yes sir cool and how what what does that look like are you guys thinking about pretty much just doing live rosin uh what what does that release look like it'll just just be live rosin um the big thing is we haven't really gotten to do too much testing on making sauces or batters and what we're going to do yet whether it's going to be just a crumble uh it's going to come fresh off the press so we still have to work out some kinks there i'm guessing it probably some r d that went into getting these pens right um yeah absolutely yeah that was a huge struggle i mean figuring all that out and pins are not easy like yeah hey no we can be honest about that and you know i think everyone who's tuned in and watching now you know we're not here to tell everyone that making a rosin pen is something that you can just pick up and do on day one so for the rosin pens specifically what were some of the hurdles that you guys went through to now come out with what is an award-winning product getting everything off the press and out of the bags like washing is super easy doing the rosin press was super easy getting the actual oil into the carts and the pods and getting them to flow correctly and hit correctly was by far the most part like the most difficult part that we had and that's just the viscosity getting you know getting the viscosity i mean as you know when your first comes off the press most of it's still thca so it's going to crystallize it's going to butter up and in order to flow in a cart you need it to be liquid so it has to be de-carbed back into thc and when you're doing that there's just there's a lot of problems that can arise so it took you guys definitely some trial and error uh some missteps but now we're at a point where you guys have a product that it looks like you're super proud of absolutely yeah you know and i i think you know some of the to expound on what matt was saying is the terpene retention you know what do people want out of rosin they want it to taste it's amazing the best product they've ever had closest to the plant yeah getting that right on that post process after the press is so integral to like what we do to make a quality product and i mean that took him long long time to figure it out uh just to keep that terpene retention and then beyond that yeah filling is is a whole different thing this isn't like this you know i can't crank the heat up and pump it in a cart yeah and have it flow well you know and so um there's still trial and error in that you know it's like you gotta it takes a while to really dial it in and um we feel like we've gotten into a pretty good spot right now obviously we release the product but there's always ways we can improve upon our process so i'd love to hear from you matt you know you said that this was one of the first pens that you guys made and it won an award tell us a little bit about the trophy we've got on the table here and what the story is behind that one yeah so this was a face-off og it was actually our very first wash in our new wash machine it was our very first time on the rosin press first time trying to de-carve things into a cart so there was there was a lot of lost face-off og grams yeah i apologize to them but um yeah it's it you know it's a really difficult process but we're here today you know we got everything dialed in yeah that's that's a cool story yeah considering it's our first watch we're i mean we were surprised when it came through you know it was it was something where we were i mean i i think i was pushing that we were in the middle of developing this product and release and we wanted to get it in before um this competition and you know i was you know on the back of matt saying get this going let's go let's go let's let's be let's enter this you know hopefully we'll something good will come out of it and it happened to and it happened to be his first wash which is ridiculous in itself but super happy no that's awesome to see you guys hitting a home run like that tell me a little bit about your relationship with pax you know we've got some products here you guys are putting your rosin pens in pax pods uh walk me through that sure um so we've been a pax partner for i think going on two years now two and a half years um and we launched with obviously our other products and pax you know provides the hardware provides the battery you know the actual pod system but you know everything that's inside of that you're smoking is is directly from us or any of the other partners that are on the platform um we there was no rosin on that platform at all and that's where we really saw like a good way to to get in and you know we wanted to launch this so this is actually the first rosin pod packs anything um in in the market in colorado no just in nature nationwide yeah this is the first rosin pax pod that you can consume very cool um and so we saw that kind of that lane that we wanted to get into that we kind of went along with our goal of you know having a really high end product that we could sell and we figured pairing it with like our packs you know distributorship was a really good move and so that's kind of how we got there um but yeah you know these things aren't the same either you know like a 510 cart is much different than a pack spot and we have different feeling techniques for each of those options um and so there's a lot of r d on that back end too that like our production manager aaron really had to play around with to figure out how to make these work well you know you don't want someone to get a product to try it and not work and so figuring that out was was difficult yeah so you and aaron were working hard to bring these products here today all right so we've got pineapple chunk rosin on deck both in live rosin pax pod form as well as grams uh how did this strain fall into your hands it starts off in house with our grow and then i hand select the nugs that we're going to use to wash we hand wash i don't advise anybody to use a drill in a paddle it's just just don't do it it's not worth it it's going to waste your time following that we throw them in a two and a half well actually we from there we select which trichomes are going to be the best to press you don't want to just i mean you can mix all of your all of your bubble hash selections together but you're not going to get the greatest quality that you could by selecting which trichomes are better which in this case was the 90 to 120 micron range following that selection they go in the freeze dryer we freeze dry them yeah and then we load them up in two and a half by nine pure pressure bags set them on the peer pressure pike's peak version yeah and we press it around 180 185 degrees i like to press until the oil will start to darken up or pretty much you can tell by as you're adding pressure you'll see possibly the oil darkening up a little bit i like to stop right around that point yeah and that's a lot of trial and error though i mean yeah it varies honestly not even from strange terrain each press will vary like i said it's a lot of finesse when you're working the press it's not something you just pull the handle and you get your perfect oil but so there's some trial and error there you know as far as the grow since you know we talk so much about growing and how important that obviously is for all forms of extraction but especially solventless tell me a little bit about your grow and you know how you guys got a product this good yeah so um all the genetics we've gotten have been from growers around uh colorado um we fl we we grow in a deep water culture system so we use a current culture system um and then we fly under 351 lec's we really feel like the end product while you might not get as big of yields like you know bigger buds we definitely get a higher quality product like in our wash specifically or in our extracts because we don't really sell any weight um all of it goes right into our process um so we either process it into our you know distillates or we process it into our co2 oil or now a lot of it's going right to fresh frozen so um you know the harvest is very very important really knowing what you're doing there is it is key to making the wash go well um you want to harvest right away you know a lot of people think that oh it's okay to you know buck these buds and let them sit here while i finish this harvest no you want to go very very quickly and go um on a plant my plant basis almost um you know you really don't want them to be sitting around for any more than 20 30 minutes so wow so it's a quick d fan um you know all right in the stock and then you buck the buds very quickly um everything we cure is in turkey bags typically and that's kind of what we do for our fresh resin as well so you know pluck buck bag and throw it in the freezer immediately it's very important um to not get too much water cotton content because it definitely will affect the wash on the back end oh so you guys have it nailed down that was almost like a little limerick i i like that so we've got pineapple chunk with us what are some strains that you guys like to smoke start with you matt i've got a weird palette personally one of my favorites right now is mandarin dreams i absolutely love that strange i mean it just sounds nice i also love bananas anything with banana in it is always a go-to for me and then cheese bio cheese any kind of cheese uk cheese i love cheese cheese okay cheesy terms i can't get enough cheese that's awesome what about you uh you know i'm big on the cheese game too um cheese quake is like one of my favorite strains ever um i haven't seen her around in a long time um i don't know how little washes we haven't gotten a chance to watch something like that but i also really like a lot of sub cool genetics personally um so like space queen is amazing crossed with anything jelly bean nine pound hammer jelly beans my favorites hands down yeah and um that's one strain that i really want to wash um and so that'll be coming in the pipeline too awesome so that's kind of yeah that's my favorite strain we're gonna do it at some point okay okay that's right i think you get a decision in there you know i would also love to learn you know before we right before we get into the review here you know let's wrap this up with tell me a little bit about what does pyramid stand for like what are your guys's philosophies um you know it's a very difficult question especially put into words um you know when coley and i started out we you know we were just trying to to get get things going and you know it was really hard to to kind of figure out what we wanted to stand for as a company and you know i think the biggest thing that kind of we look for and and that we want like our message to be is we just want to be a good place to work you know i feel like a lot of people are very unsatisfied in their life and and we want people to enjoy coming to work with us you know not for us but with us on this and so you know beyond that um you know personally like i really like um kind of able to you know expand upon my heritage and and show that you know minorities can be successful in this space um and uh and so i think that's something that we really have going for us there is um anybody can can get into this you know it doesn't have to be one person the other so you know we really are interested in in working with communities of color yeah um and you know that's kind of one of the big things we're doing in michigan specifically we're working in a um kind of a lower income area and bring jobs bring jobs to those areas you know bring business back into these areas that have you know over time have have gotten the shorten the stick here um and so you know i i wouldn't say we have a you know i'm not the marketing guy who's gonna tell you this is our philosophy this is our mantra sure i think it's more of just like inside of us yeah this is kind of who we are as people and we want this to come through on our business side as well so yeah that i mean that's a great explanation jake walk me through what do we have on the table here uh and what are we gonna review so today we are going to review our um pineapple chunk live rosin pods um we don't have a rate today so we'll kind of just let you guys look at bigger hams um and then we're also going to kind of show you guys the newest tech coming out of packs that a lot of people have not experienced or seen yet cool um and so i'll kind of review through that real quick okay yeah please show me break it out um all right so you know pax right now um just released this product it is the pax era pro they've added a lot of really cool tech into this product that is is very new uh i love the packaging to start off with yeah and then honestly the feel of it is is it's it's really premium you know i think pax really wants to be that apple of um of uh vaporizers and i think magnetic lid yeah all right they've put uh they've put some thought into this okay and even there you know yeah shows yeah very well thought out packaging um i really like the new finish on the actual product um and they've done a lot of different things with it now so you actually get some color options which didn't exist before okay um so we've got silver we've got a red a jade and a traditional black i like the silver a lot nice um very clean yep so they've added usbc um charging to so they've kind of upgraded the charging it's fast charged so um throw it in your car you know or you take it out to a hike and it's not ready it's gonna be ready weight is almost nothing which is very cool very cool um and some of the features they've added to it are really nice um they have the traditional child proof usage on here you know you connect it to your phone yeah and it's going to be child proof so your kid can't can't mess with it which i think is a really awesome feature for a lot of people totally um and then some of the what i really like though is that so if you look at all of our pods you really wouldn't really notice it let's crack one of these up real quick please i was hoping we might um okay so yeah so this is our packaging so we really wanted to go with a more um hash head feel to it yeah if you you know we want it to be we really like our packaging to look fun yeah and that's kind of the direction we're going with a lot of things and so we wanted to kind of give you that rosin feel to it that that fresh press and that's kind of how we came up with this yeah with the director this it's very different for us um and so inside the child proof packaging you'll find a a pot obviously pull it out check it out all right and now you are saying child proof often i want to make sure just pop this baby right in there oh it's vibrating and lighting up so no it knows yeah that's another cool feature is the haptic feedback um so you know you plug it into your new era pro and it will vibrate you know like hey this is this is so is this primed and ready to go is there anything else i need to do here uh no go for it okay cool these are very childhood yeah good you guys you guys got your packaging down and you know as a marketing person i'm i'm very appreciative of aesthetics and uh this this got some to spare so you can definitely take a hit um there's three different settings that we load on these pods so these pods are actually smart pods now so tell me what does that mean smart pod okay so in-house so we what we do is you know we fill the pod and then we tag them okay so whenever you buy a new pod it'll have this red band around it when you pull it into your air pro and you have your app on your phone it'll literally show you like this is a pyramid pod so it'll have our logo okay we'll get the description of the strain it'll tell you the potencies so you know that's one thing that i hate about you know our 510 carts is like you forget what you're smoking a lot of the time so you know we have it engraved on the pod but also when you plug it in it's going to give you description of the strain um and then beyond that um we have an expert temp that we set it to and then you also have a load temp automatically set in a high temp so if you really want that high vapor production with you don't care too much about the turbine preservation yeah you can bump it'll bump up automatically or you can set to like our typical temperature so where am i at right now um you know i think you're probably right in the middle okay realistically because voltage obviously very important part of getting a good grip with a solventless pen specifically and usually lower voltage lower temperature you know if i'm going to spend the money to really get a premium vape i'm not just trying to cook all my terps well i think that's a huge benefit to the pax platform is that you know if you're you know if you're that hashtag and you're looking for that really high quality product using a 510 card is usually not gonna get you there um unless you're using a very expensive battery to get there yeah where this really allows you to dial in your high um and dial in the experience you want to get you know we can take it really low and you're going to get that really good flavor almost like a dry vape yeah um but you're not going to get that that that big cloud so typically i like to pump it up a little bit okay um to get that experience right away well i've sat and heard so much about this strain let's [Music] hmm that's really good i mean it it's interesting because with a vape sometimes you never kind of know what you're gonna get and there's a lot of information there's a lot of education and you know especially with the vape crisis that was you know in full swing last year like having a real nice solvent-less vape like this i i really like the experience especially the rosin experience um out of this i mean it's really hard to replicate a true dab in vape form i think that's what what people criticize vape a lot for yeah people want the convenience especially the purists the purest yeah you know they kind of hate on vape a lot and we're really trying to get these p get those individuals who want that high quality product yeah onto a vaporizing platform and that's what our raw our live rosin pods do especially on the pax platform yeah you know just kind of taking this experience in you know it's it's fruity but it's also got something else behind it like it's very smooth and sometimes some of the really high terpene fruit strains that they're not quite as smooth as what i'm getting in this and you know kind of as it's starting to settle in a little bit and i know you know i didn't blow some monster cloud for everyone on the camera but just you know really enjoying you know having a fine vape it you know for me when i consume it it's not always just about flexing on our video it's about really just having an experience with the products itself um yeah it's great i mean honestly this is the closest you're gonna get to a dab in a vape form um no [ __ ] um i don't know if they can say that but no [ __ ] it's um we could square on our youtube channel this is for adults uh and um it's really good and i i this is pretty much all i smoke now honestly on our platform is our rosin line yeah um just because i think the flavor profile is unmatched among vaporizers and um it's always interesting to try something new yeah so well if i could describe you know after taking a couple hits some real small ones some bigger ones i mean it's fruity i get a little taste of pineapple in there there's almost something in there that is a little more savory and i'm having a hard time putting my finger on it but there's there it it's a strain that's got some depth and i like that um and as far as like the actual experience goes of using this it's it's very seamless um i'm a big fan pineapple trunk great choice on this one you guys uh i just want to smoke this all day this is a tough one well i'm glad you like it you know um we'll definitely get you some samples of some other strains to enjoy and um yeah i'm really glad you're experiencing having a good experience this is a great product thank you guys so much for coming in uh you know the review today obviously the sullivan's pax pod but for those of you out there who also really just want to take a dab and that's the experience you want to have we've also got grams here as well and you guys are going to be doing limited drops of those starting soon is that right yeah yeah that's a plan you know it's been a really popular option and so you know we definitely know that the consumers that are most interested in that are looking for those super premium you know product drops and that's what we're planning on doing um this isn't going to be like a widely available product for us unless it goes absolutely amazing which i think it will so we'll eventually start working work up to it yeah but um it's definitely some limited drop so please stay tuned for that in the near future so you guys are

little savory it has this quality to it that's a little hard to put my finger on but it's a strain that just has these hash overtones mixed with that pineapple that fruit and that's a stray that's a type that i really like uh just that hashy flavor on the exhale it's a good smoke it's a smooth smooth rip the pax is sweet i hadn't seen that pen before all in all great product and they're 50 in

"don't you hate it when you can't scrape all the hash out of your little stupid container there's a dab left in here but I can't even scoop it out not with this thing anyways but I'm about to show you a super easy way to get every last bit of hash out of every one of your containers this is gonna save you so many doubts right now on the stream answers to all the questions you've ever had about weed what's up i'm matt welcome back to the strange show this is a channel for adults and patients where i answer all the questions you've ever had about weeds you don't know how many of these little containers like this or maybe even worse the even smaller ones like this that i've thrown away that still have some hash inside of them a long time ago i never knew how to get the last dab or two out of these things and it would drive me crazy until i learned how to make a turn to tell me Tyler showed me this so shout out to Tyler thank you buddy this saved my life all three of these containers are pretty much empty I can't get any more on my stick but after we make our Terp tube we're gonna have a few dabs of these guys so super easy you really don't need a couple things first get all your containers that you have that still have just a little bit of hash in them then we're gonna need a drinking straw a pair of scissors and you probably already have your torch handy but we might not even need this first just cut off a few inches of your straw just make sure the piece you cut off is at least a few inches long now we're gonna take the piece that we cut off we're gonna cut a really steep angle on one side of the straw like this now that we've cut at this really steep angle we're gonna cut the pointy side off right there so it's nice and flat on the front and it looks like a little shovel now we have a very flexible tool to scrape our container with and it's hollow and you're gonna see why that's important in just a second but look how good it scrapes this out I mean it gets every drop there's nothing left in this that looks brand-new now and I can do that to all of these I could go around the house and find any of these I might have and try this and it even works in these little tiny ones because the Turk tube is so flexible that it just bends to any shape you smush it to so if your hash isn't as wet is these are if it's too hard to scrape with your turkey that's when your torch is gonna come in now if you have a hairdryer laying around I'd probably use the hairdryer first but you're probably like me and you're sitting here it's all your dabbing stuff in front of you and I don't have a hairdryer in front of me - dad what so I'm gonna use a torch so just take your torch and just barely wand it over your hash container and just gently heat it up just ever so slightly then it should be a little more runny and wet and pliable and you can do that with your torch or a blow-dryer or whatever you could probably just put in your pocket for now or anything to make it warm now all our containers are clean and our Terk tube is full of past but it's way down in the tube how are we supposed to give to this out this is why it's good for it to be held just take your scissors and cut right up the middle of your straw now you can get your dab tool and to scoop it right out of it and now we got a big bat dam out of an otherwise empty container now that's tight that's the success Terp - yo buddy don't forget to subscribe for good vibes and I got nuggets of knowledge cuz when you watch the stream show it's like going to weed College [Music]", "tq185XBggYE": "what's up you guys this style on us today a [ __ ] beautiful day Suns going down it's nighttime already but it was still a beautiful [ __ ] day was warm sunny broke my bike I'm cruising around and

today's video guys as you guys can see by that little intro man I got a bunch of goodies right here man and I thought I was just gonna smoke this by myself this weekend but why not make a video for you guys and let you guys know I think it's gonna be a review slash smoke sesh that's just vibing out man so right here guys I got some 710 labs live rosin some bootylicious number one it's tier two I just picked this up as you guys can see right here mint fresh super super super fresh might have already been taking add a bit too out of it but that doesn't matter because we got something else right here guys 710 lives of their 8th right here this is called oh gee KB and man I have heard nothing but good things from like their products man they the fact that 710 labs takes so much pride into the products that they all they do is just put in hard work and the results speak for themselves man they got people talking all over Instagram YouTube Twitter like I'm talking about like everywhere that I go everyone asked me as I have you tried seven ten have you tried seven ten and I've tried their hash rasen but I have not tried their what their Weed Man so I'm very very excited to get into this but for before we get into this man I have to give a big shout-out to today's sponsor man gothic comm where they sell bracelets pendants and rings super sick ass rings man well you can go buy some for your friends girlfriend whatever the case is man and you could use my own personal code savvy G to get a discount percentage of well I'll put everything down in the description below man go show them some support because a support of today's video guys alright honestly we're like I said I was ready to be smoking on both of these guys they both cost me around this one right here was $80 this one right here with $70 so a total of 150 it is a pretty hefty price to paint but you know if you want to smoke it you got to pay the price so we're gonna save this for the second part of the video we're gonna roll up a nice joint with that but first since I do have my rig right here MJ Arsenal and my torch all the goodies right here I think the only thing we can do is take it out all right so I'm already have been dabbing it so I'm bushed shut you guys in there it might be missing some so this right here guys is what I have currently right now and it's honestly some of the turkeys like 710 miles has to be some of the turkeys but I mean wax that I have ever smelled man like the the Terps in this thing is just so amazing and I kid you not man stabbing on Psalm endless like wax is just so freakin good man thinking about doing is heating this up for 30 about 30 to 35 seconds and then waiting about 45 seconds to 50 seconds I feel like that gives it the best the taste and it's not very harsh smoke yet you get very very milky clouds so let's go ahead and torch this thing up boys cheers i heated it up to 35 seconds I'm gonna go ahead and let it go till 45 just because I had you have the window open man and I'm gonna go ahead and meanwhile though let's go ahead and choose a nice little chunky one just to start things off boys because honestly I have I've only dabbed it once today and I feel like man this one's gonna catch me because I'm telling you the hatch frozen is so smooth that you only really feel it when it starts building up in your chest man so we're about during your second day and still got another ten and yeah let me know in the comments below if you've ever tried 7-10 labs man if you have make sure to hit that like button on this video and if you haven't we'll hit that like button anyways cheers boys oh dude that tastes so freakin good I already look at the depths what's already coming in that was the perfect dab I kid you not watch this I love waiting all right the reason I love waiting that much time it's because you just get the smoothest hits the milk is hits and then the Terps now I'm tick I'm talking about I can taste everything in this I can taste everything man it's phenomenal and after you're done your your nail should look like this man you should still see oil in there and man there's seven ten laps definitely definitely worth that's the $80 that I paid man I would I want to buy the Percy that one right there is $100 I believe or $90 so if you guys want to see a video on the percy live rosin let me know in the comments below like this video and subscribe so auntie dad dad got me super high and I just remember that we also have to smoke another joint so I'm probably gonna step aside from the dabbing and we're gonna go ahead and crack this open man this oh gee Kb your see you guys see how fresh it is man I have not opened it brand new look well you can see the seal right there man this is gonna be the first time guys that I have ever seen this flower in person and I'm kind of excited already it's like a little glimpse right there so let me go ahead and pop this sucker out oh dude oh now just follow my computer oh dude it's as beautiful as the oh oh my goodness dude yo I know my camera is not gonna you know pick up every single watch I'm gonna have to use my phone for this guy's but this but right here you guys know the phone camera picks up every single trichome everything that's why we use the phone and look look at this guy's just look at this you guys are gonna be in all all right so this is the og KB right here look at this dude the beautiful orange hairs I'm talking about look at the trichomes look at the purple little stems think you know oh my gosh the curation on this dude is just so phenomenal I haven't even smelt it what does it smell like I have never saw anything like this smells like me but it's just a different type of legal officer dude this is like literally one of the most aya peeling pieces of bud that I have ever seen and now it's just a fact so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna roll this up I don't know how much help I roll it up but dude this thing is just so phenomenal looking I don't even know if I want to break it apart but I just want to just put this in a casing and just put it in a corner of my room do you never touch it so this thing looks so phenomenal I'm gonna like I said I'm a roll up a joint and I'll see you guys in a little bit right here we got the joint right here man it's honestly I rolled there I've been getting so much better at rolling these freaking joints so all we got to do now man is pretty much just burn off the paperboys and basically here you go here you have it your perfect little or joint now I want to say there's like 1.5 in here man but does it really matter though because I just want to know how good this is man I want to know if it's worth the money because this this 8 was more expensive than a cookie so he hasn't gonna be the first one to find out boys choose only through the age of 18 or 21 whatever it is in your legal statement choose wood hmm after that personation I did get a little bit of some a little bit of paper tape so [Music] whoo it's actually pretty freakin smooth man so far so far I do i I did roll these in some raw hemp papers organic hemp so there might be another reason why but honestly so far it's burning a really really smooth I am getting a lot of earthiness from this plant itself and it's giving off a little bit of a sweet tone but honestly it tastes very very very good like it's something like I know we did we'd look I know we do sweet guys but you can tell the difference from something that is properly cultivated to some [ __ ] that you know that that is make that is being made in mass amounts and things like that like these guys they take so much pride because it's small batch all the time they never they never overdo the batches man because they want to make sure that every single planet that they grow is growing to a hundred percent perfection on their own terms you know but so far man I haven't I'll any clips of this this it's burning very very smooth like I'm telling you let me give you guys a little close-up of pilots burning right I rolled it really really good it's burning even all the way through you got the little tip right there if you ask them to see that and it's an enjoyable smoke man it's currently 10 o'clock in the morning and usually whenever this is the first time I'm smoking also unusually whenever I smoke first my eye like I started coffee or [ __ ] to him whenever it's the first work of a bit but this is smooth like I was saying and it tastes very piney earthy but it's enjoyable as heck I don't taste any really fruitiness flavors of it no I taste a little bit of sweetness but it's not overpowering this thing is chiefing though it's obviously getting me super super baby I ended up waiting a little bit after taking the dabs and then just I mean I rolled out the joint while I was high a [ __ ] and then I roll I waited a little bit more that way I could get the full effects because I didn't want to go from being a super stone because that was a super fat that that I just took I don't want to go from being super stoned to you know getting even more stunning I even being able to differentiate the type of high that I'm getting in the flavor because my mouth was dry as heck I kid you not that dad got me so tight but I was brick and faded for it for a minute I'm not gonna lie I have not been that faded in such a long time and it's such a good feeling now and then they finished chugging milk for sure all boys that looks like we're at had a lighter fluid on our centers [Music] this thing is McEnroe I hope you guys like the new location I mean I'm just in my garage and I hope you guys not like the current location man I was gonna do it in my car but I was like man for a special day like this my mind let's just do it somewhere where you know you guys can see all the smoke around me not the same setting give you guys some a little something different I just in used to Macanese well I'm about to finish this whole joint to the face but not on camera because that would literally turn my videos so freakin long all right guys so my review for this ogk be it's about its max I'm high right now like super faded and it's such a different height such a soothing high but usually with wheat it's either I don't get high or I get like you know too high to the point where I don't even enjoy the high because my head's hurting but this right here yeah but this one right here is honestly just hitting like every single aspect bro like I'm sure I know I know for a fact after I'm done with this I'm probably I'm probably gonna have a better good morning you know I'm already have me good morning gonna go better and EMA like like I would say though I would definitely would not mind dropping another 150 hundred 60 on some 17 laps again like because there I'm telling you they're rosin smack nice it was just the perfect gap the turf through there the taste is there that I was there everything about it was so good and I feel like usually I don't get that feeling with other concentrates you know with other flower so yeah man I would definitely purchase this again time though I do want to try the Persie rosin you know want to try I'm not even sure what kind of strain this was it was like an indica or sativa guessing it's either hinder guard hybrid so next time I want to try just a straight-up indica and see how much that smacks me because I feel like if this give this is smack at me right now I can only imagine what a straight up in meter with you so yeah guys I'm gonna go ahead and hand out the video here because I'm high as a hack right now I just want to enjoy the rest of this man hopefully you guys enjoyed today's video and you know and if you did go ahead and

about to have a very good time here I'm sure not everyone knows what quartz inserts are and how they're used but I have an entire youtube video where I break it down super in-depth so if you want to learn more about quartz inserts you can go into the description of this video and watch that first but from here on out in the video I'm going to assume that you know what quartz inserts are and how they're used it's gonna bang your nice and hot alright now that our banger is going down let's get a quick little close up if we can bounce away boys this might overflow not gonna lie one piece breast oh he's so good my god [Music] Piper hush sorry you guys got my dog with me she's away from all the deaths not bad I got a little doggie gate set up here that's oh my god man this should taste so good I'm not kidding my girlfriend even like hates the smell of weed and she smoked this [ __ ] and she was like damn you should get more of that that [ __ ] smells good that definitely raised the temperature in here holy [ __ ] those nice big shout out the cop products for making these courts inserts that fit their bangers perfectly not to mention the tweezers they make so handling them when they're super hot is really like a stress free hassle all right that was a nice way to start the session I like legit sweating a little bit yep that's what what's nice about that inserts is honestly there's not a lot of residue that gets on the banger you even want to overflows it's so much less than one actually gets an insert so it really does provide your banger from getting that like Chaz dusty look to it all right that was nice but next I'm gonna dab some rosin this strain is strong wah but number two from olio this one really impressed me even from olio it smells and tastes amazing the look on it's great honestly even when it smells it's almost [ __ ] clear let me show you all right I have number two get it nice and close time a little bit the smaller Deb but I still think it's a beige decent size with a desert no wait till it really starts to smoke up in here and then I go for it this one's a little hot oh my god Oh oh my god it's like one hit left boom Wow that [ __ ] is nice definitely burnt up though with that on that one oh my god there is nobody left in there even even when it was that hot it tasted [ __ ] good man these inserts really make the dabs last longer I sort of got I mean this time I went a little hot but even if you get a nice low time they [ __ ] Rock here alright threw down four to go [ __ ] alright next I'm dabbing on some good goog live president from Moxie I really like this drain it's a sativa hybrid but honestly it's just a straight sativa in my opinion it gets me so [ __ ] high in that like cracked-out sativa way or you're super chatty and like just want to go out and go do something like this is definitely a constraint for on-the-go I'm not gonna do a close-up on this one [ __ ] it let's see the whole function of the Ring all right let's drop it already Melton Oh Lord dude I'm already so [ __ ] big this is gonna be a long video yep it's gonna be a long video oh my god [ __ ] give me that little nose tickle oh my god I gotta hear at the chit still going Jesus Christ this is what I was talking about [ __ ] oh my god all right tap it out there I swear it man that is a straight sativa it's not considered one but like that rosin that killed me and that one's brought me back to life halfway there only three left alright next I'm gonna dive is a little scary it is like a straight THC a rock but it's actually just like lab rats and diamonds without the live presentation it it's one giant rock so this should be interesting this [ __ ] has no flavor obviously because there's no turfs but it just has this like weird chemi taste like I'm honestly just not a fan I'm kind of dreading this stab out of all of them because this is a giant [ __ ] rock of it but wish me luck this I do want to go in a little bit hopped out because since it's just straight THC a really all it needs is heat to get the full effect alright let's watch this [ __ ] melt so weird has just no flavor [Applause] a little bit left it holy [ __ ] alright it's done it's [ __ ] done oh my god dude I'm not even gonna lie there's so much replaying in here you know what that means cheers [ __ ] [ __ ] me oh this is all hot [ __ ] no bueno just has no flavor so weird the highs crazy on this stuff but it's just so weird now there's no Terps I need the Turks terms all right give me some turps next to reindeer the strong Nana I'd add this a bunch on my last video has like a super great banana terpene profile I love anything that tastes like banana I don't know why it's hard to come by and it always is just like such a nice experience when I get it and this is live rosin by the way so definitely gonna have a good Turkey in profile all right as well doing a close-up let me know if you guys are enjoying these little close-up insert drops actually really enjoy the inserts so I'll keep doing videos like this if you like it so let me know swinging a little hot on that gotta take a little breather there [ __ ] [Applause] [ __ ] me oh my god dude Robin just hit you different really does who love it great experience I'd love rosin rosin for life all right last but not least I'm going to do some only old life present my eyes are feeling heavy so I'm glad those videos under this drain is guava breath ever get what the number is let's go with guava breath to the number really never matters to me when people are like Oh what watermelon skittles is is the 16 or the 48 I don't care to that exact i honestly should but my memory is just not strong enough for that I'm like I know I like that strain or I like the sound of it I'm grown with it like it's talking me to remember what number is better make sure you ask look like you definitely enjoy the video if you made it this far I appreciate every single one of you guys watching let's do the snap I'm doing a low temp I don't care if you judgment boom get in there we're ready [ __ ] dodge like that holy [ __ ] [Music] oh dude I'm so lit goddamn alright that's it we're done it was really just an average life present nothing crazy but I honestly didn't need anything crazier than this sesh I'm already [ __ ] lit this was a lot of fun I hope you enjoyed

Tech tutorial well not really jar take away my version of jar attack the reason I say that is because there's a bunch of ways you can do quote-unquote jar tech but the way I like it is to make the material really buttery and really hard so what I do to get that material pretty much all I've done so far is I squish seven grams of flour I put it it got it from the parchment and with my tool and I've put it on to a jar with no lid in between plates and it's out 1:29 and sitting at that for about 10 minutes so I'll come back to you guys and probably about half an hour to an hour once that's a little bit more buttered up so I can whip it and I'll let you guys know what I mean by whipping it then because you can see that's already kinda starting to butter up and that's what we want but we're gonna let it go for about another half hour to an hour so see you guys yep so what I have done here is I've pretty much just taken a little dab tours you can see right there there's now a little bit dirty and I've just stirred this rosin around I noticed that one part was getting really buttery but the rest was staying really runny I actually even noticed that it's trying to build like some sort of I mean try to zoom in there some sort of like little diamonds or like some hard pieces of rosin super-dope but um as you can see it's been whipped now and I'm just gonna put it right back in here this was about half a minute back this was about half an hour in that we whipped it so once again it's just insane out 1:29 it's been in there for about half an hour we just whipped it pretty much stuck a the blossom stick in there and stirred it around mixed it up for about 30 seconds to a minute and then put it right back on the plates and now we're going to sit there for maybe another hour maybe another 30 minutes I'll be back to you guys when that's 1020 minutes from the last video maybe I don't know 30 minutes in - after the whip as you can see we're having very nice crystallization you can see him some big diamonds starting to form we're gonna let this keep going let it keep buttering up and so they could keep doing its thing beautiful we're probably about an hour in since the last video and what I have here pretty much is a very stable a little bit buttery you can see the Terps popping up on top but it's pretty much starting to harden up and as you can see this is that consistently and see I said I wanted from the beginning although I'm still gonna let it go for probably about another half hour or so everyone and how's it going this is pretty much all finished up I started at 11:53 it's now 147 so probably took like a little over two hours I don't know but this is pretty much then the results as I like it this is very hard all of this pretty much puffed up and became very solid like it's all butter and that's how I like my rosin so if you guys don't like it like that you could have left it at the point where it's diamonds or whatever but once again this is just a little tutorial on how I like to do my rosin tag and the kind of results I like to go for kind of things I do and how I do it but yeah guys this is an official tutorial if you guys want any of things I used pretty much all I used was unlocks master unit two heaped up to press the rosin and to heat it up and if you guys want you can use this kind of code yeah I'm stoned and I'll save you guys a bunch of money on these presses or on DeYoung the mini that I used because this is where I made the rosin so I'm yeah if you guys more a mini or alex master you in there like that just discount code yeah I'm stoned one word you guys will be able to save some money at Knox Master Lock yeah guys it's the finished product I hope you enjoyed and thanks for watching", "1jFtPFQ8z9g": "to the people that are new to dabbing and see all these consistencies and get confused and just don't know which one to try i just say try them all today i'm going to be dabbing on some garlic cookie sauce from grassroots let's crack the seal on this as you can tell it's super [ __ ] goopy i'm gonna try to keep it as level as i possibly can jesus christ dude the whole room just reeks of garlic trying to do this without spilling any there's literally just like a straight up layer of turp juice on top of it we're gonna mix this up a little bit make sure all those diamonds and terps get mixed together nicely just look how gloopy it is you guys this stuff's so hard to handle on a dabber bloop but it's fire i love the function of this recycler that's the perfect little drain let's get our dab ready i'm not kidding when i say this stuff's running you guys you really want to make sure you have a dabber that has some sort of scoop on it so you can make sure you get a decently sized dab all right let's go you guys [Music] this [ __ ] is crazy you guys i know i talk about garlic cookies a lot on my channel but the aroma and the flavor that you get from this is [ __ ] nuts like that aftertaste just stays for so long the dab is gone i've already taken it but i can still just taste that insane garlicky feeling and these are some great effects too i swear to god that one dab does the job but this is some live resin sauce most people just call it sauce though it's a pretty popular form of concentrate there's a lot of different terms to describe extracts like shatter butter batter crumble sauce diamond sugar the list goes on and on these names are used to describe the consistency and the malleability of the concentrate not the quality everyone has a preference on their favorite consistency but none are just bad off of the consistency so just don't overthink it when it comes to quality of an extract it really just comes to what the quality of the product is going into it and the knowledge and experience of the person who's actually doing the extraction process it's not like chatter means bad sugar means good but sauce is a pretty popular form of concentrate if you've been to a few dispensaries you've probably seen it or if you know a few plugs they probably got it it looks like a million tiny rocks swimming in a pool of like yellowy ambery liquid diamonds are their own form of concentrate typically they're on the bigger side and much less terpy where sauce is usually super tiny diamonds sometimes there's a couple big rocks in there but usually it's so small where you really can't even see them mixed with a crazy amount of terpenes but those little tiny diamonds are where the cannabinoids are so that's where majority of the thc is stored and the liquid portion is live resin terpenes so there's a super high percentage of terpenes in there and a super low percentage of cannabinoids which is why it's perfect to mix the two so the sauce might not get you very high alone but when you mix it with those diamonds it just packs a punch you get pretty [ __ ] lit and the terpenes add an additional entourage effect so it really does add an additional kick to the thc but i say it's time to take another dab [Music] uh oh [ __ ] this drink feels so awkward to hold i'm not gonna lie oh my god that train is [ __ ] crazy oh [ __ ] those terpenes are always super [ __ ] heavy on sauce so i usually try to make sure i get the strains i like when i pick it up i know i said that they're all pretty much the same thing but the main difference between sauce and every other strain is that it has like the most intense terpene profile plenty of other concentrates of high terpene profiles but the most overwhelmingly high is typically sauce and the terpene profile on this one is [ __ ] insane it's five point seven percent mercy and almost five percent carry off i mean four point five percent limiting and that's just the top three it's total terpenes is 18.4 if i did my math right like that's a lot of terps sugar also has a high terpene profile but it's a little bit more easy to work with let me open this jar real quick and show you what it looks like for those who don't know all right this is a fresh gram of bubba kush sugar as you can see it's still terpy but there's more of like a solid consistency to it there's still some sauce in there but there's much bigger diamonds that are a little bit easier to handle and work with these two are made of exactly the same stuff but have a completely different consistency but the main downsides the sauce in my opinion or how liquidy it is like i just said you really can't keep it in a hot environment you can't put it on its side for a long period of time and it's hard to work with on a dabber at least if you like big dabs like using a little needle like this would be so hard even using a scooper like this you really can't get too fat of a dab but looks are deceiving with sauce and sugar in my opinion if you're used to just only dab and shatter and you really haven't experienced sauce or sugar like you really don't realize how fat of a dab you're taking if you just scoop up a giant bit of it but again not all sauce looks exactly like this sometimes sauce looks like a mixture between the two concentrates that just showed you where they have a couple big rocks in there but it's majority that like super small diamond but a lot of companies really aren't that great labeling this stuff i bought some sauce before that was just straight up sugar i've bought some butter before that was sauce there's a little bit of like subjectiveness that comes to it where they're like i mean it's sugar but it's super terpy so let's just call it sauce they do try to label it as accurately as they can so that you can get a good idea for what you're going to consume nobody likes pissed off customers so they try to make it as accurate as they can but i'd be lying if i said i've never had it be a little off but to the people that are new to dabbing and see all these consistencies and get confused and just don't know which one to try i just say try them all it's the best way to find out which one you like and which one you don't and it's like none of these are bad technically so you can try shatter you can try sauce you can try butter and you can see which one you like the best but i say we take one more dab before we head out of here this time i'm not gonna use the diver though personally this is my favorite way to dab sauce hey that's fire now that's the right way to dab sauce a lot of people message me and ask me to like clarify what consistency of concentrate they have it's mostly people that get it from the black market because it's not labeled but i feel like i might start a series where i go from concentrate to concentrate and just kind of show them off let me know if that's something you'd like to see in the comments below but click like if you enjoyed this video if you made it this far you probably did and leave a comment let me know if you want me to make this a series and if so what concentrate should i do next don't say live rosin i already have a whole [ __ ]

this is $75 and you're getting a big scoop of it I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there [ __ ] it this video is for mature audience if you're not a mature audience this video is not for you what's up everybody Cubans here and today we are going to get into some rather expensive concentrates I picked up a gram of some hash rosin today that was priced at $75 and it is one of the most expensive grams of concentrate I have ever purchased so let's take a close look at what we got I've had a gram of Summit connoisseurs genetic and concentrates Tiger's milk and this stuff looks like a nice little slab of peanut butter I'm pretty excited pretty excited abot both so you can get a look at the packaging here this is that Tiger's milk and it's testing at about seventy nine percent THC and then it does have a little bit of CBD a in there but you know what I am so excited for this let's just take it down where are my clothes at let's get a nice nice little scoop here out of the email all fresh and clean and I'm gonna see how it does does [Music] um yeah that was really good I'm gonna actually throw that on a courts now I'm gonna throw that around on a few nails and see if we like it but just to compare I picked up some cheap dabs this cost 75 a gram for some hash rasen 75 bucks for this it's pretty expensive most most of my concentrates I usually find deals and get a lot of good looking stuff like this this is some live batter I got for about 15 bucks a gram one-fifth of the price now sometimes I find live sugars live diamonds of batters around that 15 to 20 dollar price if I'm getting it on a deal it's not the everyday price so begin the deal you can get this stuff cheap so it's really interesting to pay five times as much for a single gram of concentrate I can't I can't believe I did it it's still interesting to me that this costs five times as much as this other gram of some delicious looking stuff but some hash rods and it's hard to come by especially here in Colorado Springs it's not super common to find rosin hash rosin so I guess you got to pay that top dollar because it's so rare but let's get some more dabs of this cone I'm not done with this yet let's see what I'm gonna do some cold starts when you know that this is $75 and you get in a big school but I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there okay [Music] it's throwing out a couple bucks in that [ __ ] it [ __ ] it and get a little bit more I need about three-fitty oh we got it okay okay just pricey tab right here damn it all right let's get a nice cold start here and see if it's super delicious on the court oh damn well damn okay okay that's good stuff so I just stabbed it a couple of times here and it's pretty good stuff but is it is it worth it is it worth paying five times as much as I do for some good live banner is it worth is it worth paying five times as much to get some solvent once that's basically the major difference is the fact that it's solvent list most concentrates are made with a solvent it's the easier method it's the most common method but with rosin they use heat and pressure to make it so they just basically squish the THC or they squish the extract out of the nugs or out of hash most of the time they'll make a hash and then they'll press the hash and that's what this is this is a this is hash rosin so it's a little bit more expensive and my understanding is the yield is a little bit lower it's it's a process to make the hash and then when you press the hash you wouldn't get the same type of yield as if you were doing like a butane or propane extraction so I think part of the process is it's a little bit harder to get high-quality product and you're typically going to get less with whatever amount of plant material you go into the process with so I think that affects the price it is pretty rare out here in Colorado Springs not a lot of people are pressing - I can find it in a few places some places have rosin and half chosen but it's not as common as BHO and pho and there's so many dispensaries that grow their own bud and they do their own in-house extractions so something like this I can I can pretty much get really cheap any day of the week if I'm looking around so for me to pay five times as much for this it's a little little far-fetched I honestly I'd rather have five grams of this and haven't done but yet and it's just I like volume I like to do a lot of dub so I'm gonna go back and forth on these we're gonna compare I just want to shave this I got this the same day I kick it costs literally one-fifth the price I'm just gonna see if it's if it's it if it's 20% it's good like it doesn't make oh god I just paid so much money but anyway anyway anyway yeah that's that's solid for the price that's sell it for $15 grand look um I I think it's good I think that that the rosin is good I'm gonna dab the rod let me have a bucket that was that was the I don't even know of the other strain is [Music] [Music] I mean it's definitely better [Music] the Robins better smoother and tastes a little better you can't really compare the highs because I'm better than both back for it but it's all about the taste for me and it is smoother is it pay five times the price smoother [Music] I don't think so because it's not it's not five times as good yeah I don't even know how you would get five times as give it something like this this isn't the best this isn't the best cheap batter that I've got but for something to be five times as good as this would be pretty impressive so this is not five times as good probably not worth five times the price if I see it on deals I may get it but I don't think it's worth anything that's worth three times the price two times the price even thirty forty five bucks I get why it costs so much it's a it's a little bit less common not as many people are making it and you get lower yields with it I get why it it costs more but it's not currently it's not at the price point where it's super worth it for me to only buy rosin maybe if I had a press and I could get amazing yields myself but I don't grow and I don't have any interest in growing so it's like I don't have to buy all my nugs anyway to smash it so kind of interesting I like finding deals so maybe I'll get excited about finding a deal in the future but yeah this isn't actually the most expensive gram of concentrate I've ever purchased a few years ago I remember purchasing a I purchased several grams actually a full melt bubble hash that I got remember the dispensary but I got some full melt bubble I think it was about eighty eight bucks a gram I think I remember paying just under ninety a gram it was really really good stuff it was like some of the craziest stuff I ever spent I I gotta go back and look for some pictures of it cuz it was a few years ago those full mount bubble hash grams I got were like pretty good but after I got a mouse this isn't worth eighty eight bucks a gram what the [ __ ] did I just do so I kind of feel that way here what the [ __ ] that I just do but we made a video that's what the [ __ ] we just did so let's do a few more dabs of this [ __ ] might as well I've only taken out several dollars off of it I don't see if we can take several more I'm interested in the cold start here so let's do that [Music] here's a few dollars [Music] yeah this is good stuff still I wish I could afford you dabs well this was actually pretty fun and I'm pretty blessed after all those naps and I'm glad I finally

you're watching this hope it's going great for you we've got a little video here I haven't really done many of these but a lot of other cannabis content creators do these videos and I think a lot of people enjoy it we've got some strain reviews coming up today and of course we're starting with the hottest hash on the alerting rec market happy cabbage farms so happy cabbage farms they came into camp in probably about four months ago I don't know exactly when they came on to the Oregon rec market but at the time it was a pretty Minzy era in the Oregon rec market here in Benton there was just a lot of the companies have really slipped towards the end of the summer and a lot of their stuff really wasn't tasting as good as it was towards the beginning of the summer then comes heavy cabbage farms with hash robison and we don't see hot rods in a lot in the rec market because it's such an expensive and kind of niche product there's not very many people that are searching to pay a lot of money for hash rasam but when you [ __ ] try this hash frozen you're just sucked right on back in guys it is ridiculous this stuff I will tell you I have tried tons of hot rods and a lot of the times I'm going to say that's my favorite hat rosin because I don't get to try it very often happy cabbage now has been around for about four months and they are a group in our circle it's just been around I've gotten to dab it a lot and I've gotten to dab a lot of other hash rosin because I don't have to pay for it other people have it and I will tell you guys there's a couple strands that I have not liked from them but these four right here that I have are so titties I would stick my face between all of them and motorboat myself to death this is hands-down the best half rosin I have ever smoked and it's on the wreck more kit if you are over 21 you can buy this you don't have to [ __ ] buy it black market you don't have to pay the $120 for black market six star hash rosin it gets it cannot expensive for a while there guys so to see a company coming out with stuff that's between sixty and seventy five dollars and medic maybe even cheaper than that that's super impressive and just such a breath of refreshing air so this guy I've got open right here first thing when I open it this is the purple starburst og six star like just what in there is just a bad thing to say let's take a look at what we going got going on in this jar alrighty here we have the purple starburst og 6 star you guys can see it's nice and flaky there's no real huge clumps partly because I dabbed a lot of them partly because it is 6 star and it is just gorgeous look at that color sorry for the shaking I'm filming on my phone they check that out just absolutely gorgeous I am completely enthralled with the look of this rosin I'm enthralled with the look as well as the smell a second you open up this up you get hit in the face with the real ocean groan oh gee smell and it's been a long time since we've gotten that we're getting more chem more gassy oh geez out here this is real ocean groan oh gee and then on the end of it is like this almost faint hint of like purple lavender not in a floral way at all but in a very very gassy way like I can't even begin to explain this we're gonna go ahead and take it yeah we got two rigs out today we first we're gonna start out with the prophecy glass and get a little function shot and I'll shop for you guys we don't have the cleanest rigs or bangers today just kind of caught me on an off cleaning day but maybe we should still be able to see that function right we're gonna start off with the purple starburst it guys this stuff is absolutely amazing I cannot tell you how much I recommend going and trying just the strain right here all of happy cabbage farm is fantastic this strain right here hands down my favorite let's go ahead and get her heat it up and get into some freakin turf skies I am excitement for this video you can not believe how hard it is to have four jars of happy cabbage sitting in a drawer knowing you can't smoke it because you have to come with it it's literally heartbreaking I also want to give them a huge shout out for sponsoring the 420 of it at the Pacific Circle that was absolutely amazing they set up a tab bar anybody that came by could have their stuff a company that produces this high a product of this high quality of product just allow anybody to come up and smoke it no no [ __ ] questions asked is just amazing huge shout out to them for that call that good set a timer for 45 seconds alright we're gonna go ahead get in here and scoop ourselves out a nice flaky dab of this gorgeous six star here we go guys first dab of the half cab farms Cheers [Music] oh good lordy that is so delicious straight to the head immediately my whole head warm fuzzy dice feels delicious but you just know media we have strongest it because it hits you momentarily after you take it down man is a good video to be filming guys yeah I also got to say this is mind-bending how good that flavor is and how much flavor there is usually with a lot of even really good tasting dabs only a small percentage of flavor this there is a large percentage of flavor in that [ __ ] strain it is amazing how much you get out of it I love it for our first thing to have in the morning like if you got one dab to set your whole day straight that's it right there that purple starburst og alright move on to the next string I believe this one was a collab width Oh pull on a stick and throw it into my house I rip the [ __ ] alright I threw the Box away in the heavy collab on it [ __ ] oh no without gaps in garden Gadsden Gardens okay this one is a collab with Gadsden garden and this is Tropicana punch now this one has a much much different look to it let me give you guys an initial smell test it was like pomegranate and man what is that that is a good [ __ ] smell right there it was like pomegranate and fish I'm not like just weed but the actual cush like when you're exhaling a cush strain it smells like that oh man that's delicious now this one has a much different look to it way more waxy was this one what was this one called no just Tropicana punch hash rosin not six-star not their batter or their jam just hash shots but still absolutely delicious looking kind of looks like peanut butter and this was not what I do what it looked like when they gave it to me when it was cold it was much much more pretty and hadn't like waxed up into this solid state yet still [ __ ] beautiful we're gonna switch it up we've got the DBE 503 slimeball rig all ready to go over here a dab of this junk ambush I believe this is the one that gave me a job on the night of 4/20 and I was just absolutely mind blown by how good the flavor of it was so much rudiness to it but still keeping a really nice base in the OG gas cushy that kind of a chem that kind of a taste so I'm keeping it sweet waste in there but still having some food on top I'm a big fan of fruity strains but when I have to smoke all day every day it's not my favorite I really really want the Kim gasps og scum push stuff like that all right that's all set a timer 45 seconds that's not that's not the right dance isn't it there was a dude I'm just gonna stop him all right if vijaya tease this one's a lot easier to load up I'm just gonna take this a nice big chunk here boom I am gonna be so blitzed by the end of this guy's four dabs of hatch rosin and that I haven't gotten into this yet but I'm sure you guys read the title we're taking out Widowmaker at the end but yeah let's do it [ __ ] drop the dead Cheers [Music] [Music] get right with that safe before really really fruity but it keeps its [ __ ] feet planted firmly in a nice little og tastes good very clean - I mean like of course there's no solvents in it but a lot of other people's half-frozen I get a a wheezing in my lungs and that's usually the reason I stay away from hats Rossum as you guys can hear [Music] there is some coffee but there's no wheeze and that is what I love about this stuff it just seems so clean so pure you're tasting exactly what this amazing weed was meant to taste like guys we're going nips out go the [ __ ] nips out Jesus Christ two tabs of hash rosin in we've got the purple starburst and oh wait no the Tropicana punch and the purple starburst yeah okay yes yes boom so we've got punch breath up next this is their jam and this one unfortunately has slowly disintegrated in a series of very unfortunate dabs that were completely unavoidable but I think a little bit left so we have something for this video right here I'm gonna zoom the camera in so you guys can see it's really really clear and very very light in color but it is so ganbei good I can't even begin to tell you guys how many Terps they've got packed into that gorgeous little [ __ ] doing GM glove there when you get in this one it immediately has like a purple smell I use that to describe a lot away I don't know what the purple smell is I don't know what I'm describing there I'm sure there's some people out there that are gonna be like yeah and there's some people are gonna be like what the [ __ ] he's that high already but it does it smells purple purple with a hint of fruit punch on the end that's exactly what I'm getting clenched breath and it's really really cool how true their flavors are guys like you can't even begin to tell you how many other hot rods and strings like taste we're like this one's strong in and you taste it that's great it's amazing how many people just they'll name their strains anything just because that's what's hype that's what's selling right now these guys they've just got some fire a sweet in fire ass hash on the way out switching it back up again to the prophecy glass for our punch breath dab here I'm gonna go ahead and heat this up man guys given that Widowmaker at the end it's gonna be so brutal I have already baked like a cupcake my gourd is gone stone to the bone I just [ __ ] rent I think you guys a good idea of how ripped I am I've taken two gaps and I already am starving I don't feel like I need a turf map two naps like I thank you I'm taking seven gram damage guys this we just took like maybe point one maybe and I'm already ready for a turf down at the end of this I'm going to pass out right here after I've ordered new greens call it good BAM wham Shazam set timer for 45 seconds Thank You Carla alright let's go ahead scrape ourselves out some of this leaving just enough left to put into our Widowmaker jab guys we got we got some crazy stuff going with a maker jab this punch breath was definitely one of my favorites it was a lighter high than the six star starburst og but had just about the same percentage of flavor it's fan-fucking-tastic really allowed me to go about my day if I was smoking it in the morning before say a meeting or something it would be really good for that not if you were gonna go out and want a dad that was gonna last you three to four hours that would be the purple starburst six star that stuff is just [ __ ] tits it is so strong BAM Thank You Carla let's take this damn choose people it's tons tons and tons of flavor [Music] [Music] now we got the sweats going big time holy Jebus how is it is hot in here oh my god keeping you close holy [ __ ] this was a good fight hey promised the Widowmaker again oh [ __ ] turf sweats aren't [ __ ] real oh my god whoa next up we got some margarita punch six star don't let the nips cool off for a second here wow that overheated a needle is in the red Oh rubbie oh my god I completely forgot we have water over here not sponsored by but shout out the can event for carrying the happy cabbage four guys are in Central Oregon looking for a place to pick this stuff up get a man got it they got so many different strains oh yes we got one left guys we've got the margarita place six star same with the starburst og let's go ahead and take peak here in this jar very very flaky but it is all stuck together none of it is gonna fall out I don't believe ya all stuck in there when I first got it was flaky like if you sneezed it would go everywhere like a pile of blow it was pretty [ __ ] flaky oh man oh man this one probably actually I'm gonna have to take my my vote back for the smell this one has better smell than the purple starburst dojin form starburst oh gee I do believe tastes better but god damn margarita punch they're definitely a hint of that tropic punch in there but there is a kick what is that kick gasps that is straight gasp oh man yeah once you get past that punch just gassy oh that is good it doesn't have the og smell of the purple starburst I mean it is just Tropicana punch instead of deep purple starburst OG um but it does have a massive undertone of some gassy flavors go ahead keep the slime ball ring up last one and probably take a little two-minute walk around the house and then we're gonna dive into that way a but nothing's more currently done I am so big guy so I can feel my hind legs coming down [ __ ] just set a timer for 45 seconds Thank You Carla thank you very much I can feel my eyelids coming down like heavy hard it is I'm gonna be in for a real long afternoon here we got a photo we got the Gus glass show circle tonight [ __ ] I'm gonna be licking windows all night long guys so yeah super flaky super super potent smell let's get some [ __ ] taste in here oh yes oh yes wants to scrape it all off the bottom it is super flaky again yep all right we got a margarita punch six star and hash browns and over here I bring a ball right up in clothes for you guys kitchens function off the first initial hit oh my god I need a new cord after this video it's not even baked out of it it's just oh [ __ ] cheers everyone a lot more gas when you smoke it less of the push flavor than the go wow they're really not my favorite in terms of flavor definitely not bad whatsoever it's still delicious I'm probably ranked this number three the Tropicana punch probably be my least favorite out of the four but honestly I would buy all four strains again thanks they say that they're that good all scraped up on a piece of paper see if we can get it um damn er and then we will take a lap mop it off a bit and take this [ __ ] Widowmaker all those cobbles alright we got our four grams right here I have completely forgotten which one goes to which cap so that will be interesting we're just going to go ahead and see if we can take this damper here and get some of each of these on here it's not going to be a monster dabbe but I mean big enough for some fun boom there's our starting scoop of the punch breath now this is this is the margarita punch now this is gonna be a little difficult this stuff is so flaky I'm not quite sure we might have to get like a spoon for this so I'm gonna just take some of this and yeah there's no way it's gonna stick on there take that off and then last but not least we need the what what was this I forget [ __ ] I think I've lost more oil in here than I got out definitely alright well there's that there's what I've got and there's also some on this damper too this stuff has all different consistencies let me see if I can't like splurge some of this long as dabber just smush it all together that's kind of working I'd say that's working pretty damn good alright let's look at our dab here guys oh [ __ ] yeah oh Jesus alright alright let's let's get her going oh my god this is gonna be fun I literally didn't move any of this because I was terrified that the dab would fall off the dabber I think we are very lucky and fortunate that we got all that hash onto a bro without any of it falling off I didn't I think that was going to happen as this on a monster Widowmaker but like I was saying before guys - dabs in I was pretty [ __ ] toasted we're at a point now where I am just I'm good at I could be good for today for smuggling I am [ __ ] why are we doing this because you got your [ __ ] awesome but I love each and every one of you that's why we're [ __ ] doing this get in there fam calling that good guys this is

always please be kind to one another Cheers I'll see you guys soon", "UNWHow4VH3k": "well we are back we are back and we are pressing a quarter of moxie viper cookies okay uh this is i haven't i haven't pressed a lot of moxie uh in a while so this will be fun this stuff is ringing in at uh 26.9 percent combined thc thca we've got a 121 micron bag here and the crd 30 ton triptech rosin press is set to 180 degrees fahrenheit i don't use timers i don't use the gauge that's on this pump so please don't ask me how long i leave it on just watch the video and you'll see how long i leave it on for okay so this has been rehydrated with hydra stones and we're going to load this bag up hope everybody is staying safe staying medicated and being good to each other out there just a reminder if you are a medical marijuana patient in the pittsburgh area and you have dispensary flour and you would like to have it turned into gold please come and see me in penn hills here at the studio i do that for patients i press form for free that is a patient's helping patients initiative that i've been doing since 2018 never charge a patient to press their medicine for it it is important that patients get good quality medicine at a price that they can afford and i am trying to help in that respect so here is our quarter get this thing all put into a nice little package and move these lights up here and get this placed right where i want it to be there we go that paper of course anytime you're doing live stuff okay all right so let's get that out of the way and get this centered up where i want it to be get the light in there on it real good so you can see it get real close and put it right there all right here we go let's get this valve closed on the pump let's make some medicine there's nothing i enjoy more right now than just getting the best that this flower can offer and as long as you treat this plant with respect she will give herself to give you the best medicine that you can have much better quality than anything you will get in the dispensary as a concentrate solidness is definitely the way to go and rosin whether it be hash rosin or flower rosin is a step way bigger than any of the commercially available chemically extracted concentrates so let's just remember where the quality is and the flavor because this is a full spectrum extract and take terpenes and winterize it do all kinds of crazy stuff they just you just get the buds and the essence of them their soul that's the way i like to approach it so as you can see it's going to get harder and harder to see so i'm going to let this go now and start concentrating on this press i'm going to let that heat soak in for about 30 seconds before i finish get the full pressure i don't know if there's any big drops tomorrow for the weekend but i would be watching the healing center my tree rise all of those guys because you know how that goes friday if you get a big drop and if you're not ready to grab it online you can lose out real easy all right almost at pressure there we go that's where i want to be with it let it sit there for a minute i'm going to pull this shot back out oh yeah this should be fun so again moxie doesn't come out with a lot of flour they've been coming out with more lately and i don't get a chance to press much of it because it's usually at the high end of the price spectrum not a lot of patients bring it to me so i figured i'd grab some and we'll see what see what it does you know and there isn't a whole lot else you can do except uh try it and it goes into my database you find out how it stacks up against the other grower processors and the other strains that they're putting out so i'm just getting the scale ready i already have a jar make sure i get the tear on that first seventeen yep that's great okay are you ready you ready to see it here we go okay viper cookies what'd you give us oh oh yes oh yeah i'll tell you what take a look at that that looks mighty mighty fine to me so let us get that paper off of here turn off the i am done pressing unless unless there's a patient that comes over with something for me let me get the shot out and redirected all right a small blowout no big deal take my tools here clean a little bit of clean rosin off the end of that but like i said blowouts happen no matter whose bag you're using luckily they don't happen all the time so let's get this fired up tara and philip she looks like a happy plant this thing was coming off looking like it was made from washed flour uh and that it didn't just come from straight flour some of this consistency is very reminiscent of a lot of hash rosin i see being shown on ig gas rosin's fantastic it's just not practical for medical patients in pennsylvania because of our prices you know so pennsylvania and the medical marijuana program flower rosin is king of solidness because you can't get the good stuff good ash rosin at the dispensers they don't sell it they don't make it people who do make it aren't making it for the legal market so best you're gonna get medicine wise from somebody who can craft it immediately for you somebody like me who's doing flower rosin just like this gotta love this plant with all your heart to be good at doing this consistently you got to be having access to flour that is of amazing quality to get this kind of result oh this stuff came out so beautiful oh yeah oh moxie my good friend dave perlow gabe pirlo who is the ceo of moxie he and i have had a very nice relationship as far as his business ideas about doing solventless believe me when the feds lift the the lid off this whole thing and deschedule this plant you're gonna start seeing a lot more solventless on the market because it will be on the recreational side probably but you will see it moxie has always been a concentrate centric company it started off they didn't have the canopy enough to to sell flowers so all they sold were their really nice concentrates and their cartridges i love their cartridges liquid moxies melon wreck is awesome ellerange is fantastic a big fan of their distillate cartridges but their flowers always been kind of rare you know now they're stepping up their their production ability and now they're coming out with more flour which is really cool so let's see what we got for a yield and wow 0.61 well when you take away the 17 grams for the jar that is well that is not what i would consider an acceptable yield okay again my bare minimum acceptable yield is half half a gram per eight this comes out to be point three per eighth which i mean here's the thing though the quality is amazing okay and in terms of the look of it it smells incredible you know but there it is maybe i can get it you can see the better light i mean look at the quality of that there's no disputing the fact that moxie makes really good flour the problem is the flour that they make or that they grow doesn't have the wax and lipid profiles to make them a good candidate for solventless extraction via rosin press so always bear in mind that when you're going to buy flour you need to pick strains that work for you and you have to be willing to accept that you may get a strain like this like this viper cookies which looks to be amazing probably going to taste incredible uh but the yield is not sufficient for for me from for me personally it may be for you as a patient you may be a baller and can afford to buy enough eights to get enough of this pressed to make it worth medicating with it i tend to look for the higher producing strains i think this is an excellent strain i bet it's a great strain for the other uses dry vaping quote unquote um but for rosin it's one i would probably take a pass on personally but if you're seeing this and you're liking what you see grab yourself some dispensary flower and get on over here to penn hills and come and see me and i will do this for you too stay safe stay medicated be good to each other everybody have a good day", "hooRyPMMGDs": "[Music] welcome to wheat entertainment and every day i'm always on the hunt looking at menus looking for the right drops and today we're going to talk about something that i've tried before but not the same plant plant number i should say and it's crazy how now they have in this case this is london pound cake number 75 by cookies but in the past i tried london pound cake number 53 and everyone says no no no you got to try number 75 and i know that number 53 and i tried this i'm going to say it's probably a year and a half ago london poundcake number 53 it made my heaviest list and i'm not really on the hunt for heavy heavy flowers my hunt is very directed and very focused towards flowers that are heavy enough with focus that can grin me out because i like to use flowers and go around my day and if it knocks me out i'm just not productive and the doctor needs to be productive i got stuff to do so look at this beautiful bud and today we're going to check it out there's been so many times people asked me to try london pound cake number 75 and i look at him and say no look at him i just say i tried number 53 and said no no no you got to try number 75. so i already got two scoops in vapor cup straw this is number three it's about the same amount as a bong hit and we're gonna stick this down into my favorite vapor cup and you're going to see this cup right here it uh in about a minute and a half it's going to heat up that flour it doesn't burn it just heats it all the way around and the flour is three times removed from the heat has great airflow and you're going to see that it releases the water vapor the terpenes the cannabinoids and the natural oils from the plant and the taste is just through the roof and instead of taking one or two bong rips you can get 20 draws and those 20 draws can take you to the moon this is an incredible device it was developed right here in the san fernando valley in los angeles to be the best so people anytime they wanted to your work take a walk you're at home go in the backyard you can use this leave very little smells i love this thing it's the greatest thing i ever used in my entire life if you gave me a bong and this on day one i'm picking this and i used a bong for 25 years anyway you can see london pound cake number 75 comes in this package and this flower has 24 thc but if i remember connect correctly and i'm going to do a comparison in the future of the number 75 versus the number 53 of london pound cake i think the 53 at a much higher thc than this but everyone keeps talking about this thing they talk about it they talk about it and talk about it so finally when it showed up i grabbed it and you can see it says london pound cake uh and it's got a picture of queen elizabeth right on the front of this thing i don't know how they get away with that but i guess you're in a foreign country you can't really do too much right you get away with what you can london pound cake number 75 so that's about how much time it takes for vapor cup to get ready and you could see that the vapor's starting to uh accumulate right in the straw right here and that's what we're looking for that's the magic right there so let's check it out london pound cake number 75 at a vapor cup i've got this thing set to 320 i'm gonna leave it at 320. i'm not really even sure why it's at 320 but we're going to try this at 320 here we go so one thing about vapor cup you have ultimate control of your flowers so let's say you you you use apricot and on the third draw you know it's going rough already you can turn down the heat now that straw worth may be already too late to fix but if you go in with a second straw you need no if it's rough put less heat on it and you can see there's a low heat that can make that flower be less rough if the vape is super smooth and you want to make more vape you can keep turning up the heat some flowers can take more heat they're all crystallized they can give you a lot of flavor this thing's incredible you really can understand flour really well with vapor cup you see i'm really enjoying this vape so what did i think of london pound cake number 75 this flower was a little bit different than the number 53. this flower had a gassy og taste it was piney and since uh london pancake number 50 53 knocked me out the first time i used it i tested this at late night when i would be you know i was actually a little sleepy when i even started it but what happened was number 75 it woke me up which is completely the opposite of number 53 and it's crazy how you can have the same plant london pound cake where number 53 knocked me out and number 75 and absolutely didn't knock me out this flower woke me up and it was a cruiser it's not really sleepy and it's not near as heavy as number 53 so those two flowers have different feelings it's crazy london pound cake number 53 knockout punch london pancake number 75 is a good cruiser and what did i think of this flower we're comparing all the flowers and i guess i'm going to have to have london pound cake 53 and 75 is two categories on the multi-stream review right next time i do it but what did i think of nominees number 75 i give this flower an 8.75 it surely didn't grin me out but this is a good flower much better than i thought it would be i thought i was heading for the knockout punch but actually this was a very enjoyable flower and i see why all the brothers liked it and i like it too this flower london pound cake number size is 8.75 it's a good strong flower thanks for joining in if you want to get a vapor cup and i'm telling you the holiday is coming right now and right now there is good free stuff there is a good grinder there is a good aluminum container uh also maybe in your pack you can find a free airflow straw high flow airflow straw uh thanks for joining in if you like the videos uh please subscribe i'm the doctor i'll be back tomorrow party on my friends [Music]", "YqHusgV-caQ": "everybody how you doing as promised I would give you a video featuring my new prototype kt20 mini press then I just got in today from CR D so what are we going to use to inaugurate this well never gonna go with some GTI's star tribe picked it up today at the healing center of Monroeville I have rehydrated it with spinach leaf as you can see right here there is spinach leaf here so I'm going to get rid of the spinach leaf and we shall press the flower because the rehydration process is definitely done what it's supposed to do here do this out yeah I'll tell you what I the the pictures do not do this press justice it is a completely amazing piece of functional artwork that Chas Ryan at CRD out in Oxnard California he's the one that you want to get your presses from trust me on this for the price point for the features the engineering that goes into this you can't beat this guy now we are gonna press not 1/8 but to we're gonna do the entire quarter press and we're going to use my nug Smasher 160 micron 7 brand bags I haven't used these before I've only either used the big 14 grand ones or I use the the regular eight ones three and a half gram that I normally use but since this is a new bag our new size bag for me I'm going to try it out let's see how it works for us this stuff absolutely amazing the rehydration process went flawlessly we've got seven grams of rehydrated flour we've got 160 micron nub Smasher back and we are going to load it up with this green and turn it into gold for everybody that's the thing and you want to turn green into gold this is how you do that using a machine like mine you guys can get one to his prices are if you compare feature for feature capacity for capacity with any other manufacturer bras and presses you won't even come close to the value but you get ordering from this man here and we'll customize it any way you want you want different size plates you want a hydraulic ram instead of a hand they'll do all that for you but make it any color you want to put your logo on it anything you want the man is there to serve and he does an amazing job as long as FedEx doesn't mess up the shipment it's all good so here is our quarter in our bag we're gonna I'm going to trim this off a little bit here make it a little easier to get in the press and I already got the paper in the press I got the press heated up to 200 degrees that is my normal pressing temperature for anything I'm doing for myself I am now going to move this and put this on the plate now I'm going to move the camera that you can see what's going on give me just a moment here let's get this moved over here there we go let's get this lighting situation a little better so we can do here just bear with me I don't have any helpers today on the camerawork so trying to do this all myself and if we're lucky I'm going to get to see this thing - its drip tech it's usually pressing quarters I can get that to work so right there that's where we want to be let's bring down the hammer okay all right a little tension on that paper now I'm gonna bring this down okay let's get this up here actually you know what that's the problem those magnets didn't hold very well it's okay I got these he's worth just fine all right there we go now get the camera in here so you can see it really really well they just kind of move in look at that view right there and that beautiful okay there it is there's the slug now that's you a nice view of it let's bring the pressure together oh we're almost at the heat some point already that's good that's real good loving this and move the lighting a little bit give you better better angle how's that yeah get you nice and focused in on that bag cause you're gonna start seeing the magic happen I am slowly bringing these plates together in a controlled way just like with the original design of the mini it has a weighted handle which aids in controlled pressure without the need of a gauge again it's one of the features that I really like about his presses besides the fact that they're user serviceable which is again just priceless and its value let's see what the star tribes doing I hope everybody got to the dispensary today and got some of that flour before it before it went away at least all the good stuff I you know they were rationing it out I couldn't get as much of the birthday cake as I wanted for sure and the star tribe I grabbed only because it was the closest thing to 30% I could find so we're gonna do our best with this we're gonna get the best medicine we can but tomorrow morning gonna be in line at the dispensary Monroeville at the healing center because I heard that they got a nice drop a prime flower tonight so I'm gonna be there I'm gonna get it so I can press it at the event at the Monroeville Convention Center this weekend the holistic wellness Expo body mind and spirit is going to be going on at the South Hall and I will be featured there along with my friends sloth we will be pressing rosin both dispensary flower and hemp CBD it's going to be educational it's going to be a lot of fun and it's definitely going to DANC up the entire venue it's gonna be great had a great time in March doing this got an interview with dispense magazine back then they just published it today in this newest edition of dispensed magazine look for it in your local dispensary or at some vape shops that are around the carry it there's a really really nice article in there that they did about an interview that I had back in March with them and an event very similar to this one this will be a much bigger event so I'm hoping that everybody shows up there's gonna be a lot of people coming through I'd be a lot of flower getting pressed I promise you that so I'm gonna start adding some more pressure now and we're gonna start seeing some production here pretty quickly I would imagine there we go you can already soon as I added just a little more pressure to it there it goes there it goes look at how beautiful that is a happy happy plant properly rehydrated pressed with care and we're gonna get some awesome medication out of this you can't be in a hurry with rosin you just can't okay this is a craft this isn't a science it's not hobby this is a something that takes a lot of dedication to your craft so if you don't have this kind of dedication you might as well not even do this just by concentrates in the dispensary and pay outrageous prices if you're real serious about medicating these presses pay for themselves and savings very very quickly I know the cost is high this press here is the new design it's probably going to run somewhere just under $700 I'm not exactly sure on the pricing go to WWE rd online comm for his current pricing and you can also set up how you want it modified because he will customize it for you look at that beautiful gold coming out of that green that's what I do people I turn green into gold now question is is it gonna flow off these plates we're gonna find out back up here okay I'll back the camera up refocus it right down here and see if I get a little closer right there okay watch the mat because I'm about ready to tilt this thing yeah just a little tight from production but here it is if this thing tilted I'm gonna come back out here so that you can see how it's tilted you see that that's its trick get this stuff off the heat quickly and it's already starting to drip people see that there's your dripping starting right there so let's give it a little more love right here try to keep my fingers off the plates Pop's Malta's they are hot look at that and it's a happy plant right there just given us it's beautiful essence this is the soul of this plant and we are getting the best of it treating it well pressing it with care here's a nice look at that I'm going to take the camera off of here and give you a nice look what's coming off these plates look look at that just gorgeous so bring it around I'd give you a whip up underneath there we go back out of this you see this here's all our medicine trying to come off that heat look at the drips it just drips oh my gosh it stuff is just pouring off of here and then if you look carefully as it drops you can see little rosin webs form sometimes really really cool stuff I'm gonna put this thing back in the cradle now so that I can reposition this I'll pull out just a little bit so you can see what it's doing add a little more a little more pressure see if you can't lose some more mature there you go there's a nice rosin web coming off of there yes look at the color on it it's so beautiful just gorgeous oh yeah it's still still just given itself to us you know this is love right here this is love for this plant the plant loves you back you know that's what this is about making medicine better medicine then it comes flowers great you start off with great flower you end up with really great medicine not always the biggest yields but always good quality all the end quality out with pressing rosin if your rosin doesn't come out looking like this it's dark and sappy doesn't snow right doesn't taste right your flower sucks I don't care who we are go back to the drawing board and grow some better flower you know I'm sorry but this press never lies its crucible always was and it will tell you if your flowers not not tip-top now the lighting is not giving you an accurate look at what this stuff actually how nice it looks under here the color is just amazing so let's think we're done with the major drip edge so we're gonna flip it back up we're gonna step back out of there move the camera and we're back up here together get the lighting going on and there you go there's now we're at the final stage but getting further along in our press now so we're going to keep monitoring it for both the pressure and the color and the production I'm starting to add a little bit of pressure very very gently I don't want to have a blowout the color on this is just amazingly beautiful just gorgeous yeah there it is see it really well there and it is still producing medicine this this plant is very very happy GTI is knocking it out the park with just about everything they're coming out with that's in the upper THC range prime again just fantastic results and of course grass roots those are my three tops if you asked me what flower to get you can never go wrong with any of those three growers ever you can sometimes catch something good from Cresco you can sometimes catch something good form alehrer sometimes from Terrapin not very often but sometimes but if you were producing rosin if this is what you do you stick with those three until there's others that come along to prove themselves worthy because up to now there are the only ones who consistently put out product and quality that makes pressing medicine from that flower not only easy but just darn right damn well enjoyable I love doing this it's so satisfying to me you know it's like those videos you watch on YouTube that oddly satisfying videos this is what this is for me but it's real life so still getting a lot of production out of this it's just not happening quite as quickly and I am really wanting to err on the side of caution with these new bags I really don't want to have to clean up a blowout but I'm gonna keep giving it a little bit more I got to get a feel for how these bags feel on the press one we're at max pressure I think we're just about or we need to be just don't want to see plant material squirting out between these plates that would kind of put a bummer on it for me and I think we're about done here production seems to a slow due to almost nothing definitely at max pressure here don't ruin that so let me get my magnets put them back and we shall see what we got from GT I start right there we go [Music] and unlike my older version of my over press and get this back out here sorry about that and get you all team back into what I'm doing over here okay I mean can you um can you get me centered up here and tighten it back down oh look at that perfectly pressed puck no blowout right at the edge of it though right at the edge almost had one that's good good good now let this go down let me okay very good so we'll give this a general cooldown [Music] let's see when we get off the paper don't forget you got a lot of stuff sitting over here that came off the plates early but for right now we're gonna get what it it has on the paper so is it gonna gather up okay it's a little on the southeast side nothing I haven't experienced before with this strain so I'm not worried about it just takes a little bit different approach I'm just gonna perch this a little more patiently I'm just gonna take our time go over this paper very carefully now we're gonna get up all the good stuff there we go this is gonna be nice we're gonna weigh it up gonna see what our yield was for the 7 grams of flour that went in how much did we get back in medicine and again understand that all I'm doing all this process is is removing the unneeded plant material from the effective compounds in the flour it's all we're doing here difference is just not using chemicals just use a beat and pressure it's very green every byproduct yields the additionally valuable products", "Rh_dd_TqU30": "[Music] [Music] you", "p7xm9Y8P-Y8": "don't y'all just [ __ ] love it when you wake up to the perfect funny Roy sent me that challenge like two days ago right before it blew up but I was gonna do one just completely spaced it and I woke up this morning to that and it killed me so [ __ ] good what's going on everybody but see how somebody is 17 here I'm still chilling in bed it is what time 8:12 so 10:30 we are gonna be going over to Highland provisions and that is where Casey an unknown Terp and Tobiah Minzy Bobby both are producing cash so we're gonna get to tour their facility which is something I'm really really hyped on I think the only other hash facility move toward is Bo's down in Southern Oregon always such an awesome thing to see where they produce the hash because it's so different from pho where you have all these big cylinders and you can't really see what's going on no the hash you can just pop your head right on into those rosin presses and see what the [ __ ] being squirted out there I gotta get up I took the coldest shower ever this morning so I'm nice and awake but also very cold which is why I'm still in bed plans after that include going to Portland hopefully we're gonna meet up with crash grab some weed for ground and check out a couple houses anything beyond that we don't have planned what's getting into our NATO here we go all nice and ready for the day real quick before we get into a DAB I'm gonna gather up everything we need for the trip right here all right I think that's everything I need it always helps me to have everything laid out so I can see it all at once like yes we have everything and I think we're good looks like it's an absolutely gorgeous day outside so I'm gonna go ahead and heat up the dragon and then we're gonna go take a dip in the Sun I 100 million percent drop this dab in the dirt can you look at that I love this piece even though I was like oh my god I could never hit that it to show delicate no this piece right here is the single most durable piece of glass I own it is so thick look at this you can just hold it by the tail let's go in cheers everybody drop more of my dad on the dirt really hoping we can meet up with crash and Portland folk hopefully find some better stuff gotta love this thing early in the morning and in the Sun all right II think it's almost time to head over got about 15 minutes oh man this was what 26 minutes ago looks like we are gonna be seeing some fire today can't wait to see this facility they have those vehicles look awfully familiar one STI and Tobias truck gross do figure in here there you go buddy so we've been adorned suits we're going to leave space this is this is awesome so I think I mentioned before but Highland provisions is the company that Casey and Tobiah are doing ash for now it looks like [ __ ] oh my good god what a thing to walk-ins are you [ __ ] me what some people might remember this from a long long time ago these aren't the same place with this was our press that's [ __ ] crazy oh yeah I'll bring you sticker next time god damn there is so much I love Jesus that's [ __ ] sexy Jesus [ __ ] the first place gamer do you guys go to any brews yeah no he just came from here yeah we peaked in the green room over there that was st. Leger I can't believe how big it is this is the first step if you want to wash it and knocks the trichomes off yeah and then you got to put in the freeze-dried let it dry for like 36 hours altogether and then come out throws bing-bang-boom [ __ ] lit and then here we have the final form people and then these guys are gearing up yeah so those are those just got charged and then don't go in the fridge for about look at the color that hatch people wow you guys are [ __ ] slaying dick out your holy [ __ ] look at that Oh oh my god oh my god bro that's a that's a big [ __ ] jar right there [ __ ] so straight 120 full not baby so they're talking about starting to do up some some full melts for well just of Oregon yeah Pilon provision full melts coming soon got deal oh my god you kidding the camera can't even see it it's so I want to bring it around is that that's crc dust broken telecom let me do a line from cured material this is cascade grapes oh I think this would be like 30 under $40 a G in the dissensus for hash that's unheard of oh my god that doesn't look bad at all now it looks fantastic yeah and it just smells like great like smells fantastic - it tastes delicious and just like ice it is to reach all consumers you know they I mean that's [ __ ] awesome what is what is your top shelf go for like 60 to 70 AG which is still really reasonable and I think we're gonna get to see a lot of that coming up - that one this smells me and that color is wild she hates Tropicana yes oh my god wow that smells like dude that's like in Jesus look at it that's incest insane like pink yeah this pink - yeah the water was straight pink white that's so great it's so good and Casey was also telling us that these are all gummies and they're like gushers so they have liquid inside of them so you bite into them and you ask which in your mouth I think this is like a person looks wet yeah yeah what did that one for you 98 that oh yeah yeah that's got some og smell to it that's thick daddy take your daddy [ __ ] Nick bought damn by she think is that like it's 90 percent return from hash oh my god what yeah because it's single source they're growing it to make hash with it that's [ __ ] insanity we just gotta take one more long people this is not okay that's got to be going on over a pound right yeah that's why clock for 500 grams only I've ever seen that much happen people we are getting the see squish squish and squirters getting the temperatures all right blowouts [Music] come baby oh wow oh wow this oh my god it's a tidal wave splash me daddy splash oh shoot [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] holy [ __ ] running all the way down squish daddy Oh squish daddy holy [ __ ] [ __ ] damn it still got another 30 seconds yeah nom 22nd crazy and it's already pushed out that much yeah stop huddle down there at the bottom I see all the bubbles oh there's that GMO smoke god damn plate it is lemon Royale syzygy stained the whole place up like I'm freaking garlic orgy we do a lot of clothing for the most part so the men saw two weeks in in the cloners and then you know you get a you get some some beautiful girl girl but two weeks in the cloners and then they get transplanted to the racks and put in four inch square pots in cocoa and then they'll spend another two week on the racks under this just p5 fluorescent lights now this is where we have a lot of our just backup genetics and you know we always keep redundancy on like Oliver you know moms and then we have a lot of a lot of new seedlings together with one Zaffino hunts and [ __ ] now especially out here that we've only been here for you know just over a year I was gonna say it can't have been that yeah because some of these are let me let me see yeah there's some beats tall guys I'm six foot that is a 7 8 foot tall plan that's [ __ ] wild great bubba bubba kush sunday driver and you guys come on hand this this is this plot so these guys are just being moved in yes so these guys are just getting they'll go from the four inch square plots into a five gallon [Applause] this room wanted now a moving table system oh [ __ ] so that's that way we're not losing a lot any you know area for you know the actual aisleways and we're you know able to utilize all the square footage you know in here without wasting any space this is their next step from the room that we were just sent exactly we'll fill up this room they'll probably take us you know by this afternoon then we'll they'll spend another two weeks in here and then and then they'll be ready cuz we've just moved everything out of this room yesterday and filled another room cleaned it this morning and then our transplants you know we're like you know we can harvest the whole 72 light room in a day and then putting it in like few days and then be able to refill it again you know the resets are very this whole place is so clean its pristine pristinely clean so I'll turn on the green light so these just got put in here last night you get a different smell in the air - yeah - more than we do very deep cleaning of these rooms in between we'll wipe down every surface these are PVC walls will flush you know the entire condensate collection system well you know flush and take apart our entire irrigation system bring the tables back down that you know pretty much like they're brand new every place all our oil fires it's country money now we go through a very deep cleaning process you know really make sure that we're I've never seen anything like this this is easily the most efficient and high skill facility I've ever seen [ __ ] insane Wow in the middle that's why we have to create this going on this room there's a lot of Fino honk going on in the center of the room with Sour Diesel be x2 by Pharma welcome zero which is high so what those monsters are does I think that hels belles Wow to be a big boy jeez got cowboy Wow how far in of these these are about 25 days Wow so just start [Music] the flower really plants are you know sometimes doubling in size so that's really when we lay the trellis on you know pretty much right at the beginning and by the time that we breathe we're training them and through the trellis system to you know really try to form a uniform canopy this isn't probably the best example of the uniform canopy but this is more like what we go to fill you know and pretty much on the top and each one of these little squares and have as many jobs as possible you know periods are really uniform you've been holy [ __ ] it smells insane in here people these are huge yeah yeah yeah let me see your hand can I give this one a yellow eye where's that yeah oh yeah feel free that's that's the Cascade grape that's my c4 SSB LG crossed in my Montana shortened salad Apple Mail people who died on that highlight not a line brought right next to it that's my father bought cotton they're huge monsters this is ridiculous people ridiculous oh yeah a little man edema sorry [Music] what but this is lower talk about it maximizing canopy and probably feeling unifor yeah I think not there's no [ __ ] on the bottom that the Cascade grape is speeding out there's huge I can't believe if they can maintain their yeah awkwardness with all the egg up there like click with these guys this [ __ ] yeah it smells insane in here holy [ __ ] and then this is that like cut a Sour Diesel okay Nick point looks like some farms are deer and we have some new sour diesels from seed to Sour Diesel backcross juice Carmen I'm accelerating flour room to and that big female on tables this our Wow lineup and then this is that cowboy push all up and then I'm gonna sign them they're just smelling it's the same whoo Wow so everything in here will come and spend about 11 14 days on the drying racks in this room which is about 60 degrees and 60% humidity these are drops Santos this is Gina across with Tropicana cookie you know these are all in testers so these are all different phenotypes from that seat hon but this is most likely our winning phyno of building Hansy yeah dress combination MD and then the skittles and sour dog and that's from top dog cheese oh that's mom saying it wow so good and then here's another key know of that same Ross left orange a little less yeah and I'd say maybe leaning a little bit more onto the male side Wow that one smells crazy a little more potent smell say yes so this is a great example interior you see the same feedstock and you know these are two very you know you need Veena's yeah same plant just different feet notes yeah yeah I seen crossing their sisters same progeny this you know cowboy fish you sit on this beautiful you know from the help line that is actually the real keeper those purples oh wow oh wow what's the [ __ ] that is so potent holy [ __ ] yeah that's gotta I see why that's one of your favorites hook this up samples samples thank you so much just was funky honored guys check out check your local dispensaries check on Leafly look for Highland provisions and Casey's gonna be dropping some [ __ ] bombs on the rec market for Raza yeah I'm glad he's dead I could tell you're a good friend yes he [ __ ] he doesn't pull out the heat daddy for everybody we got the full [ __ ] tour holy [ __ ] I can't believe how big it is perhaps can be a little six-star to take my mom because a ridiculous master some blackberry love oh geez

warehouser yeah we only have until tomorrow morning to let them know we're gonna move out this month or not so if we say yes we are pretty much committing to living in a u-haul if we can't find anything they probably living with my mom yeah we pay an extra hundred fifty bucks in rent for one extra month kind of seems like good option but also but if we don't find anything after that month what if it gets stuck and Bend [Applause] [Music] kate's never stained skee-bowl that's so crazy there's skee-bowl biggest night skiing resort in America or at least they claim to be this is where I snowboarded [ __ ] 15 years of my life and had so much fun but today was beautiful with all this oh man yeah it looks like it was some powder and then clear we are stuck behind Adi sir doing a solid 24 same exact on the way here really thick it goes away let's play around always got to make this stop for some Indian tiger yeah oh god yeah this stuff is this Shh [Music]", "hMYxdRmZ5l0": "hey guys it's Florida MJ 4:20 here and today I'm going to be pressing some vanilla berry pie 20 point 18 percent THC from three boys farm which is now known as one plant but it was a three boys farm at the time on my 10 tongue that press drip tech dab press nah it's a dead press and it's called dead press so there you go all right so this vanilla berry Piatt is the first order I ever made from one plant and it was a really dry batch with not much smell to it and so I threw in some intent and type of booze pack and all these things to moisten it up it's like 60 - I think it's 52 percent humidity I'm not exactly sure here you can take a look at it inside here I'll give it a small it's got its got a berry smell to it now you're back then I really didn't have much of a smell to it and these do have a good effects these nugs but I think bringing it back to life with the integra was a necessity for sure here's a a nice shot of these nodes before I give them the press like I said they had decent effects even though the flowers themselves were unimpressive alright let's go ahead and get these buds weighed in and that way we can have an idea of what the yield is like go ahead and tear out the scale nodes these are actually pretty decent looking lugs and they they smell again now that I put the booth back in there all right looks like it's 3.5 grams on the money I don't know if you can see that alright and I use the trottle tech method I'm not sure if anybody out there is familiar with it but basically I use a 120 micron mesh bag but cut off at both ends and I'll show you how that works probably need to get something to break this stuff up on I just like to break it up a little bit so that smushes nice and tight into the filter bag if there's any big stems like this I'm just pulling out so I had pressed um some from this batch before and it didn't pretty had really really um disappointing results I don't know if it had been fully rehydrated at that point or not though so who knows alright so now we have an eight broken up right here on this piece of paper is a little bit I'm gonna take the filter bag and just start stuffing it full of weed basically there's definitely a lot more aroma now that I've broken this all up I found another stem in there I'm going to take that outside and break the bag or break through the parchment either you just gotta stuff all this stuff in there basically a couple more little stems in there if this suckers out luckily I don't think I see any seeds go grab something real quick but my help in this there's no escaping the drawer of doom alright so I just basically got a flat it's just a kitchen tool with a flat dough on the bottom handle swing smooch this down basically want to get this as compressed as possible so you can fit all of it in here and have a little puck going on inside the bag that's what I'm trying to get accomplished and so I believe the expected yield I heard something like it you know a good yield should be something like 2% under the stated THC percentage and I've gotten that that seems to be a pretty good rule of thumb I have to say but we'll see what this one does every strain is different every batch is different it depends on the growing conditions on all kinds of stuff the maturity level when they were harvested lots of variables that go into getting a good squish as they say and um so just so you know I'm not I don't want this to be all broken up like this into shake that just happened when I was breaking it up so you know ideally you just want to break it up a little bit so it fits into a puck shape inside here all right now I have my finished shuttle tech puck to be squished and turn into rosin smells pretty good good look at it yeah it's all smushed into a puck and I actually could have had a little bit less of this filter bag right here but that's okay it's not a huge deal I scrape this very last bit of crumbs on there all right but we have our eight of vanilla berry pie all puffed up in our shuttle tech bag we need to set up the damn press to get ready to be pressing some tabs how about that so I'm gonna adjust the camera and get right over there alright so first I need to turn on the heating plates there we go finally and I like to start out at 180 so I'm gonna take that down I just like to do my first passes at lower temperatures to preserve as many Terps as I can gotta have them terpene you know that's what rosin is all about is the Terps otherwise you just have other forms so we got that going at 180 the gauge on this I draw a camp up here that's what's gonna be operating you can see you once gets to 180 it'll be ready to go ready to press some dad's out press some nose alright so now that I've got the heating plates heating up from the PID with up to 180 degrees I'm gonna go ahead and get the press set up between two sheets of parchment paper for the first month all right ready to go all right I've got it all set up just like I need it these I just use cheap bulk parchment paper because I still have this thing in it it just won't seem to run out so I use I double up because it'll press through the parchment paper which is not a huge deal so yeah you just put the button in here give it a press there you go we're just gonna wait for that heat up and once it's ready will squish somebod all right now that the temperature plates are heated up what I'm gonna need to do is take this puck right here and slide it between the plates just like this and you want it to be just kind of centered like that and towards the front a little bit is what I prefer so that it can kind of direct it to come out that way yeah that's just right give me a second guys so after I get the puck in here I like to just so I haven't really started to put much pressure at all on it right now it's just strictly heating up at this point all right so it's been heating up for over a minute now so I go ahead and just start a timer right when I start applying pressure to this and I'm just going to try it as much as I can just keep applying steady pressure to this and I usually take it up to the 4000 on the PSI scale rear and then I'll be able to swing this camera in right here so that we can help you of the drip close-up so let's go ahead and get that started all right it's starting to start the timer as soon as I start to feel the resistance of the pump all right I can feel it so now I'm gonna start it I'm gonna do one minute for the first squish probably not the most exciting quite yeah I'm actually gonna swing that hammer right now hopefully we'll get a nice view of the squish going on all right well I'm a little bit over a minute and we don't get no squishies out of here I guess I don't have enough in there or it's not gonna yield as much as it would need to make a squish that's been in there long enough though so I'm gonna go ahead pull it and to do that undo this toppling like over here what's probably going on here is it just didn't have enough didn't have enough trichomes and stuff to push it out at that temperature all right nice and aromatic that is there's the first squish you say I'm going through the paper there a little bit that's all right we get it put that in the freezer all right so I put the first squish in the freezer and then we'll go ahead and get the second stick ready this is the same thing over again [Music] looks like the bag broke a little bit on that one I went a little too fast so you know usually I try to go pretty slow didn't work out that time so now I'm gonna put the temperature up to 210 degrees all right so I've turned up the temperature to 210 degrees on the plates I like to do that first press at 180 to get as many Terps and you know the nicest press that I can and then I go up to 210 after that to get as much as I can out of now I'll even go up to 220 for the last one so once this is all heated up then I'll be ready to do the second press I've got the plates up to 210 degrees and I've got the puck here so I'm just gonna slide there we go let that heat up just about 30 seconds or a minute or so all right now that it has heated up for about a minute I'm gonna go ahead and start putting some pressure on it this time I'm gonna take it slower so I don't totally destroy it I'm just trying to apply even pressure as much as I can throughout the whole time hid key to sort of get a little tougher up in these thousands give you a nice arm workout well it looks like there's a little bit coming out this time all right a little bit didn't have this already did a about 220 it's starting to drip and I've gone longer than a minute that's for sure I'm missing all of this camera tank sorry this is so bad there we go a bit more pressure just a little bit more now that we got it hurtin and it's just such dark rosin I'm not used to that but same thing happened with the other batch of three boys that I pressed so who knows all right that's plenty of time not too shabby on the second place smells nice it's kind of hippy all right so now we're gonna get the third press down here I'm gonna put this into the freezer let harden up all right so now that the plates are heated up to 220 degrees Fahrenheit I'm ready to go ahead and put the puck in but first I'm gonna have a little shot glass of water right here and I'm gonna just dab a little bit of water on each side of it now just help push out the last of the dabs last of the rosin I should say just that pressure of the vapor a little bit just a little bit of pressure so I can start heating up plates heat up the puck for about a minute or so to bring it up to temperature and that's just to help get the juices flowing basically all right now that the puck has heated up in the press for about a minute I'll go ahead and start applying more pressure slowly as I go at 220 degrees Fahrenheit and hopefully we'll see a little bit come out again it's always nice when you get to see the drip don't see any coming out yet tighten up a little bit still nothing look we should definitely be getting more rosin out that's for sure oh here comes something right there very nice very nice third press and since this is the last press I'll just let this go throw away for a minute and a half two minutes you can pretty good this is on the prison prettiest rosin I've seen that's for sure mm-hmm but I'm sure see what the yield is like press that's a pretty decent press right there for the third press but you can see it is there's a lot less of it Wow very nice berry flavor to this last press interesting what if the water help right now all right so I'll put this in the freezer like the other ones and then it will be back with all of them once they're all frozen and we'll gather them up and I'll tell you what the yield was all right so here I've got the first press and I collect it now as you can see I went through the paper but that's not a huge deal you still get this all up alright so I've got the first press collected and there it is as you can see there's you know there's some stuff on here there's no all my fingers but that's the vast majority of it right there I'm just going to throw it onto a piece of parchment paper for right now and then we'll weigh them all up together at the end get as much of this off as I can but it won't be exact that's for sure mark this is number one I set it over here all right now on to collect the second press here we had the second press and I hope it'll be easier than the first to collect nope it's shattering - let's see how it does that's not so bad all right and here's the second press put this on a piece of parchment also this has got like a taffy consistency to it label that number two and we'll collect the third and final press and then we'll weigh it all up and see what our yield was - stuff like this of course don't touch your rug further than final price right here so I'm going to collect it and you'll know just exactly how much we got is the third press right there number one go ahead and tear out the scale with a piece of the parchment on it sure it's not touching here we go got that tear it out now I'll transfer attached to this parchment and that is point one seven five grams from the first press and it has a really interesting consistency to it it's waxy it's like it's barely even sticky I mean it is but it's nothing like the other pretty cool so I'll mark this you tell the batch number then I'm gonna put it back in the freezer I'll grab the second one all right there's the second batch go ahead and tear out the scale again just like before transfer it over easier to do when it's frozen make sure it's not touching yep not touching 0.18 one second do it a little bit better than the first one which is not surprising because the second one had 210 degrees well unit 108 so there's not as much energy to push out all that rosin all right and they go ahead and tear out the last one transfer one more time whoops I have to wait a trick on this one here we go make sure it's not touching all right it's point zero seven eight there's a tiny bit more on here let me get that so I put this there was a little bit left on there I don't see what's a point seven eight so didn't really add a point seven eight point seven nine point eight let me close this really point seven nine twenty seven eight I'll just call it point seven eight 0.078 all right so label this one this one is a lot stickier look at that it's a lot stickier and that's the last one it has the water so now we'll add these all up and see what our yield was 175 that's point one a one plus point zero seven eight equals point four three four 12.4% yield man that is not good you at all it's just terrible and this is the same thing that happened last time that I pressed this stuff you know I mean I realize look you got a little bit right here but man this is some bad yield right here for 20% so I don't know what the deal is with these I definitely get a lot more out of Tru leave and let's see well if I Curie if gave me some good stuff to so let me mark this off for number three and then we'll take a look at the different batches together here's that one as you can see I mean it doesn't even want to stick to the paper you see that it's hard it barely wants to stick to the paper if you touch it it will stick to your finger because of the heat but other than that it really doesn't want to stick let's batch one at 180 degrees that's too similar but it is a little bit stickier and it seems to be a little unruly or two you see how it's like flakes off like that yeah I don't really like touching batch two very much I'm gonna get rid of it well we just ahead of my fingers and then batch three as we put the water in it much more of an oily consistency and just like before this is all really dark stuff compared to what I'm used to I will press some buds from a you know different dispensary soon and we'll see well you'll see the difference I don't I don't get it I don't understand what the deal is but I mean I would think that the first one would be a nicer color than that but the thing is this stuff is really potent and the smell is nice it concentrates all that smell down from the bud alright guys I just wanted to show you how I press rosin at home and next time I'll make sure and use a screen that gives us a little bit better stuff you know I just had this kicking around for a while now and I figured I might as well get something out of it what I'll do is I think I'll do one more press on this at some other point and I'll tell you if I get anything else out of it alright thanks for watching you guys have a good one", "A0hZd1ueLtg": "hi my name is cue Pinson is Wednesday in Colorado Springs and Wednesday is important because it is one of the days we like to Rio now before I get started I want to say follow me on twitch TV slash coupons for more awesome live content now Wednesday it's one of the days of the week we get deals on concentrate Wednesday and Saturday are two of the bigger days wax Wednesday and Saturday as they call them not everybody has those deals but a lot of places to do so we always like to look on Wednesday and I always start in the comfort of my own home on weed naps calm want the best places to look they have plenty of deals they can look up everything in my area there's bounce deals there's grand bills there's plenty options there so we're gonna get a little bit of an idea of what's out there before we get started and hopefully we get some really bang stuff today we are in the car here headed to the ATM most dispensaries are cash businesses and it's a lot easier to tip and purchase things with cash oftentimes so we're headed to the ATM to pick up some cash and I'm looking here on my phone actually and signed up at a few dispensaries for their text message alerts and they'll text me with their daily or weekly deals or if they have kind of flash or fire sales as they call them so we're gonna look through a few more deals here on the phone I already have a few ideas from weed Maps so we're gonna maybe go to a few places today once we decide but right now we're headed to get some cash and the dispensaries we are leaving the bank now we pulled out $80 we found a few good deals from a few dispensaries we're gonna go check out the first one now but we're gonna see what we can get with $80 today now I've had some good luck in the past getting a low price grams but we're gonna see what today hold so if they don't have good stuff we're gonna move on but hopefully we can get a few really bang grams for about 80 bucks here okay we are at our first stop for today one of my favorite dispensaries we are at high hopes cannabis with a cause I just started shopping here recently and I haven't been disappointed they have excellent products they always have great prices and the staff here is really friendly so we're gonna go in here and see if we can get some excellent stuff for today okay we are just leaving high hopes now it seems as though the prices are so good today that they've been cleared out so we were able to pick up a couple of different grams that concentrate as well as a pre-roll joint so we've got a gram of blackberry head band sugar and a gram of Agent Orange live sugar and we got a pre-roll joint of that lemon diesel we're gonna enjoy later so excellent prices but the selection was a little light because they must have just got raided oh man the views are sick the trees are covered in frost there's plenty of plenty of cool things to see in Colorado Springs we are outside of our second dispensary shop for today as you can see the views here are insane worse not that Apothecary farms powered by apothecary extracts one of my favorite dispensaries you can get apothecary extracts all over Colorado but they have a few of their own dispensary locations where you can pick up directly so here we are at apothecary farms in the springs looking for some more concentrates what of you over here we are just leaving apothecary Farms had to stop for a moment to check out that gorgeous view it was too good to pass up but we picked up a couple more grams from apothecary we got a gram of axilla wax and we also got a gram of their jam band lime batter which I've been hearing a lot of great things about and they were recommending it there too so we definitely picked up a couple of good ones here and I'm excited to try these right so we've spent all the money we've pulled out for dabs today we got four different grams as well as a pre-roll joint we didn't spend everything we had we've got a little leftover so I'm gonna do a little bit of foresight here a foreshadowing and then we're gonna get some munchies for later I found some coupons in the mail today so we are just going to get our munchies now and we are going to enjoy the dabs later foam pepper on the tomato black olives cucumber and the spinach oh I see this business and what also I'll just go with a little bit of that yeah we'll go at the now thank you good eat just like these chips later bad there's one thing you never expect to see him it's a trenchcoat you never expected so I realized my car is super dirty so we've pulled into a car wash here it's getting clean now my card is getting a pound and it's gonna be a while so we're gonna get up oh yeah and we are on our way home to enjoy our spoils for today more amazing views Colorado Springs is beautiful okay so we just got back home and went to two different dispensaries today high hopes and apothecary farms we got two grams of concentrate from each and we also got a pre-roll joint from my host so let's see we got a few different concentrates different grams here and a pre-roll joint we're all joint one gram of the lemon bezel good stuff nice price on this usually pick these up we got the gram of blackberry headband sugar blackberry headband sugar this is the one that is not a live and let's take a look oh this one looks very nice blackberry had been sugar wax very good stuff this one is from high hopes let's take a look at the other one this is their Agent Orange live sugar so we got a gram of the Agent Orange live this one's a little bit more expensive looks like that one got a little bit mixed up in the bag there I had it sitting upright but maybe it was upside down and that one smells very good check that out check that out this one is really saucy this one has a very very strong smell to it okay and then we also got two other grams from apothecary right and I know we got to two different two kinds here here's the axilla wax this one is 73% th if I can get a difference I'll never focus focus anyway seventy three point nine percent THC this one looks great excellent concentrate in there and one last one we got was the jam band live better and this one is very popular the employees were raving about of this one is eighty two point nine percent THC this one is a really good really good strands got a very good smell right when I open it it smelled amazing so let's take a look here oh yeah this live better okay so let's invite my girlfriend in here near there to do some Deb here is one more look at our spoils for today we got the BlackBerry headband sugar we got some gaygent orange lime sugar we got that pre-roll joint of lemon diesel from high homes we got that axle wax and we also got some jam band live batter so we've got a couple of emails plugged in here into our high five vape and we are ready to death alright we are finally back home we got the emails fired up and we're going to try a few of these out here what do you got there jam band you got that jam band from apothecary and I've got some Agent Orange live sugar from high hopes that's a really tasty the jam ban that's the last one okay we got our last couple of dabs lined up here I've got some of that axilla wax what do you have the BlackBerry headband sugar let's see how these ones taste oh that one's smooth and sweet like that so everything passed the test we got some great concentrates today and we got a couple of live options we spent a little more on the live better in the live sugar but the taste is very good we spent I think just under $80 for four grams that concentrates in the pre-roll joint so I think was around 76 for everything not a bad price for today I hope you enjoyed hanging out with us today and please if you like the content go ahead and subscribe to our YouTube channel follow me on twitch at

today we're going to be talking about the baker's dozen this is the frozen this is the frozen I should say that most of the violin is professional violinist are you know looking to buy it and honestly you guys it's it's impossible nearly impossible to get it especially these days so yeah let me talk you through this I have two kinds of the baker's resin I'll give you possibly all the information I have and yeah let's start it alright so I was able to get this resin after waiting for nearly two or three years on the waiting list I was able to get it to roughly a year ago so I have been using it for yeah for pretty much like a year or so as I can really give you my honest opinion I do have two kinds he makes two kinds Rosen's this is the original which has like a purple kind of a brownish stamp and then the green stamp this is the the French version so this is more Italian I'll say he described it as a original Cremonese recipe and this is more after French which is the V own he call it V own sea trout or something like that so there by the way they are made in England and this is a very bakers is a very small company that it's owned by you know it's a family-owned company and basically they make this resin once a year they described on their website during the hottest months on it assume it's during the summer this is where they can get the best fresh sucks you know from the trees and they basically cook it right away the port or fresh so this is like probably the only one in the world that makes a company that makes resin - fresh from like a fresh liquid SAP so the resins Kames beautifully packaged you know they also included like like a little piece of paper which looks like a very kind of old paper with the information about each rosin and I thought it was really really cute looking obviously they were all sealed nicely so the first resin that comes with this kind of a brownish a little stamp and so take a wax stamp would be you know on the top four bakers so the first one is the original and obviously on those Scrolls you have a little information about the rosin so I'm just gonna quickly read a couple of info because I think it's quite helpful to know so the Baker's original is a hundred percent a handmade based on an authentic Ramona recipe dating back to the time of Paganini so you know he claims this is the original recipe recipe and unlike many products this rosin is made from a fresh liquid SAP so if you're not familiar with the resins like usually resins you know that whoever makes the resin the resin makers they buy a SAP which is comes in the solid and then they kind of melt and you know two older magic and they make the resin so baker's resin is made of the liquid SAP so he's basically doing right away so you know the this obviously is resulting in a superior resin and fresh or product so it's a hundred percent natural and the highest quiet quality you can imagine so the reason this resin you guys is so difficult to to get and so hard to get is basically it's because it's a seasonal product and they can just only make so many of that resin and I believe they put you once you get it they put you on the list and I believe you can buy it every two years they send you email you know here's your fresh frozen would you like to buy it as far as I know you guys I'm gonna leave his website down below anyway but as far as I know the list the website is like closed for a new customer I know it's not gonna be really helpful but you know you can you know look into it for the future and see you know maybe they won't reopen the new customer list and you know hopefully you can get on it but ya expect to wait a couple of years because you know like I said I waited a few years for this rosin so anyway so this is the original rosin and it's beautiful you guys I mean look at this eye you can obviously tell that I use it quite a bit during this past year so this has this original Rosa has like a little like kind of like an ember you know outside color so it's a little bit darker than the young rosin so this is the original the second recipe comes with the same packaging but it has a little bit like a green kind of a wax stamp again with the letter B on top this resin in accordance to his information this is the Baker's young Citroen is created but hint from a traditional French recipe which was popular a wonder Lyon was alive so again it's made of the fresh liquid SAP and yep in this result this resin is highly reactive to players input and capable of a broad range of tonal variations so this rosin is lighter in color as you can see from the original one so this is the French recipe and the other one is what Paganini was Italian so Cremona I guess it's Italian recipe so this is this is basically the only two resins you can get from him this is what he specialized in so before I will tell you what I think about those resins I did record a little sound sample and just I'm gonna insert it now so you can go ahead and listen and just think about it like can you hear the difference alright so you can see both of them and just tell me if you can hear the difference [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] so could you hear a difference because I couldn't if I listen to this recording to me it sounds exactly the same I did use two different bells they were all clean so I had a fresh you know rosin on on each of the bows now I even when I play it you guys I couldn't tell much of the difference between one and the other formula maybe I like the original a little bit better than the French recipe but there is really very little difference and honestly it all is gonna come down to your personal preference okay now let me talk about the price a little bit because knowing that this is so hard to find you would think that this resin is gonna cost a fortune because if you're familiar with the curent resins they're on the market some of them can be extremely extremely expensive and to my surprise a year ago I paid about $25 for each US dollars for each resins that cost me $50 or something like that $50 for two Rosen's I think it's extremely inexpensive considering how much work you know he put into it so the price point of this rosin is just there it's perfect like I mentioned my personal preference if I will have to choose for life just one I probably would go with the original and then this would be my second choice but honestly you guys those two are equally equally very very good resins I would agree with the claims that has a very low low dust you know which is good especially for those who are allergic those people who are allergic you know even when you rosin about you know there's very little rosin dust coming out and also very little rosin dust is accumulating on top of the violin which is good these are super smooth you know very but they can be quite crispy if you need to you know it's it's obviously depend of your technical abilities of your you know obviously your right hand has a lot to do you know with that articulation but I found this roses to be really really good I have no any complaints whatsoever the question is is this resin the best rosin in the world considering the fact how difficult is to get and you know although obviously all the claims I don't know if this is the best or is this as the only one because I own quite a few resins you guys and I compare this resin to my other resins and honestly I think they are all beautiful you know and I'm talking about you know more expensive resins you know let's say the leather bespoke rosin from Australia that cost twice as much probably as this or even more and yeah I feel like that rosin is equally as amazing as this so it's very hard to tell you guys I'm just being completely honest with you so if I'll have to you know just choose one rosin for life I don't have extremely hard time because and I'm by the way I'm gonna do the video if you want me to do it give it a thumbs up on my top top five favorite resins let me know if you wanna hear that video so um yeah I think at the end of the day all of it comes to your personal preference what do you like there even you guys I'm getting so kind of picky because for certain pieces for certain about I'll use it different resins so I'm talking about like I'm going to the next level this is not necessary because I feel like one one of those rosin would be perfect for you know playing any piece yeah is this the only one is this the best yes and no I mean it's your personal preference it's exactly what you like exactly what you believe in exactly what it sounds good to you how much a good sound you can take out of this you know how much the rosin is really helping you with creating a beautiful sound articulation and all of it so I think it's a really personal preference at the end of the day and I would highly recommend to get it if you can if you can be lucky enough to get this yes go for it try it for yourself especially that it's not you know that expensive and you're not gonna be disappointed for sure but at the same time I don't want you to feel that you must have this rosin because this is the only resin that you're gonna be happy and satisfied with so there we go yeah I'm pretty sure you can buy you know different resins and be equally happy and satisfied you know using this so there we go guys so this is exactly what I think about this no complaints whatsoever it's a beautiful resin I will leave mr. Baker's website down below although I read just recently he's not taking any new customer so I'm sorry for that you guys but if you do get a chance to get you know this resin just try it it doesn't hurt it's a great resin and I'm sure you're gonna be very happy alright guys thank you so much for watching if you're new to my channel don't forget to subscribe give it a thumbs up if you like this video and also give me a thumbs up if you want me to do my top four top five you know favorite rosen's so yeah let me know if you have any questions and I'll duck take some bite", "enz-OhEF6lA": "[Applause] [Music] uh [Music] i just picked up randy uh he's going to get a new bong because he's self-conscious about his dirty ass i'll just show you guys what i am embarrassed to like actually put this on but uh he said he wants to get a bong so i'm gonna take him to get a bung but the point of this video is this dollar dab i bought this a week ago still haven't done a video on it and uh hopefully i could split this in two depending on the size so i want to give him one as well but in my opinion to get the full effect you should do the whole thing that's what i was thinking yeah we'll see we'll see because it kind of it feels like it has some weight so we'll see we'll see we got rj we got rj subscribe to him if you haven't already he just got done doing a video yesterday with his cousin so it should be a good one whenever he does decide to pick it up he brought the forbidden fruit as well you know you've probably seen the video where we uh went and picked it up already fire stuff but yeah whatever i just gotta say man i hope you guys are enjoying your week um i have not been releasing as many videos as you guys do see uh but man there's a lot of reasons i don't want to digress into that right now but i hope you guys are patient with me and i am 25 so plenty of time yep so let's do it baby all right boys we are back showing what you got you know i'm saying a little a little uh what is it detachable one oh damn that noise oh dangerous let me put up here yeah you could switch it so you can go here oh it's in there oh whoa okay so it's a switchable beaker bung so you could hit it like a normal beaker bong or you could switch it off put that here put that there i think i like it this way it's like a science project right here so it's like you know homie's got to put some water in that yeah we got a new ball yep let's go baby yeah and also uh the homie picked up another one of these from that video uh the night the dispensary run the jetties yes the jetties uh

luckily i had the second greatest person here with me you know i'm saying no i'm just joking now but luckily andrew was there and he pointed out some other bombs you know for better price and not even that better design like on the bong itself so like i said this is only one dab so if it's not enough for me and randy to take we're gonna be taking other dabs alongside you know this video as well or in this video but the whole point of this video is to showcase this one dollar dab that i got from finos exactly a dollar out the door so oh nice let's see the functionality i'm gonna need more water

hit that's kind of lame to be honest you know you can't just grab it like that yeah here we go yeah my [ __ ] finger slime so uh i am gonna drop this in here but it is [ __ ] hot as [ __ ] so let's just cool it off a little bit you know if you want me to hold it for the camera for you or just leave it oh yeah yeah hold the hole hopefully it's the lighting i'll find out right now oh yeah i have to put it back yeah all right just this one yeah turn up the iso it's not bad let me see i already should not touch screen right so [ __ ] i'm scared all right ready [Music] it is you just drop it in there but uh we don't have a carb cap guys so we couldn't enjoy it as much but i definitely got a good hit man as you can see right here oh i wish i had a carb cap though but yeah that's really really cool that they did this yeah i feel like we should do that again with the car cab it's better at the end of the day batter can only go so far and when it cramps to like taste and stuff it probably wasn't going to get me too high but the idea of a one dab uh one dollar dab how are we going to get this out this is 12. that's cool dropping it yeah i can see that's becoming a thing i really can probably for people who are like just really interested in dabbing and don't know it's like if you have if you're if you have like a dollar at laying around why not right it's a it's a weird experience but it's cool yeah can you blow it out there hella higher because this is what i'm gonna do oh check this off watch out for the water though hold this here thank you for saying that boom oh crap it wasn't gonna go out today you know what i'm saying we're turning to the ground and i'm saying just like the sand it was before time i was gonna clean this this is mine it's cool so uh burn

but dummy no i'm saying we're gonna take some dabs here and then we're probably gonna end the video here just uh a quick one i just wanted to showcase the dollar dab that was just the main focus of this video and honestly it was uh not bad at the end of the day it was only a dollar you know and if you don't want to tip your butt tender because he or she was an ass or not giving you the good [ __ ] spending on that instead of giving it a dollar to them you know i'm saying i don't know just some stuff to try out but look at all that remaining it was definitely a lot for a dollar with that you can see that's a all the excess stuff burning yeah we don't have a car kit huh huh we don't have a car kit we're [ __ ] what if we use this just kind of like oh yeah you can yeah right yeah i don't

so we're going to be squashing there's like three different strains in here this nice keef nice pile of that we'll be squashing this at 170 degrees you want to wind strong said five times [Music] is should be a nice gusher of course you want to go low and slow on this too we'll double bag it awesome get a little bit of extra peg protection we got it all loaded up there double bagged all right as i said 170 on the press there [Music] and now we're gonna lower it down just to let it let the plates hit and of course we'll let it sit there for about about 25 seconds a little longer just to let it let it working cause that bag is kind of full it's been 25 seconds we're gonna add a little bit more pressure to it you don't want to over press this you don't want to press it real fast and heavy because you will have blowouts a lot of times if you do that so you want to nice and slow just you know feel it as you uh apply pressure if it's easy once it starts get a lot more rough pressure to it let it sit there and let that heat loosen it up a little more so it's kind of low and slow all right so we're starting to get it coming out on this this side right here so it should be coming out here a little bit more pressure all right so now we have it coming out right here down both right there and there all over there strictly i grade [Music] all the time all right we're gonna go ahead and pull this one because you know what if there's still rosin left in there we can still squash that bag again new strain news flash got the best grass got to take two and pass by no means average good god i got to have it babies are perfect and like the way you dream less smoke with friends uncle stone i like the way you dream it's yo dabbity we're gonna dab it dab it up we like the way you trim it this is a nice shield nice squash here yo dabbity we gonna dab it and of course you see there's still some stuff left in that bag so we will definitely squash that one more time all right this is uncle stone many blessings peace out my two favorite parts after squashing and making some beautiful rosin first one is gathering it so so [Applause] so as i said this was a nice yield of three different kinds of teeth no this i know there's definitely vanilla cush is one of the strains that was in this all right it's getting close to my second favorite part of this process that's nice all right now the fun part the sampling of it we like the way you trim it yo dabbity [Music] uncle love the way you dab so freak what they heard monster kong marketing", "4WqaQPE_M9c": "Wister the YouTube chef voice I'd like coming through with another quick video for today man today I'm gonna be giving you guys a little bit of info on the 710 labs list so makes you guys we're coming if he knew hit that subscribe button for your boy and make sure you dab what's the deal boys y'all already know what's happening man I'm coming back with another quick video me give you a little bit of information about what's going on here so as you guys can see I got my delivery from the list this right here came from 7-10 labs personally they hand-delivered me this package full of bomb ass extracts and whatever else I ordered that you guys are must take a look up right now what is the list how do you get on the list where is the list man it sucked because actually the list is currently only available in California now the list was made for only friends family and true OGS of the 710 community you can go to 710 labs.com and find out how you can apply for the list sometimes it's open sometimes it's closed with 710 labs actually does is put some of their best production of every month to the side for people who are on the list if you're on that list then you pretty much get dibs before any dispensary in California that's supposed to get their supply for the month or whatever so once you get on that list you have first dibs on all the stuff that 710 labs made for that month on a certain day of every month 710 labs is gonna email you a link and the password you use that password to sign in on the website that they sing you and then there goes the whole list of everything for that month you have to be careful because whatever you pick and you purchase you cannot change you have to spend the minimum of $300 and the maximum is whatever your tolerances for recreational use the max that can deliver is 8 grams of concentrates so you can only get 8 grams of rosin or you know dabs or whatever if you're a medical user that you can actually get up to 50 grams and the same goes for the flower if your recreational user that you can only pick up one ounce of flower twenty eight point five grams and if you're a medical users you can actually pick up eight ounces of flour so that's pretty fired they actually delivering a lot of cities up in Northern California and here in Southern Californians they deliver in a couple cities as well so that's gonna do the basics of the list let's get right into the package as you can see they delivered it in this nice sick ass bag labeled 7/10 Labs has 710 labs on both sides and you can actually take the bag apart if you would like to or you can just keep it together and you know rock it like a little duffel bag and on the side right here has the perfect note that this got a 710 labs booklet and you actually got this handwritten note so it's gonna be a handwritten note with your name on it big old paragraph talking about yeah you get it what's the dilly it's very dope you told me I'll [ __ ] with that how they just write you a note and [ __ ] with your order that's pretty sick that's like a lot of love so as you can see you got two zippers right here we're just gonna zip them fangs openness in this inside you might want to check all the compartments cuz you know how smokers get man they end up putting joints all in the cutting [ __ ] but uh yes so here you got ice packs this is gonna be a 710 labs ice pack which is pretty [ __ ] sick yes and then you have all your rosin or whatever that's you ordered you have your whole order in here if you got flour that I'm pretty sure the flour being here to anchor no flour on this order and sometimes they give you goodies and [ __ ] so sometimes you might have like a pair of socks or a t-shirt or whatever they're giving out for the month you might have something special you might have some couple of joints like you never know so just check the whole compartment and as you can see man I put in a pretty nice order because the prices are ridiculous I mean wholesale you're paying forty-five fifty dollars for a gram I mean you can't get this quality anywhere for this price usually I go half with my homie he'll get like two hundred dollars worth of things I got like $100 worth of things argue like 150 he'll get 150 or whatever the cases and then you film it'll be easier on both of us and get some high quality [ __ ] for the good price and we can still be on the list because if you actually don't order if you start like skipping your orders and like not ordering anything because the minimum is too high or whatever or whatever your case is like you're on vacation or whatever the cases if you keep missing out on making the orders and they're gonna cancel you from the list so you guys got to keep placing the orders I mean they do it at a very good time I would say it's pretty convenient like monthly it's not like every week or every two weeks you gotta put in $300 so um it's really like right around the time you got a smoke if you just save all your money and then make the order then that order should last you for like the whole month or until next time you have to order you'll probably even have some [ __ ] left over so I think it's really convenient especially if you have a buddy that's really interested in these products or whatever just interested in high quality [ __ ] and I want some new [ __ ] they can put it in the order they got all type of [ __ ] as you can see from [ __ ] dabs rosin bunting BHO they got joints they got dad pins like they got the high quality spires if they got the high [ __ ] bomb-diggity flour they got everything but um I only got Rosalyn because right now they didn't have anything on the list that spiked flour and they have any flour on the list all they had was rosin and dabs and joints but uh yeah maybe next time I'll get some flour this is what I picked up man I picked up some Munson number 58 I picked up some [ __ ] called the loot it's gonna be a Percy live rosin another Percy live Rosalind called greasemonkey number 15 times bootylicious number 1 I picked up a regular live rosin another month's in 58 some of these are gonna be doubles because where they're like 45 bucks each so it was like why not I got the live rosin and sour tangi times bootylicious whoo that was like another what $45 one sour tangi bootylicious again I'm telling you the Lemonheads number four so you get a good make sure you get a chain you get to change it up and [ __ ] and then you get to you know pay a really good price so the booklet man you got a couple of Snickers I believe up in here oh they give you your receipt as well and then they just show you how to smoke this [ __ ] the right way so you got the weed instructions you got all the rosin and dad and live Persis and different types of [ __ ] that they make these got the instructions behind them and stuff so I really respect that they put a lot of love and hard work into the [ __ ] versus people who just give you a box of weed or whatever like yes that's what that is like they actually care what they're doing with their [ __ ] so that's pretty tight you know I'm pretty happy I made the list so that's pretty much it man you film you got your [ __ ] you got on the list you got your [ __ ] you pay cash and then that's it they come they pull up they text you they're like yo you want us to come at this time or this time and you blow yeah come at this time they'd like alright then and actually come right on time too and they keep this [ __ ] in good condition though it's cold it's frozen it's ready to go in the freezer or in the fridge or whatever it's ready to get smoked I really [ __ ] with that so man that delivery service is a [ __ ] one anybody on the list make sure you hop on that damn list boy I know y'all enjoying that [ __ ] because this shouldve sick as hell you got the bag you got the ice packs there's nothing I can really say man but if you guys mention his video I appreciate y'all for watching guys we're coming if you knew hey that subscribe button for ya boy it makes you get to an incident excellency [Music]", "9DJ3hRZBgTQ": "yo yo yo what's good you guys welcome back to another live stream it is time to do it

going um let's check on the amount of ice that we've got in the reservoir we'll see if we need to top it off i'm pretty sure we're going to go ahead and top it off with some more ice probably two more 20 gallon reservoirs full of ice which is i don't know i haven't waited i'm guessing when i fill up that trash can it's approximately 60 to 80 pounds of ice based on like when i have 20 pound bags of ice i'm just guessing you know probably about 60 to 80 pounds so i'm gonna add another 150 or so pounds of ice and then yeah we'll go ahead and get the bud and the bags and finish prepping the rest of that [ __ ] san bueno [Music] what's up cv [Music] [Music] ready to wake yeah [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] i fill this thing up almost all the way right and i do this i put about four to five of these in there just when i start the water then it gets to where you see it right now where a lot of the ice is melted the water is really cold but it's not full and i add a couple more and we're cranking the ac at 62. ugh [Music] [Music] [Music] looking at the movies [Music] [Music] we pray to god [Applause] got that all the way open we got the booster pump on i think yeah the booster pump is plugged in out there [Music] we don't have any other pumps or anything on so that should fill up the rest of the way pretty quick and be nice and frosty [Music] [Applause] do i have enough to start a wash sure i'm sure [Music] now you're gonna have to excuse my mess i've been trimming in here so i don't want to hear no [ __ ] but you know me i'm transferring i show it make sure this valve is closed back here we're gonna go ahead and fire up the freeze dryer and pull the trays we're gonna clean the trays and then um [Music] me [Music] alcohol [Music] and then i'm gonna go ahead and [Music] hit my seal with a little bit of iso sometimes when you collect the uh the higher micron stuff that's fluffier and you go up the uh the freeze dryer you'll get a little bit of um almost like backdraft sort of it's basically just a lighter fluffier ash and it wants to go towards the uh the vacuum the vacuum cloth and so it'll cause a little bit of the hash to stir up and so every once in a while if that happens you gotta wipe out the hatch from wherever it flies onto most of the time it just goes to the seal so you just wipe it off the inner part of the seal a little bit of alcohol every once in a while you'll get some that builds up in the shelves you can take the whole seal off the door wipe it down you can pull the shelving unit out of the whole pretty much freeze dryer chamber if you want and you can vacuum it out you can wipe it out [Music] i'll be doing a uh a little bit of a maintenance video on the freeze dryer um here in about a month [Music] during that time i'll show you guys how to disassemble the freeze dryer and inspect it in certain areas for certain things and then how to clean it and put it back together [Music] so i'm just hitting my seal that the door forms a really good seal and you make sure that you get into one vacuum [Music] and there we go [Music] take my cover off we'll put the cover back on a little bit [Music] come on [ __ ] get on there right thank you okay [Music] lagging huh [Music] close out some of this [ __ ] i got open on my phone holy moly i had a lot of [ __ ] open [Music] better all right so now i'm gonna just flip the freeze dryer on it turns on and it says updating log files and blah blah during that time if you have a thumb stick in the um side of the freeze dryer or whatever it will go ahead and update the log files that you have on the thumbstick [Music] sit sit we're going to have that [ __ ] unplugged i'm going to put it back in real quick [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] i just noticed there

"what up this is chip from the real dirt podcast man today we get to talk about one of my favorite subjects of all time that is solventless extracts that's right water-based extracts today i'm talking with my good buddy chris from solely solventless out of denver and man he's been really like pushing the bounds of uh um extraction water extraction rosin extraction in the colorado area so if you're around if you're around denver or come to denver definitely uh check it all out man hey guys and if you haven't joined already please join us at therealdirtpodcast.com subscribe on itunes and hey man check out our new youtube channel you know we're just working on it but uh should be all of our episodes loaded up there real soon and uh i believe that is the real dirt podcast on youtube so thanks again for joining us today and as always sit back and fire the largest joint you can and enjoy this episode of the real dirt and this is chip from the real dirt good morning hello one and all another episode of the real dirt podcast this is 2021 and today we're gonna talk about extracts concentrates how they're kind of made and what they are the first time i ever heard of a concentrate of course it was it was called hash and we didn't quite know what it was and this guy kevin price i believe he was he he was like hey i got some hash she you know and we looked at it and we were like man this looks like rabbit [ __ ] are you sure this is hash and to this day i'm pretty sure he sold me rabbit [ __ ] as hash and we didn't know any better so we smoked it but it's come a long ways and as soon as i got real extract which was jamaican hash oil back in way long time ago i realized the potential of extracting the trichome and extracting the molecule from cannabis and have really been fascinated with it since then in all its forms from traditional hand rolled hash to sheaved and pressed hash to bubble hash to sub critical co2 butane propane solventless like i'm really fascinated and interested in it all and today we have chris from solely solvent list chris a good friend of mine say hey chris how you guys doing out there thanks for having me chip you know chris is an unsung hero he has some of the finest extracts on the market they're boutique and rare to find and if you ever see them absolutely scoop them up they may be a little bit more expensive than the ones sitting next to it but you know what it is absolutely worth it hitting it chris i appreciate all those nice words there chip yeah man just paying attention to detail man and you know really having a love and appreciation for this plant and all that's all its power that it entails you know so you know we're small small batch but uh you know we're just starting out if you do happen to catch us on the show like chip is saying yeah man you definitely gotta give us a shot you won't be disappointed we like to take our time like i said that attention to detail is important when it comes to solving this extracts there's a few things you definitely have to uh pay attention to as far as the input or the material you're using to get that output that we all desire are what you know the customers are desiring these days one of the biggest things about xtract is the quality material in gets exceptional quality out and many people just use the trash you know to make it and and you can't absolutely do that but to me you guys can best gear possible you use the best buds possible that's right my friend yeah a lot of credit goes to the action you know the cultivators first the flower has to be top-notch the flower's banging and it's on point and usually you know the hash on the other end comes out what you would like as far as like you know quality numbers you know that can all vary from a few different things different genetics and yield different numbers in those areas you know it's it's all interesting it's all you know experimental it's just great to learn and you know every day you know whether it's something that really throws down a lot of hash you know and you know it's in the family of the gmos or the cakes or something like that or something that doesn't really throw down as much it's more you know on the terp side i mean that's all important you know it depends on what you're looking for what are you starting off the day with man you you you smoke weed in the minute at the beginning of the day are you one of those people i mean probably like three or four times at the beginning of the day three or four times at the beginning uh i mean what did i have this morning i had a little bit of the uh some some live rosin made by myself it was some uh i call it the gumbo mix or you know my term that's right because chris is from actually from louisiana yeah you're right you're right um he's also our resident go-to of anything southern cooking food as well he holds the gumbo and shrimp and grits title at cultivate colorado currently right nobody compared yeah i mean i i i take that pretty probably anybody wants to step up at all i'll take it you know but oh man when we made shrimp and when you made shrimp and grits down here in oak okc my crew here never had it and literally the other day they were like man that time you guys made shrimp and grits he actually said chip you made tripping crap right uh i didn't take credit i mean it was a team effort man come on we watched you do it extracting hash is just like cooking you can be a cook or you can be a chef right you got all the right ingredients you got all your temperatures together you prepare everything properly you prep everything properly then wow you got something then right yeah 100 yeah like uh you know a lot of people you know may not go along with the the mix material washes but i particularly like those because as you were saying with i like cooking and flavor profiles and things like that you know you take two different you know hatches and mix those together you never know what you're gonna get man like you can be in a mood this day take a hit of that you know the same hash you know that you hit two days ago and get different flavor profiles because you might be in a different mood or something you know it just really depends like today a mix of tropicana banana and monkey berries and i really like that that's my gumbo mix for this morning chocolate chip did pretty well those did about i think that was at four percent together so not bad numbers so you're mixing these you're mixing these flavors in the bag yes i like to actually mix material together and wash it together in the bag you can do it separate if you like and then mix the resin at the end and press it like that if you want you know that's a preference thing man everybody got their own way to do it yeah way i like to do it you know so it works out well for me i don't have any issues with it taste fire love the taste so we've been babbling a little bit here i realized like there's a lot of people that listen to these podcasts or we'll see this podcast that don't really understand what hash or extract or rosin or resin or solvent list or bubble or co2 or any of this stuff is man let's just let me get your opinion of it let's let's let's start at the beginning let's have like a 101 basic extract course from chris i would tell you this i honestly um you know definitely knowledgeable in the extracts but as far as an extract connoisseur or someone who is going to go to a store and buy an extract over flour that was not me three or four years ago i would say the hydrocarbon extractions or co2 whatever you want to call it those extractions you know just we're not really that interested in them as far as like dabbing them but definitely using them for edibles and things like that which they would come up really well in edibles so you know never really you know downplayed it or anything like that but starting just like let's let me let me pause you right there and ask you and let's make some ex explain to people what's going on so most of the extract you see on the shelf at a dispensary say in colorado or california it's some mostly some sort of wax or goo or oil or shatter and most of that is made with butane or protein propane some type of hydrocarbon mixture right right right right they're literally just combining all of the the plant material they're mixing it with the hydrocarbon and then they're separating out the plant material the hydrocarbon they're recollecting the solvent the hydrocarbon yep and what's left is the extract right right right right and that's what mostly is on the shelf so when you're when you have a pen what's what's in most pens chris you get a mix of a few things these days i've seen uh you know you get your distillate pins mixed with terps i would say uh you get your sauce pins i've seen you know lately you're starting to see some live rosin pins kind of new on the market but mostly mostly just through it and terps i would say which you know distillate would be you know just your pure thc no flavor profile and then able being able to take different tariff profiles and then add that to the distillate you know um it was some sort of solvent these those are all mostly solvent yes correct yes right right but but you mentioned rosin tell me what the difference is between solvent lists and and the the non-solvents oh well you know as you mentioned uh earlier with the uh actual process of collecting the trichomes using hydrocarbon uh with a non-solvent uh extraction or a solvent extraction as you want to call it you're actually going to be using water as the solvent or as the carrier or the lubricant whatever you want to call it but like super cold water so you want to use a combination of ice and water to actually collect those trichomes opposed to the hydrocarbon so a healthier way or a healthier method i would say as far as like uh approaching the extraction process but uh you know each process equally has benefits for whatever end product or whatever way you want to do with it but i just if you're asking me water and ice seems pretty safe and clean to me so using that path to actually strike trichomes uh you know solving this just you know really stuck with me when that started coming around i think nicotine probably is the guy to give respect to that starting that term from what i understand you know and he's been around for a minute pushing out some great product just learning and discovering that really got me really interested in that and these days you're starting to see it they're starting to be rising carter just popping up you know rising and batter live jam you know uh sauce and diamonds even like people starting to even make diamonds and solvents which is crazy because that's like mechanical separation and things like that it costs more for a reason though you have to put more raw material you have to take more care in the solventless extract than just a hydrocarbon extract the material 100 matters you can do it from trim and things like that well taken care of trim will deal some great results but decide it'll actually use you know your prized buds you know and something that a cultivator or you know cultivar that does really well you know you're gonna you gotta wash it you gotta collect it run it through the bags you know then take it from the bags goes to the freeze dryer you know that's in there for 24 hours comes out of the freeze dryer then you have to see that then you have to you know collect it again into your screen bags and then now you have to press it so you know you press it then you collect it and then now it has to cure whether you want to you know heat cure it cold care room temp cure whatever it may be there's all these different ways you can approach it there's no wrong or right way in my opinion it's all great technique yeah it's all technique and preference you know some people swear by full spectrum you know or like some people swear that oh it's got to be the 9120 or only 90 you know and that's like man that's cool you know that's great that's your preference you can like that but like you know it's it's it's all out there man it's everybody likes something a little bit different and it's great that you have the options with verizon you can do that also when you you use different material you get different results and it's really hard on the commercial market to have the same exact material over and over and over and over again and and so that's the importance of like what we're talking about you got to watch it see what's going on because what might collect what even one strain grown by one guy might collect differently than the same strain grown by someone else right and you you've you've seen this over and over again like wow man those crystals are really small those crystals are really fat like this is nothing but glands this is nothing but stocks you know yeah man i've seen two two different growers two same exact stream like almost one and a half percent difference you know which is crazy you know like that's a decent amount of difference you know but still great outcomes on that on that particular stream but uh yeah you're right uh environment that's actually grown in um you know maybe i'm starting to notice has a play in into that too and maybe appearance of the actual riser you know whether it's going to be a little bit lighter things like that whether those whether that person maybe pulled that product a little bit early harvested a little bit early things like that and you know kind of go into it too you kind of never really know so like having a good relationship with your suppliers where you're getting your material from really helps you know and like consistently consistently knowing that you know you're dealing with these guys it's going to be this every time you know you know that it's going to put out you know these guys grow it perfectly and boom you know everyone does good yeah well it takes a different mentality well slightly different mentality to grow for for high quality extracts i mean many people grow for extract but they're just literally trying to grow biomass they're just trying to grow like weight man the highest quality stuff though it comes from when you really take care just like you would ganja right all the way to the end and you finish it the same way and you know you dry it and store it and package it all the same way like you know maybe i mean you don't have to trim it necessarily right but like you definitely have to like you know there's a little bit of processing going on yeah you definitely like to prep it i mean you know you know you don't want to put any you know leaves that doesn't have any any sugar in there you definitely don't want that sure in there you know so you got to prep it a little bit but definitely as far as like taking care of it and growing it with the utmost attention attention to detail you know as far as like i know you don't have to do your ipm's but you have to minimize those things like that you know that really like carries over into your end product you know later in your flower cycle when you come up with an issue you know that's love matters you know so you got to be on it from the beginning man and take care of the growing environment you know many people are familiar with with this term bubble hash or water hash but let's talk about why what this solvent list how it's different from from just like a crude extract with water yeah so with bubble hash you know in the cycle route to get rosin you pretty much get bubble hash first but like you said most people are used to seeing you know the bubble hatch in the form of you know looks like sand i guess almost keith rather people familiar with the grinders you know and you have to keep catchers but like typically you know whenever you're washing the material and collecting it in the bubble bags you know before the whole freeze dryer thing at this point you take it out of the bubble bags you gotta pretty much dry it at the perfect condition to get it to not mold or anything to be able to go from like you know you know the bubble hash process like that that we're all use that's a pretty intricate process too to get that right to get that correct for freeze dryers like i mean i guarantee you i would have failed plenty of times you know what i'm saying i mean i i mean i maybe tried it a few times when i first moved here from louisiana trying to do some bubble hatch before rosin was even a thing you know and you know it came out well but that whole drawing process is tricky and lucky out here it's dry the standardized you know so it was pretty you know relatively easy to learning curve is you know easy out here with that lack of humidity but i don't know if that would happen in louisiana i end up with some moldy hash man you know a few times i'm sure yeah yeah you got to control your dry environment yeah but you know now but now with with free drives it's a different story yes free drive is definitely a different story pull it out of the bag wet press it out water out a little bit put it in the freeze dryer yeah right yeah and even with you know i mean still with freezer i mean you know you're using freeze dryers i mean people don't tell me you could press it in horizon a lot of people keep it as melt too you know you you know you separate use your bags and use that 90 bag get some full melt people really love that nice full melt these days it seems like you know different strains are going to give you different meltability of the heads but like usually that that 90 through 119 seems to be that that one that people love for that good bubble hash melt you know super clean heads you know barely any specs of anything you know but you know it's got to be clean that's got to be taken care of properly to get to that point you know and using the freezer man just freeze-dried bubble like can be incredible oh yeah right a few times i've had it it's been ridiculously good right but it's to get that high quality dabbable bubble at that point like it's really really strain specific that you hardly get any yield you know out of your your your batch when you do it that way right compared to kind of like what you're doing and you're making you're extracting as much quality material out of the the leaf as you can with water you're taking it freeze drying it right and then what happens well from that point once it comes from the freeze dryer we take it and we put it between these nice plates by these low temp plates i like to use those plates but they're great heated plates low temp heat and pressure um the bubble hatch goes into filter bag and then between the two plates and that presses out the rosin so you go from the bubble hash and then those two plates creates almost like a you know like an environment of where pretty much that that protective layer on the resin heads or you know that the bubble hash bursts from the heat and the pressure and it oozes out all that good oil rosin and you collect it into the jar or into your banger or whatever i've seen people do some crazy stuff on instagram but so basically it goes to a jar we're using water yeah and then we're freeze-drying it and then we're using a press with some heat on it that's right right and this is this is all just water and heat right natural man that's it water heat a little bit of pressure you know and boom you got some rosin you have some beautiful extract that you can then take from that state and cure it how you'd like or you can keep it in a fresh press state you know take it into cartridges take it into edibles which oh man make some beautiful edibles tastes so good i love that that you know some people complain about that weed taste or whatever i like a nice rosin taste and an edible in my opinion that tastes good me too yeah i prefer all the edibles with more basic extracts uh keef water rosin oh yeah right i i prefer those as extracts for sure hey all of you uh uh edible companies out there man don't just use distillate make some with keef make some with rosie yeah your clientele will love it too i'm sure they'll start learning you know when to experiment with different inputs is you know the education of all this stuff will definitely keep growing with more states becoming legal here you know as we keep seeing it almost weekly and it seems like i see another state is passing some you know medical cannabis or recreational loss which is great man so you know hawaii yesterday alabama tennessee like people in texas new york new jersey like it's going everywhere right it's happening man it's happening and that's great you know and you know that people people are going to want they're going to want to learn about it you know that's how it is man you know the thing about private market cannabis and that industry is is we always try to squeeze as many dollars as many cents out of a square foot or out of a plant as possible because you know it was gray market or it was totally illegal and and now that we have these legal markets it allows to us to do research and experiment with with cannabis on a different scale and you know even though like solventless you know might be twice as much on the shelf it might be 65 80 a gram on the shelf you know the the the manufacturer still is he's not really like making a ton of money at that price it's literally you know he's making less money that way than he would if he was doing butane or propane or co2 right he's making less money that way than he would if he was actually probably selling the buds for flour too right like it it really gives is solventless extract it really defines to some degree a different segment of cannabis production right because it's not just like this like the biggest bang for the buck right get the most money out of the square foot it's like hey i want to make this product and this is how we make it and then the market bears the price 200 100 yeah it's definitely a it's a it's a special product that like you're saying it's there's multiple steps to it man you know so so complex i mean it should be worth 120 a gram i mean i was just out in california and that's what it was about yeah it's 120 a gram there though because all the taxes that go on yeah and that's and that's what i was yeah it was attacked right right but yeah it's uh i don't like to say it's not for everybody but like you know if you want to get into it man it's definitely something that like it takes a little bit of you know diving into you know there's a few steps to it a few things that you definitely gotta you know you gotta pay attention to detail that's what this is man you know it's more like a food or a laboratory-like environment all right not to say not i mean that's what you know other extraction techniques as well not to say that's not how you would treat it with that one but like you know just particularly with the solvents man like like you said you grow all your flour you could take this flour and sell it as flour or you would take it and you know throw it in this water with this ice swishing around and hopefully some trichomes come out i mean you know that sounds crazy yeah crazy it does you know the research and you know the groundwork that a lot of people have done you know in the past few years i would say have definitely like built that confidence and i would say you know definitely curious minds like me for sure because it was definitely tough for me to dive into it too i remember thinking about this more than a few years back i'm like man that's crazy just take the flower and throw it in there and like like really okay but now you learn and you get educated and you're like okay now it makes sense you know now okay cool i'm definitely gonna go take my flower and throw it in there and do that you know because this browsing thing just tastes really good makes my edibles taste really good too so sorry i just had to break for a second you guys over at the uh i just do yeah right yes yeah i know you gotta have security up in the studio man all kinds of [ __ ] roll up here i mean tupac learned it the most i know dude that's right that's right i just was watching a couple episodes on hip hop evolution about that sad story man sad story sad story sad story yeah you know greatness often is is snuffed out too early man that that's you know i lost a couple friends this year uh danny smallwood and rob cox and man like you know it's always sad when uh flame goes out too quick man yeah that's right yeah man my condolences i'm sorry to hear that man hey both those guys danny and rob loved extract love bubble rob love bubble i was making it with both of those guys in literally 2002 and nice we we got super high you know on more than one occasion on a a handmade bubble that we just made with literally pantyhose and silk screen and man you're taking it back man you're taking it back [Laughter] right but it can it you know you don't have to have all the equipment you can do it at home you can do simple extractions at home and people should try if you're a home grower definitely try to do that go to the store go to the dispensary buy some see what theirs is like and then try to mimic it right yeah 100 there's a lot of information out there on the web these days uh you can follow an array of guys on instagram too um that are really interested it seems like in letting people know how to do this i gather a lot of information just from perusing instagram man following people that i look up to that i know we're doing big things out here in the industry and you know if you're familiar with colorado's or rosin scene you know who i'm talking about but you can find some information out there don't be scared of it man you can get the equipment relatively easy and it's relatively easy to use and you know learning curve with anything i mean don't expect you know just get it and then all of a sudden you know you got what you but it takes a little bit but you curiosity man you got to want to do it you know you got to be about it that's all i'm going to say you know like yeah you know if like if you like extractions and you like smoking extractions and you have access to flour and you know you have opportunity to do it you're in a state that allows you to do it i say do it absolutely i believe that state can be a state of well-being 100 so uh yeah get out there grow some weed man make some extract of it roll some joints with it yeah pass it along to your friends and your family and then grow some more do it yeah keep it going man keep it down great chat with you man likewise man i really appreciate you having me it's uh you know really an honor being on this show and i you know sharing the information that i possess here which you know take it for what you want but uh yeah man you know what i love about you man is next year you're gonna be on a totally different plane with this we should do another one next year and see where you're coming out with it you just learned so much you're like a sponge man i'll come out there i'll i'll come see you in okc next year we'll do it out there oh yeah hey absolutely we'll we'll uh yeah man we'll make some we meant to make some this year but it didn't work out just yeah that's what that makes yeah we'll get it going man no worries come you know do some fishing as well oh well i don't know man you tear it up a little bit too much [Laughter] i need my fish in my pond you're catching them all come on man i look forward to it chris man i miss you guys likewise man it was good chatting with you this morning thanks again this is uh chris with solely solvent list how can how can people look you up chris oh you can find us on instagram uh we're a solely dot solving lesson that's s-o-u-l-y dot solventless pretty easy to find yeah man so we not solving this um check us out we got some you know good things happening here very soon and uh yeah be on the lookout for us thanks again chris man appreciate it thank you and have a good one too oh man i tell you after that episode i want to sit back and uh vape up some some good solventless extractor maybe even go back and get myself some bubble hash and sprinkle some on a nice large joint you know i think i might have ruined myself that extract years ago by making uh trainwreck keefe joints and and train wreck bubble hash joints i probably lost a couple years smoking dust and i hope you guys learned a lot about extracts and solventless extracts today you know they're they're they're not dangerous they're safe it's just water um not that like hydrocarbon products are dangerous either but but many people have an aversion to them but hey you shouldn't if you're interested in you know uh solventless extracts or bubble hash man you should try something if you can make it at home you can buy a lot of the materials online you can always check us out at cultivate colorado.com cultivateokc.com hey if you haven't already subscribed to our podcast please do that's the real dirt podcast with chip baker and check out our youtube channel man we're going to put all of our episodes on there from the past we're going to have all our new episodes on there so you'll be able to listen to all 70 80 90 episodes on youtube at your will so thanks a lot for joining us again today yeah man the next time you're out there in the world the next time you're at a dispensary ask the dispensary about solventless extracts ask them their opinion um ask them to show you some this has been chip with real dirt thanks again", "UwwitbTOJGE": "a Florida medical marijuana patients what's happenin this is Florida medical marijuana reviews coming at you with the review for the subra melt from fluent subra is there strain of Sour Diesel it is super delicious it almost had like a lemony sour taste towards the end of it this last week about having it and I say that because it's changed but this was it in the beginning it had a very grainy sandy texture not many of the glands had come to like a clear coat covering you know where they've connected and become one okay but then later on after having it out for so long and having smoked it the thing the melt has is oxidized I believe is what the man told me would have happened and that's where the glands have come together it's changing in its flavor it's changed in consistency a little bit it's always actually been pasty and tough to work with you definitely want a sharper tool to use this stuff I had to definitely go out and pick something else up because my little pinpoint dab tools were not going to give me what I wanted to medicate with this is a super delicious product but for a hundred dollars I cannot guarantee you that you're going to feel more medicated from this or better medicated from this than other things such as flour or cheaper concentrates that other dispensaries have it's delicious it's great I mean I've thoroughly enjoyed it but again at a hundred dollars a gram that is for the connoisseur I do not want to say that every first time that we should go out and get this stuff because it's better and because you're paying the higher price it's going to medicate you better it's not now this is a good looking to show you how the consistency of this product really is it is a hard magic sand paste consistency and you almost need that sharp edge to almost cut this pasty dab off it's super delicious but it is going to leave a lot more residue in your dab products and on your tools and in your bowls just FYI so with this product what I'm suggesting is you definitely need to keep alcohol at hand isopropyl alcohol 91% or above so you can keep your dab tools clean so you're not bringing this ashy gunk back into your gram and keeping that up here see how much it can create I did that at a high temp to show you how much burns off its actual plant material and you're going to need a higher micron bag from fluent for them to get less plant material in their product to create an even better ice water hash essentially thanks again for watching Florida medical marijuana reviews", "V52d8bvB-8A": "yo yo you was good YouTube welcome to another live stream just getting ready to kick it take some dabs do some planning on my veg setup took care of a little bit of that planning earlier and I figured I would share with you guys what it was that I came up with for my humidity that I was trying to solve the problem with like I got three different levels in this veg rack and I gotta make sure the humidity is right on each level individually so really I didn't have too many options for that unless I went out and bought you know humidifiers that are at best case they're you know about the size of a water bottle right the problem with the humidifiers that are about this size is you don't just plug them in and they turn on there's typically an on/off switch which means that you can't use that humidifier with a typical humidistat to just turn it off and on so of course my only solution I'm left with DIY there's pretty much no solutions out there for a mini humidifier for this application and so I started thinking how many people grow in tents I would be able to utilize something if I were to create it you know I can create it relatively cheaply for less than $50 you could have a mini humidifier that stays filled up with water to the appropriate level you know and put out enough humidity to fill up a small area like one of these sections relatively quick we and like I said less than 50 bucks when all said and done really it's more like 10 bucks that's if I do it the absolute cheapest you know so I don't have my my computer with me you guys will have to excuse the fact that I'm gonna be looking at my phone a lot to talk to you guys tonight but basically the so northern Cali the issue with the small humidifiers that they have out there right now what is this trippin is it not online I think my sister Ben maybe not I don't know I can't tell how there goes never mind so the issue with the small humidifiers is they don't just turn off and on that you the ones I found you in if they have an on button so you plug it in and you have to hit the on button and usually they have two buttons once for the lights and the other ones for the actual ultrasonic humidifier but basically those small humidifier those small humidifiers the ultrasonic disk the ceramic discs you can buy those for anywhere between I found a 4-pack for like 15 bucks or a single one for 15 bucks so I ended up getting the ones that were like 15 bucks each and I got three of them one for each level and then with that ultrasonic humidifier I got mini quarter inch float valves that are about four inches long in total and basically what I intend to do is the DIY I saw it took like a a water bottle a tall one right or something like this even and they cut a hole in the side that was large enough for them to fit the ultrasonic humidifier through it it pushed it through dropped it down to the bottom right and then that hole that's there which will be above the waterline they put a small little DC powered PC fan blowing into the bottle and then they they spliced the wires together for the two and hooked him up to a power supply so when it was plugged in both the ultrasonic humidifier and that PC fan will turn on then what happens is once you fill it with water the ultrasonic humidifier will start to work and the fan will push all of that fog out of the top of the bottle into your environment so one I'm not gonna use a plastic Bob - I'm using a well-made humidifier disc not cheap ceramic like shitty ones and then the other thing is I'm not going to use a plastic bottle I'm going to make the prototype out of either ABS plastic or you know PVC something along those lines more than likely it will only be a two to three inch diameter and not a hundred percent positive what the final design is going to look like but because float valves at least the one that I wanted to use anyway if there's a horizontally placed one it's not the vertical lungs so I would get a piece of PVC and lay it on its side like this I drilled a hole through here I put my float valve in secured my quarter inch ro line now my PVC tube which is gonna be you know capped on this and this end will go to an elbow which goes straight up okay and we'll have the basically the ultrasonic humidifier in the bottom portion of that elbow the water level will stay at the right level and the you know horizontal portion of the tube the humidifier will be just an addictive water level and it'll protrude the fog up out of the top of that PVC elbow I won't need to use the PVC fan that they used and cut a hole on it because the fog won't we have one [ __ ] place to go where is it gonna go it's not gonna stay in here if it's continuously producing that fog it's going to have to push it out and then on top of that I'll have racetrack air flow within the tent itself so that airflow that's passing by or it will automatically pull the humidity out so then I just plug the whole thing into a humidistat station and boom I'll end up with a very small usable humidifier that will be basically handheld and I can place it in the corner of each one of these levels and allow the airflow within you know the unit itself to move the humidity and spread it I think that's probably going to be the cheapest easiest solution for getting that auto-shutoff is easy but otto on is the hard part usually those are the ones that have a built-in humidistat and they're not small you guys have to keep in mind this isn't an actual tent this isn't like a 4 by 4 this is a 2 by 4 and the entire area is being utilized by plants or the trade so I really it's not like I have space where I can just send a humidifier in here and just leave it on the tray that's why I was going the DIY route and going with something super small because like I said I haven't found any humidifiers that don't have the on/off switch that are small like that if I can find some that don't have the off/on switch then I could just use those but it's a pain in the ass oh my god all these people hitting me up on the DL now over you a licensed facility if so we could provide testing and compliance and blah blah [ __ ] off you guys just want to come and see where I'm growing at that's what you want good [ __ ] right off I got people emailing me from YouTube now offering me promotional items that they want me to review because they saw that I'm a can of this page and I often review items apparently they haven't watched many of my reviews I'm a pretty harsh critic they probably don't want me [ __ ] reviewing their [ __ ] besides it was a rolling train I'm not gonna review a role what the [ __ ] piece of metal it's a metal [ __ ] train what am I gonna review the design it looks like [ __ ] I don't want it hey Tunsil it's unsolicited emails and [ __ ] unsolicited calls and emails like oh those are the worst the calls gets me every time anyways we're gonna smack down some of this run some dried [ __ ] tonight I my uncle came through I lashed him up with a little bit by half a gram not closer to a full gram he came through with some [ __ ] poop soup though some BH know I had to let him I don't let him know what's up um you can't be doing this to me so I had to break them off of some of the runs dry sips oh yeah let's get in there Oh Oh [Music] oh so creamy so sticky icky Wiggy how're my music way what's up Tim Sapna go find some good music to put on here [Music] I don't know what I want to listen to you tonight hi work playlist with The Simpsons in the background that works Cheers [Music] [Music] [Music] [ __ ] backward [Music] oh yeah that'll do Pig that'll do [Music] [Music] this [ __ ] gets stronger and stronger every day I swear to god I'll take a half a dab it max me in the back of the head [Music] gotta be more fun [Music] well I guess I can't be watching you guys and shad awful thing hotdogs on this wire this battery bank for I should just go get my laptop [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] goddamn [Music] [Applause] now that my first dab at night since I got the kids down and that [ __ ] he's got me [ __ ] sweating I gathered at 395 you guys I wasn't even hot down that [ __ ] is just macking the high on this is something else I think I might have Loki underestimated the runs a little bit because I delish that initial smoke you know I'm saying is never that potently it's not fully dried yet you gotta give it the full drive and a little bit of a cure and then that [ __ ] full potency comes out and grab you by the [ __ ] balls that's where I adapted this [ __ ] the same day but I made it didn't hit like this actually it's different so what I wanted to do tonight was kind of clean up a little bit behind me just take this [ __ ] basically and go put it in another box and deal with it later and then I'm gonna show you some of the irrigation components that I got in the mail the other night we did a live session and we planned everything out on the live session and I placed the order for the parts and some of those parts are already here so I figure now would be a good time to kind of go over them those of you that are in the process of either doing or planning irrigation setups this talk is for you alright so I dropped its Hertz Berlin here don't ask [Music] so go get your notebooks pull up your computer or whatever the [ __ ] you got to do I'm gonna explain exactly what I bought exactly how much it cost and every component for the irrigation for this behind there it is found it I was trying to dump the water in the Banger into that can and I forgot that was puerperal in it and it just ended up in the can I know you guys are like what the [ __ ] is going on alright so basically I'm not going to have much automation to this because what I intend to use it for is for keeping the mother plants of the keeper if he knows that I find I'm about to pop four packs of seeds to be from strains 20 beans each they're all feminized so I'll be taking cups multiple cuts from each of those and then making sure that those are successfully rooted before I flipped to flower and then during flower I'll figure out you know obviously didn't have to chop I'll figure out which the keepers are and I'll mix the rest keep my keepers and then basically I'm gonna sort my way through about probably eight to ten different genetics from honest honest genetics for twenty I have a bunch of new gear from him so I'm just gonna start going through packs and finding my keepers and as I find a keeper this is my stable I'll add it to the stable my intention is to find four to six ultimately that you know I can put in the room and have two to three of them maybe even four of them all play nice together or at least to portray that can be harvested at the same time because I could feel each trade differently I can harvest them a couple days you know separate or even a couple of weeks if needed without truly you know hurting one yield or the other right but that means I need two of these shelves for keeping mothers and one for cloning at a minimum so my irrigation is going to be at least in the meantime basically the same for the first round of clones that I take so it's going to be pressure compensating drippers actually I'll bring it all in here I have all the goodies right here all right so first things first I am not good at cloning all right I'll say it again I am not good at cloning why because I haven't done it [ __ ] a long time right like consistently I've had to do it sporadically here in there the one the only good way I am at cloning is aeroponics that's it I can clone the [ __ ] out of something aeroponics easy cloner Dooley mr. just bubbles whatever crappy method but the first way that I ever learned how to clone and I was like pretty successful at it was with these rapid readers for whatever reason I felt like these rooted really easy and really consistently and then I moved to using waffle starter cubes and just cloning in a dome and I wasn't good at that because I would keep the moisture level too high with brew and they were damping off and my stupid [ __ ] finally I got my cloning tech town and I would have you know all my clones rooted in an aeroponic clone or like an easy cloner and then I want transfer them to cubes with an easy peasy right roots in like seven days eight days and then I was like [ __ ] this is kind of not cool I need to just learn how to like clone properly in starter cubes so I can have an easier transfer when I start veg couldn't get the [ __ ] neck for using the starter cubes so I picked up some more rewrites and I'm just gonna run these I don't use clone X at all you know for popping seeds which is what I'm gonna be doing not cloning right poppin seeds in these these are gonna work way better I think so I'm gonna go with these last time I tried popping seeds in rock wool starter cubes [ __ ] half the seeds got stuck because rock wool is not forgiving it's not gonna move like soil or cocoa or even this spongy [ __ ] you know so for me what I do is for my seeds I do a 30-minute undiluted herb natural soap for the seeds once the seeds come out of that I'm gonna be popping them directly into these root rights these will get soaked in some herb as well so these will be inoculated and I might even use a little bit of 891 roots and between those two things forget about it a seed is gonna come out taken off but we're gonna pop all the seeds in here anyways domes Riots some inserts and then I got the fancy trays that are black on the outside white on the inside so when I go to pop seeds it'll be twenty per tray I have twenty of the area on the ground a 2003 honor so we'll have that going miss why I needed to clean this [ __ ] off so I could start putting all this stuff in here but the goal is to have my DIY humidifiers built by next week when everything else comes and then once I have the humidifiers built I already got the magnets and window foam to completely seal the front of this with more insulation so I'll have that removable door you know have a humidifier and I got my eighty infinity fan I didn't show you that yeah it's so I have that AC infinity fan with the HEPA filter and then I've got another six inch AC infinity fan up there and I mounted the controller for it right here I don't have a plugged in right now but I mounted that right there and then basically I'll stick the sensor inside and I'm gonna put it at the highest level because heat rises so it's gonna be the hottest up here at the top so I'll put the sensor up here and if it gets too hot or too humid then it'll go ahead and pretty much cycle all the air in here so I got the AC infinity fan let's see what else I got a bunch of half inch tubing for the irrigation that's not for the actual like irrigation it's more for like the waste lines right the drain lines that these so that'll drain from the top table to the second table to the bottom table and into a condensate pump and then from the condensate pump out of the room up there in the corner that's what that line is for I got more sensor cards for every single cube on the grow game and then I got 0.3 gallon per hour preassembled meta-chem drippers these are pressure compensating okay and basically you can do one or two of these per cube I like to run to so I got like 200 of them so I could take care of my flower room and then I think that's all I got in there for today and then let's see this is uh all my grow down right here [Music] [Music] [Music] Rodan my oh hey do you guys on a send me a box or two on your new Jumbo's your 6x6 by borders i already run your hugo's to 6x6 my senses and I want to see if they're better just take a look at my image and let me know so I took a look at my page Vania they're like hey we would like to send you a couple boxes so you can run your all next run so they sent me two cases sixty four and eight so these are six by six by fours and they're two inches shorter you get a little bit faster veg time so I'll be running these on top of the root risers next to grow the aspects of [ __ ] hmm [Music] well so much to do is so little time yeah I know I told him like look at my [ __ ] it'd be good promo for you guys cuz I already was tagging them and a lot of my stuff that I was doing so I think it's a good move for them you know what I'm saying like they're gonna benefit from the promotion I wish I do what was stopping this from closing so I thought about that too Galloway how many say way yeah the root risers the root risers definitely do that they they air prove the roots just a little bit so let me show you a little bit more of what I got and then I'm gonna do a little bit you know if I guys but so in order to run pressure compensating drippers you need to hit a certain psi in your irrigation system for them to start working because they stay closed until they above I want to say five or six psi you have to hit that minimum but typically you want to sustain around 25 to 35 psi in your irrigation system for pressure compensating drippers to function properly so I picked up this sure flow pump this is a 55 psi pump they have smaller psi pumps so that you don't have to get a psi regulator but I went ahead and purchased a Hendrickson Bros mini pressure regulator that will basically screw on to this side which is the outlet this is the inlet side or the vacuum side and I purchased a couple of these inline filters that just screw on and they are a mesh filter I'm not sure what micron but I know it's enough for what I'm going to be using it for since I just use you know salt based newts so I have two of these just in case one malfunctions or whatever but it's easy to clean easy to replace this goes before the pump right so you screw this on all right and then it comes with these cool little attachments so you can either have a half inch threaded fitting or you can screw on this fitting which gives you a barbed connection all right the half inch barb so that's on the inlet side now what I'll run from here is all run the half inch net 'litham tubing that I have with a couple elbows and I'll run that to my reservoir that I'm going to have so it'll pull nutrients up and out of that reservoir and this is going to sit on the floor because it is a tad bit noisy but not if you put it on the floor so this will go on the floor it'll pull nutrients in through the filter and then it will come out of this side and go through the pressure regulator which I got a twenty psi pressure regulator and as soon as that 30 s become available they are out of stock I'll get a thirty and I'll replace the 21 to 30 that'll screw on to this side right here and then this will screw on to that okay they screw directly one on say it either - it's perfect and then this will run from you know here to Mehta filled fittings and it'll basically go into the bottom of the tent over here right in that corner and it'll come up and it'll tee off and I'll have a line full of these drippers that I got coming off that back line and at the end of that line I'll have one of these Jane lateral flush valves these also operate off of psi so once the pump turns off I'll have a vacuum relief up there and then that arrow will come in and flush the old nutrients out through that lateral flush valve that way the next time the plants go to get fed there's nothing in the lines it's completely cleared and they get a whole fresh batch of nutrients no stale old newts so these go at the end of every line and I can show you what that looks like because I have the ends of my old irrigation lines right here scrap this one so it's at like this on the table and this was the end of the line over here and I have a pressure gauge so I could see what my running pressure was and if there was ever a clog in the system and it was happening on that table I would know or if there was an issue going on where some pressure or some you know drippers weren't working I could check the pressure what's the pressure at the whole line right now here's that lateral flush valve so every time that the you know pump would cut off boom this would fill with air and all the old nutrients would flow out of the bottom same thing when the pump first turns on this allows air to come out so it pushes all the air out of the end of the line through here so these major key so this is basically what will be set up in here right but it'll go this way because obviously my trades are going like that so I'll have this set up on every single tray and then drippers and it'll tee off and basically go from the bottom you'll go across and then ot will go up to the next level and then it'll tee off and do the same thing to the next level and then at the very end at the top I'll have a vacuum relief valve so that the whole system can allow air in to flush out the old [ __ ] and then again everything will drain down through the drain on each tray down to the next one and then I'll have a condensate pump that'll pump everything out of the room [Music] so I think that is pretty much everything oh yeah but you're using the hydro veggie garden huh that's nope my wife wants to really get some veggies going indoors stop do you nuts I appreciate it on me yeah so that's that's the plan right now with the irrigation so between the irrigation that I have planned and then I'll just put it on a cycle timer at the pump you know what I'm saying I'll monitor the the cubes I'll probably get you know a pulse meter of bluelab pulse meter because then I can stick it in each individual cube to measure it and see if it needs to be water right and then I can develop irrigation cycles for each plant and start to shift them into one irrigation cycle what I need to yeah pumps out to my yard and right now it goes to waste but here in the next couple of weeks we're going to start redoing our backyard so I'll start capturing all the waste and pumping that into my irrigation system so it feeds all the plants outside Jesus Christ I'm getting so many like somebody's going through my youtube and reporting me ridiculous get off my nuts whoever is my [ __ ] and you tease anyways that's the plan for that but what I really need to do is I need to stop [ __ ] I need to stop buying more [ __ ] so yeah ace to infinity fan is gonna cover humidity temperature I've got the humidifier taken care of we got two daehyun the room I'll be venting a tent to clear the temperature got irrigation taken care of I got drainage taken care of I've got lights taken care of if I need to I can bring my part meter from the other room in here and still see what the par is so I can dial the lights down to the appropriate level for each tray and then once it's set it'll pretty much stay there it'll never change I might [ __ ] with the spectrums a little bit but that's about it so I think we're good we meet I'm good I don't know what y'all are doing are you good did you guys do some [ __ ] today without productive girl your cloning callers over here I don't [ __ ] eat my bad you guys can't even see what I'm doing nothing important I promise you don't need you in my face back clothes that's for sure look feel bored oh good show right there BAM damn you bought more beans ocean you have constantly like new genetics I envy you guys that can do that and then clean up some of my [ __ ] right here I still have a whole pack of two-gallon for our drippers I'm probably going to use those on my irrigation outside actually okay so it's going in there that's how simple I am when it comes to cleaning or moving like here's here's my methodology trash or its stain that's it that's step one simplify the [ __ ] out of it step two go through the pile of [ __ ] that you kept and then organize it but step one simple trash keep trash keep get that [ __ ] over it cuz just looking at a room full of [ __ ] for so long could be daunting so where you don't want to do it I have like a whole bunch of jars that are empty I neither recycle have old box [Music] anyways I'm gonna come and talk to you guys while I do it yeah we're dizzy pop I need to order a couple more bees to be the circulation bands for each level I have one I need a total of six so I got a word five more of these they don't have to necessarily be the Eco plus model it just needs to be an axial fan but that one is damn good for sure [Music] all this [ __ ] that I don't use for our hash making anymore they [Music] hache collection spoons there's like hash on it so my wife's been asking me where all the spoons are now I know there's email coil and some sour patch from sevens and coils I'll clean up one of my bangers and I'll do a giveaway a 30ml banger and boil the banger will be slightly used but I'll make it look brand new no luck it's empty a little bit more DC cleaner actually we could refill my little bottle so that's good label tape some zip locks or now some back seals here's some nug that Merlyn melts gave me when he came over a couple weeks ago this is I don't know but it's like very very green like it's been trapped in this bag too long and I needed to not be in here I don't smoke any flower that anybody gives me any less I tell people not to bring me flower I'm not gonna lie very very very very few people give me a flower that I'm impressed with and that's not me being snobbish or cocky or arrogant none of that [ __ ] it's just a lot of people like to show off before it's time and their bud isn't fully cured yet so they give it to you and it still has that green smell you know and that's hard too [ __ ] it's hard to get rid of good but I look but I use all these up you gotta bleed ah ah that was worse than stepping on Legos [ __ ] stepped on that little [ __ ] half inch drain Evan flow drain in my [ __ ] socks [ __ ] me we're looking like what the [ __ ] this will have so much random [ __ ] in there it's true I do I look there's a humidity thing for toll master I could probably just I could I think I have enough stations left on my full house to set up in there I could run three more of these and just program them but no they read off the sensor in that room that wouldn't work you know my [ __ ] [Music] all my lives for my my wrongs but I have some big drops come in so packaging [ __ ] down there yo and here's some keep this tight I got tired of using zip ties during my last harvest when I was like having to cut the plants and hang them but it's because my [ __ ] carabiners hadn't shown up yet I ordered a bunch of mini carabiners so next time when I harvest I'm literally gonna chop the plant flip it upside down hook a carabiner on one of the thickest branches at the base of the stalk and then just boom pop the carabiner onto the the wire that I'm hanging it from boom clipping clip it to be so easy peasy no having to sit there and [ __ ] around with threading zip ties that sure was kind of aggravating so a lot of these games pups are good thank you for asking they are growing up quick growing up too quick I'm gonna use these bags are contaminated they've been out you press the parchment here don't repress slap I'm not going to put up yeah got masks and loves here and so I'll put this down here with packaging my easy super cropper my infrared thermometer my skull and some snips and I'm gonna take all that stuff and I'm gonna put that and I'm gonna hang a basket over here in the grow room and I'm gonna put all this stuff in there it'll be my growers toolbox I wait it's always in the same spot I don't [ __ ] around and move it and lose it all that other fun stuff but I like to do is often so I got shrimp in down here I've got naan whose bag of trash down here I don't know if you could see me now there got your bag of trash down here spill [Music] hopefully I have to use up the rest of these jars on my next drop these are 1 ounce amber jars for keeping those Turks preserved I only pull these out on the larger orders of like for teens and up and I just have a bunch of slaps and giveaway stuff in here [Music] so that's where I'll quit this jar going to the graveyard alright so they're all channel caps for giveaways started here I don't need over here I've been procrastinating on cleaning this [ __ ] out for at least two weeks you guys why am i doing it right now on a live session because you guys are putting me on the spot so I have to do it that's why I did it to myself put myself in a position I know I wouldn't be able to make an excuse for myself to get out I tried a couple different magnets tonight to try and get the the front covers of insulation to stay on but they weren't strong enough so I'm gonna order some neodymium magnets some rare earth metal magnet whatever you want to follow from Amazon that are going to be much stronger and bigger and then that way I can just boom stick the door up and it'll magnetize and stick to it and then I got like I said the window cushion that will fill in the gaps so that way there's no light leak or pads or anything else like that I would have an entryway so I'm gonna put my window foam in there so I can finish that up I'm gonna put these seven generation wipes back in the house before my wife kills me because she was looking for these let's see here all of this stuff would stay there [Music] parchment paper is we will make your teeth yeah [ __ ] I need more space all that going on here my irritation and my home just trying to prep the breakfast age basically for coming in here and just throwing the throw in the irrigation in and cleaning the the trays out and I don't want to have to come in here and clean on a day that I'm trying to install [ __ ] dude spice to work that way all right tree irrigation [ __ ] now I just got tools and [ __ ] down here my cars here drain plug [Music] and a shopper back that I'm not even gonna trip on getting that [ __ ] thing right now all right let me take this [ __ ] out of the room and then I think I've got a good starting point [Music] man I'm glad that's all done I feel better I could take this GoPro mount understand - smoke this flower I'm gonna throw it in the trash [Music] [Music] [Music] all this is wire management like zip ties and wall mounts or the zip ties for the ACM fatty fan so I'll keep that in here I need that these press bags floating around here and again there [Music] don't use this [Music] do I need any of this maybe I should be doing the rest of the AC infinity stuff my marker goes there my uncle forgot to take these nugs that I gave him earlier swish okay I'm feeling good this is looking good we're almost there couple more small things to do you guys might not do all of this on camera but hey boo boo I do [Music] Who am I kidding have that I do that in here monkey don't work oh no I had a walk first all right I'm just about done I want a [ __ ] trash and tomorrow I get to shopback this room take all my equipment out and I'm going to probably put up baseboards on Monday and then a wash on Monday too why am i cleaning like this quickly because I hit the [ __ ] run swear it out once get you [ __ ] going it's like a go gear every time I have it it's just like a burst of clear focused energy like here's what you need to do here's your task get it done there's other [ __ ] that I dab and I I start dabbing it and then what should be a productive day turns into me not really being a productive as I should because I either just you taking more tabs or you know you just get stuck you know [ __ ] and you don't realize it fool yourself like oh I'm not stuck or whatever but man and you smoke something that truly gives you like that bursts of crazy energy and you're like oh [ __ ] now I know maybe I have been a little bit doorman [Music] the fun oh my marker [ __ ] this about the fire room before this room all right much better much much oh all right Wow there is 31 people watching me walk around cleaning oh I do clean and reuse the jars John Smith I'm not throwing those away so the back therapy that idea that you're talking about that was called spinal decompression via traction right the machine is called a traction machine for some people it works well and for others it doesn't it depends on what your issues are but for the majority of people that have chronic back pain your muscles are inflamed and irritated so the traction doesn't really do anything for your muscles it just kind of provides temporary relief through the decompression that brother Rick yeah so let's see there's a couple things that I need to take care of next week hopefully I should be hearing an update about when to expect my new rolling bench I'm just gonna go pick it up take the guys down there some treats they take care of me I'll take care of them so you knew once I get the other 4x8 that other room was pretty much ready to go I have a few small chores to take care of I can't seem to get any type of duster inside of the Schaefer fans to take care of the blades so I'm going to just buy some compressed air I don't think that there's any amount of anything on there that can be knocked off with just a little bit of compressed air so I'll do that and then I'm gonna create the par map of the room and orient the lights in a way that will best suit the ppfd spread and yeah I think after that it'll be just throw the plants in and rock and roll there's another jar for the graveyard and now I don't sleep I'm a vampire doc cravings coffee I need more paper towels you guys are over there I wasn't take you with me but [ __ ] that you like my house is probably a mess right now I'm sorry Carly I had to back out and get myself a thumbs up real quick a alright so now I got both these [ __ ] trees cleared out Sun system is taking forever to get the third tray to the hydro shop but as soon as the hydro shop gets that I'll pick it up we'll have all three rocks in the fun doors we'll be done I'll have the humidifier excuse me the humidifier is done I don't know what else I need I'm just trying to make sure I have like everything 100% done before I pop it I don't have a go-to strain there's no way because if you can give me you can give me any strain I don't care how fire you think it is whatever give me three days of dabbing it and I'll be over it because you need variety when you have a tolerance like I do it's a hundred percent of all variety so you live close to the bill that's the start send me a friend request on IG I like to get to know the locals about to eat some of these [ __ ] - right here I don't know about these already peeled state\u00f5s shell filled whatever delicious it's almost midnight though and I'm creating coffee and I'm really like hmm I have decaf their girl wants to do shrooms do it man do that [ __ ] my experience with shrooms is like this I have two of them one of them was just me at a house a house party my boys house and it was like coolers [ __ ] coalition it was after the party with already drank already pops and strums just listen to music and chill and play games it was it was a cool experience I felt like my senses were elevated in a way that you could only understand if you were to experience it basically yeah I [ __ ] got me I took almost three and a half grams dog we started off with two and then like let me try one more and then it kicked in and it was a trip like I felt like my senses were connected in a way that it's hard to explain oh I'll tell that you straight up like this we were listening to music it wasn't really loud there wasn't a lot of bass or anything like that but like I could I could see the the sounds from the songs right so it looked like a techno bass song or something like that and every time there was like a laser sound that would go off I could see I could visualize it like like for me I was actually seeing it I could see that laser shoot across the room right but it wasn't a laser it never was it was just a sound and it wasn't necessarily the sound of a laser it was a sound that I correlated to that visual and then I could taste colors so whatever color I ended up seeing I could taste like my homie his roommate walked through the room he was this big black dude who's wearing a purple shirt and I called him [ __ ] the the Barney kool-aid man or something but then as I was talking [ __ ] like I could literally like taste the color purple in in like the craziest ways to imagine it you know and it would happen with other colors that I would see that would just pop out and I could like taste it and it wasn't always like a significant taste it was weird I don't know but it was just in a different experience right it's totally controlled by your atmosphere and the people around you like you said got to be around chill people if you have one person who has any negative feeling going into it don't allow them to be a part of it if they're nervous anxious like anything other than like excited and happy don't do it because that paranoia comes out like times a million when they are on shrooms and they can't control themselves and it ruins the high for everybody it's crazy sex on shrooms don't do it why because it'll probably ruin the sensation for you forever because I didn't even like have sex on shrooms but we were like there was three pretty much couples of people in the room and we were all just laying there like [ __ ] for the morning drunk like four hours into this trip everybody's wishing they could come off but they can't because everybody's wants to go to sleep we're tired and shrooms when you go on trips you better be [ __ ] prepared for like a good 6 to 8 hour trip and it's not one of those trips that you can just talk to yourself out of it's not like when you're a little buzzed or a little high and you're like oh [ __ ] there's the cops I gotta sober up or oh my parents are here sober up hey you're not coming down until the shrooms tell you to but we were all laying in this room alike so [ __ ] we ours is the more you're trying to go to sleep and somebody you were just here one person just start to the giggle a little bit and you couldn't help it you hear that and you lose your [ __ ] [ __ ] and everybody starts cracking up nobody knows why they're laughing they're just laughing because the person next to laughing and it feels [ __ ] good to laugh and you get like a little touch just the right touch like somebody could like do this to your head and it'll sing [ __ ] vibrations through your entire body that are just like orgasmic ripples just like all the way through your body is crazy off of a simple they can walk past you and nudge you and you'll be like don't [ __ ] touch me dog now remember there's different types of shrooms and then the caps and the stems affect you differently I took an equal dose of caps and stems and I don't know what type of shrooms they are or were but man that was some [ __ ] so yeah I've done that twice and then the other time we were in we were in Vegas that was fun that was fun but yeah man it's something that I've wanted to do again but you have to be around the right people in the right environment and me being a family man now the situation I'm in i how am I gonna justify yeah let me go spend eight to ten hours of Monday I hide on shrooms while my kids are at home with mom like no no that's not gonna happen so when they're older all experiment again see what happens I mean I think that there's something to be said about psilocybin I think that there's a lot of research that needs to be done I know that they were doing a lot of medical research into psilocybin and the different diseases that it can help treat in like depression I think that you know it's another thing that was suppressed by the government because it posed a threat right also it's dangerous it truly is but I don't know oh you [ __ ] hippies on shrooms and and on acid and blah blah blah speaking about your all of your idealistic movements [Music] funny sure [ __ ] my homie poppin solvent less mm puffing solvent list I need a care package puffing solvent list is dropping all these crazy-ass edibles let me know the tickets aw his poor brother I love supporting my local hash homies man I got just amazing work to and he put me on the game with some [ __ ] man look at this tell me that doesn't look good mmm Jesus why five number five pre whip looking like Froyo a couple jars of it right there my man has some s'mores vegan toaster pastries some brown sugar vegan toaster pastries birthday cake Wow he's doing it up citrus fruit shoes jeez I'm gonna need me some of that oh my god I'm gonna get so many edibles from him right now 15 each I want two of everything literally so I gotta finish typing this I'm so single tasks minded right now so I told my man's right now I want two of everything and if you need help moving like if he has so much that he needs help moving it I would put his stuff on my menu I have never offered anybody else's product on my menu ever but I know his work I trust his work he personally goes to the garden where it's grown and chops it down for fresh frozen and runs it himself and they need collabs with these different edible companies for his food great ash and makes really good edibles so [ __ ] yeah that's dope cuz here's the thing I would love to be able to offer people edibles but when I do that they want to know how many milligrams you can't measure that until you measure the decarboxylated oil that you're using for the recipe so it doesn't matter if you measured the flour or the starting material doesn't matter if you even measure the THC in the rosin once you go through a D card process you have to measure the THC all over again see what the actual percentage is and then you can calculate it into your recipes right but that's not practical for me I don't make idols that often and when I do it's on a small batch basis so for me to be able to provide his edibles which I know are super fire now you do and I'll be putting my homie on you know what I'm saying [ __ ] yeah I just told him two of everything he has I don't even know what ready guys he might have like ten different [ __ ] things that's fine what at all those down on the flow flow if you're not [ __ ] spending money with your homies they're not your homies they're your [ __ ] [ __ ] or at least that's how you're treating them if you're not [ __ ] paying [Music] I might have to do a collab with this company I have a book ton of runts you know how tired hmm [ __ ] me I need my inhaler my [ __ ] asthma is killing me today um you know how much runs I have I'm gonna be so tired of that [ __ ] I should just do a whole run and give them like half the yield to turn into edibles for me these look so good I'm out to go grab my inhaler a real fast I'll be right back all right I think I'll live Thank You Nyjah you did not have to do that I appreciate you yeah that was a crazy night that was the night that I made gummies on a live stream and there was a bunch of extra so I just poured it onto a paper plate and it was probably like a quarter-inch thick cover the whole bottom of the plate everybody said oh dear view my dumbass said okay I was so [ __ ] high I was just oh my god it hit me like a [ __ ] Mack truck and then less than an hour later my wife's like babe I think I'm in labor and I was like what ah for real I was like I'm so [ __ ] high right now I was like really I ate like edibles you're not you're not due for five more weeks are you kidding me so we started getting ready luckily we were waiting cuz my other daughter at the time is so young we didn't want to wake her up and take her and all that so we waited on my sister show up which took about 45 minutes I had a little bit of time to sober up and then drive us down to the hospital Sammy um I was fighting to drive but it was more so like what the [ __ ] I'm too high for this [ __ ] right now like this is too real and what is trip it was a [ __ ] trip as soon as we got to the hospital and I started talking to doctors though like I was like sobers could be [ __ ] me wild [ __ ] night for sure [Music] the how is that was not fun I wasn't just a regular animal I was probably like two to three times the size of a normal [ __ ] serving of an edible way too big it was supposed to be a oh well I'm going to sleep and tomorrow's my day to sleep in type of a [ __ ] edible knot I was expecting you to [ __ ] drive to the hospital in an hour attack of edible yeah oh well 2,000 milligrams I don't know I couldn't even tell you brother I put I don't even know how many grams of hash frozen into this batch of gummies and there was just a bunch of extra it was uh yeah it was quite a bit I'd say it was probably each one of those gummies was were probably around 150 to 250 milligrams or so just going off of weight right it was a lot that's a lot it was enough to where I still would not redo that amount even if I didn't have to drive I wouldn't redo it the discipline yeah that's all these notifications going on all right you guys I think I'm gonna go ahead and call it a night I'm getting tired now go hit some munchies play some [ __ ] Galaga call it a night probably catch you guys on Monday probably take a break from streaming this weekend and do some uploading to YouTube take care of some stuff the plan for this upcoming grow is pretty shortly I'm going to just start recording when I come into the garden to work I'm gonna put the GoPro on and I'll just record it kind of like you guys ever watched Vader og kind of like that style except I'm not gonna do as much editing and [ __ ] so it'd be pretty cool cuz I'll have more frequent uploads but yeah I don't know I need an editor if any of you guys want to volunteer to edit videos for the channel let me know anyways I'll catch you guys later thank you for hanging out and if I appreciate the donation as always and I'll catch you guys on the next one", "hdQt-Ej-2Ho": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with tokentim420 this is a florida medical marijuana review for those over the age of 18 and medical marijuana patients all right like say hi to everybody out there if you haven't subscribed hit that subscribe button down there leave me a thumbs up thumbs down let me know how you're feeling tonight what you're smoking on token on what you're moved in um so today we got the token tim's mad scientist lab we are going to be making some rosin vape carts on our own save a lot of money um i will like give a shout out real quick um i got some of that girl scout cookie now this stuff was only coming in at 15 it was minnie's i couldn't see that online um and i'm not a fan of girl scouts but this stuff totally changed my mind this stuff's real good um nice flavor to it nice high to it not quite a sativity ah as sativa leaning as the last stuff i've had that was the girl scout cookie so like i said not bad at all all right so we're gonna make our own rosin vape carts now you guys know i've tried true leaves i just went and got another one we got the skunk ape blue river rosin we tried both of them for cure leaf i left the other box in there from the select um some people was asking if this was live resin or not to me it didn't really taste like that tastes more like the terpene like the cannabis infused terpene vape pens exactly like them so if you could find those vape pens cheaper i'd go with them but we're going to show you a way to do it real cheap and i tell you what they taste amazing all right so we squirted a little distillate in there i got i was trying some of them i got a little tore up had to take a break my water cooled off so it didn't work so this is take two on the video honestly um that's that papaya cake rosin from move or from true leave sorry um in there and then the distillate we're using because it's an indica uh the indica uh bubba kush coming at 78 percent so all i did was microwave some water and a shot glass put it in there you don't want to get it up past the stopper there you don't want to get back in there i want to get this part done before it cools off again so there was probably about three left in here on this syringe it's got a little bubble but it was about at three i put a little bit in there already so when it's warmed up it's just gonna go real easy in there yeah i guess we're gonna use all of it all right that's all of it are all that we're gonna mess with getting out at the moment now if you notice the pad i'm using is that five dollar baking sheet which is silicone so it's the same thing as a dab mat that i got on amazon it was like five bucks or two for five i can't remember videos if you go back as while back i just cut a piece off to fit the table so i didn't have to clean the whole table off so now all we're going to do is we're going to take this and we're going to mix it up now i have made a few of these before i did warm the rosin up on the one and then by time i got out here it was just kind of like a hardened back up more like a caramel just letting it sit out at room temperature seems to work better let me pull it off the view for a second and make sure i got it mixed evenly sometimes the distillate wants to stay on the side but as you know the rosin carts are about 60 bucks apiece and they're only half grams so this distillate i believe was 60 bucks from grow healthy which truly has them for 60 most everybody's around the 60 mark for a full gram so this right here will fill two vape carts um and then the rosin's uh 75 gram so you basically for 135 you're getting two grams um which you would only get one gram buying it by the vape cards like i said these are half gram vape carbs these aren't full grams only half grams if you also notice on true leaves the thc is always really low i'm using 80 distillate and 80 um rosin so these are still up in the 80 percent so we're gonna use our um we had some la confidential co2 cart which i got another one of these so we will be reviewing it later then all we're going to do is unscrew the top here now i will say that it helps to have a decent dab tool the dab tool i'm using is the one i got for five dollars uh from banger supply and if you use code token tim you'll save 10 at banger supply they got these for like 5.99 so try to keep it up here in the camera see what we can do so mainly what we're going to do is we're going to take the flatter end um or either end the flatter end kind of works better towards the end and we're just going to get a glob out there like that this stuff's stringy and looking in the camera is a pain in the butt all right we'll hold that there and then what i do is just press it around the stem and then put it down in there so let me go over here and do this where you guys can still see it but yeah you guys can see it there now i'm gonna go ahead and use the flat end just kind of scoop out a big scoop like that and then smooth on that thing and it's easier just to push it right down in there you guys can see that just kind of pushing it down now it doesn't go real good um so there is a trick we'll use here in a second once we get it pretty blobbed up all right trying to it's hard for me to focus i need new glasses so i keep pulling it off the frame to me to be able to see it now i'm just scraping all the gunk out of the jar real good i'm gonna do the same thing i'm gonna go over to a clear spot each time and just wipe it off on that and then take the tool focus there we go and slide it down that thing it's not wanting to focus if it does go on the outside just scoop it back up all right we've got about all of it now the first one i tried to wait for it to go down and it just didn't seem to go down quick enough so i'm gonna take a little torch and i'm gonna heat the glass down in here i'm not gonna heat the concentrate i'm just gonna do it like that without burning my fingers off hopefully so i'm just going to slightly warm the glass going around you can see it's starting to drip there where we warmed it up so just real quick that one bubbled on me and then it starts to it'll just start to run down in there then go ahead and take the tool and access there's a little bubble there we're going to pop that scrape all that off on there try not to get it inside there for sure we've already got it about half full it doesn't take a lot um a lot of concentrate that is you can see i only had about three in that syringe and i only put a couple dabs in there it really wasn't a lot so again we're going to take a little bit sometimes with this i can just scrape it right across the glass or like i said just roll it around that and whatever's left there the mouthpiece fits real tight over that silicone ring and it just pushes everything else down let's get a real good scrape on this jar real quick and then i'll show you the other ones i made and talk about them a little bit now i will say the flavor on this stuff is just amazing it tastes just like just like doing the dab let's scrape this off of there real quick all right now i could play around and get some more out there but i want with you guys i'll just dab that out with my dab straw later so we're going to stick that on see how it just squishes that on through there and we're going to screw that on now i found with some of them you'll have to go back again with your torch and this one's a little thicker you can see it's still thick so i'm just barely going to heat it if it starts to bubble you want to quit so i have to look at this real good and it'll take a second for the heat to transfer through to the glass still a little creamy there's still some up there at the top there we go this one must be a little thicker glass than the other one i had we're just going to hit it a few times now if you notice when we did that it kind of cleared up a little bit not a lot but so you can see the little holes down in there now where the wick is you'll see how that cleared it up some and i didn't bring the battery out i told you i got pretty medicated all right but we have made a few other ones um so i made one yeah this is it i used the move vape pen and this it worked great for about two days and the battery died and if you can see right here at the bottom it's got little um holes i thought i could take it off with a battery i grabbed it with some pliers and apparently i couldn't so i shattered it what i'm going to do is unscrew the lid i'm not going to do it now because i want the glass to fall off and then i'm going to heat the banger up and i'm going to put it in there upside down like that and just let all that wax come out now this was the um i used the skunk ape and the bubba kush um the skunk ache ape was from move or true leave again sorry i don't know i got move on the head now i did put some of the thca powder in that one also and it was really really really tasty tasted just like the skunk ape tastes a lot better than the skunk ape rosin car which we'll get we'll have a video on that later but like i said really really really tasty um and the thc is going to be up there and it's a cheaper cheaper thing so i'll show you the other one i did but first we got to do it sorry it's alive all right so i did make a live resin vape cart um this is with moves rainbow train wreck and you can see how it's cleared up a little bit more i hit it with a little bit more of the torch um but it tastes amazing there's a little clog there that's why heated this one up it was clogging a little bit but man it tastes amazing and the high on there i'm telling you the high is better than any of these vape pens i've had yet and i gotta write what i put on this one so i don't forget that's the rainbow train wreck which we know it's live rosin because that's all there is um but the skunk ape one i'm telling you you know vape card even these i hit these um you know 10 good hits off of them to catch a little buzz um i was only hitting that skunk ape three three little hits and i was blasted i the dying i made that i rolled up a joint um and after my three hits i had like this much left of the joint and i looked at that i'm like hey no way i'm lighting that thing back up so it tore me up pretty good so if you guys want to give it a try like it's not really messy you do have a little bit of residue left in these so you could either take a bud and roll it around in there and then roll in some keep and make your own moon rock or you could just take your dab straw and hit it you could also take a hair dryer and melt it down so it would get it in a corner better to get a little better dab out of it but if i mess around with it with like this one that has that little scoop on the end i can pretty much get everything out of that jar there won't be anything left and especially it's starting to cool off now because it's getting ready to rain here but especially when i'm working in a hot garage and it pretty much stays warm here anyways it makes it easier to work with it's not coming back up so it's easier like i said just to push push it all the way around to the corners i just take this one the longer straighter one and get the sides like that and what i'll do with this is dab it that's what i do with the other stuff that's why i mark the charge but i think it rub keeps rubbing off with my fingers so that one's uh we just made the papaya cake so that was this one we're just gonna put a pea on the jar so i remember but yeah that's what i'll just use when i come out tonight i'll scrape that again you can see like i said i just got that little bit i wiped off on the edge there just by taking it around a little bit and just keep scraping it back on the side and then when you get enough to take a dab you just take it all off of there and dab away and like i said with the other with the rounded one it works a little better getting everything out there real good this one's not bad but the other one's better so like i said it doesn't take long to get you a dab and then just drop the dab tool in the dab rig and you're good so that's my take on making my own vape cards um the live resin i did use the co2 true clear the sherbert so i figured it'd have a nice cleaner flavor but this stuff here wasn't bad um i haven't tried this one i just made yet of course i didn't bring the battery out um but i used it with a skunk 8 but that skunk cape's got such a strong skunky um smell to it it's hard to for anything else to come through so we'll see if anything comes through on this one but like i said the thca powder worked great in there too it didn't clog that one up that one worked you know it was almost all the way full and you can tell see there's not much left in there i smoked over half of it in a couple days it was so tasty and like i said the battery just quit on me so i don't recommend refilling those the reason i refilled this one and like i said we got it filled with just that little bit i didn't use a lot i'll show you how much i used on that um but this one's got the charging port on the bottom so hopefully we can recharge it when it does die now i only use this was a full gram i did lick a little bit and but pretty much i just used two i pushed it from where it was at the one to maybe just past the eight so maybe three milliliters of this stuff but closer to probably the two because it did fill that pin up and it's only 300 milligrams so like i said it didn't take much of this to fill that vape in and i did dab a little bit in my mouth dabbed a little bit in the banger just to try it the flavor wasn't bad the banger wasn't real clean so i couldn't get a good flavor on it so we'll save that for a review hopefully too well that's going to be it guys if you have any questions just leave them down there in the comments like i said this is an easy way you could also just put the distillate straight into the vape pen without the rosin and just make a bait pin that's what pretty much they're using is distillate but like i said with just a little bit of that rosin it makes it a real good flavor so you don't need a lot of that even you could probably just put maybe two little dabs in there mix it around put one in there see how you like it next time add more if you need to but like i said they tore me up good so i definitely recommend those of you who are feeling your own give this a shot let me know what you think of it that's going to be it guys we do got some more videos coming tomorrow we got a delivery coming and then we'll also do what's new in the florida mmj we got some new things

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "tNKG6YoPU5Q": "the only always good YouTube welcome to another live stream just hanging out taking some dabs tonight and the children really got too much [ __ ] going on waiting on a few parts to come in over the next couple of days so that I can go ahead and finish putting together the irrigation for this veg setup and once that comes in then I'll go ahead and put together the irrigation and get some seeds popped and start to show on the road those of you that saw my Instagram I posted the start of a DIY project to make some mini humidifiers one for each tier in here they're gonna be perfect for you closet growers or if you have a bed rack similar to mine small space you don't want to put a big bulky humidifier in there and like we talked about before there's not a lot of options for just straight power on power off humidifiers that are a small and portable as what I have in mind so anyways we'll get into that later tonight I cleaned up the old sexy gin tree rig I got the broken pieces of the grabbes Labs drop down out of here so all good and this still fits snug in there with no issues even though the you know tiny little bits of the bottom broke off no big deal so got the banger all cleaned up opaque bottom this is the deep dish third email from 710 coils so cake bottom if you guys need a discount code SB and v-love will get you 20 per 12 percent off of $40 or more so before we get fired up tonight though actually gonna go ahead and empty this because like my dad's to taste fresh super fresh so I got a little reclaimed jar here and all I do is take a little heat to it tip it over yeah I don't want to burn it I just want enough heat to facilitate a little bit of flow all it takes once it starts to flow in you can remove the heat just off grip on down it stops flowing you add a little bit more heat and keep the flow going that's it boys ask me how I do that my reclaim or whatever would I do with it this is it looking like dab some of y'all will probably take this reclaim came out very nice very clear it's not ugly and dirty it's more like distillate than reclaim this deep dish really makes it so that you're not sucking down a bunch of nasty reclaim into the neck of the banger you only get like vapor so I'm getting what I'm getting out of this is like [ __ ] almost like true distillate not the black nasty [ __ ] that's left at the body of your banger that people suck up from hitting it too hard and then that's it and then it's nice and ugly looking for a second and voila now this just now seeing you guys popping up in the comics what's going on guys and he switch over to live chat so I'm not getting trolled yeah I'm glad I did not break that [ __ ] I was thinking about oh I've got cuts on his hand okay rinses alcohol off oh Jesus [ __ ] that hurt I just did that inside - ah big well [ __ ] like cut right here like a paper cut from earlier she's five and I ain't gonna switch huh got my ass Kavi slipping right now bueno I don't need it to be alcohol doubt and all that I could if I was being super super picky but now that's good like that and we got a bunch of you claim in here and we'll keep collecting it until it's almost full and then I'll deep carb it and all and people say you don't have to deke our brief claim that's not entirely true we claim is not only a 100 percent d card sometimes you still have to hit it for like 10 or 15 minutes walk around a club which is dumb in your mouth stick map and take your tongue out see if I can't go switch see I wanna [ __ ] tell me what where do you see my where do you see my a girl beat at the max when you see man let's see if he burns himself ladies and gentlemen I usually don't so that means now would be a perfect time for

how was your weekend what did you do what's up Netflix you recommended [ __ ] I don't care about right now this jar shall we get it shall we Wow so I found out this run's changed on me over time so when I'm smoking this about three or four days ago it had a very nice sweet candy taste to it with a slight slight sour taste to it today I hid this [ __ ] not 405 I changed my temp up a little bit it tasted like I just got done eating a whole bag of lunch when I exhaled it blew my [ __ ] mind how much the temperature change and a few days was able to change what happens to the flavor profile [Music] you're already a DAB in oh my god you stop [ __ ] around [Music] [Music] [Music] look at how clean that is [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] the other runs it seemed like they got a little bit more of a intense candy flavor it was more of a just like a sweet taste with a slight candy you know but now it's like just straight bag of candy [Music] [Music] Wego somebody said they were already on their second dad I'll catch up don't worry I always do man what a great year whoa [Music] [Music] good well you guys I guess I'll fill you in on the projects I got going on yeah that's how I am dog I got that but I can't be any heightened ads I like them nice and low temp no I'm saying I can come back and hit it in 30 seconds if I need to yeah dad sneezes getting me to man it just depends on the Turks right all right so this all right we pull up Amazon right quick so the first project is the irrigation in here I got the pump in I showed that last time it's a share flow pump with the filter built in we're not building but there's a pre-filter on it so we're gonna be running this sure flow pump nice and small less than a hundred dollars and it kicks enough psi to run pressure compensating drippers like in my flower room with my big leader pump I could even run that room off of one of these isn't that crazy less than a hundred bucks if that liter pump fails I'm just gonna pick up another one of these and throw it in there it'll do the job so the rest of the connector pieces that I need to put this together are coming tomorrow and it's basically just a bunch of elbows in random fittings did I get into caps I got in caps yeah what I need to get now is more irrigation stuff for the big room so I guess I'll pull out the whiteboard I know I don't need it basically right now on each tray I have one irrigation line that runs down the center of the tray right and at the end of that I have my flush valve slash pressure gauge setup this was at the end of every line right what I'm going to be changing for the flower room now is instead of running the single line down the center of the tray I'm going to run a big u basically or a big circle all the way around the tray right so the line is going to come to the the table or someone drop from the ceiling down to the center of the tray it's going to go to a tee and it's going to basically go out to the sides of the trays elbow run down the length of the tray and it'll have the drippers along the length right for the plants on its respective side and then at the end instead of each line just coming to an end right it'll come back to Center and that's where I'll put this so what all I have to end up doing is I'm going to get across and basically what will happen is with the cross it'll be like this right so at the end of the tre imagine down there is the end of the tre this is the lateral flush valve it's going to be right in the very middle so I think here guys this view you can see this whole thing right imagine this is the end of the tre that's over there this is the end right so it'll sit like this boom right in the middle Wow this pressure gauge and then I'll have this lateral flush valve so that way every time that the system pressurizes it will pressurize all the way around faster more evenly and it just works that better way as a manifold and you have drippers and then i'll still be able to have the function of flushing the entire system out by having this in between and at the the lowest and so everything will flush down here and get fresh newts at the very beginning and it's also air relief so when the system fire is on any air that might have gotten into the system will escape from here too at the end of the line but I have air relief valves in various places in the plumbing in there that is one thing that's going to change that I should definitely show you guys shout out first off Roz rosin ink alright that's the homie Miami mango because I I learned a [ __ ] ton just from following his pages and going through and reading every post reading every comment every [ __ ] response like you have to read the comments you guys are so much gold hidden in the comments woodsheds my dude he does a lot of custom 3d printing stuff for me like my driver coolers science LED of course for my lights glob mob I'm actually wearing their shirt right now more rosin ink and hydro racks that is root riser you guys that is the company that does this vedric anyways nothing with that so here's my system in here all of this is going to stay the same I don't need to do anything in here this is a net afem disk filter that I have pre pump I'm going to throw in an additional filter post pump that'll be probably a leader filter and I'll throw that somewhere in here that way I have that I got this project box and I I just realized when I brought it in here I don't know how all that's gonna fit to be really really real like what I might end up doing is I might end up putting this and this on the outside and then putting everything else inside if I can fit these on there I will but I don't know it's gonna be tight maybe this these two and these two we'll see I might be able to pull it off but it's cool it's got space inside so those will be mounted on the outside and then I still have all this space inside so those will easily be able to fit and I'll be able to fit at least one power strip so we'll get all that taken care of I'm gonna go ahead and clean up some of the plumbing in here I don't really need to do any real design modifications other than I have different style air bleed valves for up there right now you can see I have like the Jane right there the ball ball type air relief valves kind of like the floor flex ones and then I run a hose down here in case they get stuck open it just goes back into the reservoir those suck ass I'm gonna switch those out for the plunger style which I'm gonna have to put into a bushing to fit into that top piece up there so that whole black piece will come out and I'll screw a bushing into the adapter and then I'll put the plunger into the adapter and it's a way better error relief valve I won't have to run hoses back they don't fail I got a reinforced put some more strut up and run all the clean lines and all that once I mount all this troll master [ __ ] in this box I have wire covers that I'm going to put up and shorten all the wires but I got all the [ __ ] new irrigation pretty much ready to go right there and the cubes floors been cleaned everything is pretty much ready to go I'm gonna go ahead and change the orientation of these lights tomorrow so I have like basically three continuous bars running the whole length of the room and those also are going to get their orientation change better spread Schaeffer fans are gonna get moved down about a foot and a half each that way they can put their main airflow underneath the fam instead of above and the canopy it will get all the airflow just you know basic [ __ ] cable maintenance type stuff that I'm gonna get to button up and create you know the control panel and [ __ ] for now and then I'm just waiting on the other four by twelve from American Grill products should be about a week or two now and then I'll go down there and pick that up come back up put it together it takes like 20-30 minutes to put together by myself and then we'll be ready to rock but first the beans are going to be going in here and I'm just waiting probably by Wednesday or Thursday I should have this entire thing done and I'll be able to go ahead and clean and sanitize do some IPM work prep these rooms to make sure that we're not gonna have any issues and then I'll pop beans probably over the weekend I'll germinate and we'll be good to go and then that way the following week I can just pretty much watch him you know do-do-do-do-do-do oh man I gotta catch up to these [ __ ] comments now all the 35 Pablo 31 I'm not a towel you are can of this way holy [ __ ] three grand a month four bills do you think he need all them lights oh yeah I mean all those lights why have the side lights when there's what kind of question is that that's like asking why have a girl suck your dick plan you could have two girls once I can dig in one second your boss oh oh [ __ ] mmm I think I'll take both please the sidelights they give you so much more like direct light to so much more surface area and canopy and it increases your yield significantly with very little wattage it's not hard to get too much light I just agree with you there you can you can you can get too much light real easy especially with LEDs which is why it's so important to measure your par or your ppfd right that's why I got the troll master part of me here which is integrated with those lights so it can automatically dim them down to the specific ppfd that i've said to please that's fun it beefs up the lowers the meds and the uppers and depending on your growing style how much you do foliate how tall you grow your plants etc etc they can really really be beneficial because some of that stuff that you maybe would consider chopping before will actually give you the same size knows is what you're getting up top and really I don't use it to concentrate on the lowers I use it to concentrate on the mid-to hires that way if you're getting in that side light they're not going to stretch as much anyways right and then also you're hitting the majority of the the bulk of the canopy that you want to hit alright than eating the potatoes you don't want to beef up the green beans you want to beef up the meat and potatoes you know I'm saying you know larf just depends on how you how you grow really right and know you don't get too much heat before you get too much light if you're growing with LEDs it's very easy to have light burn before you have heat stress any advice about your little tips during a soil grow so it depends I mean yellow tips could be a bunch of different things top of the plant or bottom of the plan so I'm watching the chat over here I realized we had 45 people in here cheers you guys if you if the tip sir yellow like at the end of the leaf just the end of the leaf if it's a light pale yellow that's usually a sign of a little bit of burn coming on or or it's the whole leaf is like looking pale it could be a deficiency but if your leaf is not like pale then it's most likely that the start of nutrient burn it's at the top of a very young plant then it's most likely a nitrogen deficiency that's starting as your plant is requiring more than it's getting older sounds like you're getting an immobile nutrient deficiency so I would start increasing well what is your ppm or sure EC you know whatever you're measuring it in right [ __ ] it let's do [ __ ] troubleshooting night we should just start doing that because people ask me questions anyways we might as well have a dedicated night or I come on here pour myself a beer have couple dabs and we'll just go through the questions and I'll just ask one person to help me queue up the questions we'll do it through zoom webinar actually you guys can put it in the Q&A boom our third of the Leafs are yellow then that sounds like it's probably I'd have to see a picture let's just put it that way you could post a picture to the chat right now with the Google photos link if you'd like and I can check it out and I could tell you what I think it is it's really hard to diagnose based off of people's innate descriptions so every light in that room is an LED oh [ __ ] warns in here sup Lauren gabs you know what we're gonna take it down because mr. Warren is it two times [ __ ] SB and he giveaway winner lucky month guess where he's got like a [ __ ] Lucky Charms guy shoved up his ass or something oh [ __ ] kill it [Music] [Music] but I forgot what I was about to pull up on my phone oh nothing I'll take down laptop this runs is wrong so strong straight up so oh you guys are talking about topping I am super excited for this next girl one of the first ways that were the first way I grew was from seed and I had the pleasure of learning how to manifold train and oh [ __ ] man I can bonsai [ __ ] out of my plants you want to talk about [ __ ] vegging for a while I used to veg my indoor plants for minimum three months in deep water culture my plants were [ __ ] monsters but I would just veg him in spirals I would top him I would end up with like an eight headed manifold and I would spiral all the heads if you go back on my youtube videos you could see when I used to run HP s with an LED in the center I had two plants that took up a 4x4 and one of them was a c99 that I just spiraled the [ __ ] that [ __ ] was dope but yeah I'm excited to be popping all these beans because beans give you the the word is escaping me the equal growth on both sides right your nodes are gonna be nice why my brain farting on that simple word what's the word sub DC shoes I appreciate the donation my man hashtag DC shoes everybody gabs up for DC and woman on this one oh yeah you guys see how hard I'm ripping those globs and I'm not getting anything down the neck but pure vapor look at that nice ass reclaim / distillate vapor we're getting down there yes it is delicious you renounce your mad dabber crown to me [Music] you know a lot of the times what makes me have to call mid DAP is the fact that my saliva or mucus starts accumulating mid dab due to all the Turks and that post nasal drip just instantly makes me want to like gag and cough [Music] [Music] fool wiggle bigger [Music] clear my turf caves using all that [ __ ] out of there you do it put a Terps I ain't gonna do it do put Turks I ain't gonna do it so when did I start Spanky Pablo for the compliment on the rig I said gingery recycling the taste profile is like sweet candy runs and depending on you know what temp you hear that what your ramp up is on how he eats up all that [ __ ] yeah that's what's in my Amber glass here this is what I always use first is dark crystal I only use a little bit alight so right now to see if I can get a little mark off network the glitter the drip drip yeah I like all my little opals there's opals everywhere and then I haven't even pulled out the bad weather the dabber I use you made this custom to go with it carp cap diverse little nasty dirty right now but man [Music] Thank You loan yeah so I started growing pretty much at the end of 2014 beginning of 2015 I started growing in a 4x4 tent with the 600 watt HPS deep water culture and 110 gallon tote with two beans from I love growing marijuana calm who strain was gold leaf cross of alka poco gold in something else I think but it was [ __ ] huge I got quite a bit I got like 21 ounces or some [ __ ] it was cool we should see some of the the other pictures from that that I didn't post on Instagram some funny [ __ ] yeah I'm [ __ ] high [ __ ] man that [ __ ] me up so here is my first grow it was bad but in that at all I ended up washing some of it too and then pictures of my first wash it's not so great you guys not so great and I think I just washed popcorn Doug's I'm trying to see where's that uh affordable picture the top cola was [ __ ] like I [ __ ] you not I waited I'm just gonna show you cuz you guys wanna [ __ ] believe me that I thought I waited [ __ ] huge man look at that [ __ ] crazy are the roots on them with a [ __ ] dog I was running GH newts back then one plant just completely triumphs the other two [ __ ] bananas I was doing stupid [ __ ] with the [ __ ] look at that monster bugs on that thing what are all the dots on the the pieces of leaf that were trimmed all the way Oh uh-huh yeah I was I was pretty happy with that for the first girl it was a [ __ ] it was a hairy string uh-huh I thought it was partly because of how I grew it but I reached out to I loved growing marijuana and they said I did good there was definitely some things I could have done a lot [ __ ] better holy [ __ ] but man that was fun and I used to pop seeds and put them straight into neoprene collars and into dwc I know there's probably quite a few of you guys that do it but now I just wait until the taproot got long and just slide it straight into neoprene and go straight into help onyx or DWC that [ __ ] was fun ladies through experiment so [ __ ] much like it ridiculous ridiculous how much I used to experiment but I did it because I knew like if I got all my experimenting over at the beginning then I wouldn't have to worry about it later on I would be profitable you know what I'm saying cuz if you don't fail first and you just have nothing but success you're gonna get ahead of yourself and you're gonna trip on your own feet but if you trip on your own feet enough and you figure out all the [ __ ] kinks and you learn how to think ahead on certain things you figure out what works what doesn't work what scales up well and what doesn't right like aeroponics was amazing for me but I learned after experimenting with trying to run a whole room with it it it doesn't scale up well it just does it um you know it just doesn't scale up period there's no other way to put it I'm especially with the way that I was trying to do it and my limited resources it was strictly like reinvest reinvest reinvest reinvest so that I can constantly add more equipment add more plants add more space you know and I [ __ ] you not it just took about it took till about a year ago for me to get to where I was able to have this amount of space to grow and this is like [ __ ] man I'm like a hermit crab in here it's like a shell on my back it's not very big when we move and I grow like and I build a new facility then I'm gonna have like a couple of rooms you know but this is just I did once oil grow yeah hydros where it's at you guys here's what I'll tell you about soil I used some cool RIT sub cool I used his 2017 super soil recipe I cooked it for about two and a half months and then I did a piss-poor half-assed grow under like some [ __ ] tea vibes or something and that I maybe finished it under C mhm I didn't give it a fair shot at all and the results were actually really [ __ ] good given the fact that I didn't even bother to water it that much you know let alone give it teas or amendments or proper light even you know the terpene profile on it was something I grew gorilla glue number four it was something that I had grown numerous times and various hydroponic setups in the rooms under different lights and nutrients and I was very good at growing it and so I ran that and the Turk profile was completely different hold on I got to plug in his GoPro and it's like okay there we go the Turk profile is completely different it was less on the gas side and more on the chocolatey diesel earthy side it had like a chocolate ty type vibe to it and it was [ __ ] delicious and I could still taste you know the the Turk profile that I get from hydro it was still there but it wasn't the dominating terpene profile wasn't the main thing it was just chocolate II earthy a little bit of gassy just but really chocolaty and sweet and it was it was great um the effects for the high I can't say that I noticed anything you know noticeably different but I hadn't had any hydro to do a side-by-side comparison so um I would run soil again but if I were to do soil I would probably be pretty conflicted on whether I went with a potted system or like just doing beds I think for me if I were to do something in the soil I would dedicate just one room to LEDs and soil and it would be beds I would have to do beds and it would be kind of like a living soil otherwise I don't think there's a point you know it doesn't have to be like oh no till bla bla bla bla bla na man like you know working a little bit but it doesn't have to be you know I don't know see that's where I'm like inflict it on f2 because I'm not a soil guy so I'm not gonna be hardcore about one thing or another i'ma look at it from an analytical perspective and be like hmm how can I eliminate some risk here cuz there's a [ __ ] ton of horrible pests that you can have it's hard to fight them with being sterile so that's out of the option anyways if you're running soil there's no point in being sterile right but then again you can run just microbes and like like what's the [ __ ] mosquito microbe killer that I run whatever that is I forgot what it's called but you could run Mike and Vinnies and nematodes and just specific predatory mites and other insects without it being like a complete no-till living soil you know you could just be very precise with the things that you use to minimize your risk of other bad pests but it's just such a gamble man I am look in my room now and it's like I let it sit after-hours for a whole week without cleaning it and I still didn't even get it bugs in there you know what I'm saying because of how I built the room and I don't run dirty ass soil so I run rock wall and I run I ran my last friend sterile because I wanted to give it a fair shot I will never do it again mark my words all my years in all my different ways of growing I have always ran hydroponics with beneficial bacteria and microbes right and I've done it in various ways I've handed it to the reservoir not top that'd only I've done foliar applications I don't wrenches and dunks then all types of [ __ ] right and I was like all right let me try going sterile [ __ ] that I don't care how white your roots are there is a symbiosis that is happened in the evolution of this plant between these beneficial bacteria that exist in the soil where they evolve that and it creates a terpene expression in the plant that is unavailable if you are sterile hands down if you compare a hydro grower whose recipe is exactly the same - the microbes one go sterile and one goes Bennie's you're gonna have different terpene expressions the room everything can be exactly the same it could be the same exact bro you know what I'm saying I could decide not to apply beneficials to half of my plants next grow and the difference would be apparent and the growth the vigor right the health of the roots and just the overall final product the terpene expression would be different right with the potency be different I've never had anything tested for potency I will going forward but before I have it so now that I'm getting ready to pop seeds I'm probably gonna have a [ __ ] ton of testing done you know but we'll see we will see but Vinnie's absolutely absolutely absolutely will never run without them yet this lady here is yeah and [ __ ] snapped out as different environment will give you different chirps yeah but the environment would have to be vastly different to for that to happen you're talking it would have to be probably a delta of a continuous fiber or more Fahrenheit you know you're talking a room that has proper a/c and ventilation versus a room that doesn't yeah you're probably gonna have some different terpene expressions they're absolutely Stoney's [ __ ] right on the money on that different immuno responses from the plan are going to trigger different terpene responses right I like my best results always came from running this super brew that my mentor taught me I have the recipe say it was the latest recipe he ever gave me before I he told me dude you're like smarter than me now you're better than me now you're doing more research than me now you should just go and find somebody else or start teaching somebody and I was like [ __ ] really you're not gonna teach me anymore your tricks and he was like dude just pick a girl and [ __ ] out now you got it I was like all right I haven't talked to him since then other than an occasional hey man how you been but it's been like probably two or three years so let me see what was up [ __ ] was I gonna pull up that run Scottie super booth thank you I looked back at the [ __ ] thing and you had it all right let me pull up my Google Drive it's a venti recipe it uses multiple things alright I'm gonna give you guys the [ __ ] lowdown recipe right now you choose to use this if you want or not here's the [ __ ] deal the recipe is you're gonna need great white gh subculture M G H subculture B aqua shield or hydro guard GH floor blend and a sugar source you can use molasses or a hydro sweetener or turbinado you're going to put all this into a makeshift bioreactor so basically it's gonna be cool between roughly 60 to 68 degrees super bubbled and stirred or through a water pump right but if you use a water pump that's going to heat it up over time therefore you need to be using a chiller or keep it in an environment where it's still going to maintain a cool enough temperature and it needs to be light proof recommended to use RO water but any non-chlorinated source is okay everything is going to be represented in teaspoons per gallon you're gonna use a quarter teaspoon of great white per gallon you're going to use an eighth of a teaspoon each of gh subculture in and be 1/8 each per gallon and eighth of a teaspoon right then you're gonna use anywhere between 10 to 15 MLS per gallon of your hydro garden or your aqua shield all right that's your bacillus okay it's gonna keep the bad beneficials from growing okay depending on how warm your tea mixture is you're gonna want to use more Irish hydro garde right if it's warmer use more it's cooler you don't have to use as much you're gonna use one ml per gallon of flora blend which is a pre blended tea now this was all created back before Monsanto and blah blah blah and GH was taken over and sold and blah blah blah right so if you have issues with GH then find alternatives to what these are just look them up see what they are and then find alternatives all right but for a sugar source you're going to use a half a teaspoon to a teaspoon it depends on the bricks of your sugar source and the temperature of the brew the warmer it is the less sugar you need but the less time you have before your tea expires alright so real quick quarter teaspoon of great white eighth of teaspoon of G H M eighth of a teaspoon of GHB and then 10 to 15 MLS of hydro garden or aqua shield one ml of flora blend and then 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of your sugar source you're going to mix it all together and put it into your bioreactor or whatever you have to brew it let it brew for 24 hours so that it has time to replicate itself into useful proportions aka colonize doing that will make it last much longer and then depending on the temperature and how well you keep it mixed and hair rated it will last anywhere from 6 to 14 days it should always smell natural like the earth maybe a little bit sweet if it starts to smell nasty like something is rotting or foul it's bad scrub the bucket between fresh batches and you'll also want to scrub and clean the air stone for each fresh batch to the bacteria will colonize and form what looks like dark brown or black spots it's not a bad thing it's just colonized beneficial bacteria unless the smell is bad the instructions for use you can apply to all stages of growth including cloning which I used to do I would add some into my cloning mixture and that's all I would add and with maybe a little bit of cal-mag and my clones would have roots within four to five days I [ __ ] you not so you could apply it seedlings clones veg or bloom you add 8 to 10 ounces every 3 to 5 days and with fresh bedding on what you're growing and I guess right if you get too much of a buildup of beneficial bacteria colonies and your reservoir or on your medium you're using too much and or adding it too often and you shouldn't have to scrub your air stone in your plant reservoir until after the grow if you're adding it to like a DWC reservoir you only need to add a small amount if you have to scrub your air stone you're adding too much it shouldn't colonize in your reservoir like that now the way that I would apply that is I would apply that to rock wool via top feed just 3 to 5 ounces per cube at most probably once - twice a week hand-fed that way none of it is in the irrigation system none of it is in the reservoir the reservoir remain sterile running Athena AG Plains or any other hypochlorous acid and/or a citric acid to keep your irrigation lines clean and your mineral deposits from building up so if you run the proper amount of maintenance which would be maybe like three to five MLS per gallon at most of like a hypochlorous or citric acid I would run the hypo versus a citric right you can still run beneficials in your medium and that hypochlorous acid will not be enough to break down and kill those microbes but because in rock Woollett inert medium and you're pretty much feeding until you get runoff every day you need to make sure that you have colonization on the roots at least so you always feed those microbes right at the top of the crown to maybe one to two times per week is really all you need and those microbes will continue to colonize on the roots and even though the medium is being fed and somewhat flushed as long as you're not over watering you shouldn't be pretty much wiping out the beneficials they should still exist in the medium to an extent and recolonize every time that you reapply but they should never be completely wiped out but you keep it out of your irrigation and out of your reservoir your reservoir doesn't get messy or nastiest a sterile stays clean you know and if you want you can even do like a once a week dose of like - peroxide like medical grid right like maybe one ml per gallon two MLS per gallon once a week once every two weeks it'll help knock down any issues that you might have with a build so why is it that stony you're saying that molasses doesn't feed microbes why is that a big misunderstanding [Music] [Music] [Music] this isn't growing 101 what's wrong dad [Music] you don't like the tea lesson [Music] you were talking to a cat well I think it just depends on how much molasses you use and what type of molasses I think it's important to note that you have to use an unsupportable asses if you're just using regular molasses a lot of times it does contain sulfur right there's different types of molasses and there are certain ones that are specific for brewing teas but you can get so like a Blackstrap so for free molasses is what you want and like I said it's a small amount depending on how much you're using right how big the batch is what the temperature is what would you recommend as a better so brown sugar fish and brown sugar so how is how can how can a food source be too strong I'm not being argumentative at all I'm being inquisitive because you're the organics guy I'm a hydro guy my usage with microbes is very limited in comparison to ours so we need to be clear I'm coming at you in a humble inquisitive way please tell me how oh yeah TAC wavy [Music] [Music] window shopper I got a flash it out of here on me and sulfur I'm just yeah I'm just curious so oh you just heard it then go to molasses and goddammit you was just talking out your ass then [ __ ] outta here with that oh no I'm just repeating somebody told me funny that's funny [ __ ] say dad I'm [ __ ] bidding two times it's only ten [Music] [Music] oh I'm sorry I'm high three [ __ ] high [Music] dude nobody's holidays so you're you're new to the channel I think so stone you like this channel is all about breaking stoner myths and forum [ __ ] right like obviously there's great lessons that have been learned from anecdotal evidence and experience passed down and experienced through multiple growers right but at the same time there's something to be said for verifying that via science and and developing an understanding for it right so that's basically my channel is about breaking through the [ __ ] and finding out the whys how comes what Fuller's all the [ __ ] right and figuring out if there's any scientific actual you know evidence behind it and then you know that way I can research it I can understand it and once I have a firm understanding of it then I feel confident and speaking about it but until then I never speak out of lane you know I always become things that I feel like I've studied from a scientific peer review like scholarly sources me verified study do you know but there's a lot of stuff in cannabis that hasn't had no scholarly peer reviewed you know research studies on and there's not journal articles on a lot of that stuff is only available outside of the US because there's censorship in the US and you can't reach it because it's you know it's blocked off right you have to look to the Netherlands and a lot of places over these that are doing research israel [ __ ] like that nobody saying you're talking out of your ass don't you know don't take it the wrong way let me finish what I'm saying let me finish what I'm saying so what I'm saying is we welcome an open conversation here we welcome multiple points of views we welcome the debate right like I tell people not every disagreement has to be an argument right you can agree to disagree but you can still have an open discourse about it and try to seek some type of understanding or if if all else fails even if you agree to disagree maybe you walk away with something to chew on and then later you experience something that connects the dots for what that person was telling you and then you're able to understand it in a way that makes sense and then you're able to use it to your benefit right so everybody here is very open-minded we're not argumentative we're super chill and low-key positive vibes only we welcome the conversation so don't feel defensive or like nobody's coming at you because that's totally not it everybody here just wants to learn everybody here is eager learn the facts and learn [ __ ] that's gonna hold true not [ __ ] you know what I'm saying we want to be able to verify it that's all so don't feel like nobody's coming at you dog it's not like that this isn't that Channel you want to through some nugs all right you guys are asking me about what the dry and the cure you guys realize the dry and and cures done already right completely done yeah man it's it's hard to pick up the vibes sometimes when people come in here it's all gonna do it what's up magic have ad for micro crocked what do you mean micro crops you mean like having like perpetual like multiple harvest in the room or I'm an owner in the [ __ ] all the time you guys other [ __ ] everyday when somebody comes in here and tells me something I don't know and I'm so happy to learn it I'm so grateful to that person because I do so much research it's like sometimes I feel like I know a lot but then when I speak to other people that grow from you know other areas right not even different methods just other areas and learn about the challenges they face I realized damn there's a lot of different perspectives for their [ __ ] that changes just depending on where you are you know I'm saying indoor-outdoor [ __ ] hydro lor soil it gets even deeper than that right the no-till [ __ ] guys versus the regular soil guys and still put bottles loose in there's so many different avenues man it all depends on what lens you're looking through that's all that matters right I just try and absorb [ __ ] information from every angle I can and bottle that [ __ ] up in my own way and then just use it whatever way I see fit that's that's honestly if you can learn from everybody I see too many people snub their noses up at one way of growing or they'll [ __ ] it and look down on somebody because they have a smaller grow or they grow in a tent man if you can't learn something from everybody then you're a dumbass I'll say that again if you can't learn one thing from everybody then you're a dumbass so if you don't listen to what other people have to say then like here it's shutting off your own sources of information it's stupid people gotta learn how to be more open everybody so [ __ ] defensive in this day and age everybody so quick to be like you're attacking me or oh you're gonna get offended or oh I'm offended it's like and y'all got a desensitize and [ __ ] sinning yourself [Music] but you guys wanted to see what's up with the hardest so let me change my battery real quick I got a fresh one right here what's my person 12% should be enough hell yeah but anyone can [ __ ] it up so that's right so my garage is a little messy right now because of the harvest I got to call it dumpster to come so I could throw away everything so check it I did it dry for about seven days and then took it all down and cut it straight into here so that's some runt that's some run this is from the TfL lighting side the GoPro doesn't okis well but this is 507 we got a bunch in here and then I think all the raging oh this is a raging push side you can see the frost on the bottom of the bag of the ragin cush it's just visibly there more right there you can see all of that [ __ ] look at that that ragin cush puts out some [ __ ] trikes man there any on these [ __ ] TfL a little bit but not as much I'm telling you man the blue spectrum in the rating cush holy [ __ ] it just puts out these [ __ ] trikes I think I need a bigger box it's coming on the 27th until then it's Tetris baby before I start this next girl I swear to god I'm gonna finish the outside of this wall that's okay it's so [ __ ] early one in all the vapors all right okay I'll show you guys the room it's still on reset mode I'm not done yet I already come in here I did I did way earlier I'm excited to run these these are new this grow these are the six by six by four Jumbo's these are their new ones to extended to cases summer run those and these are new drippers last time I ran to gowing per hour because mango tech said those would be the best because they don't fog that's what he runs but they get water channeling so I'm around those oh my god my battery is dying so fast as I stand here and talk hold on maybe all right if it dies I'll be right back all right battery's out a hundred percent what Dad Matt which one oh yeah another piece of the puzzle came today for the bed you set up told you guys the condensate pump would come if you guys want to know what is the best condensate pump in the game the best bang for your buck it will pump probably as high as any home grower needs to go this is it [Music] diversity CP 22 okay this thing is awesome got an alarm indicator it shows running indicator it has an auto shutoff if you want to hook it up to a condensate if this thing fails it'll automatically shut off your AC so that it doesn't flood or your D hue so it doesn't flood it has a built-in fan so that doesn't overheat if it runs constantly it has like a 20 foot head I think which means you can lift it cuny 20 feet up in the air main rain or main only alright so we're gonna have another lesson I see this is the moneymaker right here they're gonna be probably underneath if I feel sick underneath I can always slide the tent up a little bit by moving the casters but it'll fit under the tray oh my god [ __ ] quarter inch away that's okay I could fit it on the side of the town and secure it right here but either way I'll get that set up underneath there now to pump out the old nutrients so all right here's the thing with the Jumbos there's it's not always bigger roots of bigger fruits so crop steering you guys that are familiar with crop steering good if you aren't familiar with it basically all it is is the way that your environment is climate steering you can't cross steering without you can't crop steer without climate steering your environment dictates the demands on your plant and in the way that you feed and water your plant will help tell the plant what type of growth it should do there's vegetative growth and there's general growth generative growth is basically flowering or producing flowers and buds and mass right you can encourage either type of growth based on a your environment that puts the demands on the plant and then be your irrigation usually you want to lower ec smaller volume of feedings more frequently and then when you go into generative growth you want to have higher volume of feedings right so you're going to be feeding a higher shot size basically a bigger shot size you're gonna do it the same frequency almost a lot of people have the misunderstanding here's a golden Nucky this is like the biggest golden nugget I could give you about crop steering when you switch to flowering a lot of people think that you want to go from feeding frequently to infrequently so you would like cut out some feedings it's absolutely not the case you still want to see the exact same frequency because the plants only going to want to more so if anything you're going to add additional feedings right but you're going to stop feeding sooner right the same veg you feed up until the last hour right and then you turn off the lights I mean you turn off your feeding and the lights go off an hour later right that's bench in flower you're gonna want to turn off your irrigation like three to four hours and before your lights go off so that they have a larger dry back overnight right in between irrigation cycles I won't give you the magic numbers but you're only looking for a small dry back overnight you're looking for a larger dry back and flower that's what's going to tell the plant hey you need to be more like a generative growth and you're gonna give it larger volume feedings you know every feeding so it's gonna be like boom I'm gonna grow I'm gonna grow I'm gonna get water only at these feeding so I'm gonna take it in and I'm gonna grow you know that is that is crop steering so when it goes to these cubes they're going to allow for faster dry backs right which basically the plant is gonna it's gonna suck up more it's gonna consume more there's gonna be a constant spike in that EC going up and down as these irrigation events happen and the dry backs occur in between shots so that's going to encourage more of a generative growth and I'm actually probably going to cut down my veg time or by about a week to two weeks and the yield will still stay the same as so long as I still run the right plant count and the right lights you know this next round I'll be running from seed seeds are automatically more vigorous plus I'll be doing an undiluted herb natural soak and then prior to popping them so they're gonna be even more vigorous because of all the special [ __ ] herb natural right usually on average they say seed versus clone if you start a clone versus a seed you imagine the same amount of time and flour in the seed is going to be more vigorous in yield 15 to 20% more in the clone I've never verified that because I've never done a side-by-side but I can say for damn sure I believe it I'm grown clones versus seeds multiple times and seeds are way more vigorous their growth is funky and the word is still escaping me am i that spelling when things are equal side by side I'm a watching chat I don't know why I'm [ __ ] forgetting that my hair got long I have to adjust my hat oh [ __ ] ah anyways I've dropped enough golden nuggets for the night I'm stoned his [ __ ] my fear is done and I want another one so I'm gonna call it a night and I'll catch you guys on the next year", "8yWpvcl5SUY": "welcome to community canvas reviews today i'm going to be reviewing a white label live resin cartridge um i had a bezel i think it was or bevel one of the two um bezel there we go i had a bezel distillate cartridge in and i just kind of got bored of it honestly because the terps are not very strong part of it being um they're not cannabis derived terpenes so live resin should spice that up um the live resin that i got is actually less terpy than the uh or it has less terpenes total we'll see what it tastes like anyways but less total terpenes than um uh cured resin surprisingly but either way we'll try it out it's wedding cake which is an indica this is cultivated by green queen farms and it comes in at 84.05 total cannabinoids um and 5.39 total terpenes um yeah so i'll read the terpenes and show you what it looks like but first let me flip the camera around for you [Music] uh [Music] all right let's try this out step one take off the sticker all right um first that's the thing about some good live reds and this um just some i don't know yeah some just good live resin cartridges i can smell that one no leakage whatsoever perfect seal that just smells nicely very sweet and almost like perfumey that's some interesting elements there so it's got a pretty basic um oh yeah that's it's got painting in there a bit smells kind of piney slash perfumey mostly but the leading terpenes and are the basic um are pretty standard beta cardio filling at two point zero four two percent uh limiting at one point five percent humiliate at zero point six percent um beta mir seen at 0.5 alpha pinene at 0.18 cedrine at 1.7 or 0.17 um alpha vista bologna at zero one point zero point one six and finch all at 0.127 so they always have a very detailed um terp list right there but usually a lot of the ones at the end are in pretty low amounts i don't think i can ever really taste them that already smells like it's gonna be way better than the other one was so um got two uh little silicone caps and the branding on this is c cell c240 620 but yeah proper c cell so that's always good um so first thing it's very very clear and light that happens with some white label um i think part of them being just like they they get stuff from different cultivators a whole lot just depends on who cultivated it what the starting material was like i think and white label actually as far as i know white label means like whenever there's um a producer doing white label extracts it means that they're doing extracts for other growers stuff instead of their own stuff so i think they've just made a name of that and that's just like their process but that's usually what that means so um i answered on reddit recently somebody posted a live resin cartridge by white label that was also very clear and wondering if it was real and also they had someone tell them that it was delta eight but they also said it looks like it has delta eight terpenes in it which if you know much about cannabinoids that's not even how that works so um but they came on reddit to verify it and i posted some cured resin and live resin that looked similar and that's just how white label is sometimes i don't know if it's crc i know they seriously well i don't know that but i'm pretty sure they crc some of their dabs so maybe they do their cards as well um i've never had a card that was remotely bad they always put out really good stuff and it's priced a little higher than some of the other stuff i get so i don't get it as often but part of that is it's higher quality too so i don't think they do it badly so all right so here's wedding cake yeah that smells it's just like a general sweet smell it's um i feel like there's like a very even smell of like the pinene and it's like limonene and something else that i don't know which i actually want to say is one of these terpenes in a lower amount and i definitely smell pining at 0.184 so i think i'm smelling one of these other ones either alpha cedric and alpha visceral or pinchol um i'm pretty sure finch all taste i've had finching which i assume is pretty similar just in this last buddies card i had and that was very like like so i don't think it's that probably i've had uh visible alone i think that's pretty sweet and i don't know about cedrine let's see about taste and smell okay upon hitting it you just get a very a much more pronounced and very standard like weed taste um i say that like it means a lot um a very just like nice balance between uh earthy and herbal and like um vaguely like musky taste to it uh not really musky someone says like the other two though um yeah it just tastes like weed usually does for most streams and don't stand out anyways uh that's how i remember wedding cake to be too i've had wedding cake from a couple different producers never a live resin so that's kind of cool but i've had select elites and that's just distillate with their terpenes and tasted pretty similar yeah so um it's not a a real standout strain to me um things like that are like mandarin cookies and like or tropicana cookies was a really good one or blueberry muffin um things like that usually stand out more to me than like wedding cake where sometimes you have strains that really do taste a little bit like what they're named and then you have stuff like wedding cake where i feel like there's maybe more behind the name or they just thought oh that's a good name for it or something like that um sounds pristine or primo or something like that very good very good but doesn't taste quite like wedding cake and the terpenes don't really stand out to me yeah those terps linger very nicely um very present unlike the non-cannabis drive terpenes that were in the last one that's why i switched it out though um i'll have the other one as a reserve in case i run out or can't get any more or something but wow this is nice and the effect on it very nice and full body too um a really good live rise and that's a good thing about the stream too is it um it's just well-rounded very well-rounded so sometimes something being well-rounded enough can make me be interested in it a little more if it doesn't stand out because sometimes that's what i'm looking for like right now for example and the perks of having a proper c cell at that vapor production all right so that's hitting pretty nice i'm getting some aftertaste again but i think it's some of those terpenes or maybe just all the mixing together but it's nothing really strong it's just so so much of like so little it's hard to describe but mostly just like um i'm getting some herbal tastes and some earthy taste like i said and i'm also getting like a weird i almost want to describe it as like how talcum powder smells that's a weird freaking thing but like it's like a very like reminds me of like a rocky taste or something i haven't tasted rocks so i don't know but that's what i imagine rocks to taste like i don't know if that's uh it's not a bad thing too it's very interesting i have to wonder what um alpha cedrine is like the effect is very nice and terps are just they stand out very nicely as they should with some live resin so yeah i think i'm starting to repeat myself a bit so i'm going to close it out here with some smoke rings at least one of those was a ring i'm pretty sure alright thanks for watching uh like and subscribe if you want and stay tuned and um yeah i'm a lot more interested in the cured resin this one's kind of a placeholder but the in the cured resin is a josh d strain which i've done a little bit of reading about because my name is josh as well so i thought that was interesting enough and he has some pretty good uh good-looking stuff and it's a josh d strain extracted by white label and it has more terpenes more cannabinoids more thc cbd um all of it really just seems like a better cartridge honestly it was cheaper i probably should have just got two cured resin cartridges um but yeah stay tuned for that one that'll come around in the next day or two so thanks for watching like and subscribe and stay tuned for more", "KVFRkBbZ9-E": "everybody how you doing I stopped at the healing center today and picked up some grass roots they got a big drop across roots today and I'm rehydrating a bunch of it now so Cinderella I've got half an ounce of that rehydrating but I've got some East Coast Sour Diesel that's ready to press so please join me as we come over here and show you what we're working with

medicine so go to the healing center they are keeping everybody at social distance away from each other it's nice and safe but there this morning everybody was nice and orderly it worked out really well just so happened that that drop can get I was the second one in the door today at the Union Center Monroeville so that was pretty cool [Music] these videos today medicine so we pressed into our slug yeah it is cut off the excess and we already have our paper set up you know set this here move the camera in so we get you good view get ready to happen get this sit up here so you get a good view press there we go right there take take our slug and into our press and this paper out of the way as best as possible so you can see what's going on it's more white on the subject here we go you can see what's going on a lot better let's get this centered up Oh the shot closer a little more height on here all right there we go I should look just great [Music] let's make some medicine shall we [Music] they need the pressure hope everybody's fighting themselves enough medication to get through this crisis and please be careful when you shop if you were if you did resort to the black market I just need to warn you a lot of people out there our sum of hot have as Street and it ain't real just let you know so that you don't get burned there are some bad people out there who do not care but you are what your needs are trust me dealt with a lot of with this cannabis space in recent times [Music] okay and should not change clearly long for the start [Music] it's like that here just enough [Music] [Music] I suppose good as this views gonna get more pressure here and it's gonna start extracting real quick [Music] and you can see it in there it's already starting in a little closer [Music] you see it there it is look at that a beautiful a beautiful medicine right there more pressure look at that material move it just wants to come out of that plant [Music] just wants to come out once to medication make your life better I love this plant enough everything that it was to do with this planet but especially precedent that's okay we are approaching the quarterbacks pressure still know the material [Music] get a blowout have an issue here always err on the side of quality over quantity you're not interested in the quality [Music] really not trying to make medicine [Music] almost done good on pressure give us a little bit more time when I stopped seeing any movement see what we got spreading out quite nicely across the face in the plates cuz you're still and rate where it means to me [Music] I think we are about ready look [Music] look at that that beautiful hmm it's like you've got some sand off of this one crystallization all right [Music] right on here let's get the camera we focused what's going on okay so let's see it all right here we go [Music] look at that perfect no contamination of the raw it's exactly what you want to see the smell coming off this is incredible that color got crystals sand [Music] we're just a channel list of a cool now we're gonna gather it up where my trust tool here here we go [Music] look at how nice this is coming up notice the color if you're dealing with hemp you're dealing with hot hemp street that you think as weed doesn't come out looking like this smelling this good you got you got some funk we prefer and I know that with the prices the way they are and I know a lot of people going to the street I'm telling you don't get painted okay be careful I would still recommend going to the dispensary if you want to get results like this on a regular basis the camera here move it around I'll get you focus on there [Music] look at that so let's find out what our yield is showing it's a support let's get you over here get this free centered up right there okay that would be let's find out what our yield is it seems like if I my superiors thought I had put them right here on the table but you know every good so can you see the hello let's get it in here a little bit easier for me to see no I want everybody see what we got here to get this [Music] all right down here", "lbxe9wjChMA": "welcome back to the canvas packaging show episode 3 in this 12 part series also known as a saga we're talking about concentrates today quick reminder to subscribe to the channel we're going to be doing a lot of eco-friendly packaging in 2019 we're going to show you guys through the canvas packaging so so please subscribe and without further adieu unless Danis I need to add let's get right into the cannabis excuse me concentrate packaging Kalia has an announcement to make sure they've all going to show us the products first and then this was created by Heather the Saudi a favorite thing I've done for the concentrates in the entire you know for the last year Wego she calls her own packaging Fuego Johnson a good sky by the way shot up the sky shot at the skies Str jar it fits through the card Co dry it can hang it's very cost-effective it shone like the spot UV if you can can you see that on there this thing's getting a lot of compliments all right next up show it like unwrapping it on the actual show you don't have to unwrap that actually it's just it's just the bow just about yeah holding backs to put your jar in all your warnings on there it's a Massachusetts product all right keep this moving League that's the same concept just another is a flap here that you can put some branding on or a message of some sort I love that idea of how do you put a message in there that tells the story so it's like just that person holds your package and you can hit them with some kind of call to action whether it's going to your Instagram or you want to show them your tagline of what you're about so how do you tell your story through packaging is something to really think about not just a box it's a way to tell your story and it's a proven fact that I'm doing the unboxing process we talked about that a lot when you have more flaps you have more openings it's more exciting and it leads to a much lower case of buyer's remorse certainly just from having a fun experience in opening the box opening the package it's like you're opening a gift it's a true unboxing process we do a lot of the stuff in our ecommerce division and it's all about unboxing opening it up and really being pleased with what you see on the inside and half of the fun is you see on YouTube all over the place unboxing experience half of the fun is the unboxing process repeat customers that's what's gonna have people come to you again as a repeat customer versus as more dispensaries pop up down the street why would I go to you know location a versus B it's because I have that experience through their packaging and it resonates for sure alright we interrupt this program Talia please show your Christmas cookies to everyone a lot o you're interested in buying cookies for Scalia please so let's go to the chatter envelopes upgraded this has an insert in it two items from our fashion side of our business that we think could be adaptable this would be like super high but I was thinking this for shatter Irving this for a concentrate but that for shattering there's a hinge box with raw materials has an inlay and this is a flock interior which is like a by the sweater this obviously has a bracelet insert inside okay inside this box is a wood lacquer hinge box which again this was for a ring but we can make an insert for your jars really nice pause would I don't know if it shows up on camera but a gorgeous gorgeous almost like a mirror finish polished would non contempo sample don't have to be a different size but just I really like the opening and the magnetic closure and the material to the materials are a huge thing that plain to the brand overall so it's not just the design on the box with the material selection and I see a lot of people in the industry just choosing standard 18 point board with four color process for color print and the textures are great way to tell the story of what you're about where you premium will then use a premium texture are you eco-friendly are you natural then use a natural craft field so keep materials in mind this is a similar example it has a magnet in it this is the box for makeup it has a mirror inside but it has that nice snap closure type of box that you will not throw out like Dan was talking about knowing the experience and knowing what her customers going to do after he makes the purchase or she makes the purchase sometimes you want to just have a package that's going to contain and after you've thrown away other times if you really want to make it whether it's giftable or you just want to add to the experience you've designed packaging that's not going to be thrown away that's going to be kept with the life cycle of the product or even after that so an item like that with a mirror on it could be put on the desk has your brand on it forever and again the customer connects with it you know for years and years and years to come I see that was like a five milliliter concentrate jar would look really nice than that that that concept okay what do you anyone say about this all right so this is just sort of a aspirational or concept that we haven't really tested but we're thinking a concept issue to have shatter inside of there I want to see if you guys think that would be viable this is the concept that we did for the fashion industry we had a floating ring box and I think a lot of people like to see shatter they like to see how clear it is right how transparent it is I'm thinking that could be a really really cool option to display these Nick what do you think that was actually your idea about the your set you're telling me about like the transparent nature like to see you know the purity of it how transparent is honestly I think that's a great idea I think that would be really unique and different okay I guess this episode is over because our helpers just run out the door and she's back alright anyone have anything else to add in the concentrates you guys things you're seeing in the market that would be worth sharing with the audience or do we kind of hit everything and everything about the boxes we have a customer that were conceptualising packaging for now that wants to make sure that whoever is using her packaging moving forward can fit it in their pocket or if you're using it for a pre-roll or concentrate that they can take one of the tubular ones and actually turn it into carry your joint to a concert or going somewhere else where they are just having it a nice box to fits easily in their pocket like chapstick with so I think that that's really important for people to try and not keep in mind too when they're designing their packaging is the smaller the better and you know people can use it more than once that's really going to be the best-case scenario mm-hmm oh great I think especially with the primary packaging so like I think a lot of this stuff people could have a box they're gonna keep that primary package on then like fit it in their pocket I think that you hear that a lot that's definitely a common thing what is it going to be like for the person who's carrying the product how do you have that seamlessly integrated to their lives the cookie was great and a little rude eating on camera I could see someone writing the comments this guy's eating on camera but I'm sorry to you whoever's gonna call me out on that", "OtFh3Bz-TQs": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with token to him 420 this is a medical marijuana review for those over the age of 18 you're not 18 go away all right guys like say hi welcome back if you haven't subscribed hit that button leave me a thumbs up thumbs down let me know what you're feeling what you're smoking on I got a little Tillamook strawberry here about three o'clock is my first joint of the day guys know I've been feeling good I don't wait that long for a wake-and-bake easily mmm but I am feeling a little better thanks for all the prayers and the good wishes guys somebody pulled me through I was feeling like crap I did that video and since then I've been feeling progressively better every day so alright just knock this review out real quick I got an order to pick up a true leave and I'm returning this one alright so we got the Blue River Rosslyn cart we got the puck yeah first I want to show us a few things it's not moving that line there's where it was already laying there but we can't believe it you guys can see it's upside down it won't stand up by itself but we'll put it back in this bottle for a second take a couple more puffs for starters when you look online on this on true leaves website it says that this stuff is gonna range between 75 to 85% where is it that mine come out to 41 so I'm half of what they said when you can the reason I was showing you the oil there the if you read on their site and keep reading down it doesn't necessarily say this oil is thin but when you read the description for the battery it says the battery is made for thinner oils so which leads me to believe is this stuff is supposed to be thin I've seen a couple other reviews and theirs was a little thinner see if all that talking it's just barely moved a little bit he's got a little bit more down there from that trickle there so mine was a lot thicker than I think it should have been for starters that might need a little bit of a problem I didn't find I could get a good hit off of this even maybe because it was thicker I'm not sure on that one and my battery's dying of course it is but you I hardly got any smoke I've got it raised up 23.8 when you look at their battery their battery goes from two six two three six so I never went over that it didn't have a burnt taste the taste wasn't bad but this is 60 bucks for a half gram at 40% no way I literally got a better both smoking the joints than I did on that to be honest and you guys know the cartridges should hit take you to the moon real quick I found it to be lacking like I said the flavor wasn't bad if the THC was a little higher it still wouldn't be too bad but still a little pricey but I would recommend these for anybody who doesn't want any kind of leftover residue I mean I know you're not gonna get a lot of leftover residue and there shouldn't be any in there to start with but those who really don't want to take any chance there's this is Sullivan free there's no chemicals used in making this there's no ethanol it's just rosin pressed and then when they're making their THC a there's another by-product it were paying top dollar for bit that way there's no terpenes reintroduced back into it or know that stuff so it's all real so like I said if you don't want any kind of residual ethanol or anything like that this would be a good product for that I know some people that had like mouth cancer or something like that was real skeptical and using anything with any kind of ethanol or anything like that in it so this might be for you I feel I got a bad batch more than likely like I said everybody else's carts seem to be real thin and they moved real quick mine was a lot thicker other than it not hitting good and the effects not being good yes that's what you want something that hits good the effects are good but so for me this one was a big puck no and some of you are gonna go we'll Tim you don't even smoke carts your flower guy when I got my card there was no flower so I've tried all the carts are out there so I do have some knowledge on carts just like a lot of the rest of us out there that have been in a game for a little longer like I said we first got our cards you couldn't get flour you couldn't get shot or crumble know that all as you get was bait carts tinctures in patches I think at the beginning so like I said I've smoked a bunch of cards this one really like I said that 41% I got a better bus smoking a joint that I did take him to four or five hits off of that and four or five hits off of one of these should do you a lot better than a joint ever does so like I said that one for me was a big buck no the reason I'm doing a review real quick if I can return this I got a flower order to pick up a true leave I'm gonna take this bad boy back so I hope everybody's doing good out there if you guys tried one was yours thick like I said everybody else's I seen looked pretty thin like I said the flavors not bad on it I don't know if it's exactly like the rosin because I haven't had puck in the rosin yet indica rosin is a bit hard to come by around here so I've had a lot more of the hybrids and I have the indicas but it has about that taste to it I wouldn't say exactly because I haven't had that one so that's going to be it guys make sure you subscribe like share tell your friends tell

here at ozviz um very excited to join you for the investor conference um today uh before i introduce you to our next guest who is gary foster from pearl global let me tell you a little bit about the company to give you some background now pearl global is a revolutionary tyre processing company it applies its next generation technology to cleanly convert tires into valuable secondary products including in the waste to energy opportunities which is as we all know increasingly important now perl's technology is a significant advancement on other methods of processing waste tyres mostly because it's low emissions it doesn't produce any hazardous by-products and requires no chemical intervention it does hold australia's first environmental approval for the thermal treatment of rubber and is in commercial production at its facility in southeast queensland but i won't tell you anymore i'll leave that all in the hands of gary foster the co-founder and executive chairman don't forget you can ask questions at any time you can go to the q a button down the bottom of your screen and ask questions of gary but take it away gary thanks very much thanks for organizing and thanks uh everyone for your time just give you a little bit of background obviously um and thanks for the introduction so pearl uh has been operating um at our stapleton facility here in queensland for over two years um so we have built up quite a considerable amount of data i suppose on our emissions and our outputs and we're in a process of continually improving um on all aspects of our of our business as mentioned we are the uh the first company to be licensed to thermally treat tyres and the only entity that we know of is that's commercially operating what's encouraging over the last sort of three to four months is that we have found domestic markets for our products and the products that we're producing are a tie-drived fuel oil so it's a liquid product um the recovered carbon black steel and clean gases um and as touched in the in the opening those clean gases is something that we're working on currently to convert those gases through a turbine system to create our own energy so quite a quite an exciting development that's been supported with the queensland government who provided a grant for that process so i suppose we're a company that's evolving from uh confirming our technology works and that that's taken obviously a number of years of independent testing um to get to where we are now we're converting ourselves into a full commercial operation uh we're still growing uh the site here at stapleton which at the moment we're probably about halfway through but we certainly have in the next six to nine months more machines coming on we've moved into another process which is related to tyres which is crumbing now that crumbing is separate to our thermal desorption process but again the reason why we've gone into the rubber crumbing is that it's come out of demand from our asphalt customers who use um around about 80 000 tons nationally um for use within uh bitumen um itself so we're well we're well supported by strategic investor rock partners who hold around about 22 22 and a half percent interest in the company every time that we've looked to expand as young companies do need to raise a certain amount of funds rock partners have continued to invest alongside we also have energy super fund which is a queen land queensland based fund [Music] who are a supporter as well so just in this slide here probably what we're reflecting is just quarterly production growth so um we've processed over a million times at this site currently we intend to have a fairly strong increase over the next six to nine months uh we do have a an internal target if you like of um reaching cash flow positive um this year so what we're doing at the moment is we're tying up i suppose and we announced uh three or four days ago that um we have a five-year agreement with uh oztek or aussie asheville production um for the supplier of our fuels so what the ashford industry is looking to do and and there's a lot of eyes on us currently and and the success of this particular program with the ashford industry is they're using the fuel as an alternative to diesel so this is used in their burners and basically the burners are heating the asphalt where our recovered carbon black is going into the asphalt mix itself and creating a better asphalt we've had some serious success in this area we've recently had some media releases in relation to moreton bay who have laid roads using this asphalt who have very strong positive outcomes in fact there's there's 10 benefits that our carbon um is able to increase the characteristics of the asphalt um so it's it's been some very strong results next slide i won't go into this too much we obviously know there's a fairly large issue with tyres um we're very happy to be in this space um as one of the cleaning conversion of our tires into alternative products but also finding domestic markets for that what's important to us also um is obviously the social outcomes so you know we are reducing stockpiling um there is uh independent uh experts reports that we have had in relation to our process um having a carbon reduction of around about 500 kilos of co2 for every ton of tires recycled but also you know we think that the story itself is quite strong both from a economic perspective and a social and community perspective so the business model itself is we receive income from thai collection so people drop off if we pick up from bob j and team arts or we deal with the mines up in the barn basin we take away mining tyres we get paid a fee for removing those tyres or receiving those tyres at our depot we then shred those tyres into small smaller about the size of your iphone um and we put them through our thermal desorption units and what happens in that thermal absorption unit is there is a breakdown so the fuel that's made up of the tyre comes off as a gas and we capture that gas and we cool the gas and when we cool the gas we create our fuel what's left over at the back end of the of the unit if you like what comes out is carbon and steel together and we basically just have a normal separation system and we separate the carbon from the steel so we have our three products and obviously the fourth product is is the gas which i spoke about before which we're looking to convert into our own energy source means that we're not relying on the electricity grid so what we're doing at the moment in our business is all the level one products that you see there today the level two products have all been developed we've had a strong relationship over the last three years with the university of western australia who's assisted us in developing our products our secondary products so as an example our raw fuels we've been able to separate that through a distillation unit if you like not a very very small refinery um and we've been able to fraction off what we need out of it so 30 of our fuel because of the way that we process um is actually solvents we've taken those solvents and we've created a degreaser and we've put that decreasing into the market um from a test test perspective so all the secondary products you see on this page is all future business the reason why we're doing those secondary products is because we get a significant uplift in value for each of those products so as an example if we sell our fuel today 60 cents a liter if we were to refine make a degreaser we could be talking two dollars per liter so there's quite a significant upside on those level two products again just on our process pretty simple when that we collect our raw material we receive an income for that we process the tyres and then obviously we sell the commodities the fuel the carbon and the steel so just in relation to to our process you'll see here our operations in stapleton the units are quite small they sit in a 40-foot container they are portable so you could do campaigns with them although we don't really need to do that we've got a massive amount of tyres currently where we are and if we were to expand into another area we would actually secure the feedstock for the for the um processing prior to committing to that particular site so we do have a number of opportunities that have been presented to us and it's also through the queensland government where they'd like us to sort of move up the coast sort of bowen basin area townsville where there is quite obviously a lot of industrial area and an issue with tyres attached on before our partners so rock obviously very supportive capricorn are an interesting strategic investor so capricorn uh have 18 000 automotive members um quite a large cooperative um the reason why they invested in us and quite interested in us is obviously for what i spoke about before in relation to the solvents being converted to degreasers um and then being able to distribute out those decreases to the 18 000 members as a you know a recycled product if you like um so it serves a number of benefits the other partnership we have is with aussie road services and we do have a five year off take agreement we're continuing to work and develop our products with aussie road services so it's a very close relationship as i mentioned we are getting a lot of interest and we do have a pretty strong sales pipeline in relation to the larger entities so you know we have engaged with downer ebi uh borrel fulton hogan a number of those entities hansen's is another one because they've sort of been the larger groups as we know in business that are usually not frontier type groups um they sort of sit back wait see if it works and then sort of move forward forward from there so the fact that we're now getting interest from those those particular entities is a strong sign that what we're doing um is having quite an impact in that particular sector i mentioned before obviously about our ongoing investment into product development so we've created the fuels fuel oils into solvents electrical energy i spoke about and obviously upgrading our carbon um and all of these will be done um you know at the right time of of our business cycle as mentioned had a great success in the asheville and bitumen uh one of the agreements that we do have in place that um we'll be obviously updating the market on although it already has been announced and is in relation to our crumb rubber as i mentioned crumb rub is a very simple process and tyres come in and it's basically a cheese grater over the top of the tyre and you get shredded rubber and there's a number of applications for that one of those applications is in bitumen itself and there is a difference between asphalt and bitumen very briefly bitumen is the is the wet wet soggy glue if you like that that holds the asphalt blend together or the recipe together so asphalt dry bitumen wet and those two come together so we do have an agreement with the grid called bituminous products for 1500 tons um so that that to us is quite a lucrative um opportunity and another stream of income but within our sector in doing what we do i mentioned that we recently laid the xero product the z road product is basically the way that aussie wrote services and marketing um our fuel and carbon um and really interestingly it's got great traction um we are using 10 tyres per tonne of asphalt that's produced by utilizing the the product so what we're starting to do especially from a campaign perspective into the retail and industrial sector is market you know market ourselves in that we're taking queenslanders tires and we're putting them back into queensland roads and again we're getting great traction um in relation to the uh to the results uh i won't go through the potential borders all there for you to see but in essence um we have some pretty strong directors on the board um brian mummy who's come from um obviously bp australia um is involved in the north west shelf gas joint venture um brad mitten obviously seeing on the board of rock um as well as our group and we'll see through that this is the progress timeline obviously just a simple schematic of how we've continued to evolve uh our business uh 2021 we're looking at obviously said increasing our volume uh bringing more thermal absorption units and the crumbing the crumbing opportunity as well as increasing the the breadth of our of our sailors so we're now talking to explosive groups for the use of of our recovered carbon blackened explosives um we're talking to the steel industry um so there's a number of of opportunities for us to to expand outside the the asphalt sector even though even though asphalt's a large sector in itself investment highlights obviously we were in a very you know large addressable market we have established a track record um of our process um interestingly the government the the federal government recently came out um and talked about the banning of waste streams outside of australia so the government policy both in queensland and at the national level is certainly supporting our business which is which is encouraging uh and that's it so if there's any questions i'd be happy to to take them wonderful thank you so much gary for sharing those um with us so tell us what's the scope for geographic expansion when we're looking beyond queensland do you see yourself servicing all of australia um and i guess moving beyond um our borders and going overseas yeah so i suppose the first the first step is and the way that we we're progressing our business is we've specifically targeted from a product perspective a domestic market which is the ashford industry and then from the asheville industry we break that down into who are the smaller players the reason being is that when um you're testing new products in a commercial sense you're not going to get the larger borrows uh downers etc so now that we've had success at that particular level with one smaller asphalt plant and we've got the results where we're now focusing our marketing attention is to the national companies so you're down as who's represented in every state and you've got your you know borrowers represented in every state fulton hogan representing every state and in new zealand um stanley ashfield is actually very large in europe so the plan is really to have a national footprint aligned with a larger entity so we have off take agreements we actually have a bankable site before we actually you know commit um from there we have already had interest from a number of the waste management uh groups out of europe uh the larger one so we're talking suez ramondas has been through our facility the germans have been through our facility uh because they have the same issue there on that side we will certainly look at the international opportunities once we've um sort of been able to bed down um a national agreement i think we need to ensure the easiest for us is we're in our own backyard at the moment and then moving it you know overseas is um you need to really partner with the right with the right group because you don't want to move into you know a foreign jurisdiction um without a without a strong jd partner absolutely so in terms of that when should we be able to see the higher value products meaningfully contribute to the revenue of the group and would they act as a means of entering new verticals beyond just asphalt yeah absolutely so the reason why we started i suppose in the in asphalt is because one it's a very large industry they make a lot of volume um there's 10 million tonnes of asheville produced in australia every single year there's 800 000 tonne of bitumen produced so the reason why we started there was obviously a big market that we can we can sell into as we as we expand our primary focus is obviously cash flow positive here at stapleton um as our first target and then we by moving the products that we have which is the the level one products the level two products are already completed everything's been done on that page it's done so we know that they're sort of sitting in a bonus ready to go um what we need to ensure is that um we do it in a um do it in a manner that allows us to ensure the best outcome um from from the company perspective so if i take the solvents and and and the degreaser scenario um we need certain volume to ensure the economics of that so we need a uh we need to double the size of our production here at stapleton which we have the capacity to do we don't need another site to do that and then it becomes viable for the likes of the solvents and the degrees is because you have more volume um so that's that's a certain strategy that we have thank you now does the process that you guys go through allow you to get um carbon credits um and i guess whilst we're on that sort of carbon side do you capture carbon yeah so the first answer is we have already done an independent report through rps who have done base level if you like and said what you have here um yes does have the potential for carbon credits the next phase is you need to go through um a fairly extensive process which we will be starting probably in the next few months um to be able to register um for those carbon credits so we've got the approval as far as we've got an assessment to say yes it is but now we need to actually go and get the license if you like for that to happen well gary thank you so much for taking us through pearl global everything you guys are doing and of course your plans for the future um we really appreciate it no worries thanks very much for your time thanks all", "qSFNG1uJIzk": "hey florida medical marijuana patients what's happening this is florida medical marijuana reviews bringing a review on one plant's live rosin that is fresh from harvest frozen plant that is pressed into beautiful beautiful rosin so essentially the strain is mac one i've torn into the gram quite a bit it has stayed perfectly together i don't feel like i've lost any terpenes since having it over the last 10 days it has stayed fully intact other than me of course dabbing the hell out of it the thc isn't going to be what a lot of people want it's of 72 roughly so i know there's a lot of people out there that think thc is everything so they may be slightly disappointed but let me tell you this product is on point true leave will sit there and tell you their rosings will give you a terp tickle slight cough it's just they have harsh shitty concentrate this right here will never give you a turp tickle this is immaculate now the reason this live rosin is 105 a gram is because it is lives when they harvest the plant they freeze it immediately and from there they prepare the trichomes for the pressing that's like one breath big dab i could not even feel the slightest of any kind of tickle in the entire thing granted i took a very low temp dab so some would argue that that's partly why it's not that hard even off a harsh hot dab i don't even feel like it's that harsh because this product is so clean now the only other dispensary out there that pushes a live rosin that is comparable is going to be move but theirs is a little bit harsher but this mac one strain from one plant absolutely out of the park indica i get just a little bit sleepy i feel like my body feels great on it now it does have a low cbd percentage a lot of people would argue that indica should have higher cbd percentages but with a live product like this i mean you get every terpene that was ever present in the plant from the start and i think that's exceptional i think for me that's a great medicine it tastes better it's cleaner", "ZBT1dhQtOkU": "just hang on second here's my way around here into my little crack we're gonna smoke a bowl real quick see we got some wedding

mean really it's just the first very very high quality to fridge that's been on the market most of them have always been plastic and there's never really been one made specifically for our dabbing community so temperature from 46 to 64 degrees Fahrenheit that's awesome very very low temperatures humidity monitor allows the user to remain maintained or H levels as needed lockable with provided keys for added security okay alright so if you're in a place where I don't know say you got 15 other dudes living with you or sneaky sibling that you don't want touching your terp so you can lock them

seeing as we get into this box is USB ports which is just not something you would expect just like you got the user manual right here and some keys okay so there's two keys we can walk it up with very very nice now this is a pretty large unit I mean I'm assuming it's about a foot and a half two feet tall let me get it out real quick Oh fingerprint there we go very hard date let's say it weighs about little under 10 pounds it's not insanely heavy the quality of the outside material right here that I'm touching is just very nice this doesn't it doesn't feel like plastic I don't exactly know what this is let's take a closer look just wow that is so sleek these are just little this is just a touchscreen right here guys look at that no actual buttons just touch panel buttons if we look off to the side maybe get some zoom in on it there we go you can see the screen where it is gonna be but if as you're looking at it head on it is very hard to see very very sleek lock down here at the bottom the door opens very smoothly very easily my old turb cooler had a latch on it and it was fantastic until that latch broke and then it was kind of just pointless as we move on up to the top you can see those three USB slots up there which is just [ __ ] phenomenal so you need to charge a puff go your dad pin something it's right there on top of your turf cooler I mean assuming this is gonna be right in the middle of your session area that's gonna be really cool to have three charge points now before we get to the inside I'm gonna flip around looks like we've got some cooling vents over here big old fan in the back there you go you can see that big I mean that's a big fan and then you got your power slot right there really hefty power cable that is another benefit I'm saying I do like a thick power cable all right let's bust in here and see what we got going on all right so as we open the door to the inside Wow Wow look at that oh my god these are beautiful these are absolutely beautiful so these are just pieces of glass so you can see through them you can see the lower level of turps if you guys look down through here you could see what I mean like you could see through the shelves that is [ __ ] cool and what do we have going on down here looks like goes in there I don't know what that's for maybe to catch water humidity trap I don't know so there's three shelves these are all very nice glass shelves and you're given you're given quite a bit of room to work with here guys like what's that let's go ahead and take three ounce jars I have set over here and pop them right in here three ounce jars nicely educated in there it looks like you could fit maybe another three you probably fit in nine ounce jars on each trace there is a [ __ ] load of room for your Terps let's go ahead and plug it in and see what it looks like when it's got power running through it I really really want to see what this looks like is this design so sleek first things first though I think we should rip this bowl again cheers everyone [Music] this thing is so [ __ ] stick I don't black background exhale my smoke on ooh that wedding cake is good all right so it looks like I need a knife let's try the dad tool spinning method Jam a dab tool in the zip tie and spin it till it snaps go exactly how I planned but that [ __ ] works all right guys let's plug her in and see what we're working with here oh nice little beep on startup i'ma come around front here so right off the bat I'm definitely hearing sounds from it I don't know if you guys can hear that little light coming just sounds like a refrigeration unit we're set to 25 okay there we go that's very responsive very very responsive oh my god it has a light for your Terps what okay all right I'm [ __ ] sold got a blue light looking down on the Terps there how sick is that Wow okay that's just 10 out of 10 right there I must set my set my temperature to I don't know like 55 I have no idea what what's a good storable temperature for Terps all I know is that this thing is tits I'm gonna pop my hand in here let's see if we've got actually any refrigeration going on immediately oh yeah oh yeah but back there it's really cool to aren't ready so I'm assuming given us an hour and it's gonna be an actual little refrigerator this is 10 out of 10 a great [ __ ] product here guys I know they're gonna be expensive I know it's not gonna be everybody's cup of tea but for just that one more little piece of dabbing utensil Lola dabbing just add to your station ten out of ten this thing's sick that light so [ __ ] nice let's try the lock out here see if we can keep people out of our Terps so you got two keys become with it standard-looking guys that's it I mean you that's a really you'd have to break the lid off to get in there that that's not opening up that's a lot of pressure I'm putting on that probably actually shouldn't be putting that much pressure on it but we're here review products we're not here to [ __ ] pussyfoot around boom I was wondering about this little metal piece down here was for that so it walks in there what a cool [ __ ] product guys this is just this is so sick slide-out tray for your chirps I couldn't be [ __ ] more ecstatic about this I think this is gonna be an amazing product the community really needed this we didn't have an actual turf cooler everybody

categories value packaging looks smell taste and effect we then take these six categories write them on a one through five scale add them up divide them by six which gives us our final score today we're going to be reviewing um a brand new to me brand called seattle private reserve they're decently popular they've been around for a while but i've never tried their wax before so i'm excited to try it so seattle private reserve this company has an interesting sort of history as far as i know so uh back in the day when my friends and i used well my friends would cop it and i'd go to their house and smoke it um their seattle private reserve flower i noticed just wasn't up to snuff they were charging a lot for it and every time we got it it just never seemed you know up to par with how much they were charging but as far as i wax goes i am uninformed i have no idea so i'm excited to see if their wax is different and i'm hoping that it is different because i've seen pictures of it on instagram looks quite appetizing so yeah without further ado we're going to get right into it here value so starting off with value this gram uh costed forty dollars so not too bad um at forty dollars a gram it's not cheap at all but for this type of quality at least from what i can see it looks really high quality so from this type of quality uh forty dollars is not not terrible at all um because you can pay anywhere from i'd say low of 35 all the way up to even 60 dollars per gram for something like this um so yeah i i think the value is pretty it's it's okay it's at 40 it's kind of expensive but you're not going to be breaking the bank for it moving on to the packaging here really really like this packaging so you guys can see here they got the strain name on top source cake and then got all this information here on the side all the stats all the terpene percentage everything like that and it's all in one glass jar no cardboard no plastic no extra added waste to this product really really happy about that i love this kind of packaging y'all i think the last video that had this kind of packaging got a super high packaging rating so yeah i love this kind of packaging so now for the open test here so i think you just grab it and twist or okay hold on so if you guys see these stickers right here you are probably it's your best bet to cut them so i'm grabbing myself a tool here your best bet to slice through them with something so that you can then turn it because using the torque to turn it like the torque from your wrist is probably not going to work so right now i'm going to use this tool cut a little bit of it so i guess that's my least favorite part of the packaging so like really my only part that i don't like is that you got to kind of do a little bit of finagling to get it open but once you do that you're going to get to the goodies it's because they have two like plastic stickers there's one cardboard sticker that one's not a problem at all but they got these plastic stickers make it almost impossible wow okay this is actually a lot harder than i thought not gonna lie right i think i got it okay this is actually annoying to open i'm not even gonna lie like what what is going on here what am i not doing right can't open it dude okay this is i can't open this this is ridiculous what the [ __ ] okay sweaty hands all right so this packaging sucks i can't even [ __ ] open it this is ridiculous this packaging sucks ass dude this packaging is terrible what the heck i can't okay well i can't even like what is this i can't i'm getting so upset right now i mean what is this going to take dude for me to open god damn man like [ __ ] really still not [ __ ] opening on me all right [ __ ] all right i think i almost got it okay this almost i'm so sorry y'all but for this delay but this is this is ridiculous this might be the worst packaging i've had on the channel so far okay got this [ __ ] open holy crap okay that took how long that took like okay that took like four minutes to open i'm so sorry about that y'all but i figured you needed to see it real time [ __ ] this packaging no like [ __ ] it i thought it was good this sucks ass like what is wrong with this lid there's a bunch of like plastic [ __ ] here there's like plastic notches that you gotta like push it down and [ __ ] dude that's impossible to open this packaging is terrible this just fix these notches man i just spent five minutes opening that that's ridiculous okay deep breath calm down okay we're good i'm sure there's a couple funny ass faces i made during that i'm not gonna lie because i was getting i was starting to get pissed i was like i was wondering am i gonna get this gram open for the video or am i gonna have to stop the video but that was by far the hardest gram to open on the channel so yeah that's annoying moving on to the looks well these they look really good this looks really good it's got a really kind of a moist live resiny look to it crystal crystalline it looks really good it looks really kind of battery like it's all going to come up in one scoop which is nice you know i hate that little crumble consistency where you pick one up and it goes everywhere that shit's annoying but um but yeah i like this the looks of this one a lot moving on to the smell here okay that smells bomb it smells like so sour you see sour kush cake was it yeah sour kush cake you're definitely getting some of that wedding cake profile for sure pretty you can smell like it kind of smells sour this is really good it's got a pungent smell to it i like the smell a lot for sure pungent sour wet and cakey really nice moving on to my favorite part of the video and a much needed part of the video considering the beginning took me five minutes to open the taste i need a fat dab right now that was ridiculous y'all that that was ridiculous i literally had to grab this screwdriver and like do some really weird crap to get this open but i did it i got it open so here's a present to myself for getting this gram open cheers huh all right whoa that did it okay um it tastes really good i'm not even gonna put the lid back on i'm just going to like set it on top let's [ __ ] that but it tastes really good it's got kind of a the same kind of sour wedding cakey taste that it was smelling like there i really like that really strong really really clean all the way throughout really really nice uh taste on this product on to the effect here sorry y'all dying a little bit over here moving on to the effect so i like this this effect now that i've been sitting here for a couple seconds it's a nice it's a nice hybrid like i said about the uh i'm pretty sure it was the runts i feel like i can either work out right now which i just did or i can relax and play with like play with my dogs or watch something or whatever it is that you do when you like to relax you can do that after this train it's a nice nice evenly even keel uh sort of hybrid i really like the effect on this one i like the the older i get the more i like the hybrids um moving on to the ratings portion of the video now so for value okay so at forty dollars a gram you're getting a really good quality concentrate you really are the only problem i have with it is it's incredibly hard to open so like if they fix the packaging on this one the value would be a little like higher but the fact that you're paying forty dollars a gram to spend like five minutes struggling to open it with a screwdriver that's that's annoying that's that's ridiculous so i'm gonna i'm gonna say for that the value gets a 2.5 out of five because the concentrate was really good just fix the packaging because that was enough to like almost that almost made me quit filming because i i was like dude am i going to sit here for 10 minutes because that was long enough i mean that was ridiculously long the amount of time i sat there tried to open that so i was just i had to i had to open it and luckily i got it open but yeah it's terrible 2.5 out of 5 for the value packaging okay packaging one out of five i'm literally giving that a one out of five because that that is so annoying like you guys i'm sure you guys saw i was getting like legitimately mad at that freaking container like that's ridiculous so one out of five in the packaging no wii container should make you angry none that's ridiculous moving on to the looks so really like the looks on this one it's got kind of a orangish sort of tint to it it's nice um you guys will see the high resolution photo of course but really like the looks on this one i'm gonna go ahead and give the looks a four out of five because those are really good really prime looks moving on to the smell uh that smells awesome uh it smelled really really good it smelled like uh like i said kind of a sour wedding cake profile so really good i'm going to go ahead and give the smell 3.5 out of 5. moving on to the taste the taste was just like it smelled really like the exact same sour wedding cakey taste i really like that as well giving that a 3.5 out of 5. moving on to the effect so i really like this effect definitely took me down a few notches after getting upset over that whole thing but yeah i'm liking this effect a lot it's really really really nice um [Music] yeah it's like like i said it's like a 50 50 hybrid so you're getting that sativa sort of pick me up um sun's out guns out sort of thing you know if you want to go lift some weights and you're getting that relaxation body high feeling if you want to relax and not really do much after working out or working or whatever it is you do so uh yeah i'm really a fan of this effect a lot it's one of my favorite ones on the channel so far so i'm going to give it a 3.5 out of 5 as well so yeah for that that gives us 18 divided by 6 equals 3 out of 5. that might have been one of the first even numbers we've had on this channel as far as the writing goes but yeah three out of five would i buy this again man okay so like i really like the really like everything about this the packaging i mean now that i know how to open it i'll probably buy it again but that's the the way this is the way this packaging is i don't know man they really got to fix it that was so upsetting so would i buy it again probably i don't know i think there's better options out there for 35 to 40 but if they put this wax in like an abstract container absolutely i would buy it again hope you guys are enjoying my content uh hope you guys enjoyed my little mini freak out earlier in this video i'm sure it was

really it's literally like the cheapest BMW that you can buy but everyone kind of thinks it looks chill and it looks so for me I was thinking about upgrading my car really soon and like getting a good trade-in value for it I think the plan is now I'm just gonna keep my car because it's paid off and I don't want to put on a little payment so I'm just gonna drive my car until I graduate and then when I graduate I'm gonna buy myself a fat ass with I'm already saving for it but I want it to be an everyday driver and I want it to be under a hundred grand alright none and I got it if they came in GT four came in Porsches PDK I would definitely cop that like that's like the for sure cop if I had any amount of money I would get a GT four I know everyone's gonna be like bro but the manual transmission but like dude it's a robot it makes you go faster he's like broom broom you know what I mean you know no no no Eric Congrats on 300k yeah enemy my question is what are you most excited about in sales in 19 and for everyone watching my birthday is April 21st I'll be in New York City DME if you want to come [ __ ] party this it yeah the party's Henry I'm ready for a lot of [ __ ] man I think the main thing I'm excited for if you guys don't know I made it my new year's resolution to travel once a month so I've done it already for the first three months this month for 420 we're going to San Fran next month I already mentioned earlier we're going to Miami hi in the summer months I don't know we're trying to plan something fat trying to be something cool because I've never even been out of the country and I never really traveled before this year but now I have the mean so you not have a reason to his YouTube [ __ ] so it's gonna be cool man that's what I'm most excited for I'm just gonna travel all over the country hopefully out of the country at one point he's got to find the right deals and then it's kind of worth it so hey travelin that's what I'm most excited for the youtubes shit's gonna be cool too but like I think the YouTube comes with the traveling you know what I mean obviously I'm gonna bring my camera obviously I'm gonna be smoking where I'm going so it kind of goes inside with one another you know what I mean it was good my name is Sam I'm here in Austin Texas yeah yeah I was born there if you do anywhere in the world up and just smoke chew and Julie scenery the view you know where'd you go oh this would have been a tough question like an hour ago but I I was just thinking about that actually it's kind of weird but the aurora borealis anywhere where I can see that I know there's a lot of countries in Europe or just like northern country you can probably see it in like Sweden and there's like a whole bunch of like Greenland Iceland I don't know I want to go roll up a nice fat joint and watch the aurora borealis and trip my mind maybe drop a little tab maybe I don't know probably if we're gonna be honest if I'm over there then yeah I'm probably gonna drop down the southern lights look pretty sick to you no one talks about that underrated but I mean the Northern Lights bro they're all green and [ __ ] like come on you know you trip balls looking at that yeah so this is an easy one I forgot your name what you're saying Mitch Mitch yeah all right this is an easy one man said it before I'll say it again I just balanced my [ __ ] by smoking after I'm done with all my important stuff so usually I'll wake up I'll go to school answer emails do all that stuff pretty sober and then once like the business day ends you know like 5:00 p.m. type [ __ ] then I'm just like all right [ __ ] off and I already streamed before that I start my stream every day at 3:30 so it's just like I'm kind of clocked out by that time I make sure I have nothing else like the main thing that I make sure of is that if I were to just smoke too much and pass out I wouldn't be irresponsible you know I wouldn't miss any deadlines or oh of course I just realized it was it was in 1080 man that's the worst anyway just make sure that if you get too high it's gonna be alright you can just Joe and be high cuz that's the worst thing to like when you're high and you're getting high and you remember that you have like homework you do or have to like edit a bit or upload a vid or I do this and then it's just like dams it's kind of like a buzzkill on the hunt you know I mean like I like a stress-free just chill chill high and if I have things to worry about and it's not gonna happen yo my name is Daniel and my question is what is your favorite strain right now right now yesterday right now oh shoot right now purple punch it's green it was Green crack for a while everyone the real fans know like bro Green Craig been your favorite for a while would happen purple punch man when you get the purple punch bud if you ever had some purple punch extracts like I had some lunch time as dude almost came like I almost like came soft that wasn't even hard or anything like I just [ __ ] almost came my pants but hey it was ridiculous so far but I'm Eric - Patrick I want to know the shirtless big come on bro Stan how long can I do a keg stand bro I don't have everyday cakes in my life I got shot gonna be real nice I can beer bong it'd be real nice I've never done a cake set man I'm a [ __ ] [ __ ] for that hey we'll get a cake Sancerre don't even worry about all right now that you put it in my mind I've actually never done any kicks in so I got you bro you were what session was probably the 42 grand moon rock even though that wasn't really one session if you don't want to count that that is probably the hounds in one sitting either one of them those that's I don't mean that that's a lot bro I don't really like blow down too hard like everyone gives me this leg this [ __ ] they're like bro I smoke like Suge like maybe you do bro I spent like two grams a day like including the stream to three grams a day probably like it's not that much I mean yeah smoking every day's a lot but I am 100% sure that there is a decent amount of you that smoke more than me I'm not worried but it isn't a competition bro like I've never been like dude I've smoked way more than that guy like that's just some some little dick [ __ ] right there man that is some little deed confidence right there what's up [ __ ] yeah appreciate that chase why did I start smoking honestly all my friends started smoking before me and I didn't really want to try it because like I heard all the [ __ ] in middle school was like you don't do drugs don't smoke weed like dude not do any of these things stay away from it her different parents are teachers counselors everybody so I was like of course I'm not gonna get involved my friends want to get involved they can't I'm not gonna stop him you know what I mean but as I kept hanging out with him I was like they're not really negatively effected like all these things that I thought was gonna happen to him like none of them happened there was still just who they were and they were just hi and I was like dude if I was like they can just be high and still be functional still do good in school still work their jobs or whatever and I was like I'm down so tried it out summer going into sophomore year of high school and it was a good time than it was and I was like [ __ ] it I was like I might just have to keep on doing this you know what I mean like it's not hurting me at all it's giving me a good vibe let's smoke some weed from now on and then the rest is history bro you already know what it is you know Eric your Inlet yo what's up Eric my name is Travis and my question is would you ever give up smoking for a job and if you would what John would have to be like that answer is so much different now than it was a year ago because like this this weed tube [ __ ] in like this this whole thing is actually leading stuff like a meeting companies that meeting all these people that are willing to give me jobs and it's like I don't think I'm gonna have to man but but let's just say all of it falls through let's say [ __ ] tomorrow Trump's like [ __ ] that [ __ ] you pot heads no more weed it all makes it federal again schedule one keeps it and it's just like completely [ __ ] then in that case I would give up smoking weed for a job that's like six figures probably like above yeah yeah that's like a comfortable living you know what I mean like I don't need to be a millionaire or anything but if I'm given a weed it's gotta be worth it you know what I mean it's not gonna be hard to give up like I don't think I'm gonna smoke weed forever if we're gonna be a hundred percent real like I think I'm probably gonna stop or at least take a break when I have a kid but like until then bro do you I'm not having a kid for like another decade so until then we're smoking this [ __ ] but like I don't think I'm gonna smoke it forever I'm not gonna wanna maybe when the kids a little older then I started like I don't know man the futures trippy to think about like I genuinely don't even know what the [ __ ] gonna happen in like a year that's like a asking like what are you gonna have for dinner tomorrow night but anyway I think it's pretty much done yeah that's done um that's [ __ ] gross all right appreciate you guys for coming through you guys are the absolute best 300k I love you all so so much you're all the homies man this is our year I told you 2019 was our year and everyone was like dude I mean no one really said they didn't believe but just imagine that someone was like nowhere that's not not 2019 SRU baby alright I appreciate you guys so much man make sure to check out the sponsors in the description make sure to check out the links in description to social medias all that [ __ ] I'll see you guys in the next one when she's gonna be on Wednesday I think I'm uploading this on Tuesday we did in my bed supposed to be uploaded yesterday I usually put every Monday Freddie you know it is peace I'll see you [Music]", "wSWRu9fla3g": "what is that fam organic home buds we're gonna do a lot of real fast then we are going to go and do some blasting so hopefully you're dabbing along and if you ain't you roll one up smoking along you're gonna take a big ol off Cheers let's go blast what is up fam alright so we are out my garage as you can see we are about to blast two cans of pure 322 with twenty three point five grams so yes I'm outside I have plenty of air movement out here so not worried about that got a couple things just in case this gets cold keep my hands nice and warm but let's see how this turns out I pre lie in my pan with parchment paper so let's see how it goes as you can see here's the lovely tube enough it'll show close up try not nice small little nuggets in there a little bit of a small trimming I guess you would consider a shake all frost if you've seen a couple beats with pics in it where it showed on them real nice frosty nugs that's in here so let's see what this product can do organic Sullivan peer 322 let's put this to test tears fan alright fam here goes one can about to start the extraction fifty three and a half grams of some fire frost so far not too bad on the fries in the hands so probably wouldn't even needed the glove actually it is getting cold though I could feel the coldness so it's slowly about the work towards almost where the field is at now so we should be seeing something coming with a couple seconds to the next king well know few seconds yep here comes now you can see it coming and pouring out so far it's super gold looking as soon as I can get the two cans I'll bring up an up close picture city off and check it out it's a really gold yellow yeah definitely smart to use this little oven mitt just for anything that rolls down the can it stops my hand from freezing end to one can going around to win the second can definitely a nice gold yellow super gold yellow but also when you got some nice frosty nug it should hopefully be some nice gold yellow here in a second I'll let you guys check it out you guys can tell me what you think nice comes out nice definitely ain't bad I think I'm going to try this again a couple different directions see if I can make some diamonds up with this so definitely keep an eye out and keep watch out for some more videos the Blasted is the next one probably going to be with some diamonds and then after that see what else I can try definitely next time I'm a vest in the stand because it does get a little tiring holding it but it looks like I'm have a good turnout there's still coming out nice and yellow it hasn't hit clear yet now just blows extra out cuz just air going through she does definitely get a little tiring with 2k after toucans yeah you'll probably not want to say you'll do this again without getting a stand one can ain't bad two cans your arm gets a little tired try it from all the pressure as you see it does get pretty cold so there's a wise choice to use a mitt all right I think that's all she wrote so I'm gonna hold this in this hand now I'm gonna bring y'all over so you can see some of this nice beautiful golden yellow look at that golden yellow so now we're gonna sit I'll be back I'll show you how it turns out we got a Ford 24-hour wait I will be back and show you the results cheers fan later what's that fam silver back as you can see it already started you've a parade a little bit decent amount look how golden yellow that is nice can you hear it you can hear the little book the bubbles fuzz and making a little fuzz popping sound this is really sweet so far I'm liking it but like I said we'll have to come back I'll have to check this out as soon as it's done we'll test out the product see how it tastes how clean it is the effects stay tuned much love fam later what is up fam so we are back it's been I don't know within an hour and at 62 degrees outside it is forming I would say like diamonds but maybe it's just because it's a little chilly so it's a little frosty like kind of like ice cube so it's going to take a little longer to finish evaporating but yeah just figured out a let you guys get a look update resuming here there we go see I like the diamonds but like I said it might be maybe because it's cold so we're gonna come back let you see how it looks here shortly peace alright so we are back again it's been I want to say another 20 minutes you can see it's a little drier now watch this when I give it when I blow on it a little bit to move the evaporation a little bit faster watch the bubbles and watch everything move around now that's pretty cool so as it finishes I will keep coming back with some updates much love and respect fam data alright fam so after about two hours I came inside cuz I dropped down to 50 degrees and this is where we are at nice beautiful gold it's finishing off so as soon as it's completely done I will definitely be back show you we will sample it out Cheers what is up fam Organic home buds back with the final results and I would say she is like a mighty go this is about after three hours I'm gonna refocus in a couple of spots super gold I'm liking the results really really gold looking get to zoom in there so I am thinking look at all the glitter glistening I think I am gonna try to make some diamonds next run [Music] let me know what y'all think big ol shout out pure 322 that is some nice clean pure organic Sullivan I'm definitely like a net instead of the BHO or moonshine so let me know what y'all think definitely really go she's shining also big ol shout out to chef life thanks fam definitely glad that I got to try some of this much lovin respect later", "hs2jI8I_gaI": "the

like i'm geeked i'm ready because first time ever tier one water hash from 710 tier [ __ ] one first i just gotta say that i've only ever seen tier one on their photos and it just looks like hashi grains of sand and it just looks so nice and tasty bro and it is absolutely beautiful and smells just like the strength and we have let me just show you we got the unquestionably og crossed with the wedding cake and if you guys have ever tried the 710 wedding cake it is some gas i've actually tried the percy rosin of it and it is [ __ ] amazing now let me tell you guys this is something else like i swear this is something else i am so i'm pumped because i've never had as you guys can see right there tier one we've only ever had like one or two tier one items ever which was full spectrum hash i mean of course percy also counts because i believe percy's are tier one and two only but that i know of this is the second or third tier one item we have and i'm just ready for this [ __ ] i hope you guys are ready to pizza [ __ ] if you guys ever see some tier one water hash get that [ __ ] especially from this company surprised it came in in a white container because normally you know black box black container but i prefer the white ones now are y'all ready questionable yogi tier one and there it is oh my god see what i mean by it looks like hashy grains of sand but just look at how beautiful it looks like sand crystals bro look at this you see that look at that where do you see waterhouse of this quality are level nowhere but 7 10. [ __ ] i [ __ ] love 710 and quite frankly i've had water hatch from other companies but none do it like this like none can satisfy you like when you take a dab of something like this like first of all i smell nothing but og i do smell a slight like other scent you know that being the wedding cake but this is unquestionably some emoji just like the [ __ ] name of the of the [ __ ] strain says i kid you not i kid you not that this [ __ ] is smelly like look at it bro this is some gas all right y'all that's what i'm taking cheers wow i gotta say wow definitely the og overpower this one unbelievable wow i'm so high that was such a beautiful i love hash that was that [ __ ] was unbelievable oh my god i'm not going to tell you that i'm i'm spacing out i'm [ __ ] loaded hey this is nice like okay so if you guys have been sticking in lately and you saw the last video that i did which was i believe the last one i did oh not not the last video but the one prior i did a video of a tree review and it was called humanity og and i was saying how i haven't had some straight og flavor like that in a long time well i have been blessed because this hash taste first of all the hash itself tastes earthy like if you guys ever have hash do you guys ever taste how it tastes like a little more earthy um pioneer like you know a little more like you know like dirt like i don't know how to explain it but hash has like a earthy delicious taste that you it has more of a plant-like taste and also the smell of when you're burning it it smells more like the plant have you got noticed that and that's why i think hatch is so much better because it has i feel like more of a plant like taste from it anyway back to the point of that hash flavor with this insane unquestionably ogn wedding cake like i said the it was unquestionably the og that took the flavor in this straight in this hash combo and i must say i am so happy and i'm so high i feel relieved what it's supposed to do because real kush real og is a hybrid indica dominant but it's a hybrid and right now i feel great all right we're back i had to change the fit real quick you feel me the other day we're about to take you see how big it is that's what she said that's what i told to be cheers and i welcome my dad i must i'm gonna say wow i kind of do know how it tastes like and then this one i did taste it but i still think that the og dominates or maybe it's a good blend because the wedding cake itself is pretty you know pretty potent pretty strong so maybe it's just it enhanced the og i don't know but it is gas and i am hella high all right y'all i'm about i gotta get going though shout out to everybody in the world court that is now part of the royal family i appreciate you all and i'll see you again in the next video", "HjVnvEy-IkA": "what is going on welcome back to the I smoke Channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene today we're going to be covering diamonds and sauce versus shatter two forms of cannabis extract but what is the difference and how in fact are they similar those are the questions that we are going to be answering in today's video remember to hit that like and subscribe button if you are feeling these videos that helps us grow rich even more people and get our message out there so without further adieu let's talk diamonds and shatter I've got my Chuck B glass piece originating in the USA for today's video it's getting out of the Pelle case so I can show you what it looks like oh yes and we are gonna fill it with water you ready and here we go we are ready to kick off the video let's put this pillowcase away the old one 120 Pelle case what you need if you're traveling with your glass let's talk about the difference between shatter and diamonds and sauce we're gonna start with the most familiar form of extract that you've probably come across for ready it is shatter and this has been on the market since at least a few years ago but all the way people have been extracting cannabis going back to the last century recently shatter has become a much bigger thing lead partially due to the advent of medical legalization and recreational legalization in the States that is where this was first super popular and now extracts come in this form so what does she look like shatter can have different coloration but is generally gonna look a bit more stable than other forms of cannabis extract when you get shatter you will know it is shatter because it will literally shatter when you break it you can see from the way that it breaks although some of it may potentially be a little bit more sticky but basically shatter looks like this this is some lovely mimosa shatter we got beer 710 this is what shatter should look like if it is clean it might come in a different color look at the consistency look at the sort of golden hue and just just look at it guys you can see that that is some nice-looking chatter if it's tiny or if it has got too much chlorophyll or aged plant material eg trimming it it might be darker and you might see shatter that's like really dark almost black looking I wouldn't really want to dab that anymore but have done in the past how does it differ to diamonds and sauce well let's take you through what diamonds and silks of Diamonds themselves are almost pure THC a crystals basically 99 point something percent tetrahydrocannabinol where is the source is a mixture of Turks some cannabinoids and the flavonoids giving it this lovely rich flavor profile not being an extractor I don't know too much about the process of creating diamonds in source but the source is a really Turkey volatile cannabis extract that is on the other side of the spectrum to something like shatter shatter has a really nice stability to it although it may degrade into a more waxy like substance over time particularly when not refrigerated as those turps cannabinoids flavonoids begin to break down into a delicious extract soup that's when you'll see shatter waxing up diamonds and sauce basically is like honey sort of looking liquid the diamonds are the crystallization of that so that could happen when the extract has been left in a pressurized compartment over time it begins to crystallize and over the last few years the process has been honed and developed until we start seeing big thca crystals that look like rocks basically and that is diamonds and source I really like the flavor profile you get on this I think it's very hard to replicate the diamonds and sauce flavor profile in shatter or even in fact in other forms of cannabis extracts the more stable something is the less in my experience is the flavor some exploded in my mouth you know a lot whether it's with the Diamonds and sauces so volatile goes turps something which is unparalleled so this is some lemon skittles diamonds and sauce you might be familiar with the skittles strain skittles with that is a really popular Cali import strain lemon skills in their skills cross and this is the diamonds and source of that straight away I can tell you that out the to extract this one smells really nice this one smells about ten times nicer you get a little bit of the aroma with the shatter but with the diamonds and sauce it is really really stinky in a really lovely way for the lemon citrus the skills sweetness you know that fruity pebbles types or a sweetness I've got both of them in front of me I can smell this one and I can't smell this one diamonds and sauce is going to smell a bit stronger because of the volatile nature of the extract you know it's lighter pea sauce shatters a little bit more stable than that stability means that you can pick it up with your hand as you see with this shutter I can just pick it up and hold it and that is because it is nice and stable allowing me to do that without it breaking down I couldn't pick this up and hold it I'd get it sauce all over my hands and that would be a waste we need Abdul for that so that's a comparison between shatter and diamonds and source hopefully I haven't missed much out do feel free to add your input your insights in the comments section I think that people will be wondering what the difference is between the different forms of cannabis extract and Shatter versus diamonds and sauce is an interesting comparison should we dab some first of all we're gonna start with these shatter this is mimosa another really popular cannabis strain that I'm sure some of you would have heard of so you can say this is Shattuck is as I'm digging my dad's hole into it it's literally splintering off into little portions you need to be careful with shatter particularly when cold that you don't accidentally flick it off of your your parchment paper and onto the floor sometimes it can be harder to pick up with a dab tool than than with your fingers as this is proving because it's just not sticky we are ready to go live with this dab of mimosa shatter and I'll see you guys on the other side wow that mimosa flavor is delicious but I do find with shatter he's sort of got a very slight chattery taste to it so you sort of can taste the form of cannabis extract it is now a wonder whether that is actually the lack of volatile Terps meaning that it's not as flavorsome as other forms now there is also something to say about open-loop blasting versus closed-loop distilled butane both of these forms of extract are extracted using a solvent it looks like this it is called butane and it is the same gas as goes into your blow torches your clipper lighters etc obviously handling this stuff in an enclosed environment is dangerous it is extremely flammable that is why it is recommended that if you don't know what you're doing do not try this at home I've spoke to more than one extractor that has told me that they've had an accident in the past and it's not really a little accident when it involves things like explosions and fire so stay safe people there are safer ways to make your own extracts at home just look at rosin all right should we do a dab of the diamonds and sauce and see how it compares to that in the motor shaft that we just tried I think we should it isn't the best shape to dad till family in diamonds and source actually but I think we're gonna be able to to get your nights tab allows a these looks great guys we're about to do this tab right now and I'll see you on the other side tears folks [Music] wowsa oh man all the flavor got me that dad makes your eyes forward sometimes that was intense that was expansive that actually gave me the sweats guys been a long time since I got the sweats doing a DAB the flavor of the lemon skills diamonds and sauce is absolutely incredible through the coffin I was able to get that delicious sweetness you know just as it smells it tastes and I've been dabbing that all yesterday I'm really loving that flavor so which is my favorite out of diamonds and sauce and shatter it has gotta be the diamonds and source guys and girls it is a delicious form of cannabis extracts able to give me the sweat after all this dabbing that's pretty impressive and it is certainly particularly that version of it a winning flavor and dabbing experience shutter is nice but it's got that shattering flavor but I think with the Diamonds and sauce you get this like magical level of flavor that you don't really experience anywhere else saying that though with diamonds and sauce you definitely don't need a big dab those crystals of THC a are expansive and very very strong and I just experienced that from a normal-sized dad got me quite a bit high up and giving me the sweats which I don't mind it's been a while since a DAB has done that to me but what do you think of this video folks what is your favorite form of extract have you tried dabbing it they leave your comments below this has run on to 24 minutes of filming supposed to be in a three minute video that has been the video comparing the diamonds and sauce and the shutter that's it for the moment as always thanks for watching and keep token stepping on here rollercoaster going down but I never felt this high biggest right how the century [Music]", "c8x3h7_5j9s": "what's up guys I'm Rick quick review I got a helix cart from Oklahoma I'm the patient guard of course here's the back mr. Scott puppies eighty-one percent real real part taste test thank you good night", "AKy6CXaqESI": "welcome to community cannabis review today I'm going to be reviewing a Mojave brand live resin cartridge I'm doing a quick little video which I did as well with hush because quite frankly I just want to get these cartridges in my beep and same with my girlfriend she once said as well so I'm just gonna get a review down because I don't have these on my channel and I don't know that I'll buy these again as I already have a couple favorite brands and if anyone was wondering what they're like how about we show you this much so you know so I bought this for 1916 that's how much it is made I believe it's like $22 rent something like that this is made by the same company from what I've looked into as hush the hush Brandon carts are just distillate and little canvas terpenes you get I get this for $16 out the door these ones are live resin mixed with distillate from what I can see on the ingredients they're also they're both made by A&M company or Co or what have you but anyway as I said on the hush brand ones I used to not get these because I could swear they used non cannabis dr terpenes which i'm not a fan of and now it appears that they've changed with a flavoring ban so that's the that's the whole thing I'm trying to get this open gingerly but stuff I'm not working oh this tape that's why I'm not destroy this package there's oh you know what we make sure that you all can see the info before I get to undo it so that's the strain information sativa Kim Sour Diesel seventy six percent THC two point five since CBD down with something like eighty seven percent total cannabinoids decent amount herb septic the one with the moose terpenes actually now I don't believe I did there's one that's slightly more here's any other info on the back I know before I'm going to a legal state I just loved watching these videos to look at stuff like this so I want to try and make sure you all can see as much of that as you can very cool stuff comes with something awfully similar to hush so another giveaway I just do a same brand but you can just check the back and it says well alright so it's not a bad looking live resin cart nothing glaringly bad about it and grab my vessel Georgia pop it in and see looks like a good standard see so um weird no thought it wasn't screwing in alright so we'll start it add 2 2 point 7 volts for flavor getting Sour Diesel oh yeah 3.7% Terps isn't terribly a lot for live rising compared to some of the buddies liquid diamonds live resin you're seeing stuff like 14% terpenes it's out there I mean it's ridiculous really good stuff but for $20 $19 or what-have-you this is not bad really not bad not on the same level as buddies but my med price for the buddy's liquid diamonds live resin is 30 out the door so I get to save some money here and lose a little bit of quality but I mean it's totally passable I avoided some budget brands before entirely I would just not buy them but these are good in a pinch I wouldn't be against using these at all me bump up the voltage and try one more cloud before I jump out of here 1 2 3 I have trouble with it sometimes solid cart solid cart so um thanks for watching hopefully my next videos will be slightly better quality put together a little bit but as you can probably see it's a million [ __ ] degrees out here and we have yet to get an AC in our apartment so a little insufferable right now but I wanted to just get two quick videos out there because I wanted to make sure that I put these on the internet in case anyone had any questions before I just go through these in the day and then never think of them again and soon you guys if I can never get our stand dabbing which I'm not a greatest fan o Keeffe and for some reason of I got a whole lot of stuff to review review lots of live res and lots of diamonds diamond sauce you know I just want stuff so stay tuned and hopefully I'll knock out some of that pretty soon here", "50Ym59hm-MM": "if you're not 18 please [ __ ] off thank you what's up guys we do mister boy came mark as you can see we out here and the wife-beater we

yo what's good you guys welcome to a live stream we're gonna go ahead and do uh the rest of the presses from yesterday that i didn't finish it up got uh six bucks here we're gonna go ahead and start pressing these um i'm thinking at 200. yesterday we did a range of temperatures the lower temperatures were not cutting it so we're going to go back to our our higher tip that i like to do that 202 we're gonna go ahead and uh we'll see how that does got some more parchment so i got the uh pucks properly wrapped up now and prepped in the appropriate size parchment sleeves so we should be able to get a decent flow and we'll just have to see what we get and we'll adjust the temperature as needed i don't imagine we'll be going down below 190 so excuse me one minute while i go ahead and finish straightening some [ __ ] up it is [ __ ] chilly chilly really really really [ __ ] is cold in the [ __ ] whoa i honestly i'm about to put on my [ __ ] key hold on yeah burr yeah we bout to take a dab right now hell yeah seeking something i'm glad to hear that man that's dope get your press on so here's the jar that we started last night this stuff was super turpy so we got all these crazy dark terps in here and we've got this lighter area and we're going to go ahead and we're going to mix all of it together today trim run gelato cake and white runs it's a little darker but oh my god i am in love with the taste already the taste on it is like a mint chocolate chip coffee it's bananas not the flavor but just it's crazy i haven't done any like stirring whipping i haven't done anything to it since last night i'm curious to see what it's going to do over the next couple days oh man and it melts so clean like you wouldn't even believe with how dark it is how clean it melts i'm gonna show

gotta find out i gotta find out he said okay goodbye [Music] [Music] the power what pleasure strength i'm sorry is that being is that being culturally insensitive am i being stereotypical am i stereotyping i'm sorry let's get this press started i'm banked already [Music] um [Music] excuse me excuse me hold on the tripod get you guys set up and then um we'll go from there [Music] hey [Music] dabbing gloves big force the team oh the team sounds like he's trying to say like uh the team is strong like big up to the team [Music] am i am i right we just started working at amazon working overnights that means you're packing [ __ ] women's dildo orders and [ __ ] huh doing all the freaky [ __ ] overnight i got you on that [ __ ] [ __ ] it's okay boy what else could they use the overnight [ __ ] for at amazon that's gotta be it that's gotta be so [Music] [Music] [Music] my man said he's part of the ginyu force that's what he said until we figure out what he's saying we're just gonna assume that he's saying he's part of the ginyu force [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] foreign oh this one gets loud oh so good return puck feels uh pretty well emptied and got off the plates pretty quick and was the same color or lighter than yesterday a slightly better return feels like so i dropped the temperature a little bit but not much because this stuff does just come out darker because in the terps [Music] so i still want to keep the flow high [Music] myself [Music] uh wow i'm allowed to give you guys information soon but i can't give you information on pricing yet i was told i have to wait until science led makes the official announcement and gets them on their site and then by then they'll have like um shipping times and you'll be able to pre-order and [ __ ] they don't want to put out the information too soon so they told me to wait trust me i'm i'm so ready to tell you guys [Music] you know [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm at uh 190 right now it's just looking off because the lighting is [ __ ] and this is a trim run bro here maybe this will help you guys with the color issue i know it's hard to tell but you'll see you'll see get this in the jar and then we're going to go ahead and start the next puck that was a good temperature and we're gonna run it at that time yeah i don't really have a good spot you guys where you're not gonna be in the [ __ ] way i'll try and move you over a little bit i think my laptop could be [ __ ] maybe let me see food grade month okay you guys if you say so you know what determines whether it's food grade or not how clean it melts when i show you how clean it melts you're gonna be like oh okay yeah that's not food grade the trichomes that come off of trim is usually going to be more mature because it's exposed to more direct light than the rest of the trichomes that are covered in the plant matter right so when you process trim it's going to come out slightly more amber too all right and then if you're dealing with a strain that's really really terpy and depending on what those terpenes are can also make it darker right so never judge judge it by the color alone and be quick to say oh that's food grade or that's not good like it's really really hard to judge it based off of color alone especially fresh off the press so oh yeah definitely people judge with their eyes first for sure you eat with your eyes first you judge off of appearance first but again this is fresh off the plates and you got to give me a couple days and work my magic on it telling you guys i'm telling you huh i want to mention just my lighting is [ __ ] probably back you guys the [ __ ] up huh um the plan is going to be to whip this all up and heat mat it and then burp it at um at a certain point [Music] so good extraction on that one too this is going to turn out just like the los altos did it's gonna turn into that like jam with chunks in it and i'm gonna love it we'll love every minute of it there's not good light over here where's the best light for me let's go in here oh no [ __ ] that room goes crazy let's try right here man the light [ __ ] right now there we go how's that color looking it looks like [ __ ] when you look at it from the top because the camera can't perceive the light the same way but it's just terpius [ __ ] so and you would think oh the lower temperature you go the lighter it'll be no because it just takes too long to get off the plates and we already tried 200 that was too hot then 190 is is the sweet spot it's the best it's gonna get for uh for this i mean i can go like 155 160 and press like five grams at a time maybe get a different result but i'm not pressing five [ __ ] grams at a time that's not what's gonna happen today i wonder if it would help so this is gonna get real silly if i don't put you guys down soon oh this is between 16 to 22 grams in every one of these bags how did you already know right my man saw the board behind me and added it up already my press is feminine thank you her name is bertha so yes she is feminine it's not the craziest smell actually because i'm not running it too hot but it's like a minty coffee lag oh there's some fat ass chunks in this hmm two more oh my goodness we always gotta get one or two huh you know actually i think that you've been on this channel being done before you are the weakest link bye [Music] [Music] i don't know yet my yield on this run yet because we're in the middle of doing it right now i'm not trying to be a smart ass but open your eyes [Music] how old is the material it was a couple weeks old when it was given to me about two weeks old i want to say sat in the freezer for a couple weeks i don't know if uh what the yield has been i haven't really been weighing anything yet so i'll just wait and see i'll wait and find out at the end and i get a veggie burger with uh grilled onions no tomato with fries with uh spread i mean i put my own beyond meat burger patty on it when i get home still enjoy in and out but do it the vegan way yeah buddy but also whoever did mention edibles for food grade i am going to turn a good portion of my cut into edibles or at least caps really potent caps rosin gaps no i didn't do anything today i'm working working working working working and uh somebody else says one more and then collection and then we're going to stir it all up and get it going on the heat map i'm gonna heat mat it at least overnight i'll show you guys i have no secrets no secrets whatsoever i don't time anything i don't look at the gauge anything if i don't know who you are on the gram or if you don't follow or like somebody i know doesn't follow you then i don't accept you you got to tell me what your name is so that i can go and accept you and maybe maybe if i've seen your name around here enough i'll accept it otherwise you gotta know somebody to know somebody to know somebody to know somebody to know somebody so yeah there i'm gonna start doing a lot more live sessions that are gonna be more interactive i'm gonna set up uh a streaming session in the new hash set so it'll be a good stable connection and we'll be able to have some proper lighting in there our windows uh vented sunlight and we'll be able to have some real good sessions okay so so yo i watched this uh hugh hefner docu-series with my wife and it was actually pretty interesting i didn't know that he was so involved in social issues it was really interesting to see that and how he went against the grain with racism and segregation and he would invite um all these black stars to come onto his show right and he had aretha franklin and um brain farting on the other person and but he had like a bunch of different up and coming artists and he wasn't afraid to have them come and perform at his club because he didn't care he didn't see color he just saw talent and he wanted to make it known what his company stood for and didn't stand for and so he interviewed like he did really really in-depth interviews with a lot of celebrities and at one point he did an in-depth interview with malcolm x and malcolm x was you know saying his typical stuff very radical extremist stuff and mind you majority of the readers of playboy back at this time are white and he published it against the advice of all the other people that were working for and he published it unedited and well not unedited like they edited it but they didn't like edit his answers or change his wording they left it all exactly how he said it you know um and i'm like yo that that's [ __ ] ballsy and he got a lot of support for it actually afterwards and a lot of readers wrote in and said that was awesome thanks for sharing that interview blah blah blah so yeah man that was that was really interesting to watch that and obviously to watch his back and forth with struggling to be um you know married and father and all these different things that he just couldn't [ __ ] do living in the [ __ ] mansion i think any normal man would succumb to that [ __ ] after a while especially after being away from your wife the man was surrounded by titties and ass 24 7. like i think he had so much titties and ass i would get tired of it i would be like [ __ ] put some clothes on like it's not even exciting anymore to see your titties they're just always out like put some clothes on surprise me i want to come around the corner and just be like ah titties surprise it's been three days then i'm gonna be like oh titties but if i see titties every time i walk around the [ __ ] house i'm titties like what like it's like looking at an elbow it's just not gonna matter anymore you know just doesn't [ __ ] matter anymore i don't know how that man stayed excited by i guess maybe there was just so many different kinds of titties i don't know i think i would get over it titty climbing wall bro you know how much i just pictured that [ __ ] on my head like a rock climbing wall but instead of rocks his titties yo oh my god you are creative you are creative that is funny he says my friend has a thing for elbows i mean i'm a classic i'm a classy man i i like exposed shoulders if my wife ever has like a shirt that is like has one of those wide neck collars and you know her shoulder starts to show a little bit i'm like oh that's classy sexy i'm an old man i guess but hey can we get a quick vote while i take this dab a quick vote side boob is 2003 but it's okay quick vote he said yes yo kristoff i wish i knew what you were saying somebody tell me what he's saying titty sprinkles by morgan you know desensitized from titties and ass yeah man i'm telling you bro why you think he needed them pills bro he didn't excite him no more he couldn't do it all right here's my poll thongs or booty shorts drop it in the chat right now that's all i want to know thongs or booty shorts this is going to tell me everything i need to know about every last one of you from here on out i'm deciding your face as a friend or a foe choose wisely how [ __ ] would you guess cheers man cheers i'm going to show you guys how [ __ ] clear this is too here you", "qzeEWxC1UQc": "smoking man growin and watch it fall down [Music] what is up DTC's got it real hanging out super psyched to have a new friend Julian from Bab logic over hey thank you for having me really yes yes hey I appreciate you guys blew it up at the deconcentration celebration yeah yeah yeah no it was a fun time yeah you took home you took home I think was third place in there boys what was this again you brought some with you yeah we can each owns the HT batter it's like really high terpene high potency yeah this is oops this is one to remember right here you brought two of them I like yeah I brought a couple kami I brought a truck Korean or trap cookies and so what's your specialty if you guys were dab logic what are y'all known for um we create high quality you know highly purified high terpene solving with hash oils solvent less overall solvent list so we specialize in ninety micronized soil we also specialize in the different types of bras in all the way from our newest product which is like the HT batter's all the way through like the HT show weight HT what's that mean hide your bathing yeah basically anything you know reaching on the 15% you know mark we consider pretty high tech 15 yeah 15% terpenes just pretty freakin high yeah especially for solving lists you know most concentrates are around six to eight percent on the standard market really a lot even less than that most most standard solvent less concentrates that you'll find on the market are probably about four to five even all right so help me out there help me evaluate concentrates what makes a good concert we're going to the dispensary together what we looking for yeah so when I go in and I look for a good concentrate first thing I do is you know you don't get to smoke the product in the dispensaries know you got to evaluate yeah you have to evaluate it either you know through your nose through sight you know right and then through prior you know prior time smoking either something that like that or but they could think about the colors beautiful on that yeah color colors is that you know is that to live or die by totally a giveaway you know I mean if you're looking at something and it's green or it has like you know a really dark amber to it you know it might be dagger dated it might have had heat stress you know something like that or it could be just the nature of the plant you know something like the truck the truck cookies that's always gonna have at least on the phenotype that's being passed around right a lot of the hash and being created from it right now yes it has that orange you know you cue to it yeah it's almost purple in the hue you know and when you press that and refine it it becomes like this orange almost amber like but that's beautiful orange I got a glowing orange I got no problem yeah yes smoked something that's glowing or it's the earth tones that I have a problem with yeah what does it are that's a sign that chlorophyll it's Asano's beat up too much yeah so when a plants cut if it's cut fresh you know a lot of these plans a lot of people are making fresh frozen and for plants cuts cut fresh it's gonna release Greenleaf volatiles which are different esters Josh aldehydes and you know alcohols that are released by the plant those end up actually soluble eyes in chlorophyll chlorophyll has a few different colors chlorophyll can be anywhere from purple all the way to you know the green that we know about well like purple is that like when plants purple up at the end is that chlorophyll that's so yes there's something to do with the chlorophyll and in the biosynthetic pathway that it actually takes right it's either heated or as it's you know matures or ages but a lot of times that's antioxidants is well produced by the plant such as anthocyanin or something similar to that those antioxidants even have somewhat of a smell to them even they're found in a lot of berries they're found in God and things like that so that's you kind of you know start to realize okay the purple plans have this berry-like or grape-like kind of smell to it it's kind of through that anti oxidant pathway and the enzymes that produce those right so and that's all based on the genetic makeup of the plant I have a very natural next question how the hell did you learn all this stuff man you go to school for this are you just a Googler so there's not much information out there there's a lot of there's a lot of people who are pursuing to find the actual chemistry the actual science behind a lot of this stuff right some of that has been published what has been published you know you can find Ethan Rousseau dr. moosh dr. Musallam alright people like that okay they are pioneering a lot of this stuff and you're just reading their white papers and you read then read their work and then we also you know we work with scientists on our team as well we have a scientist from the University of Boulder who worked in the Caine lab and we're so he's an extra he's a expert in genomics so okay bioinformatics and things like that Wow it's so crazy that in the cannabis company have to have a genomics expert yeah you learn how to hire them I mean yeah it's starting to evolve to the point where now if we want to really you know pursue this we have to understand it more solving this hash is something that's kind of coming back from where it was you know in the past that's all there was there were thousands of years ago if you were to look at you know what cannabis crasher from you know it was charas and you know things on the hands it was the right amount of heat and pressure under pressure that you're able to even remove it from your hand or even able to change the right the chemistry of it because they didn't start smoking it you know it hated to be decarboxylated in order for that to happen it had to be left out in the Sun for a certain amount of time or it had to be heated to a specific temperature for a certain amount of time right you know and through this alchemy that you know has evolved I mean they found plants that were more beneficial for those processes you know that's why what we know of today as the hash varieties come from a very small group of plants because those came out of you know Afghanistan and Grammy Hall and you know places like that that we're actually using hash as a resource for a long time yeah makes sense that's pretty cool I'm just trying to think like everybody's got a different art you know growing can be an art shift photography can be an art what's your what you ought man yeah the art so the art really is involved with just uncovering mechana bees resin you know there's so much there that we don't really know about there's so your the extract artists I don't even know what's your title at that company I don't have one I founded dialogic founder - ice that's a great title because you're gonna have to do anything after what you already did your work no I still I still work with hash you know every day I'm still with the plants and every charge in my fingernail exactly no you just don't think yeah but uh yeah I'm still with the resin every day you know I who I started creating who I created that logic with right was some close friends that also still to this day are are doing different uh different extracts and working with the resin so it's a big industry man yeah so I wait how many people is we just laughing but you came to my studio and saw my work yeah about five guys yeah they all stopped and took a break to take it does take a couple dabs from you totally yeah yeah what's your work scene like what's it like to work at dab logic how many people to start with so I have five people on the the actual extraction team my California team is now expanding I have one guy out there right now but we're in the process of getting expanding that team our lab is just getting the CEO so we're just getting we're just able to move in your building out we had to you know gut the whole place and redo it all for insulation and you guys to talk of something logical you know the whole nine moved in a huge walk-in freezers you know cuz we have to we're taking a lot off you know off these mountains and in Humboldt so yeah can we talk about that for a second just said I was asking about your like I was in Cali for the I don't know can I call it Cali I heard that don't live in California called Cali yeah I mean it's humble it's where it's at right here you know Northern California yeah so you were there we're supposed to hang out last week and you're like dude its I'm out here still harvesting yeah and then I'm like alright so you tell me about what you got a 120,000 square foot indoor there is that right so no no no not that quite that big we got 20,000 square feet makes you like a computer we have hundred acres up off the grid and other 600 acres that's being built built out still isn't fully that 600 acres and fully permitted or license yet I'm not pulling anything off it yet but that's a beautiful property that property goes from the top of a mountain all the way down to the valley there's a river there should be good water oh and I make important water as important mazing water there's huge ponds and the property and streams and so that and that's your your founder that's your baby right there so that I'm partnered with the company Verde Verde natural they're out of they were started here in Denver by guy Chuck and he eventually partnered with who now is the main owner of the company Jeff he has expanded this company you know dramatically he's who took on dialogic and we got and flew it up and I mean you gotta have balls or night ball if you have to know what you're doing to first off do a hundred acres some people have success enough with your 100 acres to do 600 acres yeah yeah service schedule for that has to be amazing totally and I mean you know we don't grow on the whole hundred you know there's a lot that goes into actually running these this big of a farms and you're talking you know huge you know ponds and huge almost irrigation lines that are actually sure culvert it into the into the ground I run a 20 acre bamboo farm yeah yeah purty I was like yeah I was like yeah you need water you need a well you need huge yeah you need a water cleaning system yeah yeah yeah and we're trying to you know be all organic and you know the whole soil all that come on let's get into the growth first off how the hell do you do living I okay I got it you find a place with good soil if you're gonna do living soil on 100 or 600 acres I mean we bring in we do a mixture of local humble Mendocino County dirt and then we bring in some Canadian soil as well yeah yeah that just sound great water that stuff's yeah it's amazing that already is microbial active when it when it gets there you know it already has a nice you know uh humic body to share sure it's not ain't nothing sterile yeah yeah you know if it's and I think they do inoculate that would mycorrhizae don't they I know that they pull out of that out of some plots that they have along the old-growth and that God is definitely as major fungal and bacterial actually seen a peat mine or a peat bog I don't even mind yeah back near uh an old growers to have I Drive by it and it was like whoa what is that thing it's just cutting into the earth yeah I know yeah the pits interesting there that's a finite resource in there you know yeah it is yeah yeah I will say Florida peat not as good as a reason they imported from Canada so that's actually really cool that's alright so as long as we're talking grow how do you give quality and quality outs yeah how do you have first off indoor grows got to be tremendously different than an outdoor grow right yeah completely different different processing then on your end here that your the extract you noticed I mean definitely I was talking to somebody I was talking to it was loving in her eyes yesterday and she was talking about how to be I was asking her how to be a you know a really top quality extract artist she goes get to know your resin I think it was friend she can always that originally said it her for get to know your resin you know everything's different you know your room and your resin is gonna be different absolutely yeah when you move from grow to grow or you're starting a new grow and it's new growers its new people it's a new soil mix it's a new everything sure you know it is scary you know you're coming in with varieties you know it's not like we can really transfer varieties from state to state ads so it's like we're having to find and source varieties in California wait really that we haven't ran yet but I mean you can't or you can't uh so I mean a wedding cake can find its way over an account we have wedding cake we have like all you know I know you would never talk about other people no there is there is ways to definitely get them over they audit and through in through tissue culture and things like that we can actually legally do this stuff if we're sending over callous and undifferentiated cells we can actually send that across state lines and technically it's a gray area sure it's not a cannabis plant so they can't call you out on it you know I'm just sitting here being like oh it's so silly you should be able to smuggle stuff anywhere you want but I think about all I'm from South Florida you've got people from South America and all over the place that are smuggling little plants in because it's tropical these plants from their home they are bringing so many diseases literally Jersey palm decline they have straight-up palm decline there because people are bringing palm seeds and growing palm seeds that were laminated yeah it's a huge deal yeah it's scary I mean you know we truly we want to find varieties that we know are gonna work right but we also want to be able to work with as many things as we can so it's really just finding the lineage and delving into where are these plants coming from can i source plans of that lineage from whoever you know in the area that's mainly what we look into do you have any other growers in your area cannabis or hemp because that would be a freakin nightmare if you had people growing hemp for biomass no it's okay in Humboldt County there is a lot of cannabis growing you know there's tea farm everywhere you look is there pollen I'm in there saying if there's pollen in the air and your she gets pollen there could potentially be pollen there could potentially be molds from other Wright farms and things like that so we have to be very careful you know a with who we let on the property be with you know how we filter and maintain the air quality and our property is this completely outdoor these are greenhouses what are we doing with the the big properties are outdoor they're full season that's just right in the Sun you know exposed to as many you know anything that happens yes there's a greenhouse you see matter space in that even there there will be greenhouses there will be all sorts of stuff that I put on those properties it's still gonna have full Sun and greenhouse or full Sun depending on how you grow depending on you know what varieties you're doing you could have very good full Sun that goes well depending you know how your season is out there really it's seasonal you know you could have a fall that's extremely rainy and damages your whole crop in the six-day period you know you could have a fall season that's sunny amazing and warm and there's no rain in sight all through flower and everything was beautiful she kept your dust down and you maintained your property and you did well enough to be able to like oh yeah I can you know harvest these plants that are gonna be very well do very well for you know some of those extracts yeah I mean you're talking about hmm having some problems you know if the weather is wrong mm-hmm or doesn't cooperate you know that basically catastrophic crop failure totally yeah we're doing all sorts of stuff that we can to mitigate that as the season progresses you know we're watching weather we're watching humidity we're watching as things are moving up the coast and into the mountains it's what you do though well we can prepare you know like if if a heavy rains coming you know that's gonna be very damaging the other show if you if things aren't stake properly your trellis properly not like that it's gonna just destroy your field you know just based on that alone so that's um you can do not even though huge raindrops or hail hitting those bus cream yeah yeah and I mean we we're trying to develop different rain protection systems that we will put up once the plans get more in the flour and it'll just be short little lean-to type frames that basically go over and they'll be big but they're only gonna be able to protect a few of the chosen plans right one it's not gonna be the whole thing you know so we'll start going through the that whole property was done from seed so that is also we're doing Fino hunting there so you need that yeah some special ones over there yes I mean there's we pop 2,000 seeds you know so it's a big female hunt we got the varieties from a guy Jesse his company as bio vortex they do amazing stuff at Humboldt Wow he's in another leaf Trinidad area not actually I think his farm is actually really cool know him I think I have run into him before yeah he's a great guy he I could probably swing it his way too but uh he does so many talks and writing and get a home but sure absolutely in a cannabis and absolutely gonna get your culture you know my beef is with everybody that's that's putting their their lives on the line their livelihoods on the line for cannabis is that in Florida if I were to have you know 600 acres of palm trees and they got a disease or they got wiped out by a hurricane you know what happens I get to buy myself a Mercedes man the government comes in it gives me 50 70 90 percent of what the hell that entire crop was worth and I had a check for three million you know I'm sorry if it's that many acres yeah yeah tens or twenties a million oh yeah I just sold my entire inventory before before it was even mature yeah if we get hit with you know as I guess outdoor cannabis growers there's no catastrophic insurance for us I'm sure there will be once event organization happens but kind of gotta be hard to get people to throw their life savings into you know or I should even say it's just an investor and that's and that's the thing and that's why you know we do what we do you know that logic is like we need the best material we you know that when you're getting something from us it's going to be the best because we can't take some thing that failed you know write anything that failed it's it's it's either has to be compost or its you know if if if it can be you know saved in any way from hydrocarbon extraction but that's you know what's scary about that is right people you know lose a crop or something like that and they pull it to that and it's who knows what mycotoxins heavy metals things like that are contained within that yeah how do you feel about BHO you solvent list newt or what I typically only smoke solving this hash um just because you want to solve this company yeah and I'm you know I'm in the industry I see what happens you know with I do carbon extractions and don't get me wrong there are some amazing right carbon extractions out there and it's important that you know that that side of the industry exists in Georgia they're you know keeping the earth clean and they're you know doing what it takes you know I could see one be one type you know blast rooms and things like that and I think it's fine the exist bad promotion for the cannabis industry for extracts of if they're blowing up with Dirk scanning themselves we don't we don't want that and you know a lot of times people don't know the difference between distillate or solvent lives or something like that you know found someone like us someone like us would know because it's its second nature whatever by now but it's like you know when I talked to somebody from Wisconsin or I talked to someone sharing Oklahoma or Alabama or you know somewhere like it's all good there even people out in California you know northern Northern California you know they're there's so much distillate there's so much hydrocarbon extraction everybody's running to ashes big freakin farms up there okay there's nobody that can press come close to processing that size of farms yet which is you know I mean so it's like look like a factory over there Shh I mean they are a lot of the hydrocarbon facilities around 24/7 and yeah I can take on a thousand pounds a day Jesus mm-hmm Wow what do you think you guys's capacity is gonna be in California I mean you're gonna need to have some see you've got hundreds of acres yeah it's an it's not quite that big in again we're selective for solve unless gotta take the best out of these fields we take only the best so it's it's something that when we're doing and we do about a hundred pounds fresh per per wash is what will got we what we do got um so that only happens two to three times a week typically it's something that takes a lot more effort you know through the whole process it's something that we can't really just throw it in the tube blasts it out throw write purge oven and let it sit for three weeks it's like there's a lot of processing and there's a lot of maintaining and being very careful and being you know quick but also you know taking your time yeah what how do you get the young quality and quality out when it comes to when it comes to you know Roz and I guess how do you get it to where what if you have a problem I guess is what I'm trying to say in the grow yeah soil so it's kind of tough to correct that yeah it's some things off balance if there's you know some something that may have been watered wrong or you know fed improperly yeah that a B word what about bugs bugs I mean bugs are definitely a problem you know if you're if you're dealing with large scale cultivation but you know if you're maintaining cleanliness you're maintaining rigorous integrated pest management systems leaving meaning predatory insects very cool in vegetative state never in flower it's also using you know specific essential oil sprays or oil sprays that could be used in vegetative state never in flower beautiful you know one thing that we do is we make sure that our products aren't sprayed if it's coming to me cannot even come close to being sprayed it can't and that's why if a farmer that's why we have to be so selective that's why we have to grow and we have to inspect product you know even if like our own farmers are out there there they might be doing something to save their own crop so we have to go out there and inspect that and make sure that's either not happening or if it is happening we need to move on and get to the plants that you know or part of the crop or even move through the crop altogether you know and only take you know something from yang on their farm I had tasted and by no means a connoisseur I like extracts don't get me wrong but I'm not a connoisseur and I tasted something that I was like this tastes like sulfur like it looks good he's like sulfur like obey me use the sulfur burner and you know a little bit too late that could be you know there's especially you know if you're an old-school farmer right and you're doing things you're trying to be organic you know you could use a sulfur burn you know but that nowadays most people are aware that that comes through a in the cannabis smoke would be way more in the concentrates you know so but there are varieties you can lineage you know coach lineage that could the diesel lineage that could lean towards like that skunky sulfuric almost type smell got a stir so you know if it's important that know your grower it's important to know you're know where your weeds coming from grow your own most importantly I mean that's why we you know it's why we do what we do is so that we can grow something that you can be certain is going to actually be something that you would drove you ain't smoke you know we don't we would never put something something in our products that you wouldn't I wouldn't personally use myself there's so many people that I just let like b-grade stuff pass through just because they're like oh nobody will know what he can tell showing in extracts it's this or that or it's going to this dispensary they'll buy I've been dispensaries and I'm like oh you buy the shift exactly yeah so it's important for us you know to sharing you know relationship with the growers and maintain the relationship with people that were selling to you know yeah what's up with the dispensaries on the other end because you kind of middleman as far you can't go in and actually rep your product during no I mean some dispensaries allow us to come in and you know frame help market help train route kind of create awareness yeah if you come in you don't know what's sitting on the Shelf right why are you gonna buy it you know well like you got this pen people are in the cartridges it's kind of going away from that you know putting your extract in a pen and having to reload it these things are super low-profile super convenient what's the first off go into a dispensary you know be like hey what kind of good cartridges do you have and sometimes they'll go none don't buy them here they're all mix of propylene glycol and stuff like that what's the secret first just cuz I'm in the cartridges because I'm picked this one up so cuz I'm gonna hit it so something like this out what's the secret to make them something a good cart what's the difference in a good part of a shitty cart this has no cut this has none of the propylene glycol MCT oil any bogus food grade this or that else is 100% from cannabis and it's also and lessly made so it's it's a high terpene extract put into a vape cart is what it is it's not something that somebody made to get rich quick it's yeah this is real hash I remember they made more convenient yes something you could melt your hash into and then you could put it in your vape pens yeah and I mean it's terrible there's a little bit of post-process like you you if you just stick show into a cart it's gonna crystallize it's gonna kind of coagulate and it'll be hard to smoke lawyers you know so creating the proper terpene ratio and things like that is very important you know and that's is that strain dependent or that's very strained dependent with us it's a hundred percent strain depending because we can't really manipulate the terpenes too much or the constant we can somewhat manipulate concentration right can't we can't change what's there you know it's like if what's there is there so we're just kind of working with what we have to kind of make this yeah makes sense if you guys make carts you guys make it what does he cause batters yeah the the carts something we've been doing for the past two years year and a half something to make it more convenient sitting so that also somebody who doesn't have a rig and doesn't typically dab right can actually use our product this is super this never really happened before the vape car it was not quality was yeah yeah so it's like being able to formulate you know the get it from this to that was huge yeah it was the game for us and really has made it so that my mom my grandma my aunts and uncle rate of have able to have been able to try my product whereas before they can I get a really good order yeah even though what it was you know couldn't couldn't even wrap their head around it yeah but we we you know what with most hash makers you know the the goal isn't I need my car nice oil you know a lot of times we're taking now because so many people love the rosin and things like that we're taking our ninety micron pressing that right having specified batches that are ninety might come or 90 120 mixtures sure like that the higher grade microns and that's what's getting some that's more often than not that's what we're pressing now because it's just what people are after and water hash is also good side of the market but it's it probably accounts for twenty twenty percent of the actual solving with sales and those riding the whole grand scheme of things seems to go quick do no otter hash yeah it's expensive yeah you know the high grades there's unless you're doing you know extremely large batches there's not a crazy amount of it you know maybe a couple hundred grams you know something like that so it's something that's very limited something that's not you can't take something low grade and make it into ninety micron ISIL it has to be grown perfectly it has to be done perfectly actually washed perfectly so we presented and given you the consumer perfectly as well you know so we have to keep it maintained you know from start to finish you know a cold environment on it you know we have to make sure the people who are selling our product right the consumer are also keeping in the right environment and then we have to let our consumer know and they have to have the education to be able to know to put this in the fridge or to keep it cold they asked something that maintains that you know environment we have a kegerator and we never use it having a kegerator in the house is actually a bad idea so why I started hiding my dad's in there man they you just don't have enough refrigerators once people know you keep them in the fridge yeah they figure it out me yeah every fridge in the house yeah bad hey we're talking about these cartridges you obviously if you were in for a year and a half ago you were getting in the days you were a little bit ahead of the trend ahead look her how they how do you keep a head into curve and what's coming up next around the next curve for cannabis yeah we're always trying to keep ahead next big curb you know we're looking at I see a lot of people are like pushing for you know really like colored high flavor hi hi flavor profile resins like 710 it's white yeah yep yep so it's really it's shooting for that shooting for the holler proper color high terpene me but also still maintaining you know the right you know potency you know because if you're pulling too early on some of this stuff you're just getting something that tastes like cucumbers and like wait up just doesn't even get you that high it's like if you want something that has the full body flavor like you have to take it to its prime maturity you know we we have to get out of the kind of mentality that ambered trichomes like when it starts to amber that's starting to show my maturity cuz that's like that's already overly matured you know like yes we're trying to pull a little bit before that ever even happens before the first amber trichome happens like the day before that would be the perfect you know yeah I'm just saying and this is I mean cuz you're trying to bring something great to your customer something extraordinary so when they try all of them they like to dab logic that's that's the one I like yeah how educated is the customer did they get it a shopping price do you have to it's just like cmed you're gonna we can educate them on that stuff or they end up buying hemp seed oil for you know eight dollars on Amazon and thinking oh everything is good ya know I mean education is huge most people they don't know the difference between like quality organic solvent list and some low-grade hydrocarbon I straight up they don't eighteen dollar shadow yeah and with CRC tech like the color mediation for like hydrocarbons and things like that I heard something about what the hell is color remediation they're pulling chlorophyll and you know oxidants out of out of the hash you know which is great because that leads to a higher grade hash but it's also like discern or both from like something that is high grade you know it's like okay this this just is high grade because I grew it right I maintain it I took care of it I processed it right you know this came from any run of a mill place with who-knows-who doing them whatever and it's coming out looking the same you know that's the that's the thing yeah plastic surgeries you know a couple yeah so it's gonna be then you know now going back through the customer finding you know the nose the trained eye things like that being able to actually understand what what you're getting you know yeah and that's hard you know if we're we're still in the phases of trying to teach people what good genetics are you know and you more if they're not even understanding the Terp why those genetics are good the terpenes that they're producing the cannabinoid profiles that they're producing them we're gonna be like then they're gonna just be sitting there clueless when anybody can call anything whatever they were you know I mean most of the country thinks independence atiba there's two varieties of cannabis one gets you up let me get you down exactly yeah and it's who's that well who's your I've heard I was actually at the dispensary one time it must be right after Social Security checks were issued hmm to what everybody was 55 60 years old so you know I mean they were older yeah I was just kind of wondering like where the growth is I actually was talking to somebody and they were telling me look the people that are smoking weed are already smoking weed you know what we're really after now is the people that aren't smoking weed the other 85% of population we're looking for you guys say you know ever think in that that way or is that why you got stuff like these pens yeah they really make it I think what the vape is designed for its to give it to anyone who can basically take a hit you know if you can take a hit you can try this pen there isn't even a button on it right it's magnetic it's just you know it just slides right in yeah it's so easy to use it's nothing like heating up a nail and take your day about measuring a dose all that kind of stuff this you just measure with the pup knows how hard you're drawing you know so it's it's per a buddy of mine called me I've been talking about this guy because I feel terrible about it a guy knew back in Florida had a stroke and you just case just told me he goes my body's hanging off me you know it's my hair and my leg of my arm and he's like it starts hurting and I was met recommended that he grabbed one of these pens and check him out it's not a cannabis user and magically he got one and he's like dude I like it and it's really cool cuz in the beginning you could take like a couple of one hit and you're like wow yeah I have a friend that has psoriatic arthritis shoutout to Paul and yeah it's really bad man where sometimes he just can't move his hands and it sucks cuz he's uh has like a technical job as well he will take one hit of the right strain and he just goes like immediately he goes I'm all better I'm all better mm-hmm David it's amazing and I was absolutely I don't know if you got any medical cannabis stories or not I mean like that is so inspirational to me totally my yellow rooftops you know my grandma actually has went through cancer twice she has you know used cannabis to help her right through different chemo treatments and things like that she's fully off chemo now and she's only using cannabis and CBD you try to help and you know so that's kind of where she's at sure the whole world would change their mind on cannabis if somebody handed them a joint when they had a stomachache okay know what I mean that's all they would have to do is when he had a snowman somebody joint they got I instantly feel better I can actually empathize with the psoriatic arthritis guy cuz think about having a horrible stomach game taking one hit of weed and being like I can get up off the floor I can get out of bed you know terrible state your intestines I've never been ashamed of cannabis always been me Oh doing what I can to let people know that this legit shouldn't be considered deal with all the other drugs while the other armful drugs know it's a medicine I agree 100% yeah and that's kind of what we do - it's a logic is the reason we're organic the reason we choose solvent less is because we want to give you the purest truest medicine you know we don't want anything getting in the way between you and nature in this plant you know we're just presenting you with as close as you can get to it you know so it's it's then up to you you know to use this medicine however you choose you know whether it's dope and your consciousness or whether it's to heal your ailments or just a plain old you know relax you know like all of those things are so important you know to de-stress and to unwind like it's part of why we all use cannabis and it's so so important you know and that's why I think cannabis users as a whole have that mentality in that mindset of for lack of a better word we're chill you know sure it affects you I think I think it affects your brain you smoke enough weed it shows you out of it that's actually a generalization know some crazy [ __ ] just smoke weed all day they're not the least bit chill oh well yeah no I mean thinking of one that was a pink shirt you know just knows how much weed they use but let me ask you a question so we're talking about the expansion we're talking - everyone should smoke weed all right they everyone should consider it a medicine anyhow so do you want federal legalization that's a super double-edged sword they're super sharp one I mean I don't look at medicine as pharmaceutical in any way you know I hate do it yeah they do they do they think you know put it into a pill or make it something that's completely controllable something that we can maintain and control reacts down to the milligrams same way oxycontin is a molecule that they can control exactly you know and by doing that they take away the whole plan the full spectrum you know aspect of it and using THC on its own I mean all the studies show that it's way way way less beneficial than using in conjunction with Kurt beanies and other cannabinoids that are found actually within those plants so no to federal legalization just cuz just gonna commoditize I mean federal legalization I think will be the last thing that happens what I think will end up happening is states will end up partnering with one another we'll be like we'll see California Oregon Washington State interstate they'll partner what's going in there yeah all of a sudden you know it'll open up other other avenues for other states and it'll be able to follow a trail through our country one way or another you know and as long as that money files which follows a trail the federal government somehow will probably be ok yeah exactly I mean it's everybody knew it was coming you know it was like the Jack Herer initiative of 2012 it was his whole thing you know it's prophecy it's good there's no way you're super you can't win an election by saying that you're against cannabis there's no way yeah once cuz we've been fighting for so long brother kids yelling it yeah I love it I love it worriers boom and we're back and magically we're taking - yo so where can people get this stuff anyway so you can grab it at vert and verts and Fort Collins if you're in this area otherwise if you're in Denver you can always get it at Verde if you're in Boulder you can get it at Verde nice that Verde carries the largest selection of dialogic products overall so deal deal I appreciate it man yeah there you go there you go thanks for bringing such thanks for bringing samples absolutely it is gorgeous this is absolutely growing always glad to be over there [Music] [Music] [Music]", "-1nK1EiqXU0": "man the new york giants we are going to be expecting the new york giants to make a lot of moves to try and help out daniel jones but bit but here's the thing we already got rumors that that that they're trying to go after kenny gallaudet but this one holy crap i say the future would i say daniel jones's future could be bright at this rate i mean seriously we now get word new york giants are signing long minnesota former minnesota vikings tight end kyle rudolph yep kyle rudolph leaves minnesota for the big apple man and it's gonna be one hell of a season it's a two-year 16 million dollar deal now that's what i call crazy i mean what's this gonna mean for evan ingram could he get released could he get traded i don't even know what the heck is going on yeah but yeah yeah the new york giants they got their they gave daniel jones the tight end that that really helped the minnesota vikings out over the years and i real and i must say it was a great effort but the ques but the question is will kyle rudolph be better with daniel jones than like he did with all the other vikings cubies guess we'll have to find out won't we guess we will find out welcome to the big apple kyle rudolph anyway see when i bring even more breaking news", "zVQruAIpxWk": "[Music] welcome to wheat entertainment and we love talking about grandy flora strains and this bud is something called yada da and it's really a unique looking bud but it was crunchy dry when i got it i opened up this bag and then i set it down and now it's even drier because i think i got this thing i don't know three weeks ago a month ago it just sat in the back i don't know why i didn't review it but i didn't do it so today's the day for yada da and let me load my little scooper into vapor cup straw i've already got two in here we're gonna add the third then we're gonna tamper and we're going to stick this down in the vapor cup then we're going to talk about yadda da yada comes in this bag and i got this at cookies maywood i got this at the apples and bananas drop down there i ran down there they held that for me and there were some comments on wheat entertainment so i grabbed it when i was down there and this flower has 26 thc and people are asking for the package date and uh so i'm going to give it that but to get that date i need a magnifying glass because my eyes aren't so good anymore so this is the package manufactured it is 9 29 20. oh no wonder it's so dry it's been in this bag for months right and you know what's crazy you would think that they're saving money on the jars right so at least they would give us some kind of moisture pack in here so these flowers when they come out of this bag are more fresh so let's say i got this the beginning january was harvested three months before crazy just crazy but anyway it's not about the dryness i don't wait for that so even though i note it that has nothing to do with my ratings my ratings are all about the something something and everyone's got their own something something that they're looking for but what i'm looking for are heavy flowers with focus that could grin me out i have to stay active i have a lot of responsibilities have to take care of i need flowers that can let me do that now i'm also a heavy hitter so a lot of the flowers even though i call them focus flowers they could stone you to the bone but it doesn't necessarily do that for me but certain ones do like the couch lock flowers but this isn't about catch lock i'm not looking for those type of flies this is about focused flowers that can grin me out so today it's jan dada turn to get the review we're looking for the best well let's check it out so you can see that's about amount a time it takes for vapor cup to work you can see that right there that's the terpenes the cannabinoids the water vapor and the oil vapor you can see it condenses right on the straw it takes about a minute and 20 once this cup is hot and also a lot of people have vapor cup so make sure your cup is hot if the cup is hot you need less time in the chamber if it's a fresh you just start it up you're going to need more time in the chamber and that's one of the things when you get vapor cup you got to learn use but i love this thing this thing changed my life but today it's about yada da so let's check it out yada da by grandiflora at 330 degrees out of vapor cup let's do this again so this flower's got a light og taste with a pungent pal but there's much bigger pungent pals than this one but it has it and the pungent pal it's i'm gonna say it's something like the chicken wing you know when you go buy chicken wings you smell it it makes you kind of like the ammonia taste people say ammonia but if you try vapor cup i'm going to tell you it's a pungent pal this flower took me a lot of flour to get stoned actually but it definitely got me stoned this flower's strong enough but not super strong and i thought it was good so what did i rate yada da i'm looking for the best and this flower you know at first i'm saying it's not strong enough but i used a really lot of it i used up half an eighth on the session i mean i really used a lot of it and in the end the feeling was actually kind of good it wasn't heavy it wasn't you had focus or didn't have focus i would say it was like a cruiser a little bit i wish it personally would have been a little heavier this flower gets an 8.65 which means it's a good flower if you're not a super heavyweight yeah it's a try but for someone who's a super heavyweight this flower may be not strong enough for them it was good but there's definitely better out of granny flora if you want to get a vapor cup this item right here and i'm telling you instead of smoking your flour up and joints get one of these things that little bit of flour that i put into this cup can last you 10 minutes and stone you to the bone i love this thing makes so many opportunities for use i love it and you can see it at vaporcup.com if you want to see my favorite picks you can see them on wheat entertainment.com that site's just getting updated right now it's going to have my top 100 strains in la
