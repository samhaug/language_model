using a ceramic made cartridge and a cotton wick baked cartridge [Music] alright guys so when you have your 510 threaded cartridges this guy or this guy you're gonna have two types one of them is going to be a cotton whip like this and one of them will be a ceramic heating element like this guy well they both have their advantages and disadvantages if you're trying to do a lower voltage meaning the lower power setting you want to go with the cotton cartridge they can't handle such a high voltage from the battery which would mean you know if you know especially if you have one of the ones that are adjustable where you can turn it up or down you're gonna want to keep at a minimal setting because if you put too much power into one of these guys you risk burning it out early or you know you could turn your juice dark and black because it just stresses the heating element out too much now with our other guy these ceramic these are gonna be a little more up to date where you're gonna be able to run them at a higher setting not super high but with the spinner batteries or the adjustable voltage batteries you'll definitely be able to turn it up a little higher and will give you a little more of a kick with your v the way you can tell the difference is if you look inside the barrel of this one the cotton one you can see a little cotton poking out at the top of it as opposed to the ceramic where you have kind of a cage sitting down on it onto it and you'll have some wick holes where you'll see where the juice will flow in both of them are gonna be 510 threaded and both are gonna be acceptable for batteries like this so you know again just to make sure if you're adjusting you're gonna want to have a ceramic type that'll let you turn your battery up a little higher we recommend a voltage no real higher than about 4 volts that should be the highest you go if he's something a little higher but take it bit by bit and then if you're using a traditional cotton cartridge that's gonna want to stay at a minimum about 3.7 volts you don't really want to turn it up much higher than that and obviously the question too is well what if my battery doesn't adjust well then you're fine for both you know that's going to run at a lower setting that'll be acceptable for both types so if you liked the video give us a like subscribe and if you want any of these products

for the truck with a 10 inch wicked customs lift we actually got a couple plans we're gonna get rid of these bumpers soon painting some stuff but let's go ahead and get in the review of the truck so we've had this truck for every year and a half now or so this is a 2015 Super Duty 6.7 long bed singer world wheel base with a 10-inch wicked Kustoms lift we bought the lift from Florida they shipped it to Houston all-out off-road performance waiting head to did the lift force it's a custom silver powder coat with cortes steel to match you can see that we have the Ranch Hand bumpers on here that we've had for a while since we bought the truck but we are getting rid of those soon you know going to get new bumpers and they're gonna be hopefully painted to match we have decided yet but that is to come by this 10 inch lift has literally raised the truck so much I did not expect it to be this tall to be honest but you can see we got the traction bars here the four links it is absolutely a beast it rides smooth I can't think waked Kustoms enough for building a durable durable lift you see here we got the core test tool Springs with the wicked Kustoms logo on top of them we also have the wicked shocks here which is heck of a ride on those things I love them so you can see here we have the four links and we decided to go with the four link because the 8 inch did not come with the 4 link so that's why we did go with the 10 inch originally we did one a 8 inch but the 4 links looked a lot better here you can see the big traction bars it's called the Goliath lifts with the way these bars are made and you can also see the leaf springs teal and silver we also have the rear axle painted black you can also see that we have the teal blocks now the front axles are black as well with the steering stabilizers up front with the wicked shocks and you can see the wicked chassis mount and the bars that are teal just really comes together we went with a 24 by 14 American Force 74 octane wheels they're silver for now but we will be getting those powder-coated but also wrapped with 38 inch trail grappler from neato tires overall this truck came out amazing and I cannot wait for the extra parts that we have this ride thank you all for joining us and hope to see you all in the next vlog he's at home easy all be safe", "0V9NRRk0FQA": "hi I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we're going to be talking about the fastest booming trend which is concealer vaporizers for cartridges so let's say you're on the market for a new concealer first of all I hope you stop by vape honey stay calm to check out our selection because this is something we've really been working on and making sure that we innovate but you're on the market you want to know what the differences are what the categories are and certain things that you can go through or buy to make sure that you made the right decision for the cartridges that you like to purchase so today we're going to take an in-depth tour and talk about the differences between our concealers to make sure that when you buy you buy the perfect concealer okay so there's two general categories to these concealers you have ones that have the cartridge exposed and ones that have the cartridge is completely hidden okay these are kind of a way that we like to separate the vaporizers and then there's differences in between them as well so let's start off with the ones that keep the cartridges concealed so you cannot see them now most of them that on the mark and all of ours are powered by magnet adapters so you can simply pull the cartridge out and you have a magnet adapter now why would somebody want a concealer like this well first of all it looks cool second of all it keeps your cartridge completely hidden for discretion and it also protects it from anything hitting it or possibly breaking it and they fit and sit up right in the pockets they're very very sleek in size so that they will easily fit into you know the small pockets for women's purses and the small pockets you know the upper pockets on your jeans like so it stays completely head so first thing for people is size I want to show you guys this is our beekeeper model this is our latest elf model and this is our phantom model so everybody knows what a sip we're not promoting combustion here guys we are vape company but just to show you how size pairs up everybody knows what a standard sized Bic lighter with the size is so to take our beekeeper for example they're actually very close in terms of width as well as height for the body now we move on to our elf and then last our phantom so let's start off with our first model the beekeeper the beekeeper is a very good unit it was actually our first model that we launched in this concealer category and it has been our historical best seller it comes with a magnet adapter simply drop in the cartridges and it actually has a push button operation so you would push and hold this button throughout the time that you inhale and you also click it five times on five times off this unit produces about 20 watts of power and it also has a a 300 milli amp hour battery so it's gonna last longer than the standard batteries and it's also give you more consistent power it has a micro USB charge also that you can just plug right into the side port right there and then when you get a new cartridge you can just take the Magna DAP tur which if you lose it try not to lose it you can purchase more online you just screw it onto your cartridge and you drop it in so then once you hear a click and your unit is on your rate of vape so well we get from a lot of people is that there's a variety of cartridges that are on the market and some of them are wider than others so some people are concerned to order a concealer unit before you know when they have their cartridge to make sure it's gonna fit so what we're gonna do here is we're going to measure the openings so that you know how wide our concealers are before you make the order so let's start off with the opening of beaky so in millimeters this is exactly a 10 millimeter opening so if your cartridges are wider than 10 millimeters in diameter they will be too wide to use for the beekeeper now let's move on to the elf we just launched this unit a couple weeks ago it's something that we're really excited about it's available in five colors give you a brief little look the only one missing from our display is the white one which we do have available what makes itself unique is that it's not only a little bit smaller than the beekeeper it has a little bit more capacity so it has 350 milliamp hours so the battery's gonna last a hair longer it has a really nice texture to it I would compare it to if anybody has ever had a like an iPod Nano it has this very um the this this kind of grippy thick metal you just feel the quality when it's in your hand you know completely solid unit what makes it unique is that it is completely buttonless so it's Auto draw so people who really you know have been holding on to those pull through batteries this is the evolution the next step and the way that the technology is is you are just gonna get effortless draws on this vaporizer it is gonna be much smoother much more powerful and it's gonna fit a larger variety of cartridges that those auto draw batteries cannot fire now the kick comes already with a glass really high performance ceramic cartridge with a ceramic mouthpiece so if you are not buying prefilled tanks and actually filling them then this is like an awesome tank to get started with and all you do to get this thing fired up is its there's no clicking anything you just put your Magna adapter onto your cartridge drop it in and inhale and you will see it light up very smooth very good unit charge with a microUSB and again it's a little bit smaller which brings us to our ultra premium unit which is the Phantom the Phantom is not only for cartridges it actually comes with a wax concentrates adapter which is dual quartz it is our largest unit in terms of size comparison but it also has a thousand milliamp hour batteries so it's gonna laugh last about two and a half times what all the other concealers do now one unique function that this unit has is when you flip it open it has a squeeze action trigger so you just squeeze it to inhale and it also has four different temperatures that allows you to dial in to what intensity and flavor you really prefer and it ranges from 3.4 all the way to 4 volts it has a advanced preheat function and the unit also comes with two magnets a longer one as well as a shorter one so all different sizes of cartridges you can have the perfect magnet for it so your mouthpiece collar will sit flush and you will keep your cartridge completely concealed now what the beekeeper and elf do have in common is they both have windows so you don't have to excavate your cartridge to see what level it's at but they do do a good job of keeping it concealed so that is really a rundown of these cartridges now let's get into the width testing for these two these we've made slightly bigger as the cartridges have gotten bigger it is a hair under 11 millimeters we're getting 10.9 so most cartridges are labeled 11 millimeters are actually a hair under 10 point 9 so this will fit a standard 11 millimeter cartridges which actually does fit into the wider category now let's check out the phantom the Phantom has a slightly skinnier opening than the elf and it comes in at ten point eight five millimeters so that will give you a good idea if you already have a cartridge that you are buying prescribed to to make sure that the unit that you get will fit so to recap the beekeeper has a ten millimeter opening the elf has an 11 millimeter opening and the phantom has a ten point eight millimeter opening that will drop cartridges in but let's say you have an extremely wide cartridge what do you do well that brings us to our second category of concealers which is found in our mini max line you can check out a really cool in depth review done by a high-rise on our mini max to show you just how powerful it is which is our smart tip key fob vaporizer it's very light and with this line what we want to do is make them very light concealable and make sure that these units fit onto your keychain this these units both have 500 milliamp powered batteries the difference is this one has a variable voltage which is our minimax Pro and this one is a single voltage but it automatically adjusts to whatever cartridge you put on it it has a smart chip in it this unit the minimax Pro has three different voltage settings with a maximum output of four volts the minimax what you would do is when you purchase your cartridge it could be as wide as you want all you do is you take it and you screw it into the 510 threaded opening and it's similar to a standard battery but it is a little bit smaller much lighter and you have a charging port right here so the cartridge is exposed when you have a cartridge on it however it is a device that is designed to look like a key fob or a clicker which does make it discrete when you don't have the cartridge attached to it then we have our minimax Pro which looks a lot like a key fob and it even has a deluxe keyring holder there and a micro USB but what's cool about is you don't see the cartridge because it's actually folded in there and then you push this button at the top to flip it open and what we did is just to show this flip open as we use one of the widest cartridges on the market which is a Liberty variable air flow model and it actually does fit in here so this will fit cartridges and we'll check the size of this opening right here this will fit 11.6 millimeter cartridges so the mini max pro and the mini max if you're buying extremely wide cartridges are your best bets to making sure that your vape pen is gonna deliver power concealability and stealth-like options if they're very wide if you buy skinnier cartridges or are filling your own cartridges we went through these features and on our channel at vapor store direct on youtube we have in-depth detailed reviews unboxings and feature comparisons on the individual items so I suggest you check them out so if you're on the market for the

more turk in his uh almost a rammer and his uh dirty max over here so today you guys remember michael's uh dirty max it is a 17 l5p and today he is doing the uh eye dashes we're doing three he got three eye dashes and he got the derringer so we're going to right now uh scan the directions okay to give that to michael there you go michael or skin on your phone just go to that website and um we're gonna do start this install right here because well michael wants to pump some more uh ponies in his puppy and he wants to keep it you know um somewhat legal so it's stock exhaust this thing is bone stock he does not have anything done to it besides you know some rims and tires other than that stock oh and we are putting uh michael's new race radio in here because he right now has a handheld and the problem that we're having with the handheld is when we sort of get far or we're going up the grades or we go around the mountain the handheld sort of dies he can hear me but i can't hear him and well my radio puts out 75 watts and the little handheld's put up five watts so there's your problem so once we he's got michael has picked up the yaesu ft 2980 this is an 80 watt radio and this thing is awesome i'm probably going to switch and put one of these in my trucks too but we're going to do that install also for you guys today but a big shout out to banks for uh sending the derringer and the eye dashes and no guys is not sponsored michael had to pay for this full pop yeah this is not uh you guys are all your banks banks banks uh no guys we're banks because i like banks because they're true tested i know the product works they've been around for a while they're not new you know i'm comfortable with them yeah he had banks on his own way he still has i mean it's awesome so uh we are just going with banks because uh you know we know they're true tested and they work so let's get this install uh going here we'll uh get under the hood yeah we gotta get the heaters going over here it's a little nipplish what happened banks doesn't do anything for powerstroke uh i don't think commons and duramax that's totally too different no they're starting you know what i don't know they might be a lot of you guys for asking for the comments and the ford i'm not sure the best thing is call banks guys i know they are working on the uh cummins i believe the derringer for the cummins so you guys will be able to do it and i will say and i will admit these freaking l5ps haul but actually excuse my language they haul and um yeah this is going to be the first time me driving it i mean i don't really want to test it out in the rain we got some rain in california what the hell that's all that's about but um my dad's as you guys know is a 10 speed this will be the first time me trying to derringer with a six speed so and these things are fast as is so uh let's get this install going okay guys so where the derringer is going to plug in is right here one sensor there and one sensor here it's very simple all you're doing is unplugging the factory sensors and plugging banks sensors in in place of that and then you're plugging the bank sensors into the oem sensors which i know sounds confusing but you can't mess it up because they got male and female on here so you can't really you know plug one into the wrong one this is a i want to say 16 pin and that's only a eight pin or four pin connector so you can't really do that now you can route it whatever way you want in the directions they want you to ride it coming through here i personally like to ride it in the firewall tuck it in there so you can't see it uh it just looks a lot cleaner and see we're gonna tuck all of this in here go on here and then we're gonna this is all just extra and we're gonna we're gonna unplug this and reroute it under here and then i will put the derringer this part just zip tie it somewhere here right on the firewall and that one when you open the hood you don't see any wiring or anything coming through here and then this right here is for michael's radio so we're going to uh put this right to the battery this is just some wire loom you can pick up you know anywhere you can get this stuff we're going to put this right to the battery mount this here and then we just ran it right into here and then here's right here this is the one for the radio now this is going to be for the uh banks i dash uh the problem is we did not michael's paint did not come in in time so all of these come uh black we did get some paint you can see right over here but it does not match and does not um look too well so i just finally we got the color code to make it perfect because i don't really know what color that interior is i don't know it looks like gray looks blue looks i don't know what color you guys want to call that but uh it didn't match so we're gonna repaint that so for now we're only going to do one eye dash until that paint comes in and we can redo it but at least the derringer will be set up done and complete okay guys so our luck michael just made it found some paint this looks almost identical to that inside so we're going to uh uh let this thing paint it let it dry put a couple more coats on it and once we can actually grab it uh we're going to match up but this looks pretty pretty damn close than this color right here we thought it was gonna be this like camo color it's not so i think i think this is it but we're gonna stay tuned and find out but derringer is done and installed so now michael is trying to figure out where to put his radio so this this radio is a big radio yeah this is a big big radio uh i'm not sure where we're gonna mount this bad boy right here there it is guys check it out look at that that color is literally a perfect match i'll show you the uh the can what we got with match perfect but that's it those are all let me turn the light down and now michael is going to set him how he wants uh each eye dash up he can change how many gauges he wants and up to i believe four to five pages on here and he can set the derringer now on here um what he what level he wants one through you know six i believe there is so this is all done i gotta say it looks good uh and how we ran it and this is how they want in the directions is running through the door uh that's how they say that's how i ran it you know on my dad's truck and the directions just says come through the door not through there so i don't know it's been like this um you know it's up to you guys michael just said yeah run it through the door my truck personally i would go through the firewall in here so there's nothing uh coming in the door but he just wanted like that so on my truck his decision and then this we're going to take wrap this under here and this is going to plug right into here for michael's uh radio he wants to put his radio right here okay truck is complete guys okay we gotta adjust to see michael over here uh like sits in the back seat over here okay all right um you could tell and i'll show you the spray can the color is like dead on so what we have we've set up for michael's boost top one we got vane position of the uh turbo the gear what gear it's in so you'll see if i put it into drive uh we got this door open that tells me close this up and that little lock tells you if the torque converter is locked unlocked vane position now you can see has moved up to 89 loads 15 manifold air density i like that because that will be able to tell me if the is really working so if we go to the stock level here right here this manifold air density at full wide open throttle call it 200 and if i go to level six that manifold air density should go higher 250 to 20 uh 270 whatever it is it should go higher letting you know that okay it's true you're making more power now we have the egt's we have the inlet air temp what's coming in we have the coolant temperature rail pressure and fuel rail commanded pressure and then we have this def fluid level oops and we're trying to get a percentage not okay uh we're trying to get the soot load it's 32 percent regen's off and we are in stock mode right now and guys you got to remember one thing so this system it's not like you're getting massive crazy horsepower you're only getting i think i want to say 60 or 70 horsepower on level six it's not a huge you know jump this if you guys want a 50-state legal tune that is conserved you know conservative and is not going to void your warranty yeah like void warranty and give you 200 horsepower and destroy your transmission then the banks derringer is the way to go and if you're wondering guys the paint this is it what is it called uh the color turn it turn it turn it turn it turn it keep turning keep turning it nothing doesn't say it's like a medium gray i think i have a number i want to say satin stone gray okay all right good enough okay guys so i wanted to show it to you completed what it looks like in the daytime and check this thing out guys this thing is awesome all right bam and look at that that color is literally dead on so all of this stuff now guys you can get from banks all that michael purchased this from banks all the eye dashes from banks the derringer everything he did not get outsourced or anywhere mine on my ram i had to get mine uh i forgot website i put in a link but i had to modify it so it's a kind of a pain if you guys got a 17 through 19 um duramax this is gonna work perfectly for you you do not have to you know modify or do anything now one thing i'm curious on just for my own knowledge because i've never had a truck any of these trucks with death mine always happen to i don't know go missing i'm not sure but i've always want to know when the regen starts so you see here we set up the regen right now it's currently off and the dpf suit load percentage now i have heard when these things get to 68 of soot load they start the regen so it's at 67 so i told michael keep an eye on this and let me know um you know when this actually starts to regen and if it regions while you're driving while you're idling just keep an eye out on this just for our own knowledge to see but there you have it guys for that install it's a very very simple install if you guys need any help or have any questions you can dm me at my instagram at eddie's life and i'll try to help you guys but i mean like you saw in the video it's literally plug and play you can't mess it up it's only one way it's simple but thank you guys for watching this video that's all i got for you guys if you guys like this video don't forget to hit that thumbs up button or click subscribe peace [Music]", "dOvM6_RhADY": "[Music] good morning everybody and welcome to hammer down motorsports it is a beautiful day in las vegas and we're gonna go early to seem us so we can get there before everybody's crowded around the cars and we can't even see them so we're upright and early let's go get it done [Music] [Applause] so we're in 7-eleven and yes you can gamble at 7-eleven [Music] it's one of the greatest things about the SEMA show is the fact that they have manufacturers here having cars that we can go around on the track and they just beep Living Daylights on these things and you have to go for a ride along so we're gonna be definitely doing that today this is actually the place where they're doing the BMW drifting and continental tires here putting tires on these cars several times a day because they're burning off so quickly so we're gonna definitely take you guys on for a few rides today and it's gonna be awesome so here at the SEMA show what comes before breakfast hot lap in a Corvette [Music] [Music] there you go I try my best to keep the camera straight but yeah that was not happening right yeah big carbon brakes on the park it's a good time though it's short but sweet absolutely thank you very much so I know I got a few mixed reviews about the louvers on the car and actually as time goes on I start getting more and more positive feedback about it which is great because I absolutely love them so if you're looking for a set of louvers there is another option available American Authority actually is selling a little bit more of a rigid set rather than the icon Motorsports ones that I have so they're probably not gonna have as many problems with the rattling and stuff that I've encountered during my ownership for the louvers so I might have to try out an American authority set and just see if there's a big difference between the two [Music] I've notice that there's a minute for sale sign on a couple of these cars and it's pretty tempting but I think I have to just rely on the excuse I don't have enough garage space as it is [Music] [Music] now aside from the ford factor this is a rough truck I mean this thing is something that you can take out use the whole package box line you've got tool boxes this is a real truck I really really liked what they did with this one [Music] so if you think I'm gonna come into the SEMA show definitely wear good shoes and be prepared to walk for miles and miles because this place is absolutely massive but if you're looking for new products or you just try to see what's out there for the new products for this year for the automotive industry this is definitely the place to be so out of all the things that I saw today that I was not expecting to see Leroy jr. here but he's here [Music] [Music] so we've got Eric Hoffman here today and the line actually goes this booth so we're gonna be here a little while but I think it's gonna be worth it see you here hey what's going on how are you nice to meet you yeah likewise yeah you actually inspired me to do a BMW bill winter bill 5-series yeah yeah so how long you don't get how we just bought the car we're just getting all kinds of yeah is 8:36 will or different morning it's a 5:30 or 5:20 a big bigger car yeah good yeah we're gonna yeah exactly forget it together Semyon pictures dmu picture absolutely I'll have to see I appreciate it man pleasure to meet ya yes sir we'll see ya so there you have it everybody Aaron Kaufman super awesome guy nice got a meet and everything and he actually stayed back like 15 20 minutes beyond the time that he would have been signing stuff so he's definitely there for his fans and I can't wait to see what's next for him [Music] [Music] I think we're gonna have to go do that here we go welcome to the condo tire extreme experience you signed a waiver right [Music] [Music] aides are doing the Camaro now right yes a very good sign ever see another question does anybody get out of these cars without a smile on their face note that along it's doing it for Johan [Music] hashtag do de fer Johan [Applause] [Music] next part for the Camaro [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so Mustang cop car you might you could think of a thousand different things to say after seeing that first they would have to be able to catch you if you had a Camaro and second of all it should probably say crowd control on it because that makes a lot more sense [Applause] [Music] [Music] this is a beauty about a Camaro as you can fit people in the back you have to possibly without cutting his legs off but we're not gonna rule it out just yet yeah gas newsdesk oh oh he still is liked [Music] what do I fit hahaha that is the question well the knees are definitely touching the - do I have any room to go back no Jeff I'll tell her you wait till you started screaming okay now we're good [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] well everybody that's going to end our coverage of the 2017 SEMA Show in Las Vegas I hope you guys enjoyed the footage if you did don't forget to give it a big thumbs up if you're new to the channel hit that subscribe button keep that hammer down [Music] you", "lH-RrjtiC8M": "hey everybody today's video is going to be all about section 1.8 of Luke's guide we're going to talk about east steps and flow rate tuning my name is Jim I'm a little broken but this is the edge of tech [Music] like I said today we're going to go through the e steps and changing the flow rate in Luke's guide he describes the East step as how many times the stepper motor on the extruder has to advance to push out 100 millimeters of filament that's what we're here today to figure out and I'm gonna show you a formula on how to fix it there are two different ways we can do this first the free air method and that's what Luke prefers himself we're gonna focus on that one today the second one is the through the hot end method which most of us have seen other videos on already so today we're gonna focus on the free air method and we're gonna do it right now let's go okay for step one what we're gonna want to do is go ahead and remove the Bowden coupler and the Bowden tube from the extruder so I'm just gonna take the wrench that came with the kit I'm gonna put it on there carefully one-handed and get it a little loose and then it should just screw right out just like that and you should be able to hang it right there so the next step is to go ahead and push the filament through the extruder and then flush cut the face which is right here the face of the filament so I had my wife help she pushed this up through because I can't grab the extruder very well so she pushed it up through so what I'm gonna do is go ahead and grab my flush cut there we go and flush it just like that and that's your step two so next on the list is to go ahead and heat up your hot end because you cannot extrude any filament without the hot end being heated up even with the free air method so we're gonna go to touch our button here go to control go down to temperature go to nozzle and then heat that up I'm gonna stop it in at 200 degrees Celsius right around there just like that now your hot end is heating up and we'll move on alright so now that the hot end is heated up you can see it's 200 degrees Celsius the first thing we need to do is go ahead and Auto home so we're gonna click the button go to prepare and then select Auto home so it's gonna bring itself to home in my case I have a BL touch so it's gonna go to the center of the bed and probe in most cases if this is a stock machine in under three it's gonna go to the front left of the bed and hang out there so then what you gonna want to do is click the button go to prepare go to move access go down to extruder and scroll down to one millimeter so what that's going to do no matter what number this is is you're gonna add a hundred to whatever number so mine is at 203 right now let's go ahead and bring it up to 303 don't go past it and then click that button so at this point your extruder will start pushing out filament and I'll show you that now so you can see the extruder is pushing out filament now it is gonna be pretty slow when you do it like this so go ahead and use your patience it'll take a couple minutes to get all 100 millimeters out but it's going slowly but surely and I'm using red yes so you can see it but because it's almost Valentine's Day as well okay so once the filament stops extruding as you can see here go ahead and take your flush cuts again and cut it just like you did the first one alright so the next step is to go ahead and measure the piece that you cut now I did this three times just to double-check mine but as you can see here it's kind of hard to read but I get about ninety three point four five millimeters and I got ninety three something every time I measured so we should be good by using the 93 number so the next step is to go ahead and find our new Estep so we know that we told it - we told it to extrude 100 millimeters and we know that we got 93 when we measured what was actually extruded so what we're gonna do is take 100 divided by 93 and that gives us our one point zero seven five - all right so what we got now is the answer one point zero seven five - and we're going to take that times the current Estep now 93 is the default Estep for my under three and other creative devices if you've changed this in the past you're gonna change this number to whatever your your current Estep is in my case it's 93 so we take one point zero seven five two times 93 and that gives us 100 so this right here 100 should be your new east steps so we're gonna put that right there 100 is the new east step okay I'm gonna do one more example because mine was a little bit confusing because we got 93 on the dot so in this new example we're going to go ahead and take 100 and we're gonna divide that by our measured length in this example 87 so in our example we got 93 in this example we're gonna use 87 so we told it to push 100 millimeters of filament through and it gave us 87 when we measured it so 100 divided by 87 gives us one point one four nine four so we take that answer one point one four nine four times the current Estep in our case default under three is 93 and we get 106.8 nine that's our new Estep we're gonna round that up to 107 and we're gonna call one zero 700 or 107 our new e step so after I did the e step calibration I went ahead and ran it one more time just to double-check my work and as you can see here I'm at 100 millimeters and that's exactly where we want to be a quick note once you do this and we finish up with this process you will not have to do this again unless you change the extruder or the extruder gear so once we get this done you should be set the only thing you'll be changing is the value of the flow in your slicer and we'll show you that coming up so the next thing we want to do is we want to go ahead and copy the new g code into our start g code in kira so we're gonna go ahead and select the line we want to copy just like that now maybe there we go select the line we want to copy right-click choose copy then we're going to go ahead and open kira and we're gonna go to our printer so go to printers manage printers and then we're gonna click on the test printer that i created and click machine settings so i'm gonna expand this a little bit so it's easier to see and what we want to do is put this in right below the g28 code or g29 whatever one you're using so we're gonna right under this one right there there you go so we're gonna go ahead and right click and hit paste and that will paste the new line of G code in and that's going to tell our extruder to be 100 steps so we just need to change that 93 to 100 and once we do that now every time we slice a new file with this it's going to give us a hundred key steps go ahead and close everything and you're ready to slice your next file okay so the next thing we're gonna do is go ahead and install your boating coupler in your Bowden tube which I've already done and I've also already fed my filament so that's good to go we're gonna go down over here and we're gonna go ahead and go to prepare scroll down to preheat PLA and go ahead and preheat your PLA I've actually already done that so we're at 200 degrees on the hot end and 60 degrees on the bed then what we're gonna do is I've inserted my SD card with the cube that Luke has on his Thingiverse I will link it below I've sliced it with the new settings and put it on the SD card so I'm gonna go ahead and initialize my SD card then we're gonna do a print from sd card and I'm gonna go ahead and choose his cube and that's the next part of this process when you do that your printer will start by homing and then go ahead and print a cube and we'll come back so as you can see it's printing the single-wall cube now and we'll come back when it's fully printed so our cube is printed through the video magic so the next thing we're gonna do is go ahead and measure two points on each or the four walls so to do that we're just going to take our caliper and we're gonna go right here that's 0.03 one and the next one I got point three seven and then we're gonna go to the next three walls and record everything we get and I'll be right back here's what we got going on now we added all eight of our measurements that's two from each side of the cube and we got three point zero three then because we're getting an average we take three point zero three and we divide that by how many measurements we had which is eight that gave us three point seven eight seven five so then what we do is we take our point three seven eight seven five we round it to 0.37 eight which is fine we take what our wall should have been at point four divided our three point seven eight and then we end up with one point zero five so then what we do is we take our 105 we multiply that by 100 and we get 105 so one point zero five is what we got up here we times that times 100 and we end up with 1:05 so 105 will be our new flow rate or extrusion multiplier whatever slicer you're using it might be called a little bit different but in Kirra it's the flow rate so from now on when I use this filament I know that we're gonna use 105 as the flow rate when we make anything so the last thing we need to do is add the flow rate the new flow rate into Kirra so if you scroll down on the right side you can find material and then flow and we're gonna change that to 105 another way you can find it is go to the search bar and click in flow just type flow right here it'll bring up everything with the word flow in it under the material tab and you want to find the flow rate and we'll change that to 105 that is our new flow rate and you're good to go so there you go now you have the e steps for your printer and the best flow rate you should be rockin and rollin the reason why Luke prefers this method is because if you only have to do it one time as long as you don't change anything on that extruder you're good to go then anytime you get a new filament you just print the cube do your measurements and write the new flow rate on the spool of filament then you can go through many different filaments without even changing that Estep I hope that you learned something today and I hope that helped out we'll see you next time once again my name is jim and this

you smoke yourself okay so focus oh yeah nicely you kiss my name's Jason yes I'm the on rhetoric a cluster of your life honestly right place Sharon what the electronic cigarette company proper know what I do I make video diaries for my customers and we're going to different venues of that and find out what your opinion is on electronic smoking have you ever seen these products before now can you show you them I'm asking busy right now gene come back later oh so sorry if you come back later that'd be great I'm room okay no problem thank you oh yeah it's not good what's that sorry okay sorts of

drink problem I'm just doing this for video diary up all the videos on YouTube we own the business across the road okay do you know whether he's allow electronic smoking in the premises okay do none of you smell okay so we use one of these and have you gone with it yeah well the legal to use the public is you know and y Arriba lights are it's not been very helpful you manage I want to know whether I like 20 cigarettes the legal shoes and induces whether you minded people using them no problem I thought well always troubling here there's not smokers in the place and none of this stuff so home fortunately I'm not getting much responsible people I'm Ryder and I like 20 cigarette would replace a real cigarette for the small do is I'm going to go out to winghouse and see what we've got to

guest speaker dr. Annabel Tina I'm going to provide a brief background on what is Disney and what fizz nee looks like inside a bank for those of you who are unfamiliar with cider Bank briefly what is site of Inc tidal Bank is an end-to-end cloud-based compliant and secure single style knowledge management solution there are three basic components that comprise Saito Bank as part of our cloud-based software we have high dimensional analysis tools such as citrus Spade and of course the topic of today's discussion Disney as well as structured content management pieces including inbox searching and collaboration tools now finally we also have an informatics consulting services division where we provide data analysis training as well as custom services such as protocols data analysis tutorials and helping our customers take their data to results where did vis me come from in 2008 Lorenz von der mountain and Geoffrey Hinton published a paper called visualizing data using chisme or T distributed stochastic neighbor embedding in this paper they described how tease me was an algorithm for reducing dimensions and visualizing data however it wasn't until 2013 where this tool tease me was described in the context of cytometry data l ad David Amir and colleagues essentially rebranded the chief knee algorithm and reformatted it calling it vis knee and described how to use this tool to obtain information about from your cytometry data what is vis me visiting is a dimensionality reduction tool that provides a visual representation of the similarity relationship amongst tile essentially high parameter data are reduced into an easily understandable two-dimensional map all these busy maps each dot represents a single cell and cells that are close together on the busines map are more similar to one another across the dimensions that were used to generate the Disney analysis there are several features inside Oh Bank that can be used to understand your businesses and results from these analyses one featuring color by channel this is a helpful tool to get a single style expression of measured parameters and this tool is also helpful to get an idea of what the different measured parameters looks like at a single cell level and then using this to isolate cell populations of interest such as in this case drawing a gate around the cd4 positive cells populations another helpful feature color by sample so here the samples are from the same subject however each sample has undergone a different perturbation the blue indicates a basal condition orange is the sample that has undergone b-cell receptor stimulation Green has undergone interleukin 7 stimulation and here you can see that all of these samples are overlapping one another and that there really isn't heterogeneity in the types of immune populations that are present however you can imagine if you had generated this knee analysis using different subjects that you may see the presence or disappearance of certain cell populations in a given subject as well as there's also the possibility if you had run a vision alysus with a subject where one of the conditions was a longer term stim where you expected that to change the type the phenotype of that sample you could also use this tool to start seeing and visualizing some of these changes another helpful feature is color by density and this is a great feature for highlighting the abundance of different cell populations in your Vista analysis so all of these features can be used together to understand your vision alysus of course there are other tools with insider Bank that can become part of your analysis workflow to also extract and get the most out of your high parameter data so for example you could take these viz new data and use spade for clustering what is the site of is the advantage with vitamix cloud implementation you have the ability to experience decrease in runtime for your busy analysis you can fire our parallel run since it is a cloud application it's going to free up your local computer for other activity and as I mentioned before after you've run your vision alysus you could use other site or Bank tools to cluster your data there's also the ability to export statistics on spider bank to try to quantify observed results and since it's in the cloud you all you need is a browser to access your data and Disney results now I'm going to provide a live demo of what Disney looks like inside a bank this is the Disney setup page inside of ink the first thing you will need to do is choose a population for your Vista analysis birthing a population is going to depend on the questions being asked of your data however a good place to start is to choose a lightly gated top-level population such as cd45 cells here reflect all of our sample and then next we want to choose the type of event sampling so there's the option to choose proportional sampling or equals so here we're going to choose equal sampling because we want a representative sample from all three of our samples next you need to choose the channel that will be used to generate your 50 analysis selected channels should contribute to the separation of desired populations especially miuna phenotyping markers we're going to select those next use the option to choose the appropriate compensation for your data here these are mass spectometry data so that's not applicable in this instance for your fluorescent you can change this and then you also have the option to change these advanced settings inside Oh Bank as well I'm not going to talk about how to adjust these it's going to depend on your data whoever dr. Bell Cana will discuss how how to change these settings in her talk later again just briefly what some of these Disney features look like actually in the spider banks is the interface this is color by channel feel the different channels measured you can also color by population so here these are different gated populations and you can see where they fall in the Disney max your B cells are in purple C for T cells in green you also the option to color by sample as well as you as well as color by density that's what that looks like here if you have any questions on how to adjust your Disney analysis after today's webinar I recommend checking out support site ob.org you can search for articles depending on your question sohow trend bismi analysis for example you can also navigate to our articles on 50 here and select the appropriate article another helpful resource is this recent blog post by a guest blog post by Tyler burns a PhD candidate in dr. Gary Nolan's lab at Stanford you need to scribe how to fine-tune your disney analysis to optimize results and information from these 50 analyses and finally as I mentioned very briefly we have spider bank services and training so yes you have training on how to use these data analysis tools as well as custom services service projects if you're interested in that please check that out and contact us through through a contact portal on the website with that thank you very much for your attention and now like to introduce our guest speaker today dr. Annabel kina dr. Burkina is joining us from Boston University where she spends her time managing a large core flow cytometry facility as well as investigating mechanisms of chronic inflammation in various disease settings today she will share practical applications for how she\u00eds optimize disney analysis for her data all right so I'm going to talk today about my research and how we use this lis and other automated analysis tools in the analysis of multi color flow cytometry data sets I'm very excited to be here thank you cited Bank for allowing me to present my research so just a quick outline of today's talk I'm going to talk briefly about my research interest and that provoked our need in data analysis methodology I'm reporting today I will quickly quickly overview our panel design and spend a good amount of time discussing high dimensional data analysis that we are using and what a wet lab scientists can do after the initial terror of programming tasks we're off a little bit so then I'm going to show some preliminary results that we obtained and I'll just wrap up so are so if you worried about me I am an MD PhD I did my PhD in Boston University School of Medicine was working on epigenetic regulation of inflammation and obesity and now I work in full cytometry core facility as a research scientist and also I'm doing my postdoc in the Department of Microbiology so my main interests are innate immune function and chronic inflammatory conditions and flow cytometry data now so before I get into the data analysis part of the talk just like to outline how our research shaped our needs in folks accounting methodology so in our lab we seek to elucidate how immune regulation impacts the course of variety of chronic conditions and most of you know exhaustion or checkpoint inhibition occurs when either the antigen specific for the immune response such as pathogen or tumor or nonspecific inflammatory signals are sustained in the hospital past the acute phase of the response so the exhausted cells are described by the progressive loss of ex vivo functional capacity and expression of so-called inhibitory receptors so this field gained a lot of interest in recent years utilize largely to the groundbreaking clinical trial results using therapeutics that block the dd1 PDL one pathway and other inhibitor receptor pathways in late stage cancer patients so here's an example from one melanoma patient in my PD one clinical trial show eradication of the tumor ninety days after treatment initiation so the immune cells exhausted state appears to be transient and not permanent and reversible when signaling from the inhibitor receptor was blocked and one view of how immune exhaustion progresses is that an individual cell will up regulate more and more inhibitory receptors and over over time and this will be linked to the loss of effector functional capacity however evidence from our group and the other is indicate that the process likely occurs in more complex branch manner and factors in the micro environment drives distinct immune cells oxygen to variety of inhibited states so we hypothesize that this state may be reflected through the individual inhibitor receptor signatures on individual cells and we wanted to build a collaboration hub between our group and several translational research labs in our institution so where we would acquire blood and tissue samples from diseased subjects along with match controls and from the subjects we would measure inhibitory receptor signatures on the variety of immune cell subsets and at the same time we could sort populations of interest from for the actual functional profiling and other studies so this was about two years ago and we started now we have an ongoing research project on oral squamous cell carcinoma several HIV projects assisted a systemic sclerosis project so we got quite popular and this research relies on single-cell cytometry methods and it takes us to an obvious question so why not mat psychometry okay so we all know that there are major differences between force and mass spectometry and fight off on one hand cannot detect for dance i scared its sensitivity range and sampling deficiency speeds are dramatically lower on the other hand you can interrogate more than three dozens of parameters at once for dozens I think now right and no spectral overlap to struggle again and for us the sensitivity was extremely important because we know that many inhibitor receptors are a dimly expressed and low sampling efficiency would prevent us from seeing rare populations of immune cells so what is more want to be able to purify cells functional updates and it's kind of complicated to do with titles right so we thought that even though we can detect less parameters with fluorescence by country it was still the optimal choice for our specific study and I'll I'll not spend much time talking about our source inside country set up we have a sorter with 16 color capability so total of 18 parameter and we did some tweaking and troubleshooting how to get the best quality data from that I'll be happy to discuss that if we have extra time I'm not sure this is relevant to today's talk so we develop a piano for a single tube inhibitory receptor profiling so I'll not talk about iterative steps of panel development today so this is the final results these are the antigens that we can do and immune cells are succeeding so with this panel will look at innate immune cells like gamma delta T cells NK cells ing T cells also conditional cd4 cd8 and what we call T regs in codes because we don't have Foxley pretty obviously so this panel has five inhibitory receptors and these are team 3 PD one like 3-digit MCD 160 and also an activation receptor CD 137 it's a noble target for cancer immunotherapy so we wanted to see you two in the panel so we can determine all combinations of this five receptors on every cell acquired in the sample and we have two flavors of the panel one is the basic six receptor version and then another is slightly altered the lan-evo memory T cells and irrigating it has only four inhibitors so this just came out in cytometry a in October it's available on the website you can read our paper on that and our gating strategy is very very straightforward so we get out our doubles debris that's LCD 19 and c2 14 positive cells because we're not interested in them right now and then we gate on CD 3 and CD is 3 positive 3 negative with Jen Jade and K cells the cd4 cd8 and then so-called here as you can see in the bottom here and also gamma delta T cells IMT T cells wicked ng T cells based on VV also 24th TCR and NTP tetramer ligand conjugated with ABC and the inhibitory receptor staining looks I have to say it looks pretty good it looks better than most of the stuff I've seen published I will not I will boast a little bit here so we get very good resolution and this is from non stimulated sample from an individual with unusually high expression of the reciprocal excited to show us so anyway we have the two and now we could proceed to our characterization steps so as more people know in this audience I guess if you have 16 parameter data set altogether you have 120 combinations of all markers of interest from each sample we run and that would be quite hard to package in conventional manual analysis so this is john vento style demonstration to scare you enough so we got into this funded world of automated analysis and we found that we have too much information or our tools are too limited now the problem of too much information has been well known to mass spectometry users still at the beginning of that technology but it remains kind of exotic to flow cytometry users however that's mostly because the polychromatic pills with large numbers of floor crumbs were not accessible to the majority of users this is rapidly changing so in 2014 you have to work in very few specific very special labs with instruments that were basically prototypes or you have to be present obama to visit the my rotors lab and see the 30 color LSR - so in 2016 you just go and buy a machine that can do 20 plus colors like a Yeti or X 30 or I guess a bunch of you already have the X 50 the new machine from Beadie that can do technically up to 50 parameters so this means that we're we will the many many users facing this problem of extra information in flow cytometry field and we need to provide some tools for them okay even if our current president is not interested in posted commentary as much we still need to do something so anyone can get a large data set now and the question is what we're going to do with it and how we're going to tackle it okay oh if we have a five parameter high dimension data set what we want to do is to extract the message from it and to find what's special about it so our eye and mind is constantly looking for that message and in any given set of information points but there's a limitation to our perception and to the way we can present this message so we need to reduce the dimensionality down to three and actually better two dimensions for a human eye to flatten it in order to make it comprehensible so our first goal is visualization of high dimensional data in two-dimensional space that would preserve the structure of the data so then we can search with our own eye for the message and that's what we do when we do manual dating on bivariate cytometry plots so this is this process is intrinsically biased and provides sufficiently good results in many cases but not in all and we could skip that and go directly to the Machine unbiased analysis however it's often the case that a preliminary dimensionality reduction step it's beneficial for data analysis results allowing more clear signal extraction so what we do when we do the dimension reduction we arrange the data points into the space so that nearby points model measurements that were similar in high dimensional space are the three keys to find a good way to do it so today I'm going to talk first about how one of the most efficient dimensionality reduction and visualization algorithms that is available now the tease me or business side of ink and also talk about another algorithm state that identified cell clusters in high dimensional data sets so teeny was developed by people completely unrelated to bioinformatics back in 2008 and it gained huge popularity was adopted for site of data analysis by Donna parish lab under the name of this make so teeny algorithm builds a map of high dimensional space objects in 2d space by measuring pairwise distances between data points and then moving points around to find the best position out for them on the 2d map so that similar events appear close on the map so this animation was created by side a Bank team specifically Christian Corolla and demonstrates how we build step-by-step add this new map okay so here's our nice map and let's go to some examples so let me show you some real data from from my my opposer country dances so this is a vision a map of our 16 color data set of healthy donor PBMCs that we simulated with cd3 cd28 antibodies so we can utilize the color to represent the immediate intensity of marker expression and that will show that similar cells form and Island on the map so here is for example islands for cbs3 expression and cd3 positive cells would be either cd4 or cd8 and then there are some cd3 negative cd16 positive cells and these would be empty cells probably so do you think dimensions act like any other parameters in the FPS file and they're just added to the file as extra linear channels now Disney allows us to build a consensus map for several samples within one dataset so this is the unstimulated sample along with stimulated sample that we saw before so in business space channels like in other channels we can gate on populations and here we gate on cd8 populations that formed two neighboring regions on the map however only one of them is presently our simulated sample here if we reveal cd25 expression on the map we will find that the population that appears in both stamen on stem conditions is 325 negative and city 25 is the activation marker and the city 8 positive population that emerged in the stimulated samples in this empty space is 325 positive here so this will makes biological sense city 25 is one of the markers of t-cell activation there are several implementations that of Disney available tease me algorithm available for the users now I listed them here in very BIOS order so since I'm talking about my journey in the automated analysis I would have to confess that for a long time I try to stay away from let's say coding so I'm spread quite thin between my mineralogical research and full site some core responsibilities and in this talk I want to emphasize that these analysis are now accessible to people who don't have bioinformatics background and who cannot develop their own tools or even troubleshooting existing tools and have to rely on the marketed solutions that are available there is a huge need for this tools and it's slowly but being satisfied I think it's really great so the first tool that I use primarily and most extensively is at a bank obviously so it's called a space platform for data analysis I'm not paper I had a big graduation so I have great collaboration with cycling team so since I was one of the first folks a time to users interested in their automated analysis tools they created a sandbox cloud for me to work on algorithm optimization now you have access to the same mechanism same same tool set because it's rolled out for everybody to use both your health is literally diversion that includes DNA does not require any special our installation recently I gave it a try it works as described but however with bigger data set I have experienced multiple memory leaks so my teeth analysis basically acts like cancer consuming all free memory so that the good thing about it is that both of people in the field already have closed your licenses however if you're doing any big big data analysis right now I don't think slow to analysis is actually up to the point unless you go with their cloud solutions as well which I think are still being developed then I don't have my personal experience with FCS Express I just listed that they do have some kind of decent implementation and now we go to more complicated solutions that is the mclovin implementation it requires MATLAB I haven't dusted myself extensively I know very few monologist that actually use MATLAB it would be a huge limitation for the broader user base and I mean he because he's made so popular in computer science and various machine learning applications you can find it implemented in a variety of programming languages which is not very helpful if you're not a computer science specialist so if you are you probably don't need my advice on that so just let you know this is for example of Disney mouth keeping up of machine learning algorithm to that recognizes different patterns in the images so it sorts images from Google into I think from Instagram actually into different populations of some insects in the corner here and like fishes in the corner there so are if you go into the bigger world of computer science you'll find Tiffany popular and implemented and being a huge interest or go back to biomedics ago um so initially I was expecting that I would need some optimization of a math cytometry tool for flow cytometry dead Mouse's but once I sorted out all these small technical issues the nature of the data doesn't cause any trouble really so it's the amount of data that cost problems and this is a story that I'm going to share in the next place so PCA or visnu works best for small data sets and the more events you include into your run the more calculations are required to perform the mapping since the algorithm is measuring pairwise distances so there is some algorithmic pasture overcome the problem but it doesn't relieve the burden completely so then there's also this crowding problem when there are too many events and they appear to be too many neighbors so as opposed to manual analysis also where we can get a sample and then copy those gays to the whole set of samples Disney analysis cannot be supplemented with more samples so it combines all samples from the set at a lot analyzes them all at once so there is new Disney learns a new map each run there's no function that would define the mouth there is some work in progress I know from several groups who try to actually make expandable listening but I don't think it's really working role yet and there's some limitations that probably cannot be over or overcome at all with us with this task so you have to run the data set if you have a big data set so all Michael cytometry streams which is a high throughput that mass spectometry for rare populations is impacted by this problems with this needed big Visnic dataset so let's say I need just a handful of cells in both 800 terms right maybe like 50,000 events like I have two groups of 10 subjects per group in my study that's not really a large group for a human immunology study so we already would have a million events to run and if we have 200,000 cells per sample it will be 4 million and I mean you know like people asking it's ten thousand events enough for my experiment and you always say no so it is true it's always no so this is a well-known calculation of how many events one needs to acquire to observe the population I mean acting this table our copy pasted in various publications starting like 1990 something so if you're not very obsessive with confidence like you're happy with 5% of TV for a reasonably small 1% population we need to record at least 40,000 descent so here you go if you have a good in all in your study you really quickly hit a 2 million barrier so there is no special arrangement here for even if you got like it on million dollar math monitor you still need to record that many events if you're looking for rare population so when we plugged our first data set into teasing it went very well with smaller samples and with single samples once it started to increase the event load we followed this puzzling artifact and with number of thousands of data set increasing with complete loss of resolution in our visiting mouse so in fur to treat that are sighted being packaged assemble own busines algorithm used inside a bank for me to explore its capabilities on on my computer and what I did we took the healthy subjectivity salvo stained with my 16 color panel I stopped doubled it into five hundred thousand events of live single non be non modified PBMC population and then I did kiss me with this standalone version of the algorithm that produced a thief came up and extensive analysis loss so just a few words about the teasing mechanics I would refer anyone who is interested in the exact measuring polities new works to the extensive literature detective so just summarize the details that are super important for the story so tease me runs and iterations with each iteration fifty produces a better version of the mouse the quality of the map is reflected by so-called kld so these parameters reported for each iteration and in our case Kold shows how much information is lost when the high dimensional data are flattened onto two-dimensional balance so the points on the two-dimensional map move with each iteration to minimize the kld and when this project started sighted Inc was the only platform that allowed users without programming skills to run this neon native calls that didn't require external coding or transformation cell but it still didn't allow to titrate the algorithm parameters and you could only define the number of commands in the run and it would subsample them if requested the the special side event package that was prepared for me allowed to change the parameters for the Disney map but now it's available in premium and then surprised by the bank so you all can play with it I think it's been rolled out several months ago and there was a separate webinar on how to use it back so going back to my workflow I was able to get the intermediate snapshots of the Vista map taking every certain number of iterations and I was taking the kld measurement and recorded computational time required for the task so obviously I did the the standard thing I used lineage markers in my panel to define the visiting lab and I expected to see all major populations of immune cells on this valve so that are listed over here on the slide and that we discussed previously so my question is basically here is a probe why the map looks so bad we tried to change the real things immediately found that increasing the iteration number helps so we thought that if the kld is reduced we just need more iterations to reduce it low enough and to get a better Mouse the second question was how how we can measure the badness of the map so if there's an unbiased way to measure the map or high quality other than just our naked eye saying like this doesn't look right or this looks right so in scale D is a good measurement of that and the literature was saying that yes this is what you want to use to do it so let me show you okay so let me show you this is how the relatively good map looks here's a dot plot and the contour plot of the same this near on also contour plots on the next few slides because they show the population overlaps better so this the populations are labeled here in color and overlaid to avoid the ambiguity so it's not colored by by marker expression it's colored by population so we measured Chaldean runs where we said the total iteration number to be as low as 500 or as high as twenty-five hundred iterations so surprisingly we found that the eld measurements in those runs kind of converged so we got the same value in many runs whether we aim for higher or lower target iterations however the maps that those runs produced were quite different so here are the maps all captured at 900 iterations with the kld around 6.5 and you can note that one would run for another sixteen hundred iterations for the this map for example or this one is almost finished so this is this is the final product of it so if we go to the earlier iteration steps this is around six 4600 iteration step with the kld value a little bit higher we see the same pattern where the high target iterations are being much more promising and low target ones are not so good and not promising at all so we calculated other parameters as well like perplexity and learning rate and Teta and increase the number of events so we took the same sample same subject just added more data because our data the initial data files are quite big so we can afford that so only perplexity really makes difference for the map quality there all the maps I'd shown before were perplexity 30 that's the default value in most packages including the cider Bank the recommended value is something between 10 to 50 so if you increase perplexity to 100 it helps with the smaller sets but this in fact wears out when they're more events so if someone tells you oh just run everything at perplexity 100 it's not a solution it's like a temporary patch for some data set and there's no plot here because the computation time these analysis are extremely expensive computationally and there is on site a bank website in support section I think there is a blog about the comparison of computation times with different parameters so this was done on my standalone version but it's pretty similar to what was obtained in the in the cloud version just maybe every time is a little bit different but basically if you said this perplexity high enough and you have a big data set you're on may never finish at all so what about math autonomously probably well probably that oh all the problems you're having is because you have loaded it's not like it's not about this needs about slowly so I took a well-known published data set from Sean Reynolds paper is by in 2011 and it's the same thing and I found exactly the same problem at 500,000 events it was still ok when I got to higher number of events my maps all became tingled and the resolution drops tremendously so having a side of will not make you immune to this large data set problem so these these are not this new data from John vandals paper there knows no victim apps on that paper this is my myself so he didn't publish this crap I did ok so so if we follow how the Vista map goes are similar to the animation I showed before so this is a 2500 iteration run once we passed like the initial step this map appears semi results and it gets just better over time the thousand iteration map starts like a myth and it progresses not so well the iPod integration math lab just never makes it into something really good so remember that this runs they look so different but basically this three have the same are k LD value seven point eight and here is the contour plot for you to see how tangled they are and these two also have the same LD value of six point six and you can see that the one that aiming at 2500 integrations is really looking much better and much more promising so we have the resolution of the thread and orange populations pretty good here and here they're tangled together so the take-home message here is that LD is not a reliable measure to assess map quality between different runs it's useful to track the run progress within one map but be aware that if you're aiming for a certain number you might not get a good map at all you'll just get a certain number so the targeted duration number is important for the quality of the map even when it's not reached yet so right now my work in progress with SATA Bank team is to develop a reliable predictor of optimal Disney run parameters so that you know from the start what would which parameters would actually give you a good quality of the maps based on what you know about your dataset and I hope this would be result quite soon so to sum right here the Disney parameters must be adjusted for bigger event they discussed to allow more iterations and longer early graduation stats so this is the first step of the system app development and the eld diversions fairly cannot be used as reliable predictor of map quality so you have various DC software solutions and they have most of them have limited parameter flexibility or suboptimal perform with large data so right now I am totally unbiased but I have to say that side to back gives you the the best business apps because it Bo's allows you to titrate your parameters and it will not freeze your personal computer like flo-jo if you're running a huge data set so you are going back to our high parameter data problem so we discussed the visualization tool that allows our eyes to see the structure of high dimensional data but now our eyes will always look for structure even if it's not there so that's the definition of biased approach so what we want is unbiased analysis especially for finding and accessing populations that are unlikely image subsets and are not easily defined so for example my inhibitory receptor positive cells they are for one of the most known and popular algorithms for finding suppose that of your data structure is straight it was developed for mass spectometry it's not very well known outside of the biomedical field uh and with speed I'm not going to go over speed because this fear will run out of time but you basically you start with the compensated spectrometry data set down template in density-dependent fashion and then send the neighboring cells are grouped by unsupervised caracal clustering in an agglomerative manner and then the nodes are linked into the Meno spanning tree and that that one is flattened for 2d display and this is the the best reduction step basically then it stops on both rock and they saw the events that were removed in the beginning returned back into the data set added to the nodes that contain similar shells so you can also have several parameters to just you can choose clustering channels choose how much don't sample and number of nodes on the space tree so state works pretty well with the flow cytometry data so this is an example of 200 node 3 and you you know that node size represents how many events are in there so we can do overlay the median expression of markers and annotate the tree we can check how the expression how our indentation is accurate by actually picking branches of the tree and looking back into manuals into the various plots and so we end up with something like this with a very well annotated tree and we can take it from there so we have all our subsets of interest mostly so the problem is that the rare populations are lost in space and it's it's a well-known problem so either they get lost during their dog sampling or the clusters are too small and gets agglomerating with loitering or clusters so we were specifically interested in I&K T cells and they were not clustering in the state so we decided to combine Disney with state because as we discussed sometimes you need a dimension judgment for the machine algorithm to take the signals from the data so we made this say trees on top of Disney to visit a parameters that we ran with the data set so same same tree as you saw before sort of same dates as I saw before but a different tree so no long stimulated or stimulated City 328p BMP and you can see that we can see the the populations we saw before and we can see actually the I can t cluster so it's right here on the fifth name app it's got small things the red dot here and it clusters beautiful at just 37 cells out of I think 50,000 and it is very accurate and reliable so we were very happy with that and was perfect implementation of this new phosphate are there so we found that we can look at inhibitor receptor expression over different conditions say we could see variability in the expression so our sensitivity range was good enough so from there we thought okay if these are in vitro conditions that show us differential differentiate this differential expression so can we look at in vivo signatures in patients so and actually by the way this is also a good way to see whether your map quality is good enough so if you have the map that has singled populations like tier cd4 in statistics in cells it will be tangled on the space tree as well and if they're actually separated well then they will be separated well so it's in direct assessment of seasoning map quality state allows you to do that to you so what we did my workflow is we took our PBMC sample staying with the 16 color panels and we subsample guided by visiting or Spade or manual lineage marker analysis I pretty much produces the same result we get major immune subsets and then we do testing on just inhibitor receptor channels so we got the Disney maps of inhibitory receptor expression not only judge markers and then we spayed those map so we get bakeries of inhibitor receptor expression clusters and I want to show you how it looks so that we can extract these signatures of inhibitor receptor expression so it looks like that it's nothing like this beautiful spayed trees where you can immediately see the populations and say oh these are T cells these are B cells now this looks like aa kind of a nut so these are five inhibitor receptors designed coded from ABCD and E for easiness so you can see that we can have the different combinations of expression of different hibbity receptors and then you can either annotate it manually using bubbles in spayed or you can actually extract the information from each node and do computational extraction of the information the same way so once we have that we can extract the signatures of inhibitory receptor expression are in different subsets of immune cells so I eliminated E because it's barely was expressing this dataset so I have a chat for ABC empty so I have all the 16 combinations of expression profiles right and this is the population I think this for city force so you can see that the expression shows us hips basically so there are certain combinations that show up in certain combinations that never show up and also if you look at another subset of immune cells I think these were one of the NK cell cultures you can see much more variability in the receptor combinations and for example this combination never showed up in in the population number 1 but actually was very prominent here and we actually start seeing like quadruple positive cells and triple positive cells well here there's only one combination of triple positive civil so I mean and because they can do big data sets I can have a good end and I can plug in the disease versus healthy individuals and I can look for specific combinations that are interesting that are different in disease and healthy condition so no because I'm doing all this on the facts order and not on titles now I can go back to manual gating and actually sort this interesting population and do functional profiling and get quite interesting results which I hope I will present some times else somewhere else so as a tool this looks fantastically well and I would like to thank everybody who helped they was a research specialist I dabangg team on and Chris is my big guru and all the troubleshooting and development of this tools and a bunch of people from my University and I said they're International Society for investment of cytometry who told me an emerging leader for in 2015 so is the big award that helps me to develop my cytometry research forward", "hNPbspTTnHM": "so I've been watching the forums and a lot of people lately have been saying that in the end or three in the new versions you can actually save your east steps right on the control panel so I looked into this and I found out that's true I'm gonna walk you through that my name is Jim and this is the edge of tech [Music] so today we're actually going to walk through how to save your East steps on the newer versions of the under three this does not cover all the versions and I'm gonna leave the other videos out there you'll need to go to the other videos to get the calculations to learn how to calculate your East steps and then use this video on how to directly input them into the under three this is really a great feature and if you're under three has it this is how I'm going to suggest to do it going forward like I said check out the other videos they'll be linked below on how to calculate your East steps and your flow rate and then this video will show you how to enter them straight into the control panel and it saves to the EEPROM let's do it so if you click the button you scroll down to control you click control and you scroll down to motion and you scroll all the way down now all this stuff was not in my first ender threes firmware you could not see this on the screen there's excel and jerk and vmax and everything so if you scroll all the way down to the bottom though there's a line called East steps you can see from the factory we know they come at ninety three you can actually click on that and we can change it so say I want it to be 100 so we're gonna go ahead and scroll that up to be 100 and click OK so now we see the East Epps is at 100 point two so if I go back in the firmware to control and I go to store memory and I click it it flashes and it's okay now if I go back to the main page and back to the info screen we're here and what I'm gonna do next is I'm actually going to shut off the 3d printer and I'm gonna pull the power plug so the power plugs here I've pulled the power plug and we're gonna let it sit for about 20 seconds just to make sure now I've tested this a couple times and I was really astounded to find out that it's saving the NUI steps so I'm gonna take this power plug and go ahead and plug it back in and then go ahead and turn on the under three so it fires back up and we're gonna go ahead and check that so hit the button go to control go to motion and scroll all the way down now our east steps right now is that 100 point two okay so if I change this and we're gonna make it back down to 93 we'll hit enter now I'm gonna go back a little bit just to prove out this point hit control and I'm not gonna hit store memory this time I'm actually gonna hit load memory and that'll bring back anything that was already previously in the memory we know we just change this to 93 steps again so go ahead and click load memory go up to motion scroll all the way down and look 100 point 2e steps it remembered so I just wanted to throw that out there because I think this is a much easier way to store your east steps in the newer and ER threes the older ones did not have this but the newer ones it looks like you can do it right from the firmware so there you have it you've saved your East steps into the EEPROM and you're good to go you don't have to go through octal print and you don't have to put the settings in Kyra or your slicer like we said before this is really a great feature and again if your and your three has this it's the way to go you guys have a great day and keep printing hey everybody if you liked the video hit the like button below click the subscribe button if you want to see more and if you want to be notified when the next great videos come out click that little bell over there thank you so much for watching keep mashing that subscribe button we're almost to a thousand subscribers and I'm doing a big giveaway [Music]", "O2fGNVnaIt4": "okay so this is a hard reset for the Nokia Lumia 630 from pre-k to wireless okay we're gonna use the volume up volume down and power key to restore this phone when the screen is loved with a gmail account we mean a Microsoft account or a campaign or any screen pattern so first make sure to remove your SIM card and external memory card which is inside the phone to save some files because with this process we will delete any information stored in the phone okay is it gonna start okay I'm going to go slow so we can go step by step to restore this phone we're gonna press the power key and as soon as our the phone vibrates release power kill me immediately press the volume down and wait for the exclamation mark appears on the screen okay it's when I start Pyrates plays volume down you see the Nokia Allah logo coming exclamation mark release volume down now we're gonna press the volume up volume down and power key in volume down so just press release press release press release press release release to it volume up volume down power volume down the phone vibrates again just let the Nokia logo coming up and then we will see some gears on the screen that means that them master reset this performance of wait for it and there you go so that means that the phone it's basically performing the reset and it will delete any Microsoft account any passwords and extra email storing the phone and if you want to delete your microSD card folders then just leave the Lea live to leave the memory card in the phone with a SIM card also and so this process is going to take a few minutes maybe five to ten minutes so be patient and make sure that the phone is the battery is fully charged because if the battery is going today while this this may ring the phone you have to restart over again okay so let me say this one take a few minutes and if you see this there is a line cross so that line will will highlight it so as as the reset performance this line has to be higher at the end from the left to right and when that finish that means that the phone will power off down or end okay so we patiently said this will not take a while okay okay so at that point the master reset is going by more than half of that process so when these line highlights at the very end then the phone will power off and on again and also when the fire phone will power also going to take a few minutes also to fully power on and take us to the main screen to select the language and register our Microsoft account or and start downloading applications so be patience so far has been like maybe 10 minutes fighting this so let's wait until this finish okay so now we see the Nokia logos come showing up so just away for a few moments also okay so this is a cricket Windows Phone and so far there there's no way to unlock this phone to use it on another carrier like t-mobile so you're trying to find out the information how to unlock this phone I've been checking are companies that do the unlock things but now in this model so hopefully next

vapor here again I've got another hardware review for it's an RTI the triad Genesis such this I'll be back with you in a sec right here we are is the bag well yeah there I mean this comes in a cloth bag it doesn't come in a box or anything like that let's pull this there here's the here's the RTI triad and it's a Troy posted version of the velocity deck so there you go let's just have a quick look and see what else you get in here oh come back you know yes right oh all sorts of stuff in here Alan Kay otherwise oh yes yes that's the monthly here Phillip in trite so there's the bag and put that to one side yes right well inside here you get you actually get two plastic bags or two little baggies one of which has got the spare glass pyrex glass pop raptor1 saw in the other one you get all these goodies now what we got the wake up loads of o-rings a little bit thin in my mind there cook it stripped quite easily hence the reason I'm certain that I put on the roads of loads of o-rings in here get to fill caps or to fill screw caps some spare post screws six of those you also get those tiny little rings as well and you get a allen key now this isn't the allen key that actually came with it I can't find the one that came with it but the one that did come with it it's stripped the first time I start I cold this thing up it's stripped so that's what I've been using one of those it's a title from from geek vape well there you go you also get two daring blocks now they either use to block off yeah your spaces where you put your coil in if you want to just one coil in there or two calls pop back there and the reason why I've got this one my hand is because I don't bother or haven't been bothering to put the the fill pin in I'll show that in a second let's just get this out there there we go right okay so ordinarily the fill pin would sit up there like that now between you mean the garbin Post having that pin in there is all very well and good all very well and good but if you've been vaping on the RTA it gets bloody hot you try taking that off to fill you yet tank up or there's only two mils in there so and so that's one of my comes anyway so I don't bother with that what I just leave I have many leaks from it so I'll just leave that out yeah okay let's sir just move all this lot to one side a sec right let's put the cool master there for a second as you can see it's a try posted velocity deck very interesting to build on I've only managed to get vertical calls in it I can't get horizontal chords in there because you've got that wick hole incidentally those wick holes are three millimeters and if you look there very carefully next to this one you'll see where's my pointless you 7th shoe so if you'd look carefully there you have got what they call is an auntie suction oh so in other words when it wakes up when you draw you're not going to get a really really really tight draw because that helps to circulate the air okay let's sir let's just undo this take it apart and show you now the base comes off like so which enables you to take your glass off oh yeah they should they should glass and there you go and if you look underneath today you've got your three holes there for your wicks as I say there's three meters so that's fair enough you've got a gold-plated pin on there for enhanced contact avati yeah there you go right let's pop that there the the base plate itself is stainless steel likely like the cap off I'll show you the cap in a second mr. Sun colors it's just a a gold color so yeah and you've got the word as - written on there because this is animalist product I don't know whether I mentioned though I ring round there also an o-ring in there you've got two o-rings actually on the deck itself and if we take a closer look at the underneath of this deck you can see you've got one two three holes and they connect to this loose bolt so when you put your your juice in there it comes out there filled your tank up and that's very enough in it right let's put this thing back together again right here we go don't over tighten this just finger tight is more than enough because if you over tighten it you could end up boy well cracking that glass okay you've got a spare but once this one goes that's it unless you can get hold of Asmodai sand boy spares from even sure was they do space for this year or not the yeah the little o-ring plugs a fitting like so okay that's try wint days to always use this one as number one polt because you've got that anti suction pole where if you cover that up it's gonna make it a really really tight draw for you unless of course that's what you want yeah yes I mean there you go so you could you could cover up two of them you could just have one or even better if I can get it back again you have the three that's fair enough right okay I'm just going to curl this up okay there we go and I've got a cold I've only put two coils in huh so what I'm gonna do is get one of those dill ring plugs and pop that in there right there you go I managed to get it in okay so right now before I yeah I'll whip this up I want to quickly show you the cat me there we go there's the drip tip and then what you do is you push inside and you've got a sleeve and the answer part a little cat if we take a look at this you consider you might be able to see it's got triad Genesis laser etched into the side you've got another row ring around the top there yeah and then you've got like squares yeah for your airflow on the cap itself you've got almost an optical airflow system it's made up of triangles so you know right so um let's see let's put this together right now what I do is I don't block off any of these airflos right okay so I've jumping playing around with the calls and trying to get and firing right right let's let's try and all the shots let's give this a wick up shall we right now the way that I like to be able to do this actually why do I take it off for there I do not know I'm going in the sunless morning I'll turn right put that back on let's get me calm what would where I'm screwed up from there just trim those wicks a button there just you better you can if you if you prefer to put the wick up through the hole there and up through the I just happened to find it easier to put it down through the through the coil and then through the base let's just cut these don't know I like to do with these tiles it unlike to cut them roughly around about where the 510 starts we go that's fine yeah us goes right okay so don't what we do is we put everything back together again great fun make sure those as wicks are tucked in nicely and screw that back down as I said earlier on it doesn't need to be overly tight just over finger-tight is perfect for that right so there you go right now let's put sir put something in this shall we and I'm going to be using bare banana ok I've got a little bit left in here I've got some in me unicorn ball so this is what I suggest using a unicorn bottle if you use a dripper our family it gets incredibly messy so pop back down there give it a good old squeeze put me cap on now this is the pool well before you do that that would be the point you put this little screw back in but I tend to leave it out so I'm gonna do that this time it doesn't sir doesn't leak or it hasn't in the time I've I've been using this thing anyway there she is all filled up etc let's go back up top and dirt and give her a tooth shall we welcome back up now I've got you on the RX two three okay let's just give this a bit of a toot then we can talk a little bit more about it Oh blimey the amount of vapor and the amount of flavor I get from this thing it's brilliant it really is great a bit disappointed with doing it with the two mil Hank on there I think that's a plane in the waters no but as I said earlier on there is if you decide to keep that little screw in there the only way to fill it up is to fill it out pull off your top cap and then unscrew that scrotum and put it down if like me you want to fill it up quickly without burning your fingers leave that little scum fill screw out pull your drip tip off put your unicorn bottling and squeeze away makes life so much easier I found that sir if I leave that screw in there it gets so hot that I can't turn it I have to wait for the damn thing to cool down before I can fill it up oh well there you go that's as I said earlier on that's a con for it right let me give you the specs on this the drip tip is as you can see there it's a slope drip tip or conical it meets the only one that comes with it now it's a 75 watts but one zero sidebar there you go as I say 75 watts whoa it ain't gonna take me long to fill this little room up I'll tell ya 24 mil or 24 millimeter around yeah the matter juice capacity of this is 2 mils as I said just now it's made with the whole thing is made with 304 stainless steel they have taken quite a pride with this one actually a notice the construction of it is extremely good it really is but there are a few problems with it and I'll get to that in a minute you've got three unique point truck triple post so yeah a little triple post design I should say you can put in there Singh or jewel or a triple coil I've got the upper jewel in there at the moment let me take this cap because something I forgot to show you on the up and closely yeah if you look I don't know whether you can actually see that there but if you look between the two holes to post holes there don't put the post hole screws I should say you can just about see there's a peek insulator there and that goes all the way round yeah so fair enough you get two of those del rim blocks with it so if you wanted a single call in there you could have a single coil and I haven't found any other way of coiling this up apart from putting vertical coils in it which I don't like vertical calls not really so this are the aim or RTA is not really my cup of tea for that simple one simple reason you've got the precision air flow around the around the cap inside as I say on the sleeve you've got square one so you can could actually turn this and cut that air flow down but in my mind that air flow is too small anyway I have it completely wide open it's absolutely fine for me even though I've got one those blocks in the back they're blocking off one of the post spaces fair enough as I said down at the upper close see when you pull this up look for that anti suction hole it being next to one of the three mil wick holes spaced one or call her one or whatever you want to call it and do not put one of those blocks on top of that that auntie suction that because you will get one hell of a tight draw if you know trust me been there done it warmer take one of why it was so incredibly tight then I figured it out that is also a a con because you would have thought that they would have pointed that out to you but they haven't I mean there are no instructions or instruction manual or anything that comes with this he's taken the fact then you know what you're doing with an RTA or an RD ta pan turn screws for that Phil Pole what I actually like about this thing is that three post deck yes it's a pain in the butt but I can't coil it any other way than vertical but saying that being a velocity deck it's so easy to call and with bows Adi very more wick holes there you can get ya lose it you can get the diameter post that you use to build your coil on and you can put it down the hole and sort of hold it there while you're screwing up and then use that to maneuver your coil wherever you want it sort of saying inner ya lovely Japanese I love the flavor that I get from this the flavor is so full on it it's unbelievable and as you can see the clouds they're sick they're creamy wonderful you know me I'm not really a cloud chucker but at 75 watts this is blasting it out really blasting it out now what I don't like about to miltank no go five six seven poles you're at liquid you got to fill it up again as I said earlier on the airflow is it's too small as far as I'm concerned yeah I would prefer to have seen it a little bit bigger I mean on the competition one yes I've got a competition one you see if I'll put that up against that yeah the airflow is it's exactly the same but this one is a lot bigger yeah okay granted this is the competition one it's made for blowing clouds this one I think it's made mainly for taste and believe me the taste I get from this is gorgeous I'll absolutely love this bear banana I really do and another drippers or RTA's or even tanks it doesn't just it doesn't taste the same as it does in this holding lovely one thing that I mean most RTA's Rd TAS you have to take them apart anyway to to rework them work the yeah my joy I don't take it apart - wait - wicked why does I pull the cotton out and then I poke it down through dulls because if you notice on there I haven't got hardly any cotton in it anyway and I end up by tipping upside down - to Wycombe but it works then it worked well for me this one what I did was I should have cut those wicks just a little bit shorter because as you can see there they are sticking down and touching the bottom of the deck but wow there you go there you go now I don't like the idea of having to take it apart and reworking it it's virtually impossible to do what I do with the I joy or the limitless the fill pin now in my mine that fill pin for the the fill pull it could have been a bit longer be caught on his item is dangerous well not dangerous caution and caution you need caution when you fill this especially if the tank is hot yeah I mean I can see some burnt fingers happening with that but up there you go and again vertical curls absolutely bloody hate it I'm not gonna stop talking about them anyway as I said this really isn't my cup of tea this one I though sign they're the flavor from it is great brilliant exceptional the vapor from it is brilliant again exceptional well as Graham Graham would say let's let's play the alien game shall we if I lost this or damaged it or somebody stole it or or whatever would I go out again and buy it because about it I probably would do you know why because of the flavor that I get from it yeah it is such a pure flavor it's much better than anything that I've got sitting here it really is and that includes my favorite one which is Nick Graham grains recoil much much better flavour so there you go anyway is there anything else there Oh rings thank you won't talk about the o-rings they're too thin yeah I can see people put keep pulling this cap off those rings around the deck there they are gonna get stripped you're gonna bugger up you're going to go through all the ones that you've got in the bag there hence the reason I try and leave another word another reason why I try and leave this cat on there we go do that why it doesn't no more to sit down properly on there I'm not surprised there's an o-ring round this drip tip and it wasn't on properly and here we go yep that's on there properly now oh there oh my Staller reviewing is terrible in it there's more of an experience yeah right there's nothing else that I could Oh again yes I told you about the allen key I still can't find it's around here somewhere my desk is in a terrible state but that allen key they they gave me with it I did the first lot of coiling and then looked at the allen key and it was strict in the end I ended up by using the gig fight he told right okay that's it yeah thank you very much for listening to my warbling zone this morning this is kevin from woody viper saying i'll see you on the next one cheers for now let's take your help because you know I'm all about that baby that baby air bubbles I'm all about that bass bout that bass and bubbles I'm all about that bass bout that bass

presented as presented was made by bob turner jerry fowler second in the motion carry under new business the deacons voted to use a thousand dollars from discretionary missions funds to help uh chaplain brett moody at the hampton roads regional jail chaplain moody is still working to grow his base of supporting churches and covet prevented him from having the main fundraiser the jail ministry banquet this year jean sayer added that the moodys are a younger family and have to provide for their own health insurance and by the way not as part of the meeting but uh the whole family right now struggling with severe colds would you pray for them i got that news uh tonight let's let's remember them in prayer all right uh moving on to new missionary help the deacons voted to use 700 from discretionary missions funds to temporarily support missionary robert burkett who is the interim pastor at the church in lake in heath england where scott mccain is the pastor the funds given as a one-time gift represent a hundred dollars a month through april 2021 when the mccains hope to be on the field nursery wing remodel the deacons recommend that 2500 be used from the general fund to purchase drywall and paint to remodel the nursery wing hallway this expense will appear as an overage in the budget under category 1230 improvements a motion to accept the deacon's recommendation was made by clay seamster chris mccoy seconded discussion followed the motion carry ministry update annual reports dr bob valyr has examined the financial reports for gnbc and afbm and reported that he is not aware of any changes that need to be made to the enclosed cash basis financial reports for the year ended july 31 2020 and then 2020 missions conference october 4 to 11. we gave you the theme theme for the year light out of darkness from second corinthians 4 6 the 20 20 20 and 21 faith promise goal is 240 000. seven missionary families will be joining us for the conference uh four supported by gnbc those are listed for you and then three that are not currently supported by gnbc and those are listed out for you as well a motion to adjourn was made by mike blackburn ron zellman seconded the motion carried submitted by mary lynn harvey our church clerk does anyone see any corrections that need to be made to the minutes all right if not we'll let them stand as approved let me just take us back to a couple things the nursery wing remodel is going to happen but right now we're waiting for joan hostetler to get better gordon was going to be working on that and he's still planning to but we need to see joan and get better continue to pray for her please and then also under nursery wing remodel the minute state and this is what we said the minutes are correct that the deacons voted the 2500 to be a general fund overage this is on me we went back denise and i and looked at what is still remaining under improvements and that will not be an overage there's still enough resources there to do it and that will come up again tonight when we bring another project to you and there's enough in there to cover the recent project that the deacons are going to bring to you tonight all right let the minutes again stand as presented i'm going to ask our treasurer to come and share the financial reports all right let's look at the september 2020 report uh timeline 63 194 dollars given plus another 105 dollars so total income for september sixty three thousand two hundred ninety nine dollars budgeted amount of sixty four thousand three hundred thirty seven so given was slightly below budget by one thousand thirty eight dollars a couple of notes of interest on this page about halfway down line 1235 kitchen supplies that's the high this month because we bought in how to replace a freezer in the fellowship hall and the line just below that 1240 under maintenance and repairs uh fellowship hall needed a new water heater 80 gallon gas water here was kind of expensive any questions on that page all right page two that line that page is looking pretty good so down the bottom expenses for the month of september sixty two thousand six hundred and nine dollars so spending is a little bit below budget by 1728 so the net income for the month positive 690 any questions on september all right your date january through september so far tithe line giving five hundred sixty three thousand eight hundred forty four dollars the special bus giving three thousand seven hundred fifty five dollars some other giving and other means of giving us 931 dollars so total income for the year so far 568 thousand five hundred thirty dollars the budget 579 041 so giving is below budget by 10 510. and uh if no question on that page i'll go to page 2. so the total expenses for the year at the bottom of the page 543 404 uh so spending is below budget by 35 635 so the net income for the year so far is a positive 25 125 dollars any questions on the general budget all right go to missions account uh september uh income 21 597. the budget's 19 641 so giving was above budget by 1 956 and total expenses 25 839 dollars so net income for the month of september and admissions account was a negative four thousand two hundred forty one dollars and then um the year today our fiscal year from october 1st 2019 through september 30th 2020 so this completes the fiscal year so total giving for our emissions year was 253 584 dollars which is pretty substantial the budget amount was 235 695. so good news baptist church gave above the budget amount by 17 889 dollars so in total expenses for the month or excuse me for the year 237 182 so the net income for admissions account for that fiscal year is a positive sixteen thousand four hundred one dollars and then we have the operating account and uh escrow account activity like to bring attention one change we've made so under operating accounts you have the general church account admissions account the admissions account says sixty thousand dollars it was like 113 000 so what we've made is if you look halfway down the escrow account activity there's a new line it's called missions surplus fund and all that does is we want to leave a buffer and admissions account at 60 000 roughly three months worth of uh budgeted amount and the surplus line will give the church and the deacons better feel for how much money is a surplus that if special projects special mission needs come up i don't if you already talk about this i want to steal your thunder um things come up that we can really help missionaries out some special projects that we know hey this is a surplus we can readily afford to spend that money so it's more of a visual so we can see that surplus fund so that's what that is that line is now the mission surplus fund we're starting at a fifty five thousand thirty three dollars any questions on that all right so i have about finances any other questions in general or pastor thank you the only other comment i would have about the new mission surplus fund again it's just things that are being moved on paper but it also the deacons have felt strongly along with the pastoral staff we need to we need to separate out what can be used as brother hagberg mentioned for special missions projects the lord's coming back soon we need to have enough money in there in case we needed to have a few months with extra help but then the rest of it needs to get busy for the lord that's why god's provided it that's why you've given it and so we want to be a little bit more aggressive in using that money putting it to work for the for missions and so that's that's why you see that divided out there do i have a motion to receive the minutes as presented bob turner thank you second support ray mcginnis any other questions all right then all in favor of receiving the financial reports tonight as presented say aye anyone opposed so ordered okay just to update you on some things really there's nothing that we'll be voting on tonight but we want to keep you updated uh for those who are new in our church when we pass the mission's budget in january part of that missions budget is discretionary funds and so uh the last couple of years that's been at 15 000 and that's money that that you vote to put in a discretionary account and then as the deacons the pastoral staff hear about special needs and we're going to present one uh or show you one here in just a moment but when that's presented then you've given us the ability to respond to that and so pastoral staff always will bring it to the deacons and then there's an official vote to use these discretionary funds in a specific way so the deacons voted to use 2 000 from discretionary mission funds to help ferdinand and gloria reign on with travel and other expenses related to their son's recent very sad death he's with the lord but was killed in a car accident north carolina they had to come from the philippines to get here and uh and then of course the sun's young widow uh becca just just extra needs and so some initial uh cash was given in a car just so when they got here they had they had some spending money for meals and whatever and then the deacons responded again with 2 000 to help with what was no doubt significant needs related to that tragedy all right uh also under missionary help the deacons voted to use 274.44 cents from discretionary mission funds to help pastor tobin the hispanic church with copier expenses and then they voted to use 529 from discretionary mission funds to cover the remaining balance of the mccain's ptsd training at camp joy you gave graciously to that need covered much of it but then we made up the difference with discretionary mission funds the next item under new business the deakins voted to spend 1500 currently in the budget under improvements to have phil brick incorporated installed two hot water heaters in the office kitchenette and the upstairs restrooms and so we're informing you about that tonight the kitchenette up there has been remodeled and alan berry ryan gibson have done a great job uh with that and please stop up take a look all right uh we need to put a floor in there yet but it it looks great but there is not hot water to the sink there or to the pastor's restroom which is on the other side of the wall so there's going to be heater installed it's going to be piped through to both rooms so there's hot water it's the same units that we've we put in the restrooms here in the foyers so there's immediate hot water and then the second one is going to be installed in the ladies restroom up there and again run through and be piped through to the men's restroom so both both sinks are covered all right any questions on on any of that okay then let's give you an update on our current faith promise commitment you remember in fact it was in the uh minutes uh that we just read our goal was 240 000 praise god to this point

blessings as we heal the word hear the word of god tonight we ask these things in jesus name amen let's stand and sing just one stanza of close to [Music] my thee portion more than friend or life oh is thank you you may be seated you don't have a handout tonight for isaiah but i'd like you to turn please to isaiah 5. if you have something that you can take notes on i think that that will benefit you been looking at various themes and topics in this great book of prophecy tonight we're going to look at another theme and and we'll just move through the book and and hit highlights i hope that you'll take time even based on things that we've preached things that i've pointed out go back and read the book once again for yourself tonight we're in chapter five and chapter five ends the first section of isaiah chapter 5 has been called the song of jehovah's vineyard the song of jehovah's vineyard in the song the owner of a piece of property who's the lord takes every effort to plant a vineyard protect it produce grapes for his enjoyment but just the opposite happens of all that he worked for all that he intended isaiah 5 notice verse 1 now will i sing of my well beloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard my well beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill and he fenced it and gathered out the stones thereof and planted it with the choicest vines built a tower in the midst of it and also made a wine press therein and he looked that it should bring forth grapes and it brought forth wild grapes and now all inhabitants of jerusalem and men of judah judge i pray you betwixt me in my vineyard what could i what could have been done more to my vineyard that i have not done in it wherefore when i looked that it should bring forth grapes brought it forth wild grapes and now go to i will tell you what i will do to my vineyard i will take the hedge thereof and it shall be eaten up and break down the wall thereof and it shall be trodden down what a testimony go back earlier and notice at the end of verse 1 my beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill if you're taking notes or in your bible you may just want to make a marginal reference to a land flowing with milk and honey god placed israel in a choice prime piece of real estate it was beautiful and in fact we're talking about a vineyard here do you remember that when joshua and the other spies went in one of the things that they brought back out to moses and to the people after spying out the land was a clump of grapes we know it from scripture as grapes of escrow do you remember what was so unique about that clump of grapes somebody help me tonight karen it took two men all right it took two men with a staff on their shoulders to carry that one clump of grapes back to the people that's where where god put israel this fruitful hill all right but after he did all those things for israel and hoped to receive the enjoyment of grapes he got wild grapes one of the characteristics of wild grapes is they're bitter and that's what was in the lord's mouth that's what he tasted after all that he had done and as israel turned her back on him now there shouldn't be any question about who he is talking about notice verse 7 for the vineyard of the lord of hosts is the house of israel and the men of judah his pleasant plan and he looked for judgment and behold oppression for righteousness but behold a cry now let me remind us that chapter five like the other chapters that you can read and again the first half of the book of isaiah is all about judgment it's not an exact parallel for christians today since the prophet at this point is writing primarily to unbelievers and at this point israel is an apostasy and and uh many have turned their hearts from the lord and even those who claim to know him they draw an eye with their lips but their hearts are far from him so unbelievers and he's writing to a nation of chosen people who had experienced blessing from god but it turned their back on all of that and i i can't help but think as we talk about this tonight as we look at the book of isaiah there's only one other nation ever in the his well i would say there are two two nations and we as americans came from that other nation that had unparalleled a blessing from god and if you look at great britain today if you look at america we've turned our back on the lord haven't we especially here in america you talk about being planted in a fruitful hill in fact even our patriotic songs talk about that amber waves of grain so chapter five is really a song with two parts first of all the description of the vineyard and then secondly a declaration of judgment against the vineyard and a word of woe okay isaiah is going to use that word it's used six times beginning in verse 8. when you put these divine woes at the end of a song about a vineyard that won't produce the title of the message that i'm going to give you tonight will make sense god's judgment on his worthless vine god's judgment on his worthless mind now in the first part of the psalm which describes the vineyard the lord explains what he did for his vineyard verses one and two very thorough everything that a vineyard needs to produce good fruit good grapes god did it we're saying about the lord's mercy tonight think about his faithfulness god expects from us but he has fully equipped us and he's done so much for us in blessing that he has a right to expect what he asked for he doesn't expect something and then not give you the wherewithal to do it but then he asked the reader reading through this chapter to weigh in about the vineyard that's verses three and four what could have been done more and then finally he cast sentence upon his vineyard judah because of the summary of offenses in verse seven and we read those he looked for judgment there was oppression okay and then righteousness but behold a cry so let's take a deeper look now chapter five is not a restatement of what you see in chapters two and two to four you can go back and read that for yourself what we have here was not has not been stated before the beginning of this chapter focuses on the unique way god responded to this people the the children of abraham these israelites and our first point tonight what we see from the text is that god showed israel on parallel favor when you look at what god did for them compared to all the other nations it's unparalleled this is the whole point of these opening verses back in exodus 19 4-5 three months after god had delivered israel from egypt god called moses to a private meeting and told him to say to israel again exodus 19 4-5 you have seen what i did to the egyptians and how i bear you on eagle's wings and brought you unto myself now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my covenant then you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the earth is mine when israel is about to enter the promised land 40 years later again the lord will make similar statements deuteronomy 4 and verse 7. what nation is there so great who hath god so nigh unto them as the lord our god is in all things that we call upon him for god showed israel on parallel favor now the application that we can draw from this and this is a theme verse that you have memorized that should go through your mind as we go through this study and we consider israel to whom much is given much will be required but that doesn't just apply to israel that applies to god's people to whom much has given much will be required one of the reasons that that many of us are even more concerned about the upcoming election is because we know what we deserve we're praying that god won't give it to us can we just be honest about that we deserve judgment but we're praying for god to give us more mercy as we as we seek to serve him here we've experienced unparalleled favor just as israel did now no nation had received this kind of favor provision deliverance however second point god's favor had been bestowed in vain when god asked the question in verse 4 what more could i have done for my vineyard the question is not answered why is it not answered well because there is no answer there's no more that god could have done israel like a vineyard had received from god everything it could ever need the same question cannot be answered for the united states for christians who have been given so much in this land we get to attend solid bible believing churches if we choose to young people who have been raised in good homes who have been able to go to excellent christian schools and bible colleges and we have to look at the church in america and say what more could god have done and let me just share my heart with the young adults in our church hopefully we have a number who are watching by live stream tonight by the way christian good to have you back tonight but the youth out of our churches tend to look back at their upbringing and they want to nitpick at all the things that they didn't like or that weren't right but i got news for you there was a whole lot more that was right and great blessing than that was wrong and it doesn't change the fact of what we're looking at out of isaiah tonight to whom much is given much will be required and i fear that even the generations have been raised in our churches one of the characteristics that is similar of them and the world is this unthankful and unholy the only answer as to why god's favor is often bestowed in vain is the illogical nature of sin sin rejects all that god has to offer and offers what it can never deliver that sin but the recipients of god's favor and grace keep trying to see if sin will work for them all israel had to do is look back to their history the times of the judges the times of the kings and what did it reveal sin never works but to nations that will fear god and follow him there is blessing in the united states of america in in the history of civilization civilization along with israel is another tremendous exhibit of that yes sin is a reproach to every people and we're seeing that played out even daily here in our country no wonder sin is so offensive to god when people forsake his goodness and try to turn back to the poison that satan offers up thinking that somehow that's going to work somehow that's going to bring satisfaction and so notice verses five and six what god will do when people produce worthless fruit in spite of all that he has done for them and now go to i will tell you what i will do with my vineyard i will take away the hedge thereof what's the hedge it's the protection do we need god's protection yeah yeah we do and when he removes the hedge trouble by the way where does that idea come from again or earlier in scripture if you look at the whole idea of of putting a hedge around someone it starts in the book of job and we know what's hap what happens there to job when god removes that hedge of protection now praise god he's still in control but we see what happens there god says here with my vineyard i'm going to remove the hedge it shall be eaten up breaking down the wall thereof it shall be trotted down and i will lay it waste it shall not be pruned nor digged but there shall come up briars and thorns i will also command the clouds that they reign no more upon it again you can go back and see chapters two and three that god promises to depart from israel but here he says he'll destroy her remember that he promised to degrade them okay you can go back and see that in these earlier chapters as well he's going to degrade them humiliate them including their sensual arrogant women the immorality that was rampant in israel at this time god showed israel unparalleled favor but this favor was bestowed in vain and then we close tonight by looking at the last part of what the lord teaches here point three god will destroy those who reject his favor and this is probably the most sobering part nothing that god does is ever final and we know that at the end of isaiah again he's going to take these these people that he has judged destroyed chastened and in the end israel is going to come back that's god's provision protection preservation and he's going to make them a nation of witnessing sons and daughters but those who have received his good and have rejected that here's what you can expect destruction what does scripture remind us he that being often reproved and hardeneth his neck shall suddenly be destroyed and that without remedy he that being often reproved what is that well that's just a mean parent constantly nagging no it's not that's a loving parent constantly warning and when the warnings are not observed destruction is going to follow in the way now how will god destroy israel or any nation that has experienced his grace and then rejected it it's a fearful thing when god doesn't turn away but determines to destroy now we may question why god doesn't work in the life of someone who is so wayward and this is we we know the tactics of the enemy satan how he makes sin so attractive and and so pleasant and there is pleasure in that sin for a season and then like a lion he waits till you've taken the bait and then he pounces all right but here's what's so wonderful about our god while satan is doing his destructive work god is also at work and he can use the very the very tactics of satan to get hold of hearts and to bring people back and one of the ways that he does that is when someone goes ahead and sins and they continue to pursue those things god is going to deal with them he's going to judge them but he will use the sin to do its own work we want god to turn people around and restore them and rightfully so but god may be answering your prayer by letting the sin do its work we've all heard the expression that you know sometimes god allows sin to take somebody down to the point where they're on their back and they'll finally look up god can do that sometimes he chooses to be more active in stopping them however make no mistake about it when god's grace over time is rejected destruction will follow proverbs 29 1 again he that often being often reproved hardeneth his neck shall suddenly be destroyed and that without remedy if you are someone who is not saved and perhaps have heard the gospel repeatedly and you continue to say no there's coming a time when god will no longer prod his spirit will not always chide with man and destruction is sure and so there's someone listening to my voice here in the auditorium or or on the live stream tonight you you live in a country where you the the gospel is readily available or maybe you have loved ones maybe you have co-workers you have people who care about you who have shared the gospel you keep saying no you keep saying no you keep rejecting well again in a very real sense you harden your your neck to that truth and and here's the reality you're going to face destruction in fact the scripture says it's going to be eternal destruction if you have continued in sin after repeated urgings by the spirit christian the holy spirit telling you to stop god will eventually destroy you who the lord loves he rebukes he and he chastens but then other parts of scripture tell us what happens beyond the chastening and let's just take a look at that first corinthians chapter 3. first corinthians 3 notice verse 17. if any man defile the temple of god him shall god destroy for the temple of god is holy which temple ye are and oh by the way he has every right to do it because it's his temple but when in love he gives us so much blessing and for the christian his grace and dwelled by the holy spirit we continue to pursue sin and he convicts and and many times the lord will will throw things in our pathway to to stop us and yet i've seen christians who just increase their efforts so climb over the barriers and they'll just keep right on going well when that happens destruction will follow many times this kind of person is bewildered as to why god would respond so strongly after repeated attempts to turn them back they often don't think that they didn't do anything as bad as deserves the treatment well here's what you have to remember first of all sin offends god but secondly think about all that god has invested as he did with israel to show favor and kindness and blessing and then to just push that all aside and go on what an offense to god the real question is this how bad is it to be the recipient of god's favor for years and then to spurn his grace now in verse 8 following we'll see that sins of israel turn to as they turn their backs on backs on god's grace once again there are stark and shocking reminders as we look at israel of our nation today but take heart i love the pictures in scripture and as we close tonight israel the unfaithful wife of jehovah pictured as a vineyard that had all these things given and rejected it christian let me encourage you tonight yeah we face sin we can be tempted but let me encourage you with the fact that the picture that we see here in isaiah 5 is carried over into john chapter 15. and you'll remember there that as jesus addresses his bride here's what he says the father doesn't just have one vineyard israel a vineyard that produce wild grapes but when we get into john 15 the father has another vineyard and here's what jesus taught and you can go over and look at it he says i am the vine my father is the husbandman and he says you all are the branches now if we will just yield ourselves abide in the vine the scripture tells us that that through that vine comes all the nourishment that we need so that we don't have to bring forth bitter fruit we can bring forth good grapes plentiful multiplied and yet if we don't yield to the spirit of god we're going to be like israel the fruit's going to look just like israel but the good news is in christ in the vine you and i can yield to him and a while back we preached through that passage and and what an encouragement that even branches that don't bring forth fruit like they need to the imagery there the teaching is that the lord bends down and he picks up those those branches and he cleans them up and he ties them back up so that they're out of the muck and the mire so that again they can bring forth fruit that is god's perspective on us and yet if we're not going to abide in the vine we become worthless branches again and so my challenge to you tonight is to consider what god said to israel god's judgment on his worthless vineyard and remember that through the work of christ now we are part of a new vine an eternal vine where we can continue to bring forth fruit but in your flesh in my flesh we're not going to be able to bring forth good things but as we yield to the spirit of god we can bring forth fruit to his glory fruit that remains aren't you glad tonight you're not the vine i don't have to be the vine some christians are wearing themselves out trying to be the mind you and i are privileged to be the branches just abide in yield and let him do his great refreshing work through you let's stand together father thank you for the example of israel lord we're reminded that the fact that there's a nation of israel today that there was a nation through which you brought forth the messiah and that there will be a nation when messiah comes back to the earth lord we're reminded at your work and you get all the glory and then when we look at the church today so many who are lukewarm those who profess to know you and yet their lives are bringing forth wild grapes father again we give you praise because you're building your church but lord help us to do our part to walk with you and to abide in the vine and lord we pray that when you come back we'll be found ready and the lord you'd be pleased with our lives thank you for the time together tonight lord please give safety to our church family as we head to our homes keep us healthy lord help us to be fruitful for you in jesus name amen [Music] you", "yISdDlOVk8I": "so many dresses tonight so thanks for

name of the Father the Son the Holy Spirit okay so SBC members the school the committee are parents of prisoners okay and so I was having took a lot of effort to get done it and it was it was great and fun and we would've had meetings till midnight if we didn't have other obligations forget this mom how much you getting because I don't know cute kids but they're all interested in money right how much do you doing this yes you give your time talent and treasure the things that are important to you he asked me for my American Express today because for 1950 very important positions this is what I really feel about coming up to prices became whether it's the school or the parish I don't come up and volunteer because I feel like I have to write no guilty I actually want to be here helping and engaging so I'm just honored to have had the opportunity we all on that specie you want to make the ctk parish in school the best that it can be and I have a couple disclosures and I see that did dr. Murphy back there so he is actually going to understand when I say that we lecture medical students all the time we're the smartest people in the room on that day because I'm a board certified internist rheumatologist and I'm talking to pursue medical students so I always know more than they do I do not know more than the jury of you in this room on these topics okay so forgive me if I present anything that's not perfect or a little bit off it was all done with the best of intentions I am also undoubtedly not the most pious person look at these antique medals and I have something I think about the faith of the little ol grandma that has her medal and she rubs it and and I really want that so if you're out there and you kind of scrub all I want her to preach to anyone if you know we're all welcome at this table we all come as we are so thank you for being caring and there's a lot a lot a lot of information so we're going to go kind of fast to get through it all like if you have any additional questions any of the committee members will stay out there and we can have additional meetings so whenever I give a talk I have to sit down and think how did I get here I bet I had a good idea and so on this case a couple years ago we had a bunch of teachers leaving and I don't know I trust mr. Sorrell and everyone had a good reason to leave but it was a lot of teachers so I was like do we have a problem because you know the parents all kind of talked probably maybe we don't so I started to look for the answers and this is what happens on my computer at work because it's like a meetin Ella you have a problem and diagnose it and hit this button and I pushing the button and I'm still not getting any answers because I don't understand it so down this hall I have this great colleague his name is Jeff you he's an immunologist and he was on the archdiocese Board of Education and in 2005 st. Cecilia's had a grim reality and they were at risk of going under their school was and so I said to Jeff what did you guys have this all work out so we did this great exercise we formed a sense to the Board of Education of we sort of looked at all the finances and trying to figure it out and he gave me this 30 page document and I actually read it I thought that's really interesting I learned a lot so my sisters and my brother took mr. su grandfather cook to lunch and we had this wonderful discussion about didn't really have a problem and mr. Sorrell and me maybe we have a problem we kind of like how Jeff feel and Cathedral did all this work and so father Foreman committee and then he asked me to be in charge that hardly accepted at this time but it's been wonderful so what colors and the SPC kind of came up with is our charge was to comprehensively summarize the relationship between the parish in the school identify and analyzed school's current and future needs and suggest if I took an action plan to address the needs identified for the school within the framework of the parish okay so if you're an SBC committee member could you stand up so I would like to thank you all for all of our baby [Music] [Applause] I love the talk we gave last night but I was remiss in one aspect I did not as the teachers present - please stand up so mrs. Chuck was here last night and Miss Ritter so you are a teacher in the school could you please stand up [Music] [Applause] so we're gonna hope to not let me know and then for other nonsensical families I hope you'll know is your super Eleazar administrator to their principal so I'm mrs. Becker was here last night this is my title so again our floor this is Flo this was model that between Cecilia's we had clothes meetings of invited guests so people could be feel incredibly free to have open conversation and then sometimes it was contempt not really contentious but just we talked about difficult topics and they're invited really we stay in our lane so we don't evaluate or make recommendations on educational curricula or scheduling at the school we don't have access to know where we discuss or O'Kane upon any confidential matters related to school or parish personnel so those are kind of the ground with you guys who can talk about whatever you want tonight but we will adhere to these rules so we talked about we have these topics really well laid out foundations and the parish in school what is a Catholic school all about I didn't grow up in going to a Catholic school so I kind of was new to this we really wanted to hear feedback from both the families and the teachers so we've spent significant amount of time developing surveys and analyzing them we looked at how the parish fit in the archdiocese and into the whole religion and how the school fit in as well we looked at all the different committees and financial structure we dive into the educational trust and we have trust number come and talk to us we really were interested in the teacher salary benefits and mr. Sorrell went to great lengths to get all of that information for us when I know with the school needs workable you know capital expenses and resources human resources we have an amazing speaker of two speakers on the arch from the archdiocese about looking at where where our religion is going and some of the struggles our religion has had in the past couple of years we learned from Nick Cramer how to fundraise and that was incredibly eye-opening and then you are a part of our action plan so we're going to touch on all of these topics so that's kind of an outline so we're lucky enough to know this guy Monsignor huh was he just amazing okay tonight thinking this guy was amazing this book the dawn of new parish is available in the rectory if you haven't read it it's actually a nice little read and it's really informative so father Robert Huck was born at why not Nebraska in 1915 he was an associate pastor at several parishes including st. Margaret Mary's he was a chaplain in World War two for the Navy and he founded Christ the King he was the executive director of oyster he was appointed by Gerald Ford to be a delegate at large to the United Nations and has designated a Monsignor in 1985 he passed away in 2003 st. Roberts Church was was developed in his honor so that's why that is called st. Roberts so I'm sorry I've never met him but I feel a little bit so he was out in the middle of nowhere and he got this letter from Archbishop Gerald T bourbon and in May of 1953 he was told I really need you to come back and start this new parish they had a new parish an improper really long time I need someone super smart and energetic and I've chosen you and he said okay so he showed up when he arrived in 1953 Juhu with the you shoving his shaggy dogs eat his Navy basket and a shotgun and he bumped in an orphanage and he tried to start this parish now I would think that he would be given sort of resources in a stretcher system now he's got a title to 1328 there's a plan and said go so the ladies the st. Martin Mary walked the 20 miles and they developed the parish rules and they started giving money he held the first dance I started the first mass and then PD Park dance hall so that made me him to go about an hour early and clean up the trash off the floor from the night before so and the ushers eventually helped out did any of you remember the color the carpet in our church many of you remember what color was our cover yes it was blue you know why because that was the color of a trim at the peeny park dance hall and so in homage to that key we had that blue carpet which I remember the kid coming here and think is this is the wildest carpet but you've gone out on the river peace everywhere so does anyone recognize this destruction start Jim right okay so I can see it here so I'm going to just read a quote by my senior hub because I when I read this I thought well this is this is odd why we say this he said from my earliest years in seminary it was very obvious to me that parishes with great schools were far superior to those about schools should I ever be pastored a parachute out of school I thought I would do my best to build one for that reason first priority was given to a school for Christ became parish so they built the school first and after that was done they moved masses from kingi Park dance hall and by the way fatherhood was also driving a bus back in court taking kids back and forth Athena marker and then they built the parish and I thought you know I liked my parish growing up we didn't have a Catholic school what's the big deal about that and so then I started really diving into the information that Jeff's people gave me and I also read a book about I could talk to you about that later about how Catholic education and Americans started all the way back to the pilgrims but we don't have time for that tonight so in this in this some information from Jeff co-op I read this and this was very formative to me it said that the school is a formation ministry that's distinct from a service ministry within the parishes over a whole mission the school formed students and other academic disciplines of course but the school also exists for religious and spiritual formation for the students and their families the school ministry is by the Church's teaching meant to reinforce the religious formation started and nurtured in the family the primary unit formation and I'm just gonna be honest with you Tony I live in this cute little house on 59th Street and we just had done this big remodel and I looked at st. Margaret Mary that's a good school but it was really crowded and some of my siblings kids went to Christ the King and I told them we should look at the Christ King it's gonna be a great school I was completely in the private Academy mindset I had no idea of the importance of the school and how it all fit in with the parish until I went through this year-long exercise so for me personally it was really formative and if that's how I feel I'm thinking that maybe some of you out there might have come into it with the same idea maybe everyone's just smarter than me on this but having never been in Catholic education it's kid I just I missed the boat on this so I only put this slide up because we might talk about increasing enrollment a little bit but if you look in 1967 there were 900 children can you imagine do you remember that Wow and a lot of nuns to help break [Music] and then you know they kind of working were fitting medicine to price easier is definitely so as part of our review and I'm not going to read all of this but I invite all of you to go to the Christ the King website where they and brandon has done a really nice job on the website we've done our mission statements our relief statements to committee reviews the hierarchy of our parish I'm not going to go through all that there's a very long report that's going to come with this project when we're done and we've got all about outlined in there and then our school all of our mission is preparing Christian leaders for academic excellence and a Christ centered environment and so again we kind of anonymous to all of this I thought well who's in charge of this like who's over the school do you guys know this over the school but he's like so here's table so check appeal my son's in his opposite job not for me and I'll make a slide so this is how we kind of fit in so there's the bishop who's actually in charge of everything right in the archdiocese and then he's got the Catholic schools office with dr. action who's wonderful he's our superintendent who said the minimum standards academic and religious formation Sanders and it comes down to the individual school so mr. Suder elephant principal we have an archdiocese Education Committee that's advisory here and this is the one my friend dr. it's on and then father comes in here he's got a bit he's over the over mr. Serano school and then we've got a bi-directional flow of information there may be a couple other advisory committees in here but in general this is the oversight so there's a lot of room for individual decisions at the local level because of the different needs and locations and people in the parish so a lot of information and a lot of what we do there the school does it's not standardized across the archdiocese and that is one of the main problems when we try to dial in and see what how do we compare so just want to put that out there and now I'm going to talk a little bit about the finances so these are really high you know high value numbers these are the 2018-19 budgetary projections that actual numbers have not been released out of committee yet but this is what we were going on so this is what we're presenting tonight so if you look you can see that this is roughly a four million dollar corporation that is happening right as we are sitting here and so fathers in charge of that so in addition to everything else he does he's running are sort of our numbers and the biggest component of the revenues are tightening at about two million dollars and the second is tuition and fees okay so 3.8 million and employee expenses biggest expense not just at the school but also at the parish we have about six hundred and sixty thousand in maintenance facilities and utilities for a expenditure of 3.9 so I think it's pretty common that you know that the expenditures exceed the revenues and so we have to make up the gap meg lovely father did such a great job paying off our debt that we're in a much better position but that that took some effort salaries go up by about 3% per year and benefits have increased by 8% of the last two years so there are some costs that are going up and if any of you own small businesses you know that those employee expenses go up every year we've also got some upcoming capital expenditures and those are also in the handout so these are we got 2019 2020 19 20 22 and then also like doe wishlist right if we can give me money started raining from the sky this is what we would like to do so if you look at the outlay of that there's about 1.7 million dollars if we have lots of of money to do things with so we put those in there not to talk about school finances so some of you have seen this I released this with the survey result but it costs for every child we priced the king it costs seventy seven hundred dollars per child okay so if you are a member of the parish your tuition is three thousand one hundred seventy dollars we have a multi child family the first two children full-tuition the second ones half tuition and everyone after that is no tuition there is a gap of four thousand five hundred thirty dollars and this gap has to come from somewhere or we're going to have to pay full tuition so Tom McGill did this nice charity broke it down and you can see that the light blue are things that the school families can participate in so school family tithing pays for 20% of that lunch extended care another revenue six the gap fund is to sew the gap fund is what father sends a peel out for specifically to make up the gap the parent sees works though also contribute two percent the educational trust and I don't know how many of you from are familiar with the net trust we're going to go into that cover 17% and not the school family tithing covers 12% so people who do not have any children in the school are funding 12% of every child's education okay so combine the educational trust and non school family tightening for by 29% of to educate each student so we're going to look into that a little bit without the parish there can be no school that makes sense to all of you right it's picking up of a significant cost of each child's education so what's the educational trust everyone on the committee got a copy in the trust documents I don't know how many you've ever seen the trust documents but they look like this I took pictures of my documents and in January I meant to me pressures with amazing foresight about let's come up with a mechanism to find some of the operating expenses of the school and they called it the ctk educational trust and if all of these original people signed on and they had to give $200 to start the trust so I would make them and educational trust structure I am NOT a trust attorney so I did that but we did the best we could but the managing trustee is the pastor the board of trustees is the pastor Plus 15 additional members and their representative of various Christ to keen committees it's irrevocable and not voluntarily terminable there have been two amendments the 1988 minute and 15 trustees instead of 11 and the 1995 amendment just brought it into compliance with the archdiocese so if price that keen becomes insolvent or goes under all the funds from the educational trust roll into the archdiocese Education Foundation okay but short of that this is our money I don't it can't be touched I took this word for the purpose of the trust the trust documents pretty long but there's really only five main things that you need to look at the rest is all legal okay so what is the purpose it provides supplemental funding of Catholic programs and services in Christ the King parish it aids assistant Foster's in the need for the attainment of and the maintenance of total organize comprehensive Catholic educational programs at the parish and or the educational institutional level its to encourage a renewed commitment to the Roman Catholic school at leave effective instrument available to teach doctrine build community and serve the needs of the Catholic membership in our parish it provides a depository tradition be present and operates within the 501 C 3 of the IRS okay so this is the purpose of the trust the original goal of the founders of the trust was to fund one-third of the school's operating expense currently it by 17% the principle balance is six million dollars I know you guys probably aren't well versed in foundations as I was not but you should not cannot touch the principle so the principle fluctuates based on the market and we make interest off of that it is that interest that then we can use to fund the operating expenses of the school so it's variable each year okay to fund one third of the expenses the original role of the trustees we would need that trust to be about twelve million dollars so we would have to double the trust so if anyone wants to write that check right now with his copy it and go home thank you for laughing I hope and I'm looking out there no but you know doubling the trust is a big undertaking obviously but it's really important for our school okay so the trust has some restricted use funds so what does that mean of the six million dollars 1 million dollars of the principal are earmarked okay so for example the aunt on my son got the alumni scholarship so we got some of our tuition offset which was great for me but it didn't do anything for the operating expenses of the school okay so we only have about the intercept of about five million dollars and and some of the annual spiced fundraiser dollars go towards the trust but because we're suspending of all of the interest and we haven't gotten a lot of infusion into the principal at Statman and we're not really growing that much so we're sort of stuck at 17% okay this eight to me was one of the most eye-opening parts of this exercise for me and right okay this is not a private Academy this is actually your sort of need to be involved in the parish for this to work the best way that it should monsignor hubs vision you need to engage with the parish and one what does that mean and we talked about time talent and treasure so I'm going to talk about treasure so this is the same year 2017 or 2018 19 projections this is information from rictus Eric who's wonderful of an idiot financial questions this is the annual typing for the school families we have no idea that the families are and father doesn't know that the families are because he doesn't want to know he doesn't want that to be involved but these are the numbers Rick gave me so you can see that 35 school families tithe not a nickel to the parish and the 65 school families tied less than $1000 now there could be a lot of reasons that half of our school families aren't putting money to it to the parish maybe they have other places they're putting money maybe they can't rub two nickels together and the most they can do is their time in their talent and I accept that but I think that this might actually signal in this connective 17% of families except in parish tuition with no marriage typing and and maybe some people are giving cash it's not fact okay so this is not judgment this is just what do people think this will mean because maybe and I argue with this with my husband that's my office and I'm always right you tell you that this is my metrics for we have a disconnect between the school and the parish so I don't know that you can use that as a metric I don't know what else to use this isn't this is a bad so I just asked you to reflect on that a little bit and you know as a committee we were kind of stymied so we went back to that 2005 document that I showed you and we said okay what is the purpose of the school what does this whole families think the purpose of the school is is it critical for religious and spiritual formation or is it critical for formation academic disciplines or is it so we can't just take a poll because you know there's bias and the people I talk to so we decided to make a survey and we spent probably two months developing this survey and we developed a list of questions for topics we felt we're going to be really important for us to understand because you know we are we are the pressures we are the school parents but you guys are really the people that kind of drive it so we made lists and then this is my buddy Harlan he is a lot of fun because you can tell you the statistician and we spend a lot of time together he has not happened but he was fascinated by all of this I mean who's always coming in my office so I thank him because he's kind of a serving guru in the University of Nebraska and we got into Survey Monkey and we developed this survey of 5 pages and 20 questions and so thank you all for doing the survey we sent it out on January 24th and there is an over 80% response rate that's huge that gives us amazing data so when you look at internal on its external survey that you get 40 percent internally if you're in medical literature if you get over 60% survey response rate that is pristine but to get 8 he made us feel really good and it made us feel like you care you actually wanted to to have a say and somebody thank you we did both quantitative and qualitative analysis on that so what do I mean quantitative means well we just picked how many people said this so it could give you a number or any percentage the qualitative part of it a lot of people wrote a lot of information so Harlan and I kinda did animatic analysis and we're not going to get into statistics about but I felt pretty good by the time I got back to the committee that we knew what we were dealing with every single comment that someone took time to type out on her iPhone or on their computer was reviewed by me and at least one or two other people again immense Tanner Lane what a lot to say about a lot of different things and it was something on the parish line I went to the Father cooking found a boy and if it was on the school side it went to Tom and mr. sprout and the comitia Kenan didn't kind of enter in intervene in all of those areas but any feedback is important and needs to be you listened to so we thank you for that so you've all seen this because if you read your email but you get a lot of emails so we release this information but one question that we wanted to know the most was what do you think Christ keeps you mean and 66% of you thought that academic excellence is equally an important spiritual and religious formation we personally we thought that was the right answer so we were glad that we were all kind of there but 26% thought that probably academic was more important than the spiritual formation that the through spiritual religious formation isn't important but it missions an academic excellence was more important so kind of in that private academy field where I came from and then others thought that spiritual and religious formation was more important than academic excellence so 7% so those are the numbers and that helped inform us to these questions one the school could remain afloat physically without support we perish while the majority of you disagreed with that so that's good we were trying to figure out do we need to educate people a little more because education is powerful there are no bad actors in this they're just sometimes like I was uninformed the school that remained fiscally solvent or fiscally afloat without support from the Trust's okay people understood the trust was important what about an increase in the current funding sources in order to retain one of our greatest assets which is our faculty our teachers yeah people said yeah we need to get more money to pay people and the this one would you be willing to pay more money they actually said yes we will pay more tuition okay we're feeling pretty good at school family participation of the parish is important to merit the parishes continued funding of the school the majority of people so red and blue here agree crisis King School is meeting my needs again majority of agreed and Christ keen parish is eating my needs the majority agree so we thought okay we're doing things right nobody has seen these numbers not release these so this was kind of a temperature thing that we wanted to know in terms of at least engagement in the parish does your family attend Mass every week or almost every week 58% okay where did he go Christ the King 71% do you go to reconciliation and I have to say that after your beautiful Tuesday nights Mary and I are are going to be lined of the Father gave this wonderful talk on reconciliation but it was great but no 57% of us do not regularly go to reconciliation and then communication is constantly a theme some people say communications right some people say communication is not so good so we were trying to figure out how to improve communication so if people want email okay so what about the thematic mountains well we have some real strengths in our school academic excellence I mean our teachers nerd minister eager to do a great job teaching our kids how to read write do math all of that that's wonderful the state formation is also excellent I learned things from my kids all the time things I should probably know our faculty are the biggest blessing the biggest asset the biggest resource that was common theme we have a vibrant and engaged community okay these are good things we can always do better so where communication a big one they errors and fear out there that our teachers will leave because we aren't going to pay them enough because the culture is not right I don't know there is just that this is a big concern there relies the comments are liturgical style options and those went to he's made the changes and we'll talk about that and then there are comments about our culture and I'm not then I have to find an area to get out but kind of a lack of stability has been normalized in our society and I'm not talking about politics I'm talking about right into the grocery store and I get honked at nobody seems to give each other the benefit of doubt but we people can kind of you meet other people us teachers to students it's not okay our kids parent our words they imitate our meteors they internalize our worldview and we are a Christian Catholic community and I challenge myself every day to be better after this and I would challenge all of you to do the same that we need to be thoughtful of each other and our children and how we have to what we say so I am as guilty as anyone else in the room that's all I'm gonna say on that that was a theme in the survey I think it's real everywhere this is not unique to us I just hope we could do better so one of other teachers so mr. Sorrell and mrs. Keenan did a survey to ask the teachers what they needed and so twenty-eight teachers did the survey and their number one concern was having benefits stability okay so having salary stability knowing that they're gonna have tossed out living increases and everything else that they need they needed support positions okay hello mr. Sorrell help me I the individual educational planner okay so an IEP is to help children who need additional help for various reasons we want to give the children or we we don't have the resources that a public school has but we do have some resources so if you're if you live in district 66 and your child has an extra needs to website sends people over to help which sounds amazing and it is but that requires a lot of coordination on behalf of our teachers and pulling teachers on a different places and so they said a resource specialist could really help with that and then teacher days particularly in some of the younger kids rooms would be good and then teacher development so you know a lot of our teachers have teaching your degrees they know how to do that but they get extra training and Faith Formation kind of teach our children of the faith formation so they were doing the school of faith before and I'm trying to not to show what has changed but mr. Sorrell mrs. Becker have done this really amazing thing and I'm sure he'll talk to you about it but change to love faith which the teachers went to previously into real time anything it's been really well received so those are the three things that they three of the things that they wanted so now let's talk about salary information so again there's a standard structure among public and parochial schools at least in in terms of House salary is determined there is base pay astounded by our education level from a bachelor's or master's and there's a stat pay based on your years of service with these milestones 5 10 15 20 so you get an automatic one of my 5% increase per year with an additional 1.5 percent increase when you attain the milestones but the base pay make a change okay so what their salary range at Christ the King so really want you to reflect on the 31 510 because if you break it down on monthly that would be really challenging I think for many people to live on it yet these are what our teachers are doing they're really important so that's a starting salary now just ask me mr. Sorrell what it is in public schools and it's not that much more and then if you have over 30 years experience in a master's degree it's about sixty four thousand so just reflect on those numbers that's what our teachers are doing for us that that kind of pay ninety five percent single so individual and fifty percent family medical benefits and we show you the comparators that we have - this is just kind of what we have because it's a really nice benefits package we have a 403 B retirement where they can get an automatic three percent with no waiting period and then if they choose to donate or to donate gosh to contribute an additional three percent then we match up so a maximum nitrogen that they get a ten percent tuition discount of 10% tuition that's our year with the maximum fifty percent disability insurance six days of paid time off which is this is then there's a 30-day rollover so you can cash that out of con separation they get student lunch prices and I'm in the lunch line I really might see if a teacher come through I really kind of not well the one day that I've been free before an aftercare which could be huge for people with suppose children they're required before and after care and if you know it's you it's here so how do we prepare again if comparative compensation information exists it was not readily available so when we talk about kind of the whole picture its compensation so what your salary is what your benefits are and what your culture is in terms of how do the teachers feel about staying on and not going elsewhere okay so we're going to dive in on these two we talked a little bit about culture so there are these advisory groups that mr. Sorrell please correct me if I'm wrong where you can meet with principals and administrators from other schools and they sort of I don't know if it's Mormon support group as well are they just bounce ideas off of each other so it's called Deanery and our eight schools in our deanery and then he got four additional schools to contribute information trying to get as much as we could and many of them are similar in demographics and location and ask them about their total compensation and again it's not standardized but all the administrators were very interested in getting this information so I think everyone tried to participate but it is very hard to compare so compared among twelve Catholic schools of us include about the salary so a new teacher who makes about 31,000 and you add the benefits on so single rate medical last year we were fourth out of twelve and this year were third out of our teachers did get some reasons which is great now the seasoned teacher that we talked about in 2018 2019 we raise six out of 12 and in 1920 we ranked 5 out of 12 so maybe it wasn't as bad as I thought but still we could do better and the ones out west compete with Miller to have higher never to students for classes so 30 kids in a classroom instead of 20 how about the benefits this is what we have I showed you among all the schools prepared we have the best medical package available okay single benefits for the compared schools range in 50 to 95% we're at 95% and family benefits 7 schools did not offer any family benefits 65% in one school but they didn't give a 95 percent to the individual Valley gave a 70% so we thought we have pretty good for to the medical benefits how about retirement we had the best retirement package among the 12 schools no other schools offered a similar match and require our waiting period we had the highest tuition discount at 50% many schools have no tuition discount where the only schools offer reduced lunch prices I matters sisters that doesn't matter so much we spend a lot of money on salary I you know if I got it she threw lunch something good for an after care we don't only one dog her before and after care so we said how do we generate around this and so Tim Braun I said well you're the numbers guy on this committee what can we put a number on what that's worth we thought maybe roughly $3,000 I remember some teachers don't don't take the medical as maybe their spouse has better medical baby they don't have a kid maybe they don't like school lunch I mean so not all of the teachers are participating in all of the benefits available but that's a really individualized situation so but some of the teachers could significantly benefit from it so that time where we suited with the teachers so pretty good benefits package pretty low salaries I think we could all agree and I know that if again my dream of money raining from the sky and father and mr. Sorrell would be happy to pay the teachers it's hard to be a cat for the past years there's been a lot of stuff that's really kind of pulled it or heartstrings and I know it's made me question and we wanted to figure out what all of that and so Jen Monzer who is one of our parishioners and Annie deca from the Archdiocese office of evangelization consistory my spacing thought came and spoke with us and I would encourage father to have them come back here and for all of you to come and listen to what they have to say it was fascinating so they asked the first question they asked us was in the setting of the most transformative period of history with respect to increasing secularism and social movement how do we adapt and spread the gospel within a modern and a rapidly changing world it was like what are we going to talk about here so let's talk about it there are 1 million people living in our archdiocese ok 235 thousand of them are baptized to register Catholics our migration is outpacing in migration so where does not having as many babies people are moving to start B County you know and so you're we are melting we're shrinking okay now I really purposely put the Wicked Witch up here because I saw that as a kid and I kind of have this negative visceral reaction to the witch and I kind of had the same negative visceral reaction when we talked about this so there's a decreasing religious affiliation was six times as many leaving the church compared to entering it four times as many becoming unaffiliated comparatives county religion religious and school parents generation Z those are our kids they're becoming atheists and I just told you I kind of trouble so that surely don't want my children to struggle or faith because it's it's what tennis takes them when they have the absolute worst mess in their lives that are coming for everybody and I thought geez that's really frightening to me and Sarge like the diluent innocent and looking there are books written out there for targeting teenagers talk to them about what's it going to be like to be an atheist if you choose this and so to me I thought this is really a red flag this really is something that we need to think about very carefully so if I'm going to sum it up for you a little bit the parishes who are one family one economic entity with upcoming expenses that exceed the current sources of revenue the purpose of this law is to religious and academic information this is not a private Academy the school cannot exist without parish support the enrollment the well-being of the school moves into sync with out of the parish and the demographics of our religion are changing over all types of Keene parish Christ the King school are doing so many things right so I focus kind of on the problems but in general we are a very healthy engaged vibrant successful parish school but I also think you can always do better and I really struggle with I lost a little bit of sleep try to figure out why can't I come up with the bigger conclusion the aha moment anything it's because we're dealing with two really different concepts right we've got the tangibles are the abstracts your attitudes perceptions cultures your relationship with God your faith who am I to stand up here and tell any of you how to act or what to believe I can't and then concrete I got numbers rejection stats history I can tell stories about Monsignor hub you're like a plan to thank you but that's where I live that's where I'm comfortable it's this my variance I don't have any good answers other than just to talk about it so what exome each of you here is to come reflect about the intangibles just think about how they might inform the country going forward because you guys kind of get that you buy you know you know defense a so we are at me not be you mr. soprano sonica by the poi have already had some changes in response to the family survey the survey so communication it's been an issue so the educational scenario board has established a subcommittee on communication of public relations teacher salaries have increased approximately ten percent over the past two years I think they may be at a fourth at a 6% increase still like to do we have kindness 2019-20 theme is building relationships with God's self and others no expectations for families again we can all do better there's a differentiated mass dialogue I've checked out the new masses they are s described and I think there are more people in the pews so I'm really excited that mr. Sorrell has worked on the teachers schedules try to simplify um in common plan times it doesn't work for everyone but they're thinking about it and then we've got the replace the faith component of the teacher in-service new approach of the teachers request so we were like saying we hear you okay so how do we fix it okay well I can't fix the intangibles because that's father's like work and he's going to work on that but though we have to it'd be great to increase revenue so how do we increase revenues well we could increase tuition we could just ask everyone to pay seventy seven hundred dollars and that would be done but we just don't want to do that and no child no child or family should be denied a Catholic education based on the ability to pay but you will find the money it's really important but we need to have balanced and thoughtful increases and we do not the committee think that that multi-child family discounted she should change it's actually pretty small in overall dollars so we can increase enrollment not the nine hundred but currently at three fifty seven including preschool can accommodate more students it would have low marginal cost we could increase diversity which would be wonderful keep a small classroom feel and the teachers are not specifically about this which would be okay at the classroom size increases and they work the we need to understand the critical role of parish title for school support it's really important we need to continue our current efforts and we do a great job we're all motivated to do this but overall this is only covering and a small what 2% of the cost to educate our students but thank you and yes we're doing a good job we need a significant infusion of monies into the educational trust so we thought about a capital campaign just let's do it it sounds great and we would really recommend unrestricted funds to the principal because if you tie the hands of the Board of Trustees they cannot delegate the funds where they need to be so how does the capital campaign it sounds like a good idea until I heard about what it was and I thought well we got to be ready for this to make my your camp and he said you need to determine your needs you can usually raise two and a half times operatory if you got a higher firm $15,000 just to study it and then eighty to one hundred thousand dollars for the campaign to have a staff member on site to help takes about six months there's an early sign of things where they're actually raising money we want to be successful and then this is the active phase so you gotta form committees you need about a hundred and thirty volunteers each volunteer has to agree to meet with 1,200 pressure drop families got to meet with people you you have to ask them for money I said what I'm gonna go up to people I've never met and ask them for money how to do that okay I can do this you know what he said was bottom line this is a huge effort and the parachute we emotionally and fiscally financially prepared to engage and that volunteer fatigue can be real so I'm going to take a little break we'll be ready if we decide to go that route to go up can you guys all love for money but this is this could be really important but we need to be thoughtful about it so wrap up and final recommendations so you honest feedback again this is not the SBC's committee parish school this is your school your parish talk to us tell us what we're missing what we forgot what you need and then we want to figure out if we can recommend some mechanisms and a timeline to accomplish the promotion of parent engagement increasing enrollment thoughtfully and the consideration of a capital campaign and again that I do thank mr. sagrado and all the teachers who make rice to keep school such a wonderful place and for father Boyd father cook for really trying to evangelize those of us who were only possibly catechized and I'm gonna leave you with a message from Pope Francis just to reflect on and he says I invite all Christians everywhere at this very moment to a renewed personal encounter with Jesus Christ or at least at least an openness to letting him account for them I asked all of you to do this unfailingly each day no one should think that this station is not meant for him or her or any of you out there since no one is excluded from the joy brought by the Lord so you know this was very formative for me personally I learned a lot and I hope that this top has been informative for many of you if you have more interest in digging into surveys the educational trust the demographic of the church the church finances wherever we have more data than you would ever want to see and I we have about a 50 page report but it will also be available as well and so I thank you for coming for participating for being here part of our parish and our", "l-MP3_9dkkE": "yeah thank you money time and its mother  yo jump i make dollars it don't make sense

and his name is dr. Steven Davis let's see if he's there dr. Davis is this you oh he can't hear me because I didn't turn the music down dr. Davis can you hear me yes okay great to have you calling us from the the this the state of New Jersey from Newark New Jersey one of the best states in the Union oh wow all this accolade I don't know how to accept it don't because I don't really mean the thing I'm high I figured as much you know well well I I need to caution you as we begin our discussion this morning because Karen is always saying that you and I sound like two old grumpy men oh that's what she keeps saying really yeah she does you know what yeah if I know her yeah she heard that and she's probably in her automobile on her way to the beautiful state of New Jersey Oh to talk with you so watch out really have going for it is that you know she's a New Yorker that's true she's in New Yorker yes she's a New York and you know what she still sounds that way yes she still talks that way I've tried to change her I really have tried to change her and she keeps mocking me talking about car and javed she keeps mocking me and she will not change so what we'll just have to work on well you know you know they'll say that you know that New York and Joisey you know we're very common I'm gonna get away from this because I have to go home I can't that's right well how are you for the new year well I was just gonna share something that we did on Sunday which worked very well I was very concerned about what we did but it worked very well so on Sunday I'm putting together a couple teaching series for the congregation and I really haven't finished putting it completely together and so in the interim I was sitting and I was watching a pastor on YouTube pastor I can't think of his his name but it'll come to me in a minute pastor Jenkins from the Glen Glen Aden in in Maryland and he's grown his congregation from 500 when he took it over to about 11,000 and it's doing some very good things the largest actually the largest church in Maryland and it does a lot of good work in the community and in the city so I listen to a message entitled running with the horses and he was actually preaching at TD jakes is church he was a guest at TD jakes his church so I listened to the message about an hour long I was crying through the entire message and broken at the end and I said what up what a powerful message he brought to Texas and he brought to everybody who was able to see it via the streaming and he just talked about the foot soldiers and they and the horses out of the book of I'm from correct out of Jeremiah and talking about the wicked prospering and the complaining how we as Christians complain a lot if we're complaining when the foot soldiers are coming what are we gonna do when the horses come and so it's a powerful message and he I said I want my my congregation to hear and see this message and I asked myself a question could in would the congregation sit and watch a video rather than having a live speaker because I wasn't going to extend an invitation for him to come to Boston I felt that I needed to try this dr. Davis the people in the congregation will on their feet they were applauding they were a mening and and and what what what struck me the means why I'm raising it with you now and I want to say good morning to a lot of Harris was on with us this morning on Facebook live is that when I speak at Grace Chapel in Lexington at their church if I'm correct they have five campuses so when I speak at the main campus all the other campuses wants my message via video because I can't be live in all five places in person but I can be live by the video I know that here in Boston we have a Black Muslim temple and when I Drive by it every once in awhile it says Minister ferrant can to speak on this topic on on Sunday at ten o'clock and I'm asking myself the question is Minister Farrakhan coming to Boston the response to that is no he's in Chicago and he's speaking via video to all of the Muslims temples in the country and on and on and on I can go how many congregations are utilizing video as a way of bringing guest speakers and topics into their churches I had three TVs in the front of the church and I had two projectors on the wall so that I had five visuals for people to watch it and after the service I gave the altar call people responded it was a it was a powerful time and I knew I explained to the congregation why I was going via video this morning and I said be patient and listen and five minutes into the message his hot connected to the hots of the people at the church and and and not only did our people get to see it but we added live and streamed it live all over the country amazing amazing have you ever tried video early in the morning yes we did an entire movie oh that company out of Georgia that uh they did the I think I believe it might have been their first a second one okay calling called against the Giants or something like that okay and it was an it was about a Christian high school and how their football coach had worked you know with the players and it totally revived the entire high school campus right and we did that and the people loved it I personally believe that they are just there are definitely different venues that that we should use you know things like that you know I I briefly heard the gentlemen going through a Facebook okay and but you know I you know I'd be the first to say ain't let's try it for morning service thank you right the only thing that scares me though is well I guess it shouldn't I shouldn't be afraid of it is the time you know how long well that was the other thing that that got me and so as I was processing on this I said well if God has led you to add this in your church then he oh he already knows the time yeah and his message was one hour long and a couple people had asked me the question do you think that your congregation was sit for the hour and I said well if they need to get up and go they can up and go so you know we're usually through it's a service around around 11:30 or so 1:15 11:30 we were through at 12 o'clock nobody moved everybody stayed because the Holy Spirit was moving through all aspect of the worship service it was it was just and that it was it was a god-ordained message and I think if anybody had really moved it would have been out of disobedience because of the power of the message that was coming out so I I you know I know a lot of us do this yeah a lot of us watch the Rev the webinars on the internet I watched one the other day a guy who was talking about growing your church it was a free webinar I went on the Internet at a certain time and bang I was sitting there and I was watching it and we have many people as you you also do who are watching your streaming of your service on Sunday mornings oh yeah and so they're doing the same thing in their homes listening to you they're doing the same things we have people in the hospitals who are now able to stream on their phones our worship service so this really isn't any excuse for people to really be totally disconnected from your church family anymore because I went to my mother-in-law's rehab center and I brought my iPad and I asked if they had Wi-Fi and they said yes and I brought up James Cleveland these gospel singers and and I just allowed her to watch my iPad and she was so encouraged she was saying there was a lady sitting next to her and the lady said how did you know we needed this so desperately so it's being used you know and I felt I found it to be I found it to be in fact in my last comment on this is that there was a pastor who said many years ago when he first started his church he wanted to bring in some of these named speakers to encourage his congregation but he said that he didn't have the financial resources to bring them in so he read their books and then he conveyed the messages that they communicated in their writings to his congregation that's how we did it and I think the way that that's it's going to be done today is that we're going to convey bring these people via video because we have a license - Eddie's videos we're going to bring these videos into our church and give our give our people a taste of these gifted men and women I'm talking about men and women who walk with integrity sure bring them into our congregations and and revive our congregations with with something new so all I know is that we experience something very powerful on last Sunday and people of one of the older people the church said to me can we do that periodically and I think it's um I think it's great when it can when it could be done you know doing those things often or well I don't maybe I should say periodically often those speakers can say and can get brew - folks what you and I can't do right and I you know I so I definitely applaud it you know we've done it and and the thing about it is that it's I know I might be sound like I'm talking out both sides of my mouth but you know I know I'm gonna have some people that just who don't like it and who will leave and I'm no longer upset by that what it is is that I I look at it I said you're offending God you know you know you're not offending me you know when and I have certain folks that you know if things are not you know jot and tittle the way it's written or something like that you know they will walk out and my attitude now is while it upsets me my attitude is as the door you know we had one of our young people nine years twenty nine or eleven was 11 and on children today we have on preach and he did a great job and what he did even before he preached he gave myself and the other elders an outline of what he's going to be preaching all right and some of our people walked out and you know other people in the church you know they said wow that was fantastic you know so you're missing out on God's blessings right when you know when when you're when when you do that I'm you know it saddens me that some people can only see things you know one way we have one of our choirs is the African Ensemble and they are men and women from different countries in Africa and they got together and matter of fact they'll be singing this one day the second Sunday and they have and they are one of the choirs in the church and one of our people would leave the sanctuary when they when they say well why ah here's the reason I don't know what they're saying because they're speaking in their native language yeah but what they do is that they tell the congregation this song is about X Y Z and have even asked at times for the congregants to join in with them and the folks love it and but sadly some folks are just caught up in one stream and can only go one way well what what would happen if it because your church does this kind of outreach what would happen if your church went to another country to minister and you had to have an interpreter would they the interpreter doesn't interpret the singing the interpreter usually interprets the the preaching right but but those are people who are very scripted and limited and I I didn't tell a whole lot of people in the church that the pastor was coming by way of videos so a few people asked me who's preaching this Sunday and I said past the Jenkins and and they said oh I said yeah he's from Maryland then I kept walking because I didn't want to have a lot of negative responses or not maybe not negative responses but a lot of questioning or doubting people around me you know because God had spoken and I needed to act on what God had to say I didn't need to go around and seek the approval of anybody because God spoke to me not to them is that if I have a film a Billy Graham preacher okay these individuals who would leave when people a fellow was doing something they would stay so that we have a we have a person who's listening to us call her go ahead you live on there happy New Year to you listening to you all truly on time and my friend Makati yes so the idea of bringing in some of these speakers from around the country by way of video is not that far fest you know yeah yes dr. wall you talked about if they would go as they were going to another country yeah and everything first of all these individuals wouldn't go so you know they they that they they would though they wouldn't know and the and I told them and you know I've preached in other countries and I needed an interpreter right and you know the thing you know I again it upsets me when people want to limit the power of the gospel and you know it can only be done one way or this I remember this one gentleman told me I only read the King James I don't need these other interpretations the King James was with my mother and my father and it's good for me they limit they limit themselves because when Minister Priscilla got up and ran around the sanctuary I was hot I was gonna trip her but I decided not to because her husband was there I said her husband was there and so and so what I decided to do was I got up and I started running around the sanctuary and I I was crying throughout the entire message and and I got up after the message to speak to the people and I started crying when I was in the pulpit I said look I can't say anything like I need to just go sit down in its entirety and use it you know dr. Davis yeah why aren't you asking me to send you one of my videos okay okay fine wait a minute a video of you preacher yeah why did you ask me for one of my videos you know again we have that uh they'll be that spirit of what's the word I want to use you know you know when you go to sleep oh my god oh my god well you know for people for people to actually get up and walk out of her service my opinion is that that's their loss I remember years ago when our sanctuary was filled to capacity we would have Cameron would speak and people a couple people up in the balcony would actually get up and walk out I remember that I never paid it any attention I just I just said that there's a seat for somebody who wants to be here ah good because because there are some people who will who will want who are not in touch with God right because if they weren't what it is that you're doing is passive would resonate um you know so so when they do that I say great I don't want that spirit in this place anyway then that spirit that person needs to go and you're always going to have you know individuals like this like coming up sometimes is she I'm trying to figure out I'm sure will be before June we're going to do a one-day men's conference and it's going to be five dollars and any man can bring two friends free doctor Davis you have someone else who's just called in college I had you're live on the air that's minister that's Minister Barbara Hamilton oh yeah when I was a kid you know yeah yeah when I was a kid you know she's and she's so much much over then she's a mother of the church when you educate the congregation congregation was I was sitting in the back and so I was able to see how people were responding and they were thoroughly engaged the other thing I would say though and I would not have to what that done Austin oh no no but I wouldn't want to begin to do that awesome no to become lazy in preparing the word right or not only that but I was also thinking that something like that can be used at an adult fellowship you know in in the evening or on up on a Saturday where we're planning one in April and you know you're planning you you want me to send you my video in April but you know when you two both preached and woken you know during the benediction yes - you know that's my mother's terrible you know there is that spirit of lethargy that's what I was trying to say earlier one of them embrance that wasn't in church on Sunday that they had to dance and it was like what why they showing a video and they tried to say with the per head difficulty but another member who was there encourage them to really look at it and watch it no one day when they got passed kind of the shock of they were suddenly blessed that it was exactly what they needed I knew and there was nobody but the enemy trying to hinder them oh you know being blocked by so you know I definitely think we have to be open and within the Church of Christ has got to be open not to watering down the word but doing things differently oh yeah absolutely I remember oh Lord I guess I'm on now talk of maybe forty five years ago Minister Barbour was like I think 68 then you know and we had this musical group called black truth and we were singing in the church and summer of people ejected a pastor then how could you let them do that in the church they were sin and they were are going along with the rhythm and I remember one person accused me of dancing or something like that dr. Davis yeah pastor Barbara who was on the other line on New Year's Eve we had a service ah a Holy Ghost service the oil was was being poured on other people right and after after the service ah she had a special event for the members of the church we were in though we had hold of those party people were dancing Oh [Applause] what they do on the electric slide [Applause] [Music] everybody clap your hands yeah and you know what people people in Jordan I saw all the folk younger fall people enjoyed clean fun and it was clean fun in the church absolutely it's not first of all that's one of the interests of the ways that you're going to bring young people you know into your church secondly those folks that walked out of things like that they don't understand that a lot of the traditional hymns that we sing were actually sundown Abbas yeah well yeah well yet another DS was the beer drinking songs well you and Barbra do that now but still ah you know but it was the other beer drinking songs and what happened is that folks like John Wesley and some in some of these other folks took the melody and put the different words to it right you know some folks don't want to hear that but they don't want to know the history sometimes of what you're saying huh first of all I'm disappointed with any Church of color that will refuse any any gospel songs by Thomas Dorsey or some of those over full you know well but pastor barber are you in your van on on your way to Lexington no no I understand you have a special assignment this morning so you can arrive at the time you're going to arrive and are you still able to hear us on the on the car oh yeah I'm on 128 well I don't know why you will lose us because all you have to do is go to tune in radio and we're right there and and it will go right through this that the the speakers are though your speakers will rattle a little bit you'll still go through your speakers in your car and what about me what you just said and Beverley Byron from Boston has just joined us on Facebook live along with Aaron Jones and Elaine Daniels so we're saying blessed blessings to them for tuning in this morning you know it's funny that you mentioned you know I preached on the first Sunday okay I preached on the last Sunday of 2018 in the first Sunday of 2019 and I had recently heard from the late bishop GE Patterson the bishop in the Church of God in Christ and sadly some of my evangelical friends will turn off you know maybe a preacher from the Church of God in Christ and things like that and sadly they don't know what they missin and dr. Patterson started preaching and started talking about young preachers who will have an opportunity to preach at state and national conferences and he thinks his job is to you know give himself and you know he says uh you know he does these young preachers think that their job and preaching at these conferences is to get them on their feet and get himself and he stopped but he said but wait a minute God doesn't call you every day to have you in church the show God might have you in church to repent hmm and to you know and talked about as the old hymn says my sins my sins my Savior and you know and I quoted him on that that you know all he came and he turned to place out and I know a lot of young teachers who are about that you know about turning the bridges out right you know but what about you know instead of getting them to get turned out and start shouting get them to the mourners bench and let them look at this sin and you know stuff like that well one of the things that I talked about at the seven o'clock hour is that I wanted to challenge the church community to bring a message of hope this spring in this summer because every time we move toward the summer people are always talking doom and gloom it's the summertime and our children are out of school and and people are going to die they're going to be shocked we keep hearing that over and over from everybody and when was the last time that we heard somebody begin to talk hope about the summer we have a caller caller go ahead you're live on the air with dr. Davis and the young Bruce wall did you say sister Edna yes yes it's just the end is on the phone yeah how are you able to Oh sister Edna yeah oh great to hear from you I don't know I didn't know how you and Renee were able to do that because when a doesn't understand the technology oh my goodness [Applause] dr. Davis Vinay as you know is the administrator she's the station manager here Boston bridge radio so I don't know I don't know what I don't know what she is doing talking to sister Edna when she's supposed to be here at the station because I don't see her sister Edna are you keep are you keeping Rene from being at her station here at the station oh I don't see I don't see each of you at all so I don't I don't know how you can say yeah here Edna where are you in the building since sister Edna is one of the older ladies of the church she's not a senior yet but she's one of the older ladies and let me tell you one thing about her then out then I'll let these two ladies go so sister Edna knows that I have a very I have a strict diet because of my hot condition right so every Sunday after service we have something called hospitality so people go to the office standing right there looking at me and there is they're looking at me and Rene is looking at me so Edna has the hospitality table she is now but at the hospitality table they have cookies and cakes right yeah do you know that she's trained all the young people in the church that if I try to grab a cookie or something like that they'll say since the Edna said that you can't have she she has everybody trained so even if Edna is not here on Sunday at the hospital it's April I can only eat a bagel but I can't eat anything else a lady in the church on your people than you do you know I love a raisin bagel why are you guys talking about food when they won't let me eat Renee Renee Renee is standing outside of the studio as a matter of fact you won't believe it you know you know I have a kidney disease and I just got a lift yesterday yeah stuff that had a lot of potassium in that stuff it's you eating yeah they said that well they didn't know what I was eating but they they noticed my potassium level was higher than usual so they had that they had this list of stuff that was high in potassium which you can eat and the other stuff that was well dr. Davis now Edna is trying to keep me healthy so she has trained the church that these are all the foods that the pastor cannot eat correct Renee on the other hand she takes the same list of food and when she's not when she's upset with me she tells the whole church he can eat all that food she said he can eat the fried chicken give him yeah and Beverly Byron who was watching us right now she goes to another Church I don't know why but she goes to another Church and and if she if she was here and I'm sure she does it to her pastor if Beverly Barry was here she would also put me on restricted diet and I know her pastor listens to our broadcast in the mornings from 8:00 to 9:00 and I if he's listening does Beverly Byron put you on restrictions I'm telling you what you can't eat what you can't eat does she do that to you Pastor Beverly I did not say that I didn't ask him to say that I didn't say that I want to say good morning - sister Clements and Sandra and sister Mendez thanks for joining us - is still there watching us and and again I don't know how we I don't know how we got off topic like this I I think it was Rene and Edna who did that Rene and Edna interrupted I Flo that's what happened we're gonna bring them before the that's right bring them before the elders have [Music] I'm gonna ask Beverly Byron Beverly bearing the phone number to the studio is 6 1 7 2 a 2 0 6 8 5 6 1 7 2 a 2 0 6 8 5 Beverly give us a call we want to hear from you want to reminisce with you yeah we want to hear Beverly talk to us dr. Davis what is the last time you went to camp Pinal minister and is it still going strong no sadly no and I've even written to their Board of Directors i sat on that board for six years yeah they haven't invited me back so I don't I don't know what that means but they they're doing things in 2018 2019 yeah that they did in 1948 and it's not the same ah and when I say 1948 I'm sure you will know that there are definitely was no people of color I'll fail and now they're complaining well you know the attendance is down and things like that ended and they're still doing the same things that was done nearly 70 years ago yeah yeah and I I've made suggestions to them I've written letters to their board and they don't respond so I guess you know that's that's too bad because as you and I both know that was the highlight of 12 Baptist Church and also Calvary gospel church when when our groups came together they along with other other church folk they came and just like camp adventure was a powerful time and many of our lives when we were developing helping young people to grow into who they were going to become camp Pinal was also also an integral part of us helping to create leadership we were creating leaders for the church and leaders for the community we did both you know it's funny that you mention that because part of the message on Sunday was for people being able to articulate their faith yeah in other words tell me how you became a Christian yeah and one of our actually he is the executive minister of the church meaning that he is the second-in-command and he came to Christ at one of those events that we had at camp denial and now is the executive minister yeah you know and ordained and you know I feel quite comfortable on any occasion to leave anything everything in his hand let me ask you one last question with the time that we have remaining are you experiencing the exodus of church members who are actually having to move out of the city and move so far away that you're not able to get them to come back we don't have that much okay I mean I have one person who would travel from the branch every Sunday okay to come by side train and subway okay to come to church here and you know you're always gonna have that especially when you have a thing I have one of my newest members who's also a leader in the church they're going to be moving Oh God almost an hour away yeah and you know there's only the pastor you know I you know we're still going to be here and I like that but it wouldn't it would not surprise me if I get a call or let them you know telling me that they found a new church in their area right yeah let's go yeah that's that's going to happen it's it's being accelerated here and Boston because Boston is the fastest gentrified city in the country and met a number of churches are moving their churches to follow the people yeah so they're moving out of the city and we have a number of members who have moved out and they're in better housing you know different communities but the problem is is that we're not able to replenish oh yeah the the current when a congregation we're not able to find fast enough people to come in because so many people who like this type of ministry go into other pastures and yeah and there are already churches out there that are gonna be able to meet their needs you know you can't keep asking people some people who work in Boston yeah then they had to travel 30 40 50 miles 60 miles to go home then travel another 60 miles to come back to a Bible study on Wednesday then travel another 60 or 70 miles to go back home that's that's a lot when there are neighboring churches that have all setting up the churches are following the people understand that first of all you know we're training you congregants or we're supposed to be training you congregants to do the work of the ministry the other point is that the pastor is not the only one in the church you supposed to draw people to church you know you know you've been told to be a shepherd your job is to lead the Sheep the only time that you get the only times you go and the only time the Shepherd went behind the Sheep was to run the sheep to the slaughter and they have to understand that death that's their responsibility to go out and to reach people and and it's not just your or my responsibility it's a responsibility of the of the congregants to reach people well I have made it clear he says people don't give people people get people mm-hmm well let me also let you know that Hilliard Davis the second ah yeah is watching us on Facebook laughs all right oh and T Sleiman is watching us on faith no no II before he was born his family is we had three generations of those Davis's those are the rich Davis just not not the poor ones like me now is is Hilliard Davis when is he live he lives in hillside which is just literally right up the street from them oh okay uh-huh but he works on some crazy hours and his mom his brother really active in the church his sister just got married and moved out to Chicago Wow ah it's rather who went to be with the Lord a few years back was one of my dearest friends and one of the leaders in this church so you know he's like one of those people that Paul says I know about your grandmother Lois and about your mom Eunice so you know it falls in like that Wow do you have anything coming up all happening in your church that our audience needs to know a little bit about Sunday January 29 we will be having our 26th service 26th annual service where we pay homage and for with Police Fire EMS a number of politicians will come not just from Newark but from surrounding areas this year we're definitely having the lieutenant governor there who went to school with my wife she'll be there and this is about 26 service 26 annual service on January the 29th so come on down yes that's that's that's very good very encouraging well dr. Davis I want to thank you for - for calling in as you do on Tuesdays this is this is our time to connect and and what people do not understand so let me say it and make it be very clear this is not a radio broadcast where we're doing a lot of research so that we can talk about politics and talk about Christianity this is how dr. Davis and I would talk if we just picked up the phone and started engaging each other you wouldn't call me call me when when I'm crying I'm crying and I need help and I'm not going to tell you but I will be back in the Boston area sometimes in these in these coming months I'm not going to tell you anything specifically you're coming to do your broadcast line I'm coming to do the broadcast log and to check on you and you know the check on the fact to see if your wife is still abusing you so now you know the okay I got a few minutes so the last time I was in the hospital in August I was in there for eight days when I came into the emergency the the nurse said to me now the shock of my being in the ambulance and being having to go to the hospital was over by the time I they wheeled me into the hospital and in the nurse load the doctor was asking me questions and the doctor said how do you feel what's going on what brought you in today then the doctor said do you feel safe at home and my wife was standing there so I thought it was a an opportunity to inject some humor into a very serious event that was happening in my life and I didn't say no because I know that once you once you make a statement like that it's hard to pull it back but I hesitated I hesitated and I looked at my wife and then the doctor didn't like that it was like I was a senior citizen and I was looking for her approval to say what was happening enjoying my age is hot where I could just okay and I really appreciate it well I usually have this oil that I've put in the bathtub okay I got out the bathtub slipped and hit my head on the wall I heard about that yeah and I I don't you know the thing well did you black out I don't recall or I don't remember blacking out but when I got up one side of my chest yeah was loaded with blood yeah yeah so I'm wondering what you know what the heck you know it's happening so we tried to stop it it didn't stop I ended up going to one of these now care places right and you know and my wife was with me and she says and the doctor says well what happened and he says he slipped on the floor and he looked at me and I said to him that's my story and I'm sticking to you know why why didn't you go to the emergency unit at the hospital and it wouldn't stop okay and this one unit as this particular place sadly if I go on at the hospital to the hospital and you know the hospital is literally right up the street from me yeah yeah if I'd gone there I might still be in the emergency so we voted this now care was just part of another house right right and you know we tried to stop it here it just so happens it was a Wednesday evening which is prayer meeting here yeah and our chief nurse was there she came over and tried to stop it and I had ended up getting four staples right you know in my skull don't worry it didn't damage anything cause there was nothing okay can I can I make a comment here are my suggestions yeah for people my age in your age more specifically I'm making this recommendation to you I'm not making this to me yeah although I'm older than you are this recommendation is just for you stop taking baths and I want you to stop taking Bath's and i want you to stop taking showers I will definitely consider that oh yeah sure but you wanna know something that's funny what do you know when I take a bath now yeah you know something we we see the commercials all the time yeah I'm Way past my time we see the commercials to talk about the new walk-in bathroom yeah I keep looking at those and saying to Karen I want one of those even though you know I'm 510 I could stretch out in it and you know some of these newer bathtub you can't do that dr. Davis I gotta go my time is up we'll we'll talk next week all right all right bye bye take care all right dr. Steven Davis and he and I just have a casual conversation", "FujnNKPbuVI": "hey guys it's nick its grim green back here so i just randomly decided i wanted to show you this I was gonna fill up a 50 150 1 orbiter 5 10 cart with a the tea bag filler and mm-hmm there's a there is a few videos I've seen people doing this but I just kind of wanted to show you how I do it this is a tea bag I'm going to empty the tea grounds or whatever into here so this is how I do it this is a lift in tea bag it's a regular I don't know a Lipton tea bag I got it out of a Lipton tea box coincidentally enough so I'm going to grab the tea bag out of here so this is the important part this is the tea bag kind of get all the tea out of here and what I do is I cut the top off like kind of weird weird angles right there I just cut the top off there's just like that and it'll open up and you'll have to get rid of this T so I'm going to dump this over here Oh all over the desk but what you end up with is kind of this tube of papery material so I fold it in half and i put the seam side over to the two to one side and i cut it off so basically what you end up with is a big sheet or you can see right through that a big sheet of a tee material paper I roll it up lengthwise and you can do this like doobie style or you can I use this tiny this tiny little screwdriver to wrap it up in so there's actually kind of an air flow area in the middle we'll see if I can do this in a timely manner so we're going to wrap it up happen wrapping and then I just pull the screwdriver out so you end up with this tube that I'm gonna fold right in half it doesn't have to be precise it just has to be in half then I take my 510 car ready to go I take my 510 cart and I kind of just stuff it down in there you'll know when it gets to the bottom and then so what you're going to want to do I know this is hard to see on a black background and I have a black card I'm sorry is I just cut it off right at the tip I just cut it off right there and what you're left with is something that looks like that you can see the tea bag is kind of in there so what I use the screwdriver for again is to just move it around a little bit fluff it out a little bit and it will hold that will hold quite a bit of juice actually so I'm just going to top this off i have my na juice which is actually licorice from from light cig like Zig USA and I'm just going to fill this up and just we can will to see how many drops we can get in here this might be tricky to do on camera and by tricky i mean very tricky 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 oh it's bubbling it's bubbling 12 13 i'm getting this all over the place and you'll have to keep track for me ok see so that's that's too full right there it's a little too full and I can feel it running down my finger as well so what I'm going to do he'll grab my trusty kitchen towel was Scott calls it and just dab off the top dab off the extra get it off your fingers obviously it's something we want to do and I just throw this put this right on to run onto an analyzer and what's going to happen is that that moist material is kind of going to form around the inside wick when you put it on so I'm going to put it on here and you can kind of see ya oh that's on there when you take it off it's got a dent in there now so that is going to surround the wick and hopefully the idea is that it will wick it better down there some people after they stuff it in there and cut it they'll they'll pull it out a little bit cut it maybe a millimeter and then stuff it back in so it's kind of recessed I kind of just like to leave it as it is it holds a bunch of juice and should you know should vape like a champ so so that's how I do it it's really kind of quick I mean you saw that it was easy you throw away the tea or you brew it or whatever I don't care it slipped in so you know you can do whatever you want with it but but that's how I do it that's how I fill it up and this is good to go for at least I don't know I've got about a week maybe a week and a half before it starts getting you know it's essentially paper so it's going to go bad it's going to start you know peeling apart and getting sticky like a just a big massive goo in there and the idea is you want it to wick to the atomizer so replace it give it a week and replace it but if you have empty carts and some you know cheap Lipton tea bags you'll never have to buy empty carts again let's get a nice hero shot here with nothing in the way so anyway um that's how I do it other people may do it different but but that's how it is so try it out let me know how it works as always thank you so much for watching and don't forget to get it on the juice giveaway Jews giveaway juice giveaway so always thank you for watching keep on vaping you", "cior4pVoKCA": "hi guys I'm Dan HOF chief operating officer of honey stick and today we're gonna give you guys from popular demand a little tutorial on 510 thread stick vape batteries now we've been getting a lot of questions on what the differences are between different types of stick batteries so this quick video is gonna give you guys a nice little tutorial about what the key differences are between stick batteries and a lot of these we actually do sell so the first question is what is 510 thread 510 thread is the actual thread adapter that is used by a majority of vape cartridges these are cartridges they're prefilled with CBD or different medical oils that you can pick up at your dispensary and what companies will do is they will pre-fill these so that you buy just a cartridge and then you go and purchase and attach it to your own battery in order for you to be able to vape so 99% of the cartridges sold in dispensaries and CBD shops use what is called a 5-10 thread which is actually just the threading of the cartridge now not only do prefilled cartridges use this but a lot of just vape products like even slim wax adapters like our silencer they also use a 5-10 thread so they can appeal for the dabbing crowd so once you've figured out what you want to vape then it comes down to picking your battery and what the differences are between your batteries and what i've done is i've narrowed them down to four main types of batteries the first one and one of our most popular ones is the twist style battery so it has a 5-10 thread which will allow you to screw in the cartridge like for example our performance cartridge to screw that into the battery so it has a 5-10 thread adapter there or an end right there it has a push button which means that you have to push hold the button throughout your inhale and because it's a twist battery it has a little twist knob here that allows you to adjust the intensity of your vape and this one goes between 2 volts and 4 volts 4 volts being higher giving you greater intensity now how do you turn this battery on once you have your vape Karcher attached you simply push this button 5 times to turn it on 1 2 3 4 5 and you see it's gonna flash and that means that you are ready to vape once your cartridge is on there now most of these twist batteries ours included does have a preheat function on it for when you're using a cartridge for the first time there's thick materials in there that need to be preheated before you can vape and that's achieved by pushing the button when it's on twice in succession so you push it twice rapidly one two and you see the LED is changing colors there that means there's going through a low voltage preheat to get your cartridge right of vaping at any time during the preheat you can push the button to exit so that is our twist battery it is very simple to use not a lot of clicking adjustable power there nice 510 battery these are a high capacity and they come in several colors I brought along the multicolor in the red and we actually even just launched a brand new carbon fiber version which it uses real carbon fiber so there's a real carbon fiber version right here the other battery is a 5-10 variable voltage non twist battery so you have your 510 adapter here that you can screw your cartridges into or of a products that you buy like for example your prefilled cartridge show you guys we're prefilled one looks like so here's a pretty little prefilled cartridge simply screw it on in there this one is a variable voltage but it's a non twist this is actually a pass-through as you can see a pass-through meaning that the charging port is here at the bottom so you can actually if you're vaping and it's running down or you're one of those people who works at your desk or in your car you can have it plugged into microUSB have the battery on in succession while you're charging the battery which means you don't have to take off the cartridge to screw in a charger so this one does not have a twist function on it this has just a button but you still have variable voltage and preheat the difference is is that you would change the voltage by clicking the buttons and Wogan that so to turn the unit on you click the button five times rapidly one two three four five as you see it blinks right there now it's on if you wanted to go in to preheat as we do it the other battery same thing push the button two times one two and you can see the LED again is going into the color change mode you can exit that at any time to get out of preheat mode and if you want to change the voltage what you do is you push the button three times quickly one two three and what you'll notice is that the LED changes different color now what that signifies there is that now you're on a different voltage level so your power intensity has been adjusted and this battery actually comes with three voltage settings three different intensity levels and you can cycle through them by just clicking the button three times one two three now you see the LED turn blue so blue red and green so that shows your variable voltage nan twist five ten stick battery for your reference the other battery that I've outlined is a 5-10 thread a lot of people refer to this as a stylus because it has a little stylus tip that people used to use for their Palm Pilots and you could use for your cell phones and touchscreen devices but as you will notice this battery is a standard it's a buttonless battery so it doesn't have a button on it so what you do is when you put your cartridge on there you don't have to turn it on or anything like that just make sure it's charged all you have to do is inhale so it's a different action you don't push and hold the button throughout the duration your vape as the other two batteries we showed you you just simply inhale and it will turn it on a couple of things to point out at this battery so a lot of companies do sell batteries like this we don't because for auto draws to fire ceramic cartridges they have to be much more powerful and we offer auto draw models like our elf concealers and elf twist but they provide a lot more power so they can fire ceramic cartridges that have thick heaters this little battery doesn't have much power to fire some of the more modern cartridges the other thing is it to be Auto draw it requires your cartridges to have an air hole at the bottom like this one let's see if we can zoom in to make sure people see that there's an air hole here so this cartridge has an air hole which means that when you inhale it lets the air travel through the cartridge which then reacts with a little sensor microphone in the battery that signals the battery to turn on into vaporize now if we take a look at these two cartridges we'll notice that they don't have air holes so you would technically not be able to use these two cartridges on this Auto draw battery stylus battery when you would be able to vape them just fine with the twist batteries I showed you before or the non twist variable voltage battery that I showed you just before that so that's just a little bit to keep in mind when you're selecting your 5/10 or your perfect 510 third stick battery now the last battery that's pretty popular is this ego style battery now this is a 510 and also stick battery and I see a lot of people carrying these with cartridges that ask however you'll see this is a little bit different than this because look at the the difference this this right here is flattened flush where you screw the cartridge in and this one kind of pokes out and you have this exposed piece that's because there's two different 510 threads is your standard 510 cartridge thread so it's your 510 C thread and this one is your 510 ego thread an ego thread means that there used to be cartridges for a liquid that would screw on to the exterior of this and make an interior connection so you can use it with the older style eliquid tanks as well as with prefilled cartridges well you'll notice is if you're really into just prefilled cartridges is when you screw it into this ego tank it this transition looks a little funky it'll still work and they work good but you'll see that this just doesn't look that nice it looks like I need like a transition piece of metal there like a skirt or something like that and you know this is a fatter battery so as you could see the widths don't exactly line up like other tanks like this you'll see it's a much smoother transition it looks like they're all one piece versus like this now there's lots of ego batteries on the market there's ones that have twist knobs there's ones that are longer the thing is that you can these are about 500 milliamp hour batteries for so that's a pretty good decent capacity for a battery these ones are usually between 350 and 650 they're this size you can get longer ones or all the way up to 1200 or 1100 milliamp hours so you can get ultra high-capacity powerful fat ego batteries like this but one of the trade-offs is if you do use a lot of cartridges they're not gonna line up they're not gonna look a hundred percent with these stick batteries they line up so you can use all different types of heating materials like ceramic cartridges standard a stainless steel or organic cotton coil cartridges you can use high performance ceramic like our performance tank you can even use wax tanks like our silencer with these little 510 thread batteries so we hope that today's video was useful in showing you guys the

voltage on your 510 batteries [Music] alright guys so we're gonna show you how to adjust your 510 batteries um these pens are commonly referred to 510 batteries or hookah pens people home all different kind of things but the proper term would be a 510 battery if you have one that's adjustable there's two main ways to do it and this one may not look like it adjusts but it does so to break you down for you the obvious one is gonna be the sliders or spinner series you know that's what they'll commonly be called what you do is you just look at where that red dial is and you could turn this whole thing and that will tell you where you're adjusting at now the real benefit of doing it this way is you could go in between settings you know you could really customize exactly where you want to be by putting that slider exactly where you want it it doesn't have to be a straight 4 volts or 3.5 volts or 3.6 or whatever the case may be you could really do in-betweens and custom settings to really you know specify to the type of tank or cartridge you're choosing to use the other method is gonna be with the variable click buttons so this one may not look like it adjusts but once you turn it on it'll flash and then you can do three clicks to change settings now each one is usually gonna have some kind of paperwork included for example of this Carson battery if you look at the back of it you have all your settings listed out right here and it's got the color coordination for it as well and those are gonna vary so you could oh you could kind of look at it as like a high medium low and you know that's gonna also be dictated by what kind of tank or cartridge you're choosing to put on it but you could switch between three settings so it's basically like wider versions of what this slider will do so just kind of summarize the slider is gonna allow you to have more customization when you decide to adjust whereas you can go in betweens do custom settings whatever the case may be whatever the need may be whereas the buttons adjusters they're gonna be more preset settings where it's already listed as this this and this and you're just doing three clicks to switch the color and adjust between them most of them are gonna have three I can't really think of any that would have more than three I'm sure there are though but commonly you'll find ones that have three different settings you could adjust through alright guys so in summary when adjusting your 510 batteries you're gonna have two methods one is gonna be through various clicks of the button and the other one is going to be through an adjustable slider on the bottom just be weary you know that's gonna dictate what power is gonna put into your cartridge to just go bit by bit and usually start low if you want to purchase these awesome carts and batteries we have them on sale at discount vape pen calm and give it a video like you're subscribed if you think it was informal [Music] [Applause] you", "PeUljejovkw": "and i think we are live morning thoughts morning thoughts morning thoughts welcome to soulflow tv again everybody is your host with the most and we're kicking it off this morning with a voice note but first let me say shout out to the people going out to work this morning shout out to the people coming in from work this morning extra special big up shout out to all the people out there with a clean heart clear conscience and want good for other people as much as you want good for yourself let me ready up this voice note real quick yeah is there any so before i play this voice note let me explain to you what it is and of course i'm gonna have a lot to say after the voice note is done you're gonna also hear her speak again so here a couple of months ago right one of my subscribers contacted me and she said soflo i am at a point in my life now where i need healing and i've been working on this for a while now i've gotten to the stage where the people that did certain things to me i am going to expose them but i am going to expose them in a manner where i am looking for some kind of admission of guilt and at least an apology right i don't know if you all saw the video at the end of this video i'm going to attach that video to this video so for uno who don't know you can catch up a lot of you might remember this jamaican lady came on and she said her mother her father her brothers were involved with her sexual molestation but her story was so deep it was to the level where her father her mother would hold her down and her father would insert fingers into her vagina and she was a teenager at the time now want to listen to the voice note good morning everybody come on in come on in i'm laying the groundwork before i start playing this voice note i've queued up the voice note it is ready to go come on in once we get to 100 i'm gonna start the voice note so she went through some things and the things that she went through she's willing not to expose the video that she did for us before she called names so everybody know who it is is not she's not one of those persons who make accusations and didn't call names she actually confronted the people we have the voice note that we played before on the other video where she actually called her father and she recorded the whole conversation and she confronted her father this is our father i know we push up him finger in our while our mother hold our down and these kind of things and i suspect there were other things going on it could be like me i don't know if daddy didn't want it for himself or what but in the vid in the phone call to her father her father was basically saying look we're in a different time in life no things happen in the past that we can't change just move along he never said he was sorry he admitted to doing it because she asked him directly why you did it daddy why you did it he admitted to doing it he said i it's basically like he didn't accept any responsibility it wasn't my fault your mother met me do it your mother was holding you down and tell me if you push my finger open your kind of thing and i saw we did do things damn time there the man never said forgive me never say i was wrong and never said he basically told her to get over it boom we hit a hundred on one squeezing so this is her family response because remember i know share the jdf no he's a jdf soldier no and this is the brother that she said was her older brother that her mom and dad would leave her at home with during the daytime and he would have his way with her her brother her blood brother would have his way with her so she he has also threatened her like more killer anyway if if him could not walk upon the water drive palawaka come which part she is overseas it would have come to combust her brain because this is embarrassing nobody is saying but watch this she has gotten another voice note so this is a part two she asked me so flaw you're sure if you want to do the part two then it's fine if you don't then it's fine this woman's whole goal is to heal from this trauma that has happened in her life involving so many people that were so close to her and to help other females that are going through the same thing i said i have to be a part of that so here we go with the voice notes we passed the 100 sita listen to the voice no tonight because this is the brothers response this is one of her brother's responses is [Music] [Music] yes um sharon something new did happen this is part two this is the follow up [Music] right now your father have a [ __ ] conversation mississippi [Music] [Music] never disrespecting look no fear of feminine life and as far as me i understand say you put up everything with everybody you know whatever you're saying educated and you're the dumbest person i know it ever exists i mean how stupid can one person get i mean this is the height of stupidity if you are maybe intelligent being as you feel like you're the device note i have to stop the voice note it's amazing how ignorant people know for nobody it's amazing how ignorant people always call intelligent people stupid and you're ignorant and you're dumb now let's be honest the person that you hear talking right now that person that's all i don't have any sense to you does this sound like an intelligent person with balanced reasoning to you does this sound like a mature minded intelligent individual to you about my colleagues stupid right stupid because she has exposed her family by name okay she make everybody know who did what to her this isn't one of the stories where people come and talk about their soulflow please hide my id on all this this lady don't want her name hidden she don't want her story hidden anymore she want people to know because the biggest thing can one right now is them seeing people there still doing the same thing to others or she at least needs some kind of a closure or some kind of a way to move forward with the trauma that has happened to her right but this is how our our people are respond because them name call opinion no we're gonna talk more but let's keep on listening to the voice note though so we move forward opinions on social media family social media do not text about my phone again you don't have a little breaker she ain't dead clear him dead killed wow g-e-a-g be dead you know i've you know what you know what we have we have four signals you know i have five sleeping i two one more classes tell me about two better here in existing existence all right so pause again some people seem to be lost right this is her younger brother so people were asking so if all this happened to you why did you stay in touch with the family she said because she wants closure but anyhow this is her younger brother and this is the only one that she was actually in touch with still she'll explain after you're done listening this alberta where she helped got school in jamaica and sending money all the time sending him things take care of him you can hear him saying i'm saying mata may appreciate everything what you do for me but as if so for those of you who the name he mentioned earlier he's going to mention again over and over is the older brother who he's defending the younger brother is defending but just to get you up to speed who is talking what's going on listen you [Music] um things and why

time and then dismiss it as if well come on so and you know things happen but like that so she knew right away never to tell again and because she never told again because she realized that the support system that she had and the people she thought was gonna do something about it never do nothing about it she never told again and because she never told again older brother took advantage of that to do it over and over and over again he said you know when mommy got through for real properly if you think that experience with your mother pinning you down as a teenage girl and your father's

other things everything you overlook that it's what you feel you feel your media present and social media is so popular it's not hard to be popular on social media so if you want everyone to know

__ ] up then foreign people like you i was just you possibly got it but i'm now i know from you i said the last incoming attraction do not and i repeat i reiterate do not [ __ ] linked back we are not friend we're not family black people right now you say i'm not for instance oh media person they feel like you're so intellectually or not yeah our daughter is in the collective knowledge of our people you cannot do that with your simple-minded thinking oh that heavy there's more voice notes from her and somewhere at this as well that this heavy because now imagine this being a brother first of all if she was in jamaica all right now that's girl quick let me finish word i'm not sure that but i'm not upset i'm making a point you're pointing back and yelling what's say things about us we also have facebook and we can say things about you about your past your letter in your life that's right you do know that we can go on your facebook profile see your friend he knows he knows somebody sharon garden just said it seems like he knows because he said stop bringing up the past listen he knows this you can know but this is how it goes let me say this again if she was in jamaica i say she would have dead already she would either have to she would add and a lot of no females are getting killed because of them if she was in jamaica she would be dead already she could not come out with this okay the girl happened to escape her surroundings and escape her people who did her wrong and she made something of her life so one minute you hear him saying oh when should they have jamaica older than her she already explained that she became promiscuous because what was being done to her at home listen if me did have a vagina me would i rather go give it to a strange man you see somebody who may probably like what i mean like them for the wrong reason are the right reasons i would rather not say is a strange man alright me dan finosa is my brother all right me who we share to see appearance with and then my mother hold me down i spread me open for my father finger me she was trying to escape man she that tried to get where the girl left that she fly out of jamaica she made something of herself overseas you hear him come back and say and this is the brother and the only one that she stuck with that she kept contact with that she helped i know he's talking about in a business ball any kind of helper you ever give me a git ball back to you right now and i just get back to you right now that's what they always say people help you so much them lose track of how much they invested in you and you are so ungrateful but you know what he's hurt the brother hurt because him embarrass he knows he doesn't how else is he going to know other than the person it happened to telling him that this happened she has told him he knows he's just mad because she's letting the world know you see it and you hear how much time you talk about y'all got dead bad and you have a dead body and people like you dead bad don't lose sight of that kind of talk right that's all don't lose sight of the fact that he actually said so so come on i'm treating you one time and i'm not tripping you again why why your life in danger i didn't know that people had to threaten you multiple times and actually make an attempt at threatening you for your life to be in danger this is a female uh her brother has risen in the ranks of jdf so when our jamaican soldier tell us then we both saw your head back and you're looking to fly to jamaica comfortably and move around like not manhattan and things say you there's no danger there of course you feel threatened she feel threatened that our own brother threatened to kill her because she had killed upon them right anyhow this is her um i sent you the video and um that is a follow-up of the story that i sent to you from the first time for those who remember um that story that i leaked the um the video i taped my father when i was talking to my father because i wanted evidence and i remember he spoke yes he did confess now this is my little brother now on this video yeah he was the only person that i was talking with still and um even though i know that he was gonna turn on me too because um you cannot be friends with the people who are your enemy you can't be friends with one person that is a friend of your enemies because you will you you most aspects of that person on the turn point right let's let's continue he was saying that he don't care one of the time while he was talking on the phone he said he don't care he don't know what happened he was not born here because he's 20 years old so i am 12 years older than him so when he was born i was 12 12 years old so you don't know anything so when you hear him in this video it's all about they cook up things and they sit down and they inject him with a lot of stupid stupidity just to get him on their side and um you will hear in the background where the mother was fighting him for the phone and then he's telling her going going only before because uh he's got a cursed bad word now the reason why plenty will act some so after all that you still um was in contact with your family no i was not i was in contact with this only brother which is a smallest brother that didn't know anything about what happened because he's the last brother and as you can hear he said in the video that's um in the voice notes that um i helped him to go to school and i sent things for him and blah blah blah yes i i was helping him well anyways i am just explaining this this so people can get it clearly you know what happened here he they put him on the front line to curse to act up and they sit down and they counsel him with a lot of things you know they set him up so bitter against me and this little you know software is it's like stupid because he's saying he's embarrassed naturally things happened to me when i was small he said i deserve to be tortured my fingernail then the most pickled tomatoes they must pick out yeah he said i'm not going to enter the pearly gates it clashed me to no ends yes he even threatened to send my facebook friends a friend request and tell them about my past life which he made up story saying that if my daughter was living in jamaica my daughter couldn't live walk on the street the nasty life that i lived you see it you went back and say wait you even when i'm disrespecting my kids as you can hear wait until they grow up what are they going to do and i don't have time for my man and kids and my social media you know they just cook up a lot of story well for those who know me they can go on social media they can look look for all of the above that he said about me social media disgrace my family talk about them it seems like these people don't have a dictionary there's so much ask for a dictionary in jamaica but it seems like they don't know what is the meaning of this grace in one because if i i'm full and i can't take the burden anymore and i turn to social media to speak i will speak about what that happened to me personally talking about any of them personal life i i haven't gone in any one of them past as you hear he said i'm still stuck in my past right so how am i disgusting then he said i disrespected his mom because i call her a witch which i think yes i did disrespect her but not to the limit that i'm supposed to because after a woman doing all this to her child is the name which a good name to give that woman exactly i can't think of a whole lot more for those who are looking deep and is listening keenly to the voice messages that i sent you then they'll get the sense out of it this is all revenge revenge because i open my mouth and i speak they're gonna revenge me by making me go six feet deep as you hear he said i'm going down six feet deep before his mom then again he's gonna tell me that i am working on his brothers to lose their jobs and he's thinking about his brother's children how they're going to live when their brother don't and he's saying that his mom is going to fall on and die yeah just look at the things that he's saying to distract people from the real thing that we were talking about which is the abuse that the father and my brother abused me he's just trying to talk a whole bag of crap from her to take away the focus from off the right thing he said things happened to you when you was a child okay yes you admitted your father admitted his father admitted to them no why should my fingernails be picked out why should i get horrible debts and i'm not begging them to to let me be a part of the family because i'm quite happy i wouldn't like to be a part of that family but the point that he said that i'm not a part of the family anymore it's all because i speak about the abuse that i've gone through so therefore look at it he said he respect his brothers the same way okay fine so what is he trying to say because he claimed that he's so intelligent and this is based off the first um the when i taped his father because you're gonna hear a lot of names come up back in this vice message that came up in the first voice message that i sent you you hear the word give renee and all those yeah so he's basing off that okay now he said he's so angry at me because um of what i did so all of a sudden i'm so wrong he went back into the past listen so flo and he said um his brother made me be where i am today and nobody makes nobody be where they are today you get an opportunity you pick up that opportunity and you make the best of it there are plenty people that get help to go to a foreign land and where are they today they don't have nothing to show they did not help themselves to be anywhere they just take the opportunity walk on it nobody makes me be where i am i am a strong woman that fight from the day i came out of my mother's womb i was fighting until this day i'm still fighting yes i fought my way through life but using that to say that is coming up say coming up with um the fact that i've got the opportunity from the same brother that molested me and he's saying that brother is the one that helped me because i didn't have any money to go abroad or whatever you know what i did not understand when that brother was was lending me that money because it was lent to me and i paid for that money and he did not tell me that he's paying me to shut up he did not say this is hush money he did not tell me that he's paying for his sins if they're not and just look into it how they are they're they're they're they're um just looking into it how how they're putting putting out their that that that their they agree with with pedophiles and was saying rapers and family ramen people then people who are touched of people because at the end of the day so if you look into it because these people they act like they're all so intelligent and in the first voicemail i said that they're ignorant and he said that i'm not supposed to use the word ignorant because ignorance means lack of knowledge what i'm supposed to do is say that he's short-tempered no these people are not short-tempered they're ignorant they need to go back to school they start need to start from basic education right up because if my brother touched me in a in an in if my brother touched me in a way that is not appropriate my father touched me in a way that is not appropriate my mother she knows about it she didn't do anything about it she was even present while it is happening yes then my brother is going to give lend me some money to go abroad that simple means i'm supposed to shut my mouth and don't speak about my abuse and that can buy my pain that's going by my heart that can wash away all these scars that i have inside if you notice sometimes when someone like a man touch up the little pig with them in your soul you notice they give them ice cream give them one phone give them little money if a school girl and buy them lunch and and um school shoes or something because i saw them buy them out so this is what they're trying to explain to me your big brother they touch you for 10 years long your daddy taught you and your mother your mother tell your dad if you touch you so guess what the big brother help you with the money when you didn't have it which what that is what families do to family yeah that was family supposed to do this does not they shouldn't have anything to do with my hurt and abuser abusively abuse me but what i get out of it the sense that i make out of his is that that money that he paid to me is supposed to be ocean yeah yeah so look into it now is this my not acting like a big dirty pedophile it's the whole family not acting like a big dirty pedophile a big doctor some pervert others in that family reminds me about money that you lent me to abraham that simply means you was buying me out then i'm telling me [ __ ] remote and because we don't take the hush money and they pay back my fingernails to get pickled and go go six feet deep and you all hear the things that and that he said and one point that i want to touch why i say these people are ignorant and i'll say it again he said that are you not ashamed do you want your daughter to come up and hear these things grow up and hear jesus how could he ever say how could he ever say such a thing your daughter is some as as a person that has gone to abuse i am supposed to be a big advocate i'm supposed to be telling not only my daughter but other children out there should know our purpose let anybody put you certain uncertain way because i was being touched by my dad and my brother and it is not right she knows her purpose she can help a lot of girls a lot of children do but listen what he's saying it's a disgrace my daughter is gonna be ashamed and i am on facebook and they brought up some lies an allegation about me i'm on facebook and i tell everybody about what let me pause this because i see a comment and there's a comment here from trevor allen that says if it was hush money why would you pay it back she's explaining to you at the time she was very young okay all this went on in her family her brother who is now the soldier united jdf he was in a position in life to help his sister to leave the country she thought that along with all the abuse and all that she did not see it at the time as hush money she saw it as an opportunity to go somewhere where she can better herself she took it and she is explaining to you also that this is what pedophiles do okay they groom their victims into molestation and then they treat them to things to keep them quiet she even went as far as to give you an example of a school girl where the doctor taxi man might buy our cell phone and should have our cell phone before we're single by our deleted iphone and all these things then buy like a tiny picnic candy and ice cream and toys and it go from there up and up that is exactly what it is trevor so if you are wondering about is if it's hush money why did you have to pay it back no she worked she got herself together after she escaped the situation there and she was in a position to say a duty money that and they might feel like i owe them loyalty to secrecy because he gave me that money figure overseas and it was what actually got me there i'm giving the money back it was a loan and she paid it back she understands now that it was supposed to be hush money because that's why they're trying to fling it in her face now while she's telling her experience they're trying to say well forget about the past man i just see umbrella help you for reach overseas and if you never reach overseas like her little brother said you never because i didn't see him brother if i never him help you if you reach overseas forgot me white man where can't take care of you so in some sense they're saying she owe it to the brother forget the part where moles are off and ryder wrote for 10 years forget the part where her mother and father knew about it and participated in some way she must forget all that and just be grateful for the life she has now forget the past and move forward and say thank you to the brother and mother all those years by the way because he's responsible for her going overseas financially elena alec money who don't understand that anyway keep on looking at the voicemail then let me finish up that one here cause you have like two more which are more shorter he said i'm on facebook telling everybody about things that i give the family they just brought up a whole lot of fake allegations because i'm not gonna talk who i am on facebook but most people already know me because i'm not here because i want i'm not here because i want any publicity you understand but people who knows me knows that that's not true so they just come up with lies and allegations and things and oh my god she's a warrior you know why she's strong i'd rather just stop here because it's just it's so overwhelming and it's so sad and you know what i'm i'm i'm i'm not going to talk anymore because my emotions are taking me over but i really want you to share this just share it for me please and that is exactly what i'm doing okay i see i have two more voice notes here one is eight minutes long and uh one and another one is nine minutes long if you don't wanna hear it i'll put it on the next video or we can just run it here cause we are here already why why are there people here asking silly questions about if i need it's why chef appeared back and all these other things listen man i think in that family they need to really go do some checking because remember listen when somebody is off that mindset they don't do this kind of stuff one time under stop this is something let them do continuously so i'm willing to bet that these people have done it to other people like i've seen in the comment section i'm even willing to bet that the brother himself that was doing that to her has probably had things done to him as well you know what i'm saying heard people hurt people and a lot of the times those who were molested before and touched before start touching and molesting others as well it's just a continuous cycle unless unless intervention comes in to break that cycle you saw me i said so nobody thinks she's the only victim right now her speaking out is probably helping a whole lot of others even our brother picking them because people are looking now and ours and whether they like it or not it's out the bag so people are gonna look now and they're going to say look on him daughter i want that to touch her look for him when he's in public watch my epidemic any which part where him and the rest of them are that kind of thing this is raising awareness man and this is also her trying to heal from what she has gone through you saw me i said i'm not in the business of blaming a victim if i don't know the story i will say why the story looks shirk is still in about why this happened that happened but if the victim herself comes out and tells you what more proof do you need of course people can lie she went further and she got back up recorded them and had the whole conversation where they admitted it one more you need what more is needed do did she need to be raped in front of you for you to say oh oh okay miss no so it really happened to you for real this is her truth this is her truth she's walking in i wanna play our next voicemail and you know what's so slow since we're here keep it going he said in the video that is all mommy do is protect me you know i'm asking myself protect me but against who yeah because a woman that called her man and tell her man to dig into the two of the data private parts is that protected ten years of sexual abuse from the brother is that protecting your child and as you hear now my little brother here in this in this one in these voice notes that i sent you he's saying that uh he's gonna send a friend request and he's gonna tell everybody on my fake facebook page that um i was i went out there and i and i wasn't with with my i was with men and um uh my mother wanted my virginity and stuff like that so flo as i'm saying again these people are ignorant as hell because at the end of the day kept what virginity when the brother and the father already know how to how i looked the brother already done what he have to do to me from the age of four years old to 15 years old so what men this one woman was trying to keep and look into the situation the other way now they're saying that they're gonna send everybody on my facebook page and tell them how much how much money take and me was this on me was that but it hurts their feelings how much money may take when i was in my young days but guess what it doesn't hurt them that my brother and my father touched me right because it is not dysfunctional to go out there and take no man the body was supposed to stay at home for my father and my brother so as long as i went out there to take man it's a problem it's a disgrace my past is nasty my past is dirty but when the brother and the father touch me that is supposed to be buried on hush hush and when i speak my fingernails supposed to be picked out my tone my composite um lion judah lion sometimes some of y'all take on some names that you don't even you shouldn't even take on because judah lie and lie enough judah means something totally different from what you're representing right now with your comment yes we understand that but she must look to jesus christ because sometimes you're telling people your business and personal life but take it to jesus christ in prayer oh you know sashimi already take it to jesus christ and prior all you know she didn't already take it to her god in prior and it was revealed to her that she must come out and talk and expose them as well i i just hate i'm messed up pay attention to the comment section for now and just listen with you because half of this i haven't heard myself okay but some other comments just really telling about the character of the person that you are so mine did not expose yourself this morning here all right now play the thing some of you man i swear things are supposed to be picked up i'm not gonna enter the pearly gate of heaven and i'm gonna die a horrible death and you know i'm gonna go six foot deep before their mom are you looking into it just look into it and the people who are going to watch your show i want them to just look into what i'm trying to say and these people are calling me family fighter you know what i am i'm a fighter against abuse i'm a fighter families that scar their own families and never have a conscience to say they're sorry as much as i don't have a platform i'm using your platform and my voice that god has given me to help somebody out there because there are many going through what i'm forgotten through and can't even open their mouth because they might go get backstage exactly you understand what i'm trying to say there are many that is like a bomb waiting to explode so instead of them call me a family fighter i'm not a family fighter i fight against what is wrong and that they want to kill me for you know what the last thing i want to put out here to the world last time i i i sent you the the the um the other video about my father confessing i told you that this brother i have ketchum he's in the army and i told you how he tricked me i called the police in jamaica the camps both in kingston and monique they turned me down and they just didn't care no listen cop mode kill [ __ ] this little brother of mines he confessed that the jdf officer threatened me right he said did you guys listen when he said just one time indeed threatening your sister put what you did to her out there and then you as a la man that is supposed to be a good abiding citizen and it's supposed to be looking over your country in a good and respectful way it's going to trick someone after you feel upon touch of your sister you're going to your sister put panther for that and use a great jdf soldier congratulations you know ah yeah yeah i saw all right and that was it she said soflo this thing get to me so much that the enemy is telling me what to do with the knives in my kitchen my cries fall on deaf ears then she said if this part 2 is too outrageous for your platform let me know no it's not and that's why we're doing it here this morning it's not outrageous for the platform it's perfect for the platform because one of the things that we try to do and we've been doing for a while now is raising awareness in certain sectors of our life speaking about the uncomfortable truths that we need to explore that we need to speak about in order to form a conversation start a conversation and find ways to move forward in a positive manner that is all that we're doing this is something that needs to be eradicated from our culture and it is actually very common place within our culture video already where i said uh the the whole family-run thing it's actually something that is deeply embedded in jamaican culture i see other people from other caribbean islands said why so floyd always thought about jamaica we understand still because that's where you come from and all these things but is a caribbean thing is it whole are we so how are we gonna fix it if we don't speak about it are we going to keep having generation after generation grow up molested and abused and then y'all wonder why when you see you them reach certain age and take no top no more and flip out certain ways is these things they're dealing with like a boy i get ripped off by a man by uncle swanson by family friends so and so i know that they couldn't go to their family for support so they had to live with all that turmoil as they grew and like she said it's a ticking bomb waiting to explode some people kill themselves some people kill others and to kill themselves some people find healing through meditation prior speaking out venting letting it out unburdening and raising awareness and even helping others to avoid going through that so that's not the thing that you understand we're at the top of the hour it's one hour i was trying to figure out how to bring this across to y'all this morning and this was the best way i figured out how that way we can both interact to the video at the same time now i did i did a live one time on a sunday i did live i went live on youtube on a sunday and we had the callings and the amount of women that called in to give their stories for those of you who are thinking that this thing is just some it happens every now and then one in a million the amount of stories i got on that sunday we didn't even have time to take all of them literally the phone ring off ring off when i got off the phone it said like 600 and something missed calls now that could be other people who call already trying to call back again just to get in but there were so many people calling in and there were so many stories given that video is still up on soflotv on youtube as far as this story goes what i'm going to do is for those of you who didn't see the first part of this and the first part of this included her telling her story completely about how when our brother started out and started grooming it first and then it it eventually got to penetration to full on sex to where she would just lay there and just let him do what he wanted to do because she realized she tried complaining to our parents before never go nowhere she'd try a runway never go nowhere then just catch around bring her back she tried everything to escape you understand to make sense of the madness that she was going through i can't discredit this lady's story she's brought me irrefutable proof i've heard confessions what i have not heard is a regret i have not heard remorse you say our brother that younger brother because he's he he sounds exactly like what the average 20 young 20 something year old jamaican sounds like today now there are intelligent ones school book educated intelligent if you are very hard-pressed to find a very intelligent one that you can have a halfway decent intelligent one that you can have a conversation with without it turning into we're disagreeing so party boy that's how they style you you try to talk to them your brother you know say boy that wrong manner you need to uplift your life you know nobody asks you for your your your your expertise that's how they style you and he sounds exactly like that type right but forget about him the older brother who actually did all this and who actually is active jdf now if he if he had if indeed at least said to him sister said listen we grew up messed up okay me did i go through some things too what i was doing at the time i didn't even understand it till now god man if i could take all that back i would i am so sorry and it's not something that i would ever do and blah blah blah and that shall we for here that's what she was looking to hear that's what i was looking to hear instead me hear the father admit it yes yes yes it did happen but listen up we're not different time now and sometimes you need to let go of the past you you stuck in the past everybody else move on that's how her father who admitted to doing everything she said he did actually responded in the phone call so now when you hear the liquor bread out bix liquor brother i said yo yo yup yup yup he's more angrier that she recorded him and now has proof because he admitted it he's more angry about that than anything else so anyway mc diobar road tell him tell him talk to me him up something for you the family is damaged the secret is out everybody who know them because name call location call jamaica ain't that big everybody who know them right now have a look with the side eyes you understand and that is what he is embarrassed about none of them the embarrassment they put the girl through are not they are only embarrassed because what she telling and she's not supposed to tell man i wish more would but i saw the thing there are plenty more who are holding it still and it affects them in every facet of their life when they go out into the world and they try to have a relationship then try and cut that off you're growing too big personal big man big woman you're trying to you want family you want a a partner of your own and then these things start to manifest again and your partner don't even know where your anger coming from then think of the ceiling so then fix the ceiling then thing kind of sliding door so then fix it then think of the curtain then fix it and it's not changing nothing because that deep seated resentment anger all the emotions you can think of are still there tied up in a bundle to that experience and they haven't processed it out yet you see me so when you see some people are going to marry somewhere people been through things man people been through things a lot of people still going through it some people been through it and can't talk about it up to this deal one lady said to me soflo i'm 60 something now or 50 something now she said and what happened to her happened to her between the ages of like seven and ten and she in our fifties now our sixties i don't remember the exact age because i'm not looking at it and i don't wanna make up stuff but she up the inner age and she's saying that it affects her now evil more than before because as she was growing she was able to like keep herself busy and she became very accomplished because she would throw herself into studies she would throw herself into degrees she could get two masters she gonna get this she throw herself into business entrepreneurship traveling making money building life and then when it's all settled said and done it all comes right back like your full force like it was yesterday all this happened and it happens to her constantly and she can't get past it these things scar people for life life wow man no no no think about that being your support system you see what support system she had is the same exact kind of thing that a lot of them must go through in order to expose what's happening to them and because they know that that's what they're going to get people like you yeah oh god god now help you god cop listen to people like you long time like they just degrade the girl and chop her down more and more as best as they think they could i don't think this is one that they could hold down though the hearts have gone through the gift the secret is out exposed let me close this video by saying this this disclaimer here in certain situations i would use the word allegedly constantly because anybody can get up and tell a story somebody can get up onto a store upon me today or on you today we don't normally take stories at face value even though we provide a platform for the victim or the alleged victim to speak and we try to make sense out of the nonsense while raising awareness and giving them a platform to vent hoping to not only help them but help others some people make up stories and lie but when they bring you the proof man of the people they are accusing actually admitting to what they did but refusing to apologize and telling them to get over it and stop living another past and them think the past i'm gone already and it happened already i no longer need to use the word alleged anyhow we're gonna let it write this off for today remember i know let me tell you this you see if you have children no choice nobody run your picnic them the sad thing about this is this was her own we could say no trust nobody wrote a picnic this is her own mother father brother she probably would have been better off with a stranger may left this right that's all i'll catch y'all on the next video for those of you who came in late i told you man six to seven i'm gonna get seven and fifty one hour and fifteen minutes this morning all right it's six to seven a.m monday to friday we go live to talk up some things catch you on the next video i'm out peace have a wonderful day oh it's the weekend it's the weekend it's the weekend i can't go out like that have a wonderful day surround yourself this weekend with people who uplift your spirit with people who you can trust with people who show you love that you don't have to question i wonder if they really love me no so that will feel like love surround yourself with people who enhance your vibration if it's not that then it's okay to be alone just spend some time by yourself and love yourself okay self-love is the greatest love when you have self-love you will know what to expect and what you can accept and what just feels wrong as hell to your soul so you won't stand for certain types of abuse and if you're out there and molest you off speak up but it ain't that easy sometimes because as you can see lives get threatened families get torn apart people even get killed i'm out peace you", "UrJJjwEnSeI": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today I'm bringing you guys a video that is based on special requests from a lot of our viewers that want to know exactly how to pick out the best oil tank now this is normally not a video I would do because out of all this assortment of oil tanks that I have put together is basically comprising of about everything on the market on our website we probably sell about five or six of them now I have these in our testing lab because I'm always testing them we do have a lot of extractors that we private label for that we might be making this these cartridges for that might not be available but one of the common questions that a lot of our users are having that really wanted to see this video up is I have a honey stick battery when I go to dispensary and I have an option of picking out prefilled cartridges how do I know which one's gonna be good or how it's gonna work you know so this video here is gonna go through from you being able to eyeball an oil 5-10 disposable cartridge and being able to tell bass have a good reasonable estimate of how it is gonna be able to perform what it will kind of features it's gonna have so that you can pick out the best oil vape tank for your battery now what is a disposable 510 thread cartridge so there's a lot of people out there who purchase these 510 thread oil cartridges to fill themselves and they say but if it's disposable can I only fill it one time so the short answer is no most of these tanks you can take if you're buying them empty you can fill them up four to five times without a problem however some of them you can only fill once and we'll go over that other times when you go to dispensary most of them already have oil in them so just because you have an amazing cartridge if you're buying a bad extract not even the best cartridge can make a bad oil taste good so however you can have good oil where the whole vaping experience gets dulled down or made bad or taste burnt from a bad cartridge so what this video is gonna help you do is it's gonna help you make some educated decisions when it comes to purchasing and selecting either the cartridge you're gonna fill at home or the cartridges that you're gonna pick up prefilled to know how they're gonna perform so let's start off by starting from the very top of the cartridges of how you're gonna be able to start making some identification so let's do a close up here and start off with when you look at the mouthpiece to see what the hole size is gonna be let's start at the tip and work our way to the bottom okay guys so here we have a close-up view we're gonna start at the very top of the cartridge so we can go in and start making some determinations so you can see I put together what I thought was the best assortment of pre fillable disposable tanks so the tops let's go to the very top first things first generally the wider bore you have on mouthpiece which is the part that you inhale through the more vapor you're gonna get the smaller that hole is you are gonna get either less vapor or it's gonna have a smoother easier transition into your mouth so let's let's take a shot from the top here just to show the differences in the size of the bores so basically as you could see from this basic stylus plastic tip car it has a very small Inlet hole even these stainless steel ones here right they have relatively small and some of them are larger when we work our way down you have these wide bore mouthpieces which have very wide inlets if you're a person who really likes to vape like this one is probably the widest if you like to get a big cloud and a massive hits that you can really draw air through with minimal amount of resistance you probably want to get a cartridge that has a wider bore hole at the very top as opposed to having one of the smaller tips that are more focused on smoothness now some people have said that the wider bore the mouthpieces sometimes you get a little flavor loss because you're just going straight mouth to lung instead of kind of mouth to thrill to lung on your inhale it kind of focuses more on just going straight to lung however you probably get better activation and more of a hit now once you've figured out what size borer you want there's a whole multitude of mouthpiece materials as you can see you start off with the basic plastic mouthpiece which is very lightweight and then you have stainless steel and then you have ceramic which you can see here you even have wood and kind of an acrylic resin and then you have not stainless steel but more of a aluminum coated metal so I can tell you right off the bat if you are at or if you like tattoo on your cartridges like in high school I wouldn't want people to see what my pencil number two pencils look like but luckily I grew out of that but you know people sometimes chew on their cigarettes chew on their cartridges if you art or you know you have the plastic option that's not going to break your teeth but you don't want little plastic particles getting into your mouth so you're probably best off going with a natural wood cartridge so this is a natural wooden mouthpiece it's very soft wood it's not even sealed with an epoxy for coating however if you're gonna be refilling this a lot do get new tips because when you chew on them they are gonna get beat up and the moisture sitting on wood does not bode well you also have the acrylic and the metal ones if you chew I would stay far from the metal ones you're gonna end up breaking your teeth the ceramic what's a really unique offering with ceramic style mouthpieces is that they say that it's very clean very easy to get clean it also feels sturdy like the metal ones however doesn't feel heavy in your so it's it's very natural on to the lips and it offers again it's super easy to clean off it's much lighter than the stainless steel pieces and it just feels overall more natural to wear as a stainless steel one you know you are putting a little piece of metal into your mouth and what's unique let's say about the powder coated ones to where it's not like a shiny stainless steel and thick metal it's a much thinner metal and it's coated so it's never you know really gonna be cold to your lips if you pick them up if it's been in the AC or whatnot so when selecting your mouthpiece you have your the bore of the inlet hole and you also have the mouthpiece material now mouthpiece shape also makes a difference generally as you can see you're very wide bore ones are very cylindrical and that is to just allow maximum vapor to come up through them these flattened mouthpieces that look more like black and milds are gonna dull the vapor down condense it and make it a smoother transmission so again we're going back to wide bore more vapor flattened is gonna possibly be smoother if you're undecided and you want in between the two you have these kind of hookah style tips that have a relatively wide wide bore but they don't get flattened too much to restrict the vapor so mouthpiece shape and size definitely the first point of contact with the cartridge in kind of a first way that you can determine it now what we're gonna do is we're gonna take all these cartridges out and we're gonna talk about what the body of the tank brings to the game okay guys now before we move on to going over what the differences are between the body of the tanks one more notable thing about the mouthpiece is if you are buying your cartridges to refill whether you buy to a dispenser buy them from guys like us to refill the one thing that you have to know when you're dealing with tops is there is a new type of top which child safety is really big in the industry right now so there are compression tops that once the extractor or you fill them up and you basically crimp them down right you see there's no screw here once you crimp this down this cartridge is not coming back apart for you to refill so then once you go through your initial extract right on a childproof crimp lock here there's a pop top you're not gonna be able get back into this cartridge without breaking it and so you're not going to be all refilled so if you're looking for more than one use out of your cartridge don't buy the crimp tops this is also crimp top as you could see there's no threading and you can see this is one of the newer resin cartridge is actually very popular cartridge so once you push that down you're not getting back into it now let's talk about the body of these things now you have generally two types of outside bodies or reservoirs which house the oil that you're gonna be filling you generally have plastic and you have glass now things to look for is plastic cartridges generally they're not as popular anymore because people you know they want purity when you fill up a plastic cartridge it sits for a long time I don't know if it's true or not I'm not a scientist but they say they could alter the change the oil if it sits in there because the THC can react with the plastic and also the components in there so they say a glass is much better to store things in because it is going to be medically neutral to reacting and if you are going for a glass especially the Pyrex grade of glass is going to be perfect because it's also not sensitive the temperature changes so if you're going plastic tank where are the advantages well the advantages are is you're never gonna shatter your tank and they're super lightweight so they're gonna be much lighter so if you're taking it out hiking or sporty and you don't want to carry around the tank plastic tank weighs about half of what a glass tank does and plastic with a plastic mouthpiece it does not get much lighter and but if you're looking at already a plastic tank you have different grades of plastic and you can tell that from the clarity you see this is a little bit foggy this a lot of people would think is a glass tank but it is actually an upgrade plastic tank it just has a much higher quality clarity so this is an upgrade plastic tank that just has better clarity and among plastic tanks one of the most popular ones now is you have actually resin tanks which are like this generally they come in mouthpieces like this set up right here this is actually a resin tank you really can't tell the difference between the glass and the resin except the difference is is one will shatter if you hit it hard enough and one will not now if you are buying glass there are different grades of glass you know the company that does cartridges like this I'm sure you guys are familiar brassknuckles is a prime example of somebody who focus on cartridges like this this is a very thick grade of glass and you can tell that by touching it and honestly you can probably eyeball it to tell how thick the grade of glasses so you look at it it's gonna be thicker glass this glass this tank right here which is our cloud tank actually uses a very thick Pyrex certified glass so this is actually a very expensive good glass it's very hard you don't really have to worry about it breaking or shattering it's a very thick and sturdy and other tanks are thinner glass for example this one you can tell generally tell if the glass is very very shiny and it almost looks like plastic basically that is indication without touching it that it is a thinner glass so those are just some things out the body you want to be careful of now when also looking at the body center post that has become a big Arian debate within the market because generally plastic tanks don't have center post so we'll just move those over here if you look at a center post you can see some of them have wide bases some of them don't have a base some of them have rounded bases right they all have a different structure now what's the significance basically if you have a center post that has there's very thin it is more likely that the tank if you are refilling it that the center post will not be secure when you're securing the top piece down to the center post that it could wobble go out of place and possibly leak the downside so then people put in a wider base to make it more stable take up a little more space make sure that you can screw the tank down and you're not gonna have any areas of leakage the thing is with a bigger center post is sometimes oil gets caught on the transition areas or on the hills of the center post so then if you do have a wide center post base you want to make sure it's nicely rounded so you're not gonna get oil or any wastage caught up there that would make your tank less fuel efficient for example our ELF cartridge here in pink as you can see it's a wider center post but there are no slopes in there that the oil can get caught on so you're gonna use a much larger percentage of the oil that's not going to get caught in the center post transition however going right from center post talks down to the heater okay let's talk heaters most basically you have your wick cartridge as you can see it has a wick that stays up that is wrapped in a heating element wire usually those wicks are made of silica and what happens is it absorbs the oils and it burns them and these happen just fine however it's not going to do you justice and accentuating the taste of the oils and especially if you have thick oils that dry up around there you can actually taste the heater and burn the heater before you burn the oil so if you don't have a pre heat function you have a wick you could run into some issues with taste there so a lot of upgrades have moved to wick list cartridges this is a plastic those are beekeeper replacement tank it is same concept however it has no wick and it has a ceramic heating element a lot of cartridges that say they're ceramic and you can see they're ceramic generally with seeing a little white block through the inlet holes so you could see some of them have a little white block that means they are ceramic powered generally ceramic heaters mean that you're gonna get better taste better flavor notes better flavor accentuation now it's become really popular lately is this what a lot of people have coined as si cell style technology in heaters which means that you have a ceramic block inside of the actual heater itself let's find a nice example right there that is a perfect example of a cease tell it's a coated ceramic block they have good heat up times and right now they're probably considered a very nice performance tank on the market however your problems with these are is that once you've run through a filler to the taste can drop off with thicker oils if you do not have a preheat function they can fight they can heat differently so generally you want a more viscous oil with your C cells and if they don't have a wide enough Inlet hole which is the next area that we're gonna talk about you could run into some clog \u00e4j-- issues but these have a coated block it's not no rocket science abouts just a different take on a ceramic cartridge if you look this has a ceramic block however it is forced down so this is gonna use oils very efficiently this is actually an updated version of the cloud tank and half mil so that is a ceramic block heater you get good taste notes on these and then you have units that are wickless but they don't have a ceramic heater that have different sized Inlet holes now since we're talking about inlet holes what's the general rule of thumb on Inlet holes you go to dispensary and see different sizes and shapes of inlet holes as we showed the C cell had a very wide end lit hole and other tanks like a cloud tank has a relatively wide inlet hole but not overly wide so the general rule of thumb is is that the thicker your oil is that you are putting in there the wider of an inlet hole you're gonna need so that the oil can properly have access to the heater and vaporize if you have a thin inlet hoyle a hole a small Inlet hole and you have very thick oils it's going to be very hard for that oil to come in contact with the heater and actually burn so you are gonna want if you have thick oils to have a large Inlet hole so that that oil is always having contact with the heater however what if you have a large inlet hole and you have thin oils well your your possibility of leaking down through the post goes up exponentially so if you have very thin oils don't go crazy and get tanks with really large Inlet holes because then you could have leakage you could have wastage or the oil is gonna burn up very very quickly so I think that about covers what we would talk about with the inlet holes now air flow control air flow control is available on some tanks we have our cloud tank it has an air flow control here at the top this all ceramic tank right here has air flow controls at the bottom this tank has air controls atop certain tanks have this and what this is for is to allow you to control your hit when you open up the air hole it allows you to bring in air it allows you to bring an air from the outside to kind of dilute and aerate your hit if you have it closed then you can concentrate your hit to basically only draw the vapor out of the tank and out of the little air holes are located around the tank but if you open it you can draw more air so you can take a bigger volume hit but it some people like to concentrate their hit and not allow you to do that so what is the downfall of the air control the positive is you can control your hits and really tune in on what intensity of a hit you want the downfall is if you leave it open like it is partially open now then you put it on its side and it's tilted well that's an area where you can experience some serious top leakage out of the tank a lot of measures are there to prevent that but it could happen so if you're somebody who gets airflow control and you don't use it just make sure to always keep them closed now since we've basically covered all angles of how to evaluate a tank how to eyeball it let's go over one more piece that is about the bottom air holes so some tanks at a dispensary you're probably not having to see the bottom air hole so this is probably the least important part of our oil tank analysis here but an important fact for you to know is generally the larger the bottom air hole is okay a lot of these run on a ball bearing system so that when you draw or you vaporize a ball bearing moves out of place and allows the vapor to pass through and when it's not being used it goes down and creates a seal so no oil comes and down through the the tank however if you do not have an air hole it is not going to work with auto draw units and a lot of you guys have Auto draw batteries a lot of people have elves out there so if you are buying a tank for your auto draw battery make sure with your dispensary that you have an air hole at the bottom of the tank and that it is compatible with auto draw batteries we tell people this all the time it's one of the most common mistakes people buy a tank they have an auto draw battery or an elf they say my unit or my tank is a dud it's not it's just not compatible with the two so if you have auto draw make sure you have an air hole make sure that it's a decent air hole as you can see this unit does not have an air hole so it is not going to be compatible with Stylus batteries it's not going to be compatible with our elf you could see our elf replacement cartridge has a very nice pronounced air hole with even some side vents so you want to make sure that you're picking up the right cartridge now for the very last part of this because we now gave you all the tools that you're gonna need to keep in mind when you're out tank shopping now I'm just gonna run through these tanks and basically give you the rundown of what you can expect out of each one of these tanks so that if you see one of these tanks on the shelf you basically know what you're getting into so hang tight while we get back to this final shoot all right guys now we're gonna run through each one of these tanks and just give you a very brief description of what you can expect for usage and the pluses and minuses of them so that when you're out tank shopping and you see one of these things you have a good idea of what you're gonna get so starting off with really the basic plastic stylist tank with the flat head tip you're gonna get this cartridge and it has a wick so you're not gonna don't expect a big boy taste or big boy hits this is really meant to be a light on-the-go reliable non leak easy to fill tank these run on the blue plug fill system very easy to fill very easy to mass fill but if you have thick oils and they get coagulated around there you can get burnt silica taste if you're not preheating properly in here so this isn't really a flavor tank or a monster hit tank but what it is is really an Old Faithful tank that you'll fill super light is gonna take a beating so if you're into extreme sports this is probably your tank if you want to upgrade from that stay plastic but go with a wickless something that has a ceramic heater or beekeeper replacement cartridge with a metal mouthpiece same very reliable top blue plug fill not gonna get any leaking the ceramic heater is definitely to give you much better flavor notes and more smoothness over the traditional wick system and the stainless steel mouthpiece is a similar shape but it's a higher quality fit and finish and feel then we have basically the upgraded glass version this is a childproof tank it will lock in place after it is filled it has relatively smaller inlet holes meant for more viscous oils and it is ceramic so you're gonna get about the same taste but you're gonna have the purity of glass that your oils are interacting with over plastic basically same thing except it is refillable you can unscrew this top okay a lot of flavor rx cartridges come in come into this style it is not ceramic you have some decent sized Inlet holes however not too wide and you have good center post support so there's going to be a good reliable glass tank however the mouthpiece on these things is heavy and it is flattened so it is more focused on smoothness not hits you have our elf replacement cartridge full ceramic very lightweight ceramic mouthpiece that you have in different colors it's gonna feel good on the lips and it has the unique design center posts that is wide so it's still gonna give you good support however you're not gonna have any oil that gets caught up sitting on there you're gonna use a big chunk of oil really fuel-efficient nice power awesome flavor tank then you have basically a gold finished tank that is somewhat popular out there similar square tip design nothing really special ceramic heaters the one problem is is you have this really big flat top ledge a lot of oils can get caught up there that you might never be able to vape so this is kind of an old-school design but it does have good seals it feels good in the hand and its relatively light basically here's the updated version this one migrated actually to a CE cell style so you're gonna get a good heat up time it is light however still not a hundred percent feeling the center post because you are gonna get oils that get stuck up there now this is a more modern C cell with a bullet-shaped battery we sell these along with the ceramic mouthpiece style as our elf replacement cartridge you're gonna get some more performance out of these because they have wider heater holes they have that C cell Center and you're gonna be able to get good flavor hits off of them they have you have a nice air inlet hole so they'll run well with Auto draw batteries you're gonna get some good power out of this tank actually this tank right here is a brand new tank I haven't tested it yet it is a fully ceramic interior so it's good to put its advertising that it's extremely pure taste it also a ceramic heater I'm not a hundred percent sure on the bottom air flow generally to me bottom air flow could leak so I haven't tested this tank yet but my team does have samples these because some of our customers are requesting a full blown ceramic tank this is basically just a 1 mil version a different mouthpiece version of this tank that we were talking about so difference is you can have a ceramic mouthpiece it's gonna feel a little bit more natural and this one no air hole not going to work well with Auto draw batteries here and I can tell you from holding it it is a little heavier than I would like to see a tank this cartridge right here generally you'll see them filled in brassknuckles cartridges very good cartridge works with most auto draw batteries as well as battery-powered these have one mil fill size I like the bowling pin style tip it's not exactly a wide bore but still definitely wide begin nice hits and it is thin down for some elegance the gold finish that these guys have done is pretty cool so if you're looking for a good prefilled cartridge I mean these have generally been pretty reliable I haven't heard any problems of leaking they have good taste they don't really excel so much in taste they don't excel so much in vapor but it's one of those tanks to where it does do a lot of all those right it runs at about 90% ultra reliable I've heard here you have the resin and resin tipsy sell style batteries as you can see really improve the the groove there to burn up more of the oil and again our elf replacement cartridges are similar with the ceramic mouthpiece I like the see-through tops it's really cool when you're drawing vapor out of them and also they're easy to clean they're light in your mouth you don't feel like you're gonna break your tooth if you incidentally bite on them and it's a cool little reliable tank this one however it is a child seal once you push it down you're not getting it open so only buy these for the one-time fill unless you see it's got a screw top so ask him to specify same exact thing just a wood mouthpiece for those people who like the the natural wood this one is the same as the wooden except it has a different has a little air flow control here at the top it's kind of unique you just swivel the mouthpiece and that opens and closes the air flow if you want a little bit more control on your mouthpiece these three cartridges all come from the same factory it is I mean the same family it is basically the cloud tank here and they have adjustable air flow for these two the half mil and the 1 mil versions these are probably one of the tanks that I endorse the most i love the wide bore mouthpiece I like the ability to adjust especially for connoisseurs they have a nice ceramic heater with decent size inlet holes so you get nice big hits but you're not gonna lose out on that flavor I think the center post sloping on these were done right they're very stable I haven't heard any complaints of these things leaking this is the same thing half mil except it has a hookah style tip on it it's kind of like the top of a bowling pin it's like half flattened half widened tip and this is the glass version of the cartridge we showed you with a lock top not a thread you push it down and it has also has a resin reservoir this is not glass I have not tested this tank yet but it is very similar to the the other ones that we went over in that facet so it should be a good one so anyways guys thank you for tuning in I hope some of the pro tips and some of the analysis tools that we've given you are gonna help you make better decisions when you're out there looking for your prefilled cartridge to buy at a dispensary or looking to fill your own now one question I know is gonna be a follow-up is which one of your batteries basically fire everything so let me just come out and tell you our be master battery you buy one of those you're gonna fire 99% of what's out there the way that we designed it check out the separate video we did on that our minimax original with the smart chip the electronics and this thing it is I basically want you to find me a tank that this thing doesn't fire and I want to know it exists because so far I haven't heard one really nice powerful check out the separate video on that also our Gold Line battery these two batteries are variable temperature they're a little different in size and capacity however both really awesome should fire anything that you give it both these tanks three temperatures both have preheat functions easily charge work awesome with all these tanks minimax your definite go to so you buy one of these three batteries you can rest assured that basically whatever you pick up at the dispensary you're gonna be all fired so for this and several other cool videos make sure you subscribe to our channel make sure if I miss

this episode is brought to you by New York vape shop you can find all the devices that were using in the demonstration today at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with the code rough 3 first we're going to take it look at the anatomy of a 5-10 cartridge first I want to talk about the tip and the tips are pretty much a up to you like however you decide which is your preference is they come in all types of metal they're come in ceramic and they come in wood so the tips are pretty much straightforward next we're going to talk about the tanks the tanks themselves are what holds the oil and they're usually half a milliliter to one milliliter and sometimes the really big ones like the two gram or 2.2 gram heavy hitter cartridges can be really long but referring to the tank is the actual part of the cartridge where the oil is inside of it the two part and then there's the oil inlet and sometimes they come in various whole sizes you can see the one at the top there has a little bit larger hole size than the cartridge there at the bottom and generally for the thicker THC oils you probably want more of a thicker hole then there's the airflow if you can see at the very very bottom this is a bottom airflow and you can see that the airflow hole is right there in the threads at the bottom of the device other devices sometimes have them at the top near the tip and so generally one is either a bottom airflow in most cases sometimes a top airflow and then there's also what they call a variable airflow and you say the case here the airflow is adjustable at the top there so that's the one one thing to consider as well as part of your cartridge and the last and perhaps the most crucial part that we're going to talk about there's here at the base and that is the atomizer and the atomizers are usually either wick or ceramic and the wick they're okay but preferably you probably want to use ceramic today's you get a lot better even distribution better flavor and you see the ceramic heats the oil as it passes through now let's talk about best practices one of the most important things when it comes to using your 510 cartridges with a pin is to use the right voltage setting and you can see generally if it's a variable voltage for these kinds of pins that will vary somewhere between three and five volts and that's the appropriate range for most 510 cartridges but if you're using something like a box mod like the steam cloud that you see here that goes up to sixty watts it's going to be way too much so you're going to want to bring that down to like five watts or to the lower settings and to make sure that you're using the proper voltage or wattage another thing that you want to make sure is that using the proper airflow type you can see this is a bottom airflow device but used on this box mod if you pull it all the way in there there's no air inlet and so for this is the type that you'll need a top airflow so there are types of devices that may not be compatible with certain types of cartridges so that is one thing you want to make sure that for instance of this case you'd want to use a top airflow device and a variable and would be even better and you can see here - this is a bottom airflow and on the bottom airflow there will be a little bitty notch where the air would be allowed to flow through at the bottom of the device so you just want to make sure that you're using the right kind with the right type of device another thing is that when it comes to your empty device you probably just want to throw it and not throw it away but you want to refill it and not just keep hitting it because you're going to burn it out so when you get done with it either go ahead and toss it it's done or stop hitting it until you're ready to refill it or you're going to burn it out another thing is when you're putting in your pocket you really want to be careful with the tips especially with the ones that have an exposed tip and rather than sitting down into a sleeve because if you leave it in your pocket you can do something like this a lot of times it'll bend the tip over one way or the other can expose the electronics and cause you some problems so if you're going to be putting it in your pocket you might want to go with a device such as this where the cartridge sits down inside of it like a sleeve and the last tip we're going to go with here is to make sure that you keep your battery charged or keep a backup battery so if you have a nice pin that you like to use you might want to keep a little cheap on the side that you can have always kind of have as a backup by your charge in the other and that pretty much brings me to the end of my tips and best practices on using your 510 cartridges with your vaporizer batteries if you'd

started [Music] [Music] okay we are getting loaded up with Parma sharp blades into our two competing razors this is the showdown of the Merkur progress also known as a 5:1 oh this is the long handle version and the Parker variant I thought that the the long handle version would be more comparable to the variant because of obviously the more similar size and handle oh sorry I forgot I forgot I'm all lathered up with my paresseux white for sensitive skin which is always my go-to for doing gear review one important important thing I wanted to say as I loaded these very important that you put the top cap onto the handle assembly in the right orientation and you can see that by this little notch right here this little triangle on the guard and actually both razors feature that exact same feature feature the same feature and that is because of the threading that's on the cap that comes down and that corresponds to your adjustment dial down here so you get the adjustment down to be you know starting at the same position so both these razors they're a 1 to 5 adjustment scale and they both start with the plus sign that is directly below this little dimple right here they both have a little dimple to kind of tell you what number you're on and if that this has turned 180 degrees then the numbering is gonna be off so just wanted to note that sometimes people will ask me that question on the progress or marker or whatever the Parker they'll say oh it's the numbers are not correct and I say well did you have it a notch lined up on the side okay so we're get started trying to compare these two so I am first just using it on its most mild setting all the way closed as I would say so I always tell people that if an adjustable razor isn't you know usable on the very first setting then it's not that's kind of a animal waste I'm gonna gradually go up here to maybe one and a half that's a little nicer yeah so was that the progress was comparable or sorry the progress was cutting here on setting plus or zero whatever you want to call it I'll dial it up now maybe let's say two and a half that's nice okay now these two razors look very similar and I don't think it's any secret that the variant is you know very heavily based off of the progress they both use the same method of adjustment which is just a big spring inside and as you release the top cap you are also basically letting go that spring and that spring is letting out the the blade tray so that there's a tray it's here holding your blade and your blade goes on top of that then there's your guard underneath it and as you unscrew it the tray is able just to move away from the guard so it's changing the blade gap only that blade angle now for comparison I'm gonna set this at two and a half as well since I found out I you know that was feeling nice we can compare it but let me just do a you know real-time a/b yeah they feel near identical that doesn't really surprise me the price of the Parker is around fifty eight depends on what site you go to but the price on the regular marker progress is comparable if you want the longer handle it's about ten dollars more I'm gonna dial this up just a little more let's see let's just let it out let's go to three and a half let's see if there's a point where I don't like it yeah what bad I'm probably down down down to three very nice yeah I like this setting on on both razors around the same two and a half three somewhere in there they feel very similar maybe the Merkur has a little bit more glide maybe just a tiny bit that could be because it's chrome plated and variant that I'm using as a graphite one that looks like it's more of a maybe a media blasted or maybe the tumbled kind of look to it definitely not a high polish like the marker but they're very nice very comparable I think if you wanted to get started with the double edge razor and you were you know concerned about maybe two different areas of your face needing different kinds of razors like your neck needs something you know one thing and your face needs another thing these are great the progress has been around since the 50s we had literally had a catalog from 1957 or 55 or something I came over thought my head that shows it and it's pretty much unchanged this this longer handle version was the only change I'm aware of I have seen some people that will get a modified tip down here to be metal I think they call it a murderess I I think there's individuals out there that actually machine them I don't know if Mercker has actually done that on their official you know side of their business I think it's an aftermarket purchase I'm glad I did this because I have had people ask me if there is a difference between these and I hadn't shave with both you know in a comparison kind of shootout method but I'm glad I have not I I could probably be blindfolded and not really tell you which ones which that's good the markers are made in Germany they're made out of their cast of zinc and they're chrome-plated and the Parkers are made in India and they're cast out of zinc I believe both have brass handles you know turn brass handles but the head is cast and this looks like I think this is like a satin nickel that's it that's my best guess nickel always has more of a gray look to it you know and chrome always has more of a blueish kind of hue to it so that's that's the biggest comparison you can always make is just looking at the the hue a little more louder am I snacked out in here not my best lather in the whole wide world I always tell you guys it's it's not the most pleasurable thing to sit here at a desk in shape of these videos I I do it for you guys truth be told my shave at home is so much more enjoyable my routine is usually uh you know hot shower and I wash my face in the shower and then get out to a nice big splash of cold water and then do a cold water shave obviously I'm not able to do a shower here and my prep is pretty minimal I'm just in this little tiny sink splashing some water up in my face so sometimes feel like you guys don't get to see the the real Matt that's our six shades the real kind of at home but that's okay the good thing is that I know exactly what I'm gonna experience when I sit down here and it is the same every time and if something if something goes well here I can almost assure it's gonna go even better at home when you have all the comforts and all the prep and all the even just being in the steamy bathroom really helps you know you get out of the shower and it's nice and hot in there your skin's loving that you know especially in the wintertime love it well I'm going to stop blabbing the Merkur progress and the parker variant they are Ford and Chevy they are BMW and Mercedes take your pick and you will be happy either way because they are nearly indistinguishable I think the finish options on the Parker are nice they do have two different versions of the razor with different finishing and plating options the progress is nice because it has two different handle length options some people love the long handle some people want more that Bulldog kind of feel another nice suit the Parker is it it's all metal the progress does have that plastic tip I did mention earlier can get a aftermarket part and swap them out but the Parker comes stock all metal so there's one little difference I don't think it's a major difference I think it's plastic it's looks very durable and I've seen a you know ones that are vintage and they hold up just fine as long as you don't drop them but yeah that is the showdown I would I would say it's a tie there's there's not a clear winner here it's gonna come down to your preference for the aesthetics or maybe you care you know the ones made and Jeremy wants mean in India I don't really think it's a big difference either way the quality looks almost identical the construction so hope you guys enjoy today's review video please like

tips video that I have been getting tons of email customer service requests for which is basically how to clean and maintain your tank or how do you get the most usable life out of your throwaway tank several people are refilling these and you want to get the most number of uses or you want to get them cleaned up so this video is basically gonna run through how to clean up your tank maintain it get it back to you level whether it's a complex tank like our sub old carbon fiber a Cannabis Cup winning tank or whether it's a simple 5-10 thread thing fact the matter is as you use on certain oils certain terpene profiles get in there certain areas get gummed up they don't get cleaned you want to get the taste out get your tank back to new level and this video is going to give you some really useful tips on how to do that so Before we jump into the video I don't know what type of level of Pro cleaning you guys are into but I'm gonna go to the extreme and basically supply all of the equipment that you will need in the worst possible case scenario so you are prepared for everything so let's go over what I have here I just have a couple tanks so I poured some dark eliquid into I don't believe in wasting CBD or medical oils I let them sit for a week so that so that they they get a little bit discolored and they go and get on to the gaskets and get all over the insides of tank I had my guys keep them upside down and whatnot so we can get the tank dirtied up a little bit just enough so we can show you guys how to clean it so we have our example tanks then over here let's get a nice little shot I've had this for a couple of years this is actually a little coiler kit that I bought off of Amazon anybody who's into vape mods vaporizers or small things for 10 bucks or 15 bucks whatever I paid for on Amazon it is super useful I use it in here in my office taking apart vaporizers - tampering with small things constantly I mean for 10 15 bucks you can't beat it it's called a mod coiler kit it comes with these really useful little ceramic tweezers so there don't conduct static electricity they come with these almost like like a little dental tool so you grab little small gaskets and little bitty things you can play some with small screwdrivers with all different types of sets scissors thanks for 10 bucks if you're tampering around these things definitely an awesome investment we have our tanks always good to have rubber gloves before you start cleaning your tank these things are gunky some of them are borderline gross you know the oil gets slippery the rubber does give you a good grip when you're taking the tanks apart much easier to throw away the gloves than to you know try to scrub off your skin afterwards the key component that you're gonna need whether you need any of the other things or not is isopropyl alcohol there's over 90 percent purity this stuff is not going to mess up your electronics do not use soap and water to clean your tanks or anything they'll come in contact with electricity only use isopropyl alcohol this stuff kills all the bacteria will definitely break down any type of oils that are stuck to the gaskets in your tank it's gonna give it a nice clean smell it's not gonna mess up your electronics this is your best bet to getting your tank close to you you can pick these up at any grocery store any type of you know CVS Walgreens little convenience shop usually will have this or you could order it online then I bring some styrofoam cups some thick styrofoam cups this is what I set out my bets are basically my little quarantine centers in two and then I have paper towels they do not particle eyes you don't want to use the types of the types of paper towels or napkins that once they get wet and you and you try to turn on them like almost like a toilet paper that they can particle eyes or fuzz up because you don't want that stuff in your tank coming in contact with your electronics it is just not going to be good so any type of paper towel that doesn't really particle eyes once it's gotten wet that just absorbs will be good for what we're doing so let's jump right into it let's get our gloves on and let's perform some open-heart surgery here all right first things first my first cup is gonna be like tobacco chewers not a big fan with polar spit cup where I'm going to dump my residue is it getting wasted or CBBC here we are simply using discolored thick and hardened to e-juice so I'm gonna get out whatever I can get out there upside down then what I'm gonna do is I'm going to start disassembling the tank into as many parts as I can while I wait I don't want to get my glass all dirty so put on paper towels so then I'm going to start a little isopropyl alcohol bath where I'm gonna take these cups and put some isopropyl alcohol in them for the various parts as you can see I fill them up about a quarter way just so the components can become submerged now make sure that when you disassembled your tank you remember kind of what you're doing so that you reassemble your thing properly so now that this has pretty much soaked away I'm going to remove the glass piece and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take off all gaskets and separate them put them into one of my little bath cuffs I'm gonna have one of my bath tubs b4 gaskets that gaskets off could need my tweezers to get this one out make sure that you remove all of your gaskets because a lot of times if you don't remove them and you get them lost when you're assembling or disassembling your tank and then you put your tank back together you're missing a gasket you cannot have a good connection or you can have leakage which you definitely do not want to do now when it comes to the sub ohm tank you don't want to remove these bottom gaskets here because they are your seal between your glass and your base and just removing them wears them out a little bit more so you want to keep those as good as possible so we're not going to remove these those are tight on the base we don't want those to become looser now you're gonna remove your heater you might have to put some muscle into it you might have to get some pliers because some of that residue might have been down there it might have hardened and this could be oily and slippery this ejuice propylene glycol I'm definitely feeling that slippery on my gloves so in the event that this is hard to unscrew a bigger set of pliers or you know or you gonna get a really put a little muscle into it yeah it was definitely on there pretty tight so I'm going to take this away now if you are cleaning your heater make sure that you get it into an isopropyl bath but most of the time when people are cleaning their subloan tanks they're just gonna want to switch it off once they clean it with a brand new heater to top it off so we're actually not going to put the heater into the best since we're gonna give it a brand new heater since we're essentially rebuilding the tank here with this so we're gonna give the bottom base a nice little bath and that is also going to bathe with the mouthpiece make sure it's fully submerged if it's not always just add a little bit of isopropyl we're gonna drop the glass in with the gaskets because it's not that dirty heater we're gonna throw away and the top piece which has the airflow control we're gonna put into a separate uh separate bath there now this guy is not fully submerged so I'm gonna add a little bit I'm gonna make sure that it is fully submerged there you can see and while I let those absorb generally what I like to do is depending on how dirty the tank is I'll leave it in there for probably four hours it's just to really let it soak up let is sterilized let the parts break down you'll come back and depending on what type of oil or CBD you have in there you'll come back and it will look like the eye so the clear isopropyl is now like Coke or coffee or something like that you know so depending on how dirty is what you had in there but I would say leave it in there for a few hours on the minimum and go from there sometimes people even say you know if they set this up at night they go to sleep and then they put it back together in the morning the longer you let it sit in there generally the deeper of a clean you're gonna get for cleaning purposes we're just gonna let it sit while I set up and show you guys how to clean a 510 threaded tank so we're gonna take our 510 thread tank that we have filled up with some yellowish ejuice here all you could do is you're going to unscrew the top piece there's any residues in there you're going to take the spit cup here and you're going to dump it out this is obviously thickened and hardened so there really is only a little bit of drops coming in and out now there we go it's kind of shaking out the is really much thicker you can remove the mouthpiece here because we will clean that - no you're gonna do is reassemble is appropriate we were just gonna let the tank submerge the tank body submerged in there and next to it we're gonna have a little mouthpiece submerged in there then we're just gonna let it sit and we're gonna let it bathe with these generally it helps because you can't take the tank apart in the cept several pieces like we can wear sub ohm tank it comes apart into about four pieces this is only one piece and because that center post that you have in the tank there's not a lot of area for that liquid to get into so when you're cleaning this it's not a bad idea to just kind of slosh it around for a little bit kind of wiggle it around to make sure the alcohol is working its way into the tank and into the heater is generally you gotta just I just spilled that isopropyl all over the place but you just kind of wiggle it around and then let it sit make sure that there's isopropyl getting into there now the next thing that we're gonna do off is before you would start any type of reassembly is you want to make sure that you clean off your tools because you just use these tools this is the one that I really used that was dirty I don't want to get the dirty residues back into a clean tank that is the last thing that I want to do so clean your tools you simply take a nice clean paper towel soaking a little bit of isopropyl you can clean off all the areas that you would have touched make sure it's nice and sterile now to be extra extra cautious while I'm cleaning my tank I'm actually for the final phase I'm going to remove my dirty gloves that have eliquid on them and all different types of tank residues and I'm going to give my tools here a little final final touch always get a little smell test that smells like clean isopropyl let that dry and we are gonna get some new gloves and we are gonna come back and now we're going to talk about reassembling the tank alright guys we've got some fresh clean gloves and we are back to start reassembling the tanks so as you can see here you can view the cups you can see that my isopropyl is definitely discolored and we didn't let it sit overnight I said we let it sit for like 10-15 minutes while we're showing you the other tank if that and this is just strictly an example but if you let it sit for a few hours you're definitely gonna get a lot more discoloration the liquid in the more discolor it is the better sometimes if you want to go the extreme once a liquid becomes discolored you take the components out and plort it into a clean isopropyl bath you know again that depends on the magnitude of cleanliness that you want to go and how you really want to let this stuff sit but now what I do is I set up what I call a little drying station well I take the paper towels that I had and I fold them up so I can basically take the components out of the isopropyl bath and allow them to dry Oh as much intro track as you can and for our little tank we are actually going to take that out and with 510 tanks what you want to do you want to try to let them sit upside down just let all the isopropyl to drip out now this this guy wants to tip over a little bit so we're gonna do these and this guy we want him to be upside down as well it's a little isopropyl drip down and that's going to take a little bit of a while if you want to spread out speed up the process of getting the isopropyl out of tank you can always use a hairdryer use either the hairdryer if you have it only take each setting from a distance or use it on the non heat setting on just a cool setting because if you hit it with a heat gun or something like that or hiking you do run the chance of compromising the integrity or warping the gaskets or the rubber pieces of tank so do not use any of those natural drying is usually the best or use a hairdryer but don't use it on a higher heat setting or each setting at all so now what I do with each one of these little components I haven't given it much much of a chance to dry put this guy off to the side I haven't given it much of a chance to dry so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a clean cloth clean rag and I'm actually gonna clean and dry the glass and all the components within the tank to make sure move any residue and all so that I get it as dry as possible in the short amount of time so we can do this video do it properly okay that's nice and clean the base it looks brand-new it's nice and dry I'll see any isopropyl so this one's ready to go now if my gaskets I'm also gonna dry them off whatever you do don't pull on your gaskets like the rubber bands that weakens them it shortens the life of them it does compromise the integrity of the gaskets so be gentle with them don't flex on them in other words that's nice try it's back to white it was pretty yellow before we clear it into the eye on the alcohol that there so that one's done clean up this long these aren't exactly the most form-fitting gloves but you get the picture never clean off the mouthpiece generally a lot of residue with these sub ohm tank builds up around the edges so if you want to you take a little bit of isopropyl you just dip the cloth in there to give her a real final scrub you can really get a nice clean on it there even kind of fold up the towel towel a little bit clean the inside yeah you get that as good as new see no it's much better there you go now let me get a dry paper towel I can even clean the internals here a little bit oh yeah that's nice that's basically bringing you there and again you can use a q-tip you can go much more extreme I'm just really trying to give you guys the basics now we go dry long dry this guy off here okay now let's get to the bottom base a lot of times oil will set up in there the isopropyl actually did a really good job of just getting that out as you can see I haven't touched it since we pulled it out of bath so for this one you can take some isopropyl a really scrub down but in this event I don't see that as being necessary I'm just gonna go ahead and just dry it out give it an extra little clean I mean this doesn't look bad at all I suppose I mean the e-liquid and the ISO the isopropyl got rid of a liquid stains rather well just by even dipping it into that sometimes with different oils or CBeebies you could have a little bit of a tougher time you might have to give it a couple baths and a couple cleans but like I said case-by-case basis you will know exactly how far to make it so that's done there now we're gonna get the top air flow piece for this you want to twist around the airflow piece sometimes you get residue caught in the middle there or on different ends always good to twist it around to get the inside this gasket also removes because we didn't actually use this tank much there was really nothing caught in there it looked pretty new but you can actually remove it also so you can see because we didn't use it there wasn't any residue trapped in there but you could have removed this gasket also and dropped it into the bath with the gasket so we're just not gonna best so we're just gonna clean off the outside of it it's sat in the bath this will be fine get this we're going to dry off the inside and again if you want let these sit out natural air dryer more it might be better or if you just blow dry them off we're really doing an express job just to not make this video seven hours and for us to get it done so that now the most important part is is not to forget your gaskets so you want to make sure that you drop in your gaskets now with the sub ohm tank what's very critical about it is that you have a gasket that goes into each side of where the glass interacts so one of your gaskets is gonna go right here into the very top of the mouthpiece let me get these form-fitting gloves a little bit better you want to go in there you can take your little tweezers I'm gonna push them down to make sure it's in the crevice nice and easy just kind of go around don't poke the gasket to compromise it that gaskets in there nice you want to take that put your glass in there you gotta feel it line up then your other gasket is going to go inside the crevice on your bottom base you're gonna want to make sure you drop it in there it drops them there good because otherwise that will give you bottom leaking because your tank most the time sits upright so if you had to pick one of the two to do perfectly this is definitely the one the top gasket really compromises only if you leave your tank upside down or on its side with the air vents over so you put this one is good to your bottom base now we could have cleaned up the heater but in this event I just grabbed a new one this is a sub ohm heater you can pick them up on the website they come in five packs I already took the liberty of removing it out of five pack that's brand new then you're gonna want to screw it on to the tank you want to get a nice tight screw you're gonna feel the two pieces of metal connect you don't need all the time if you when you're cleaning your tank the next time you're gonna fight with it that much more get a nice good hand tight where you feel the metal connect and it's making electrical connection you're not gonna get any bottom leakage and then you're going to connect the glass and you're gonna screw the actual body of the tank together with screws into here and you want to get it tight don't want to over tighten it don't want to put too much pressure on the gasket is completely unnecessary then you're gonna take it you're gonna fill it prime it that's the place you do it but before you do that you want to do a quick atomizer check to make sure you did everything right in your tank works screw the top piece on and then you can do an atomizer check this is a brand new tank out of the box that hasn't been used and I gotta say if we do a close up even though we rushed through the cleaning procedure I mean this is this is pretty closely it's not a bad job for doing it really quickly and we could have done a little bit better but basically looks brand new so now we're gonna do an atomizer check before we fill it up because the worst possible thing you can do that we've gotten a lot of angry phone calls and we don't want this to be an angry phone call if somebody just goes to the process of cleaning their tanks takes a gram of very expensive distillates or something puts it in there and they didn't do something right or the heaters not working and now they're in a big dilemma where they just dumped a whole syringe in there and we don't want to be the cause of your frustrations so do a quick atomizer check to make sure you put the tank together properly you're all cleaned up and dried out what you're good is you just screw it onto a battery of 510 battery you're going to turn it on in most of the time when you turn it on it'll already give you an atomizer resistance reading right here it says point 5 ohms if we get good close up of that right here in the lower corner you'll get a resistance reading you see that resistance reading generally that means that you have an electrical connection now what you're gonna do then is you're gonna turn your wattage all the way down all the way is down as far as it goes then you're gonna push the fire button and as long as the timer starts don't leave the timer on a long time because then you could get a burnt taste in there burn up the coil but as long as the timer starts you know that you did a good job and that tank is gonna work and you put everything back together properly the atomizer you put in there's legit everything is good on that end so now you can take this tank and you can go through the priming and filling procedures that you would as if you purchase the tank from us a brand new so now that showed you exactly how to maintain and clean the most complex tank that we offer and it's not is only going to be easier than that one I promise you so we're gonna jump right back to the tank that has been sitting upside down now what you're going to want to do with this is now it has an isopropyl in it so you can see there's still a little isopropyl in it so you have two real options you could do here is you can take a very nice thin piece of thin piece of napkin and you can use your tweezers and actually get inside there to get it out to kind of spin and twist it around that might take you a while or you can use a blow dryer trip on this one - is he use make sure that you get it nice and dry on the inside I actually take my glove off for this one because this is a little bit more delicate than these gloves weren't exactly sized for me the glove does not fit so what you do is you take your napkin sorry not a napkin your paper towel you can roll it up into a nice little fine braided string so it has a little bit of substance and it's ultra thin then you get this string in there you get it between the center post the inside of the tank and you can actually kind of move it around and get any remaining pieces of the isopropyl out it's working just fine here it's gonna take you a little bit of time because a very thin very small very delicate so I honestly suggest using the blow dryer method or letting it sit upside down for a few hours that will definitely work for you too once you've gotten basically all of the isopropyl particles little droplets out of there you know that you will be all set to check to see if the tank works and get another fill on it including these little 510 tanks if you're putting different strains in there or if it stops not performing but it still works that's because there's residue gummed up in there you want to get a better taste out of each one to make sure it's a taste neutral and you get Paul residues out definitely good idea to clean your tank before you fill it this one I can still feel my hands it has a little bit of isopropyl on so it's good dry it off get inside the mouthpiece get the air holes now when you screw it back together and we're gonna do the atomizer test we're just going to use this mod battery remember when using your honey stick carbon fiber that carbon fiber battery you're gonna use a five ton tank on it make sure you flip the ego adapter upside down otherwise it won't read and it won't work so you flip it upside down let's turn it off move this little silicon protector screw it on now we're going to turn our battery on as you can see now it's registered at one point three ohms which is actually the factory specs for the tank as you get residues and they're dirty the resistance will actually go up on the ohms so now we push it oh wow I even heard it hissing there actually burned off some of that a little isopropyl and I still be trapped in there but now we know we clean up the tank the resistance is back to the factory specs on the original heater and it is ready to vape so this is a good way to clean you little 510 tanks get a little bit more life out of them get a little bit more usage out of them and when you're going in between tanks to make sure you're clean and pure so for this and several other cool pro tips make sure you subscribe to our channel

the\ntechnology on board and everything is ok but certainly it is still fifteen thousand\neuros cheaper than its competitors so we forgive but on the other hand\nsee the thing that is a little less

"-3rDI0b_u2c": "so welcome and please type any questions that you have into chat can everybody hear me if so you can type yeah so you can raise your hand if you have a question I will periodically be looking back at the questions in the chat box and answering them step-by-step and what we're going to do today is go through the process of concatenating and running a loop in in a concatenate and running dimensionality reduction using the T stochastic neighbor embedding T City algorithm in flo-jo version 10 and so what we'll do is I'll go through the process via a slide deck just explaining the step by step and then we'll jump back and forth to an actual flo-jo workspace where I'll do the process slide for you and follow along so let's go ahead and talk about the whole process again can everybody hear me okay see my participants list here and yes okay well thank you very much I appreciate that feedback okay so again my name is Tim Crawford my email is Tim C at Flo Jo comm I'm the central u.s. application scientist howsoever Canada if you have any science questions or questions about the topics that I've gone through feel free to email me I can also provide you with the training slides that I'm presenting today as a reference for your use in the future so export and concatenate is the process of merging multiple files into a single file it allows you to take several different samples or different tubes that you've acquired on your site ometer and actually merge them together into a single new FCS 3 standard file so there are two basic options the the export concatenate functionality is found under the file tab of your flo-jo workspace under the document and there is a function called export / concatenate and if you click on that button you will find two options one is export or concatenate populations that would be when you highlight a specific gated population in one or more symptom more than one sample and you want to merge those samples together to form a new file or more emergence populations or you can export concatenate a group this would be at the root level of the file so you wouldn't be actually concatenated or merging gated populations but you'd be merging root level part of files with all of the events contained therein and so when you want to concatenate or merge these files together you will select these samples or the gated populations and then initiate the concatenated process by clicking on this export concatenate either populations or group option and it will open up this window in the bottom right hand corner which is a export or concatenate user interface window the first option will be to the first thing you'll need to do is click on the concatenate tab instead of export because you will want to actually merge using the concatenate file and then select a format from the drop-down list my suggestion for everyone if you want to bring the file back into flo-jo so that you can perform dimensionality reduction is to leave the FCS 3 format checked if you want to push out the action because because what that will give you is a new FCS file with the raw data and a compensation matrix associated with that data if you want to push out as a CSV file you can choose to push out the actual compensated values that are already been corrected for work for us and spill over but if you want to bring it back into flo-jo use your FCS 3 option and you have a destination location where the save will occur this will be specify where you would like that file to be written in on your desktop or in this case I put on my desktop but you can put in any shared network drive and then we have a bunch of other options so always include all events the parameters will be left as all uncompensated parameters in this case because we do not want to actually export the corrected compensated data we actually want the raw data plus a compensation matrix so you want the uncompensated parameters it will come with the com matrix when the file is written just like a normal SCS file then you have some Advanced Options for naming you can give a prefix or suffix that is unique to the file that you are competiting and there are options on the right-hand side under Advanced Options to concatenate all files together concatenate every specified end number of files so you can do four at a time or concatenate files with equal keyword values this would be like if you wanted to concatenate a group of 20 files together but each there's a there are five patients and so you could say concatenate all the same files with the same patient IDs together you can also add additional new parameters when you concatenate or merge files additional parameters are keywords that's metadata information such as in this case the stimulation condition I've chosen to add as a new parameter this will separate out the files into the groups based on the keyword labels that you've given it so if I give my condition a designation of one two three or four depending on how I've stimulated or treated those samples then I can pull apart each of those conditions even if there are multiple files in there with the same condition they'll be merged together I'll show you where we're going with this all right concatenate groups the same deal except that you just highlight the group instead of individual files and what we're going to do is actually merge these together so that we get a group of files together in a new FCS file and so in this case the sample ID versus a PC size seven plot this is a merged concatenated file where I actually ran some beads staying with an APC size seven antibody conjugated for Chrome or a floor Chrome conjugated antibody and I what i'm doing here is titrating up the voltage on the photomultiplier to the dul to detect the detector for APC size seven and as i increase in voltage the separation increases between the negative and the as an infraction the stain versus the unstained events and after you get over a certain point you get this spreading effect that is due to the increased PMT voltage but obviously you don't get better separations so there's a sweet spot the detector here is what I'm looking at and I can visualize this very easily by showing all of those samples together in one concatenated file output over on the right is what I'm going to do today with you guys I've got a single patient that's been where I have PBMC peripheral blood mononuclear cells that have been stimulated for different lengths of time with a mitogen and what we're going to do is we're going to merge these samples together and then do an entire dimensionality reduction on all of the samples together in order to be able to compare the changes that are occurring in that dimensionally reduced data space now to do this type of down of concatenation and peace and need dimensionality reduction I'm going to use plugins and plugins are Java programs that come with flo-jo there's five plugins that you'll see in your plugins menu under the workspace tab there's a populations band with a plug-in drop-down menu and these come with the new installation of flo-jo you download the newest version of Clojure you'll find that there's a plugins folder and that contains those five plugins and if you just follow the installation instructions you will find that those plugins are available now under the workspace tab plugins menu now I'm going to use two plugins the down sample plug-in and the TCE plug-in today to do this process in addition to concatenation down sample creates a gate containing a limited number of events that are evenly selected across the entire time slice of the samples so they are basically a random selection from the parent population so you get down sample population with fewer events but it still reflects the same phenotypes and functional properties that you would see in the entire file and then piece of e which is a dimensionality reduction algorithm which is going to create two new dimensionally reduced parameters the 2d parameter what we will do take each of these samples we're going to add some gates which I've already done down sample to a specified number of events on a certain gate and then merge those together using concatenation then we'll run TC and we'll pull apart each of the individual samples from that concatenated file to take a look at them these other additional plugins Spade flow means and cell ontology these are useful downstream of T Sinise paid for clustering so ontology for querying what you don't know what your phenotype represents but these additional three spade plumbing cell ontology plugins require the our statistical computing environment you have to set up our and download the packages for these pot for these algorithms before using them now when you run a plugin I know it's a very wordy side but why but it just says if you run a plugin you'll be asked to save your workspace and then each time you run a plug-in operation a file out is put in the derivative holder that's named the same as your workspace and save in the same location as the workspace and every time you run a plug-in you'll get some sort of external file that's produced and it will be saved in that derivatives folder so down sample I said is very simple you select a limited number of data points from a simple from a sample or gated population and in order to initiate that down sample mechanism you select a sample node or a gated population in this case I've already gated out bad Dublin so that cells and I've isolated only the small lymphocyte population and then selected or isolated using a gate only live events based on a live dead die discriminating reagent so I exploiting the live events by highlighting the single node that I've highlighted that I've selected here and then from the workspace tab I'm going to select my plugins drop-down and select down sample it'll bring up this loser interface where you select the number of events and you can give your population as unique name click OK and you'll get a down sample gate like as shown down here down sample DP pop is the default where you get 5000 events contained within that population representing a slice of the live population that I that I've done so so why don't we go ahead and go through the concatenation process and then I'll talk about T see me with you in more detail T see me is an algorithm for dimensionality reduction it creates two new parameters which separate out that data into a dimensionally reduced data data space stop calling me and sorry my phone is ringing out that there allow and a lot of people use this as part of the first step so you can look at all of the phenotypes in the same dot plot instead of doing a hierarchical gating where you do gate on 1 phenotype want another phenotype you can only use two parameters at a time well this takes into account all the parameters that you dimensionally reduce using the algorithm and here I've taken a 15 parameter data file and I've actually dimensionally reduced it using TCE and what I've done is gate on known phenotypes in green are the just to demonstrate the separation of the different the different subsets within this sample in green is all the cd4 cells but in the node that is dark green here that I'm circling with my mouse those are the T regs and they parse out into a specific node or a little peak here that show that they are similar in phenotype based on the antigens that we've measured with this with a 15 color panel the brown cells here are the are the cd8 positive T cells and then we've got some memory cells in dark brown we've got some natural killer cells and some activated in case over here that are dark red and then some b-cells in blue so very clearly just using the basic lineage markers you can separate out all your lineages and depending on how deep your panels go what kind of antigens you're interrogating you can get down to very very small populations with subtle differences in antigen expression but all of that information is included in this single 2d plot Tisa neat algorithm so let's go ahead and jump back here what I'm going to do is jump over to my workspace and I'm going to double check if there's any questions okay where I have four samples I have four samples in here that I've described these are this is a simple time course where I've stimulated PBMC from a single patient so the LD one is the nomenclature for my patient ID and then these different no stem and stem designations depend on what type of stimulation combination these cells got and so the nose dim sample if we look at live events let's say and look at c3 let's take a look at a interfering gamma here real quick so interfering gamma is an express very robustly it's on the y axis in the cd3 or positive or negative populations in the absence of stimulation but if I go through here and look at the two hour stimulation you can see the nice upregulation or robust expression of interfering gamma from some T cells or from your natural killer cells here and so what we're going to do is start by doing a down sample on the live node I've got some other gates in here but they don't really matter what matters that we want to merge the live events together and seeing how I have about 200 and over 200,000 live cells per sample I'm not going to merge all of them together to run T Semyon I'm actually going to do that down sample population mechanism under workspace plugins here is my down sample option and I'm going to reduce the number of events in that gated live population make a new child population containing something reasonable so that the TC algorithm takes just a couple minutes to complete teasing is a very memory intensive algorithm and so if you try and throw a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand events at it you'll be waiting a while before the parameters become visible calculated and available to you so for sake of time I'm going to start with just 5,000 events here and I'm going to click OK and they get this down sample population so every time you run a plugin you get some sort of node that says what you did so this is down sample of live and this is actually an operation that I can drag and drop to a gated population somewhere else so and it will create this down sample DP pop so what I'm going to do is grab the down sample of live and I'll drag it to the next live node here I could do this at the level of the gating tree upstairs to in the group menu but then I end up with this down sample population open to me too but I had some down sample population here and a down sample population there I'm going to do that two more times just going to grab this down sample of live bring it to the live node and it will calculate I knew down sample population on that sample and then once more a down sample on live so now I've got these four gated populations that are all named the same thing and they're all downstream of the live samples so what I want to do is take my down sample DP pops and select all of them and I can do this in two ways either I can hold down my command modifier key on my Mac and select multiple populations one at a time and this works just fine if I'm only dealing with four populations but about twenty or more samples that I'm dealing with there's also a mechanism if you right-click you select a single sample gated population node and right-click you can select the equivalent nodes that are in the same point in the gating hierarchy and selecting equivalent nodes will then highlight in one motion one right-click select and select equivalent nodes will highlight all of those populations that are the same name there down sample DB pop on the live note so now I have all four populations selected now I'm going to go to my file tab and select export concatenate I'll open this workspace up so you can see the full icon here export concatenate under the file tab and it allows me to select their populations or group I'm going to do the populations because I want to only get the live events in there that I had selected in my downsampled EP pop dated populations selecting export concatenate populations will bring up this interface that allows me to select all of the properties for my export or concatenate save now export is the default when you open this up and if you notice in the bottom it says a status box where it says this operation will generate a four new data file so this export operation would only export the down sample TP pop events as individual files will not merge them together what we need to do is first select the concatenate tab select concatenate and then it gives us a status that says this operation will generate one new data file so it shows you tells you how many data files you're going to expect to us so what I'm going to do is open up these Advanced Options it's a expandable box down at the bottom and allows me to give some new names remember and I'm going to just label with a suffix for this file the LD one in this case the patient ID nomenclature remember that you just want to bring it back into flo-jo you concatenate or export you want to export as a FCS three form there are some other CSV options but we don't want to do those unless you're going outside a flo-jo it into some other program so FCS three is our format I'm going to put this in the destination that I select it's going to be on my desktop and then I want to include all of them I've already done down sample here and I want to include all uncompensated parameters and really important if you want your gating tree to apply to the new concatenated file to leave this parameters as all uncompensated parameters it's the number one thing that people or mistakes that people make is they choose the compensated parameters but you don't want compensated numbers you want the raw data it will come with a matrix a compensation matrix if there's one attached to the original data the new file will come with that matrix as well so just leave those alone give your file a name and then in this case I'm going to keep the concatenate all files together but remember I could concatenate every n number of files or concatenate files together based on their keywords what I will do here is choose an additional parameter so I can pull these files apart this is again keyword information is metadata that I've labeled on the front end when I acquire the data and I put these this information in so I can pull it out after the fact and use it to merge all this flow data into a database but I have a condition or a stim keyword here so I can select the stem condition keyword so I'll get a new parameter when I can catenate these together that I can select called stem that will pull apart the files into individual conditions now you always get a sample ID parameter which will do the same thing so I'll show that to you in just a moment when we write the file now that I have all my options set up for concatenating as FC s3 including all events all uncompensated parameters all files together with a new parameter I'm going to generate one new file and press the concatenate button it's going to write the file and then what I'll do is open up I'll select the existing workspace which is the one I'm working on it'll just when I close this dialog it will bring that file in otherwise you can open in a new workspace or just close it and it will just have the file on your desk but when I open when I close this selecting existing workspace then that new file gets loaded in close the concatenate dialog now I have five files in life in my workspace here because I'm using inclusion criteria for this group called gates I get that file automatically included so concat 1 LD 1 is my new concatenated file here and it gets all the gates and you'll notice that the gating is a hundred percent the frequency of parent is always a hundred percent up through the live node because I'm only including events contained within that that gating hierarchy because I down sampled on the live node and included only events I've got full 100% there's 20,000 events total and then at the cd3 level we look here it'll start getting smaller in terms of frequency apparent because I'm actually getting down to populations and interests now if we go ahead and look at the concatenated file as I've done here in a rap window double clicking will open up a graph window and I take a look at the drop-down options for our parameters you will find two new parameters one is a sample ID parameter and this is automatically created every time you concatenate files together and it will be the files will always be ordered in the same order as your workspace list here so in this case LD 1 no stem 20-minute two hour two hour and 20 minute is the time course here and that's the same order that they will appear in the cat file if I select sample ID so here's sample ID that separates the events from each individual file and it allows me to gate on those individual events now I can separate out the individual events from each sample so I'm going to call this no stem condition and then I'll do a couple more gates here just in one stem to stem 3 and notice how I've normalized using down sample the number of events going into this concatenation process this is important down streaming but I want to consider how the samples are changing over time in this assay we call this next one stem one then stem to stem 3 instant for skin 2 and step 3 all right so I've got my gates here on this concatenated file I'm doing it on the live node so there's my no stem gates and they each contain 25% almost and that's what I'd expect because I expecting 5,000 vents per sample and there's one in here somewhere so now I have all of those gates now what I'm going to do is go ahead and initiate this Tiffany algorithm on the data set that I've just merged together using the concatenation process and this will give us two new dimensionality two-dimensionally reduced parameters that represent all of the data in a single plot so I'm gonna go to my plugins first I select the sample I want to use T Simeon and then I'm going to select the Tizen II option from the plugins menu under the workspace tab here within the TC me menu we'll go back to this again I'll go back to the slides while it's running I'm going to select the parameters I wanted to mention or reduce so remember that we want to use the compensated parameters that's the corrected ones with the compnay tricks applied and I'm generally not going to use any parameters that I didn't stain for in this case I have one extra blank parameter that did not get a for Chrome Anna Boch conjugating antibody and so it doesn't represent anything I'm not going to use my argh my live dead reagent because I've already used it in the gating tree to identify live cells instead I'm going to take the in this case eight parameters that I have that are phenotypic and I'm going to run this but I'm going to make a few changes just one change to to this the settings of the algorithm the iterations is the number of cycles the algorithm goes through and I know from experience with this data set that thinks everything separates pretty well at about five hundred and fifty iterations and if you let it go longer the data will get further and further apart so the continent of the end result will look further and further apart not be like a like one continent structure the perplexity is the number of events that each event pushes and pulls off of as the algorithm is calculating and so I'm gonna leave that it's 20 but I might include increase the perplexity if I had larger numbers of parameters and I was using a higher parameter file in this case I can choose to generate a movie and then take a look at it so sometimes you just might want to leave the 1000 iterations and keep the movie checked and then we'll come back and take a look at the movie over time to initiate the algorithm calculation I choose selected parameters bottom right corner and this will initiate the calculation where you'll see by a hearing node with a star so it's teasing me in that it's calculating so that's going to take a couple minutes and we'll get back to that okay so we merge that file now we're dimensionally dimensionality reducing the file creating new parameters going back here I also have a stem condition parameter you can see that if I select that it separates out the files I look at a functional marker here such as the phosphorylation of the extracellular signal regulated kinase map kinase signaling molecule under no stim that's very low the phosphorylation of Earth is very low if you stim for 20 minutes with a mitogen cocktail or shoots up and if you get longer stems then the pots that the MFI goes down a little bit but the cells remain positive over long periods of time 2 hours 2 hours and 20 minutes if I look at another functional marker in this assay interfering gamma you'll see the expression of interfering gamma from natural killer cells and cytotoxic t-lymphocytes under the longer period stimulation so you don't get expression of a cytokine that fast after 20 minutes but you do get it after 2 hours in 2 hours and 20 minutes and so what I'm showing you here are the functional markers that are changing over time between these different individual samples and what we're going to use TC me and the gating for the different stem conditions is to take all of our phenotypes into account in one plot and then we'll pull apart each of the individual component files here and see how the phenotypes change due to the phosphorylation of a signaling molecule and the expression of interfering gamma under the longer stem conditions alright so while that's calculating again it'll take a couple minutes here even with 20,000 events in my MacBook Pro so I say limit the number of events you're starting with we'll get to that so as I've gone through here and I've shown you in order to initiate dimensionality reduction on a sample or a gated population you want to highlight that sample or dated population and then go to your workspace tab plugins menu select the T cine option from that plugins menu and then you will get a user interface window where you can select the options well the parameters that you want to use for the dimensionality reduction and the options for the algorithm I would only play with initially the iterations and perplexity options unless you really know the math behind the algorithm leave ETA and theta alone you can generate a movie click choose selected parameters and it runs so what is the end point of TCE it creates two new derived parameters the derived parameters are optimized in the way that the data points that we're close together in the raw high dimensional data space are now close together in this dimensionally reduced data space so here I've done the exact process that I'm showing you where I have dimension well I've taken live events down sampled them to each live event from the four samples that I loaded two to five thousand events and then merge them into a concatenated file then I have run Tisa need to generate two new driver ammeter they'll show up under the sample as a over B and then it will have a TC knee X versus T sin dy it shows the perplexity iterations ETA and all of the general properties of the algorithm that you've set there in the in the naming scheme so you can run this over and over again to get your your beautiful continent now I'm going to have to pull this apart so I've got all of the events now I'm showing you here in a little plot all of the events together in the dimensionality reduced data space T sin T X versus T sin T Y and then I've gated on each of the individual stem conditions and pulled them apart we're looking at density plots here we can now get a very clear visual view of how these are different from each other right control stim ones dim to instant three these are different because they've been stimulated for different lengths of time and we have had phosphorylation of the irk module and then cytokine expression of interfering gamma by those cells that are competent to express it those changes in the phenotypes drive the events in this data space this dimensionally reduced data space to different locations within the file and what we'll have to do is get on nodes here apply them to each of the stems or vice versa gate on nodes and take the stem and apply it to the nodes that you gate it and we'll get an idea of how those nodes are changing over time or how those populations we've defined are changing over time let me go back to my workspace here and we'll take a look I keep jumping back to you this view to see there's any questions ok fine oh I do have a hand raised if you can type in Eric to our chat box your question I'd be happy to answer it for for you so now I'm back here I've got my concatenated sample and I've got these new x and y parameters that were calculated so if i open up that sample at the root level to make it big we'll take a look at the TCB X versus T sin T y so y versus X here how does this look nice separation between different populations it's just a big continent like structure or these islands that form you know a group of a group of islands as you might have said however you want to describe it sOooo color is not the best way to look at these outputs I would recommend using a contour plot which gives you some idea of where the peaks and the valleys are or a density plot can also be very appealing here where you actually get how much depth there is with all these little dense nodes so I'll leave the density plot yeah keep it smooth there and we'll pull apart those individual samples and will find that they're very different so how do we look at this data first of all I can always create a gate on any on this dimensionally reduced day of space and so maybe I will take a little auto gate here and I'll make a node that's just called query we call it Q UV or Y query one that's just my my I want to know what is contained within that within that node in terms of its phenotype so I'm going to look at the phenotype here and actually I can make this a little bit bigger using my plus button maybe that wasn't the best auto gate you can also just do an ellipse or any type of polygon gate to get around the node that you want some use a polygon here alright and I'll call this query two now I'm going to take this I'm going to pull over to my layout editor and start exploring this data set and take a look at the phenotypes that are contained within these various query nodes query one and query two so let's open up the layout editor by using this el button up in the static toolbar it will open up a new layout turn off those gridlines that I got on and I'm going to drag my population in my first the route population which shows the two parameters that I was looking at last in the graph window along with my gates there now one thing I may do is duplicate this I can right click duplicate to move it over and then I'm going to drop on the to query nodes on top so query two and query or query one and query two and you'll see that as I drag and drop onto the same dot plot I get an overlay this can be turned the default is just a dot plot overlay but if you right-click and go to the properties menu for your layout editor graph plots we can change this into a different type of plot I like looking at these as contour overlays there so now I can see those different colors and you can always change the colors maybe I'll turn this one into a purple line alright so you can see purple versus blue versus whatever now what I'm going to do is right-click on this overlay that I've created and actually show a multi graph histogram and it will show me a histogram profile of every parameter in this in this file for each population that I have in the overlay so we'll see a red it represents all events and then the gated query one and query two are blue and purple respectively so if I create histograms here I will need to make it bigger to see everything and delete some of these guys that I'm not going to use I've got some blank ones in there that I don't need I'm just going to remove those and I'll be with each parameter that is actually relevant dead there that's all of my phenotypic parameters here so what we can see immediately is the difference in these different phenotypes see the blue region is obviously a cd8 expressing T cell that has some cd38 on it it's c3 positive which makes sense and then the purple gate over here query two up at the top top is actually a cd4 high expressing cell it's also cd3 positive and it's cd38 negative and so when you have these overlays or any type of histogram it can just be a single histogram - I can now move these gates around in the area of the TCD data space and explore it just by changing the gate and so how does my query to look when I bring it over to this region down in the bottom right that is still a cd4 cell except it's a positive so those are stimulated cd4 so I move it over here this is not a cd4 population this is actually hyper cd38 it's got some interfering gamma expression cleric positive it's probably a natural killer cell because it's negative for oh no it's positive for HLA dr which means it's some sort of b cell or antigen presenting cell and so you can a to explore this data space that is dimension that dimensionally reduced create a gate or series of gates on the graph in the graph window and then make an overlay of those query gates for different regions or just a single region and literally and then right click and make a multi graph histogram to show all of the phenotypes and explore that data space simply by moving and the query gates to different regions and in real-time all of that data will update so over here what query 2 is now eeper for positive HLA dr- perk positive it's totally a natural killer cell of some sort if I move it over here to the other node well that's the stimulated natural killer cells and so the difference here unstimulated and stimulated between those two density points is the difference in expression of cd38 actually oh no it stimulated or phosphorylated versus not phosphorylated is the difference there and so here I'm just exploring the data space using a query gate that I can take a look at what's going on within this data space the other way to do that is to take the gates that you already have drawn know about your hierarchy set of gating that you've already created and do an overlay so let's take this concatenated root file again over here and what I'll do is I'll take a known gated population and ask where are say my cd8 positive T cells I'm going to take my gated cd8 positive population and drag it over and here now I can see in blue that's the default first color in the overlay that everything in blue is by my standard hierarchical gating a cd8 positive T cell and so then the difference is within that cd8 region are going to be driven again by phosphorylation and cytokine expression in this particular dataset where am I cd4s cd4s here i drag and drop there in orange so all my orange areas are cd4 if i go and take a look at some additional let's go ahead and gate on them I'm going to gate on antigen presenting cells here which are HLA d r+ d r+ them to calm and then we'll do CD 3 negative dr negative and so these are going to be mostly antigen presenting cell just going to be mostly natural killer cells once I have the gating there for them I can't right there and there I can then again drag and drop to make it overlay and see exactly where those are located so my dr+ population is going to be over here in green now and my dr- natural killer cells so I'm getting the same answer as exploring with a query gate to see what the phenotypes are just by taking my known gating hierarchy and applying it in an overlay in the layout editor to my TC me data space that dimensionality reduced data space now how do these guys look separated well I've already shown you that we drew gates based on what stem condition now on the sample ID parameter that is created when you concatenate a file to separate out each of the individual set of files to separate out the individual events from each file and we probably did the gates against some other marker I'm thinking I think I drew against I hid our or not easiest way to get back there is to open up that case and I'll go to the parent population haha there it is so yeah come to the VR vs. simple ideas right so I've got each of these individual component samples so what happens when we bring them just duplicate this guy again duplicate and bring it down and we'll take a look zoom out a little bit here I'm going to pull in each of the individual sample files no stim all right so there they are and if I double click on those I can change all of the parameters at the same time to the X and y and go X T city versus why it's easy I'm going to make this again a density plot I'll show the grid so we can see it all right so now we have these individual samples clearly right the unstimulated sample only comprises a very small fraction or you know a 25% fraction of the entirety and now we can see that those where the unstimulated events lie and then if we look at the stimulated events right they have different positions here because they have literally been driven in two different locations because of the changing phenotype due to the stimulation in this case the phosphorylation and then over here in the third and fourth stem they look almost identical because there's only twenty minute difference between these two sim periods and so they're essentially just picking up the interfering gamma expression and so the phenotypes are very similar between the last two but they're very different between the first two so one thing that we can do if we have any gated population what I'm going to do is open up the original graph here from my nose stem display the X versus Y T semi data space and I'll take a node here we'll just take a node and say well what happens to this population population nose yeah go pop one now ten percent of the events in the no stem sample have this pop one's phenotype whatever it is the way I can ask how is it changing or if this population is going away or B and we're increasing under the stimulatory conditions is by taking my pop one and dragging them to the other stems but I can also do this by right clicking and copying that node just copy and then paste it to all three other stem conditions paste and you'll notice that the frequency here is now very different in these stimulating conditions under twenty minutes ten there's only 1% and under the other so about 1% so this 10 percent population whatever it is is changing it's going away and those events are now moving and we go to a different location I don't know where they're going to there's no cause and effect here but I do know that this population is only representative stem and that it is down regulated or changed under costimulatory conditions I can do that whole thing instead of making individual gates I can do the whole thing in a different way let me go ahead and give it a try here today what I'm going to do is actually use the plug-in called Spade which is a clustering algorithm and I'm going to create a bunch of populations using Spade I will just select the parameters that are used for Tisa mean all 18 your typical ammeter x' until flo-jo or the Spade algorithm to correct create 50 new populations and click OK and we'll let that pronounced see if I get a nice output from our what this will do is create a whole bunch of populations and I don't know what those populations are because it's an algorithm that is creating them but they should what I can do is then take my gates for the stem conditions and copy them to the Spade populations and it's any population it I know that the starting event count were equal between the different conditions the no stand stand ones dim to stand three all had five thousand events twenty five percent so if nothing changes between those conditions every population I create whether it be a gate that I create in a graph window manually or whether it be an algorithm derived gate cut such as these Spade populations I just created fifty new nodes that based on state and I should be able to see here this I want to grab each of my gates here that are 25% of the starting material and copy them and paste them here so now if I take any population and I take a look at the frequencies here if there is no change then in that populations frequency between the difference conditions then you should have equal 25 percent contribution to that population from every sample if there is a change such as in this one this population is over-represented under the nose dim condition and underrepresented understand 3 it's only about 21 events in it so let's take a look at something that has more events 322 events so here I've got nearly 25 percent it goes up a little bit under skin 1 and down in stem 2 so this phenotype whatever it is in top 13 is going to be upregulated under the 20 minute stem and you can take a look and then I want to what I would do is actually export these through our table editor and all these numbers and and take a look at how the changes that are occurring what's going up and what's going down and identify each of the populations that is going up due to the stimulation or down due to the stimulation or has no change to the stimulation the same goes with any type of time course in any type of phenotype you're looking right there's going to be populations of events that are upregulated due to your treatment or your condition of your of your asset and then there are some that are going to be going down and you will be able to identify them and then phenotype them by dragging those populations over to our phenotype overlay as one option alright so I'll pull this in and obviously it gives me a population that is down over here it's an orange and it's got an HLA dr it's in the region of the antigen presenting cell population I can call the phenotype here for each of those or I can actually take that set papi teen top 20 I can take that node and I can add any statistics that I want to it such as going to my tools tab right so little I'm going to be under workspace there workspace tab add statistic I can add medians of all compensated parameters all compensated parameters there and so then I'll get statistics for that node and again I can copy these statistics to all the other Spade population nodes by selecting all of them and then copying to my Spade pops then I can export the actual raw statistics if I want to use the actual MFIs median fluorescence intensity x' as a measurement of what's on and what's off in terms of expression pattern you can use those statistics as well so the workflow overall is to bring your data in and clean it up in some way so we always want to get rid of doublets those are events that pass by a detector two at a time in this case I've got a size gate on my gating hierarchy so I open here we've got doublets discriminated using forward scatter height versus area taking only events that are on the diagonal then I've got a size gate I don't care about in this case the monocytes and the samples were five called so there are no grands and I'm only taking the small event so I'm using a size gate on forward scatter versus side scatter to identify just the lymphocyte population then I discriminate between live events and dead events in this case this is the die if the that gets inside the cell at the membrane is permeable of the cell is dead so I remove all of the dead events to clean up just to my live events because you really only want the good functional happy cells and at that point that's where I go through the process after cleaning up of down sampling to a reasonable number of events so I can get in this case five thousand events per sample if I had more time I could put twenty thousand or even fifty thousand events but if I'm doing a TC me with more than a hundred thousand events it's going to take quite a long time to get the result so I make the down sample populations here and then select each of those down sample populations by highlighting a single down sample population node right-clicking and selecting equivalent nodes and it will select all the into the nodes that have the same gating and the same name here in that in the samples in that group that I saw that I'm on so now I've got all four together again we will go to our file tab initially and we will select export concatenate populations select the concatenate tab here leave defaults for everything in terms of output except if you want to put it into your destination that's going to be different decide where to put it but leave the invents and read the parameters you can give your a gift give your concatenated file unique name my new file however that be and then you can concatenate all of those files together and click the concatenate button which will write the file to bring it back into the same existing workspace check the existing workspace box and close the dialog and now I have just made a new file called concat one my new file because i have the same parameters in this new concatenated file and i've had a group own gating approach because this file goes into the group called gates it gets all of the gating and now I have this twenty thousand event population or file that I can initiate teason e or dimensionality reduction on by going to the workspace tab plugins menu select the TC algorithm and you will select within this menu all the parameters that you want to use for the dimensionality reduction again I'm not going to use a blank or the live dead parameter in this case scatter parameters might be useful especially if you're looking at any other populations I'm only interested in lymphocyte so I'm going to leave them out and then I select the number of iterations and perplexity that I would like I would say start with a thousand and see how it goes and if the data is spread out too much after initiating that you can go back and watch a movie that is generated to see where they set all the populations separate and before they separate out so much that they're kind of fragmented choose selected parameters in the bottom right corner will initiate the algorithm and it will take however long it takes and create these new derived parameters called t sandy X versus T CY and ultimately you will then be able to explore that dataset by selecting T cine X versus T semi Y in the x and y parameter dropdowns of a graph window create any number of geometrical gates and name them whatever you want my gate or query in this case as I did before and explore that by either taking on that dated population the median statistics for each parameter that you haven't numerated or interrogated in this in your panel so again that would be to go to my gate here's my gate one and take I'll add the medians in this case of all compensated parameters and that gives me an idea of the phenotype based on central tendency of the populations there or I can visually explore the phenotype by taking the root population the parent over and then creating an overlay by dragging and dropping other gated or created populations if you're using a spade algorithm onto your overlay and again this is drag-and-drop drag and drop to the same dot plot in your layout editor will create an overlay and it will give it a new color for each gate that I've created or that I've dragged on and along with a color-coded legend you can change the colors you can change the layering a right-click on any overlay will allow you to select a multi graph histogram which I find to be the most useful when you spread it out here you can very easily see the differences in those different regions of phenotypes for all of your markers and so if you're exploring by creating manual gates you can create the overlay right click create histograms as a multi graph and see what those phenotypes are for the gates that you've created and remember this all updates in real time so once I've created a gate here in my workspace I can move that gate around and all of the data changes in the layout editor to reflect the actual gating within your graph window in real time in order to pull apart the individual samples and compare them you can separate either by selecting sample ID which will separate into individual component files the single files that you merge together using the concatenate or using your own keyword combination that could be something like stimulation or time point or condition which again also just separates these out into individual files in this case and then we can actually gate on those files and pull apart each of those individual component files but the key here that I'll reiterated over and over again everybody asks is that you have to merge the data together before initiating the dimensionality reduction in order to have a common data space to compare the different time points or different samples or different treatment conditions or different stimulation times anything imagineable can be compared after dimensionality reduction if you go through the process of merging those files together using your concatenate options under the file tab so let me go ahead and ask if there are any questions here yes I see a few so when we addressed these number one is there any way to color the TCE pots based on intensity of marker expression at this time there is not Eric what I would do for that is actually take the expression profile of any given marker and make an overlay in the layout editor and basically use quartiles or fifths right I would gate on low medium and high and then overlay those I can give you the an example of that here real quick let's say I want to take a look at the expression pattern of HL ADR across this so I'm going to make a histogram of HL ADR and then I can make any number of gate dr neg let's say all right dr neg dr mid er mid and b are high we are we do plan to have an actual color scheme in the graph window soon so pretty soon you will be able to just select the color and see where these expresses where everything's expressed D are high but what I would do here is make an overlay onto one of these let's just duplicate this guy move it down and drop these Meghnad highs and you can make it any number of the shades that you would like so yeah so most of them are negative some of them are red but then you turn into a different population what I would probably do is go and do like a very light blue bar see let's go light blue middle blue dark blue color scheme type of thing and that would show me exactly where those different populations actually lie and I could do that for any number of markers using different colors that make one red one blue and everything and make a really nice if I chopped it up into various additional gradients I'd be able to make a nice expression pattern of a single color over time but what you're asking for will be available in future graph window just for the checkbox for a third parameter for color mapping let's see we have you choose five thousand events what's the max events the plug-in could handle I would say Jane and to all all attendees here it depends on your computer I know that I can run twenty thousand events on my 2013 MacBook Pro in in a couple minutes so I can demo it if I was actually running this for analytical reasons in a study I would want to put as many events as I can and you just have to know that the length of time it takes for the TCE algorithm to to complete depends is directly related to the number of events that you throw at it and so at this time I wouldn't throw more than a hundred thousand maybe two hundred thousand at the most at a time and this is really a discovery type of approach not necessarily an analysis approach so you're going to take a representative sample using down sample and then take a look at it and extrapolate up from that now having said that we have some bioinformaticians at flo-jo that are have been improving the math and the speed and we will very soon be releasing an update to this plugin which will allow us to throw a million events at a time and have the algorithm in a reasonable period of time and so it's getting better but right now I would say 100 or 200 thousand events at a time and even so I'd run that and go on coffee break or take lunch while it's running and come back and see if it's completed after after lunch co-expressed parameters you know Carolyn the question is how does TC deal with co-expressed parameters and I'm afraid I don't have the understanding of the math behind it to really tell you exactly how it would deal with that it would not be representative if you like you can reach out to me and I can I can ask that question directly to one of my mathematician friends at the office and so you would type a response they do but I would assume that Co Express parameters will be just you know yeah I don't I don't want to go into or make a hypothesis there because I would be truthful in my knowledgeable in that respect so stimulation and conditions is another question from Jane do I have to label before acquiring the data in order to do this in teasing the analysis may I specify as keywords when I analyze the data great question great question and we'll get Carolyn I'll show you where we can see the movie as well thank you for bringing that up so a key words can be added to any workspace if you don't already have them there they can be added on the collapse all of my dating trees here so you can see that the basic default is the name statistics and number of cells fields within the sample samples pane of the workspace so if I want to show more print you've already have written those keywords into the file ahead of time I can display that information using my configure tab edit columns function so this is first if I already have them I'll get to your yes you can add them and then I have all these keywords that I've added such as stem condition and an HIV status and patient ID and I can just bring them over to the columns to display these are all the column values in the SCS filings or column headers in the FCS and then columns to display within the workspace I can choose whatever in for piece of information from this file in this case I'll show ya kid stem and HIV status when I click OK those become columns and so these are the keywords that I used but if you don't have them there yes you can make them under workspace tab in the workspace ribbon there is an add keyword function there's a keywords band you can click on add keyword give your keyword a name my name keyword you can call a time point you can call it time course whatever you want right all it needs is a numerical value to order those keywords to get it one two three four right and and I then you type in information and it will then become available that new keyword when I go and do my hole concatenation process which is select equivalent nodes export concatenate populations now when I choose those additional keyword parameters because I made my new keyword there it is my new keyword with a value and it will separate out the four files into the order that I choose one two three four but interestingly if I wanted to merge say another patients for different sample files I could give the no stem value of one for that patient as well and two and three and four and then I will have I still get the same output which is a new keyword parameter that separates the files based on whatever nomenclature I've given them but the two files with the same value that both have one would then be represented together in that population and the two files for the next one of the two files for the next one so you could merge a hundred files and have n different conditions and ten time points or ten patients ten time points 100 files altogether and separate them out in any way using these labels and again to label a new keyword go to your workspace tak I'm sorry go into your workspace tab and you the add keyword button create a new keyword just give it a name click OK and you'll now have a column where you can fill in or late the labels for that information Jane the asterisk the question from Jane is do you have to put an asterisk before new keywords no but if you do then they will all end up every time you look for a keyword it's going to be in an alphabetized list and if you use like edit columns here all of the dollar sign keywords are things required by the FCS standard and I put an asterisk simply because all of those will now all of my keywords will group together below the dollar sign so I have an easy way to find all of my own user enter keyword information using the asterisk but it is not required just a trick I found long ago to keep everything organized one more question where can you see the movie here so let's go ahead and take a look at that when I go to the concatenated file where I've run the collapse these are focus on this one where I've got these TCE x and y parameters already calculated there is wherever you run Tisa me you will see a little star with the word t cine that means it's been run and this is a platform a platform I can drag this piece any node to a different population and it will initiate teasing me with the same user inputs are the same options so if you double click on a platform though like T city it will bring you back to this choose selected parameters where you can rerun and overwrite the original like if I wanted to now change this to 600 or you can actually get the movie so the movie of previous T sandy run is a button right here I can click on that and it will open up the movie and it will show now in 5 iteration increments the actual movement of the data and some point here I'm going to pause this and it's because it's going to separate out get better here it goes all right there's my separation it's moving it's moving and so if I run this with 1000 iterations I can kind of stop it and be like oh okay I like that right I clearly have separation in two different continents if I let it go a thousand iterations it generally separate too much and these of these different areas will become fragmented into the corners and sometimes you cannot scale and so there's a sweet spot here right and that's what I'm doing is is just running the movie one frame at a time or every five frames really it's about that and then I can select the one I can go through it just mousing over and I can find the point at which I think it is really good and then use that iteration a number of iterations for my my default for that data set now those movies and any other of any other information that is produced in a plug-in mechanism if you go to these plug-in tools and select the plug-in there's all these data derivatives these files that get produced by plugins and those are all stored go back here my screens that you can't see and I here is my workspace that I was working on today there it is so here's the workspace that I created today and here is the plugins derivatives folder if I open that up you will find that within that derivative folder there is a sub file or folder for each plug-in down sample here is before nodes that I down sample so that's actually the information on the events that were chosen in the down sample process each time that I used it here is the Spade information within stayed there is a whole bunch of information that I'm not going to go into at this time there's a zip file that contains all of these files that are created by the our statistical computing environment some of them are trees Spade node trees some of them are Network information and some of them are just a sample node attribute so here I've actually got all of the information about the Spade clusters including the node ID at the population information that the actual relates to the populations that are created within flo-jo the event count of each of those populations and then all of this information including the medians of each of those populations for each rammer so I actually have all of the medians and stayed notes already there and so all I'm saying here is that every time you run a giveback season he actually has the movie information is contained within this here it is T Sydney movie and maybe double click on the actual link then it'll link all of the frames right for each of those images and so here I'll double click on this one and it will open it up and that's what it's linking to is these derivatives folder so every time again I'll go back here for a sec every time you run a plug-in you'll get some sort of pot of node associated with the plug-in whether that be be spayed or the TCA algorithm that's doing the work if you double click on that node there will always be a link to get to your derivatives in this case the derivative participe is really the movie frames that we've saved so that you can explore the entire TCE algorithm how it separates the data over time in the movie in the case of spade I double click on Spade then I can show the trees or get the zip file and when I get the zip file it opens is up the actual zipped derivatives folder that has all of that information from the Spade run in it and so again these are these plugins are doing an external algorithm outside of flo-jo and we have to save the derivatives from those algorithms in some form and so what happens when you run any plug-in you will always get a new file folder containing created in the same place as your workspace with the same name as your workspace so here's my workspace that I've been working on use the derivatives folder and know that derivatives folder has all of the information about the plugins and their associated runs let's see do I have any more questions here guys I'm going to open see if I can open this up real quick for one more ok okay I've got a QA question from Anna there seems to be a lot of smaller clusters her question her comment is there seems to be a lot of smaller clusters in cd4 in the cd4 island do you think they are justified by population heterogeneity revealed by your other markers or there's some meaningless fragmentation yeah so overall you seem to have way more clusters on this map than what your limited list of channels would imply so it's a great question Anna and if we go back to this cd4 population in the layout filter and I've got yes I've got a whole bunch of layouts but if you look at the actual CD for events and we could do that here by grabbing the cd4 gated population and displaying it and open that up and we'll just look at cd4 X versus Y there's two reasons why I have so many populations one is that these there's three different stem conditions essentially for here but three different conditions that drive changes in the phenotype sequentially that is first up regulation of the phosphorylation event and then second so I'll get bacteria there's ago boom X versus Y phosphorylation events and then at the cytokine profile and there are th1 cells in this assay in the cd4 population that do express cytokine and so when I look at this as a density plot and you see all these little nodes there are two reasons for this one is gradiated expression of certain markers such as cd38 if you look at the total cd38 population let's just drag this on here so here in green now are the are the seedy force and if we kind of zoom is kind of hard to see with the other colors here you can see that there's a tremendous amount of variation in say t-38 there's variation after the stimulation just due to CD lower cd4 because you see 384 can get internalized under strong stimulatory conditions and so we actually have variation of cd4 antigen expression between the stem conditions we got variation of cd38 we've got some cells that Express HLA ADR and there but not very much and then we've got two functional markers that are moving between the different conditions and so what I think you're seeing with all those little nodes there those are totally valid changes I don't believe that is noise at all it's being driven by the gret the gradual phenotypes that are different between these different seating for populations and the and the functional changes that are occurring due to the stimulatory events the irk and interfering gamma of regulation okay I'm just looking if there's any other questions I don't think there are and you guys are great thank you very

bit of maintenance that you can perform on your 5 5 10 atomisers should you think that's a good idea or not obviously every atomizer is designed specifically to be a disposable device the more they get used their performance reduces the less vapor that you get and eventually they may fail altogether or they may just carry on for a very very long time but you know not performing as well as they would have done when they were brand new so is there anything that you can really do well of course there's all sorts of clever ideas out there about how you can clean them but the end of the day an atomizer is primarily a heating coil which is got a dead short across it from a battery that is chucking in some cases quite a lot of amperage and voltage at it which makes that coil get very hot or even glow red-hot depending on how much power you throughout it and that coil will inevitably build up a lot of gunk and rubbish on it and the more it does the less well it will perform and in addition the actual coil itself will start to break down and eventually it may very well burn out so the trick is to keep them as clean as you possibly can the trick with the 510 is being able to get chilly get at the atomizer itself or the heating coil is a closed unit you can see that obviously it's got the the base part and then it's got a cylindrical body and then inside the base is the actual atomizer assembly itself so how did you get the base off the cylinder to be able to have a look at the atomizer well you can see that the paint work on this particular maximizer is pretty grim well there's a good reason for that is because I've been using these on the pliers and quite simply what I've been doing are being taken one pair of pliers and I'm not not going to be able to do this too well with through the camera but quite simply grabbing them like that one end is grabbing the base let's put it in a bit more on trying to do this through the camera viewfinder which is not so easy and then grabbing the cylinders close to the base as possible and then starting to twist them like that as if you're unscrewing the two now the two are not actually physically screwed together but this motion does get the cylinder off the base of the atomizer and the wrong enough to do is take it out of camera view because I simply can't do it but they can see the cylinder is starting to come away from the base of the atomizer just another quick pull here and it will be off and there we go so now the cylinder is off the atomizer base be very careful with this not to hold it too tightly because you could crush your cylinder but it's a fairly substantial piece of metal and is not going to bend to easily but be careful nonetheless so now you've got the atomizer exposed and I've got a macro setting on here it's not getting into to greater detail but you can see there you've got the wire wool type wit bridge and then inside as I say the I don't think the camera is really good enough to get a close-up image but inside just let me get something to use as a pointing device here we go inside the atomizer thought under the bridge along there is the heating coil and that's the bit that you want to clean now with the 510 when you first open it up you'll see some fibers and those fibers are I don't know they're made of with us some sort of nylon type deal I have no idea but the idea of those fibers is that as the juice hits the atomizer assembly it soaks into those fibers and it feeds the juice to the coil so it keeps the coil damp and as you know the fire tenders run quite hot so keeping the 510 coil fairly moist at all times is also going to improve the longevity of the atomizer but I tend to find that those caught that those fibers over time get quite hard and crusty and a fairly grim color as well so what I tend to do is I hook hook the fibers out they'll sort of be filling that archway there you can see but that's where they'll be and what you can do you can pull them out with a pair of tweezers just whip them out but that does mean of course you don't have the facility the fibers feeding the atomizer anymore it's a bit of the price you pay if you're going to try and get it that coil because it's the coil that we want to try and clean a little bit now if I just grab one second let's all that I use to try and clean it which is very very unsophisticated all i'm using is a fairly cheap jeweler's screwdriver driver like that and literally all i do is i get the atomizer and i just get the screwdriver inside there and i start scraping away sorry towards me not away if you if you go in that direction you could catch the coil turns and break the atomizer so you want to bring it towards you like that and just try and scrape as much of the muck and rubbish away as you possibly can on both sides now the final tool to use is quite simply an old toothbrush and just gently clean it away both sides like that make sure it is a fairly soft toothbrush not anything too harsh going in there because you can damage the coil it can be fairly vigorous with it and you'd be surprised how much muck and rubbish that gets off the the coil and once you've gone through that process that's pretty much it from from my point of view of what I can do with it if you can think of a better way of cleaning those coils without damaging them then do let me know but this process certainly increases the lifespan of the atomizer in my view and it also more importantly increases the performance quite a bit once you've done that then obviously you need to close up the atomizer like that because I've opened this a few times already it's actually quite loose but when you open one up for the very first time you'll find it pretty tight but there you go that is just how I try and get a bit of extra life and a great deal more performance over a longer period of time from my 510 atomisers and I can tell you now they you know once you've done that you'll get a lot more vapor out of it than you did previously the thing to bear in mind because you don't have those if you have removed the fibers we do remove the fibers during this process then you're going to result in the atomizer not holding onto as much juice for as long because there isn't that supply from the fibers in which case it will dry out quicker it dries out quicker it's going to get hotter and Hacket cut that in turn could burn it out so you need to have a bit of a balance here but certainly after I've done this the vapor production improves quite considerably so there you go incidentally I did look at other atomisers such as the 901 here but you can see in the 901 the actual atomizer base is right inside the tube and very difficult to get out the only thing you could possibly consider doing is clamping it and advice and then putting a small screwdriver or something like that down the edge to see if you can tap it out frankly I don't think that would work too well this is just an adapter what by the way so that i can run it on 5 10 batteries but they go that's how i try and give a little bit of maintenance to my 510 atomisers i hope you found that interesting be very careful if you try this you could destroy your atomisers so all at your own risk of course but if it means that you can run your atomisers for longer than they might have otherwise lasted then that's that that's worth doing any rate I hope you enjoyed that and find it useful and we'll see you again cheers for now", "SYa819AN0Kc": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] wicked music

a look at how to calibrate the extruder on your 3d printer now before we get started if you would please click that subscribe button in the bottom right hand corner that helps me out with the YouTube algorithm gets the channel promoted more and gets more people watching these that said let's get started calibrating your extruder sounds really complicated a lot of people don't do it for that reason everything you've ever seen on this channel until this video all the prints I've shown you all of my printer profiles they're all done on machines that are not calibrated the printer profiles are dialed in for factors machines still with their factory settings the reason for that is I realize most people don't want to mess with this and that's fine a lot of people don't there's nothing wrong with that Quality has done a really amazing job of giving you a great machine out of the box but if you want to get that last couple of percent of quality this is something you're gonna need to do and it's simple we're just coming up with two numbers we want to come up with an E steps number two input in your LCD and we want to come up with a new flow percent input in cura now to do this we're gonna have to do some measuring and some math and I'm gonna walk you through every step of the way and it's really simple in between that we're gonna run a test print this new test cube is linked in the video description as well like I said I'm gonna walk you through each step it's really simple we're just gonna do some test prints we're gonna do some measuring and we're gonna do some math that's it so let's get started alright in order to calibrate your East steps you're gonna need a calculator a sharpie marker and a way to measure the filament now for the second part of this video when we're running calibration cubes you are going to need a set of digital calipers and they will work for this face step two but if you don't have digital calipers and you just want to calculate your east steps you can do it with a steel ruler do not use a cloth or plastic measuring tape like you would use for sewing those can stretch a little bit and they are not as accurate you do need at least a steel ruler or digital caliper so that said I do have a link for digital calipers in the video description from Amazon that aren't too expensive if you don't already own a set we're gonna start off with heating the printer up now you want to put this to about the temperature range that you normally print at if you go too hot the filament is gonna feed too easily and it won't be as accurate as it won't give you an accurate representation of what you're actually feeding at your normal print temps next step we're gonna mark off from the point the filament enters the extruder back up towards the spool 100 millimetres once that is done make a second tick mark 10 millimeters beyond that so you've got two tick marks one at 100 one at 110 the reason for this is if you're slightly over extruding and that first tick mark enters the extruder you're not going to know how much I actually fed in you'll be able to subtract what's left from the second tick mark from and figure out what actually ran through the system so next step we're going to go to the LCD menu move axis extruder go down to one millimeter and crank it up to 100 and let it feed 100 millimeters through your system now in my case I came up short it did not feed the full 100 millimeters it's 11 millimeters short so in actuality I fed 89 millimeters to film it through when it thought it was feeding 100 so I need to check and see what my current East steps are you do this by going to the menu going to control then motion and then go down to steps per millimeter and see what your estep rating is so mine is 93 your should be 2 this is the stock factory setting so the first calculation we're gonna make was we're gonna take 100 which is our intended length multiplied that by the current east steps number which is 93 or if yours is different multiply it by whatever that number is but for a stock in door 3 or an under-five it should be 93 and that gives us 90 300 so write that number down next calculation we're gonna take that 9300 and divide it by however much filament fed through your system in my case it's 89 millimeters you could be over it you could have over extruded and it might be 105 or 106 you could have 92 millimeters but whatever amount a filament you fed through your system is that second number okay so 90 300 or / in my case 89 gives me a new estep number of 104 0.4 so I'm gonna go back to my east steps and dial that new number in 104 point 4 and then this is very important I'm gonna go up to control motion and store settings you must click that otherwise the next time you power your machine off and bang on that new number is going to be lost so make sure that you hit store settings and then I'm gonna run it through again another 100 millimeters same process and just test and that tick mark is right on the opening so I'm dead on where I want to be I told it to feed 100 millimeters and it's fed 100 millimeters now next step is to calibrate your flow we know it's feeding the right amount of filament through but that doesn't always mean our slicer is going to calculate things right and so the second phase of this is finding out the current flow number for your slicer so what I want you to do is whatever profile you're using change the flow to 100% and we're gonna run the test cube that is linked in the video description here out so load that test cube in your slicer and you're gonna want to make sure that the wall thickness is set to 2 if you're using a point four millimeter nozzle this cube is designed for calibrating 4 millimeter nozzles the walls are exactly 0.8 millimeters wide so you'll get two shells so your shell numbers should look like this 0.8 and 2 and what that's gonna do when it slices is going to give you two perfect walls and when we run this out it's gonna look like this and it should measure 0.8 in my case it's measuring 0.92 that's too thick I'm over extruding still so I'm gonna take my desired width which is 0.8 divide it by my average of 0.9 and when you measure your cube you're gonna want to measure it at least once on each side so you want to take four measurements and average them some people take two measurements for eight total and average them in my case my average was nine and I come up with a number of 88.8 that's my new flow percentage so I'm just rounding that down a hair it's always best to be a little under extruded on these so I'm gonna put in 88% as my correct flow now that said when you do this be aware for a miniature for a terrain profile this is the number you want for a miniatures profile you're gonna want to use a number under this now for me I am using 84% for my miniatures profile I've taken 4% off of this for small 28 millimeter miniatures you do want to under extrude some it will fix a lot of stringing and blobbing issues and simply because of all the tiny movements on this all the tiny it layers it's really hard to regulate the pressure in the melt chamber if you're printing a larger model it's not an issue for something tiny with small arms legs sword Spears you need to help the printer out a little bit and under extrude and you'll get a much better quality manager so whatever your number is back it down 4 or 5% for your miniatures profile that you're using now run this again and with my 88 and my shell walls come out perfect now that's it that's as it's a simple process to get your machine perfectly tuned for extrusion thank you for watching please click that subscribe button in the bottom right hand corner [Music] [Music]", "36u4gberzC8": "hey everybody today we're gonna go through section 1.3 bed leveling or tramming in Luke at fields help guide my name's Jim and this is the edge of tech [Music] so the first step in this is to go ahead and loosen or lower the Zn stop the Zn stop is on the left side of the machine and that's this piece right here you'll see it has two bolts we're just gonna go ahead and loosen it with the small end of the allen wrench and then we're gonna lower it just a little bit and you can actually loosen it enough so it will lower lower than that rail or if you want to you can remove it the next step is to go ahead and in pairs we're gonna go ahead and tighten all of the knobs front the front pair and then the rear pair we're gonna tighten them all the way up until they're completely tight they can't be turned any more and just so you know if you turn it towards the bed like this that's loosening it torti towards away from the bed I'm sorry is tightening it there's actually little arrows on my knobs which is great but this way it would be loosening this way is tightening and then what we're gonna do is back them off in pairs two in the front and then the two in the rear off of four terms and make sure you work in pairs here so you want to grab both both wheels and you want to do four turns just like that and from the back a little more tricky but do it as best you can and make sure you do it in pairs and that's going to give you the best result here so step four asks us to go ahead and disable the stepper motors so with the machine on you want to click down on the little round button go to prepare so turn it one time to the right click down and scroll down till you see disable steppers and go ahead and click that button now you've disabled the stepper motors so step 5 asks us to manually move the hot end down above the bed in the front left corner so here's the front left corner I'm just gonna pull out my bed just a little bit then we're gonna use this z screw and go ahead and lower it down by twisting that Z screw and that's step 5 in step six what we're gonna do is take a piece of paper just like this I take the bottom third it's a little bit easier to manage of a piece of copy paper then we're gonna go ahead and set it under there and then we're gonna use the Z lead screw and go ahead and lower it down so we're gonna take our piece of paper slide it under and use the Z lead screw carefully and go ahead and slowly lower it the nozzle down while you're moving that piece of paper back and forth once you catch and you buckle the paper just ease it off just a little bit so right there it's a little too loose but that just buckles it just like that so once you get it you'll want it so the paper will buckle like this but if you force it it will slide under there just like that but when you hold the end the paper buckles just a quick note the Z leadscrew is actually the screw right here that goes all the way up the back you can actually turn the top of it just by spinning it with your fingers that's what I mean by the Z leadscrew steps number seven eight and nine and ten are all about the Z n step so what we're gonna do the Z end stop we're gonna go ahead and put it back on the rail place the end stop on in the rail like this we're gonna move it up until we hear it click and in my case it's not far enough down so what I'm gonna have to do is go ahead and let's see there we go and go ahead and clip that off and you can make sure it's cleaned up if you want to there we go so we're gonna go ahead and put that on the rail move it up till it clicks just like that so I like to hand tighten these first and go ahead and take your allen wrench you know that the sensor in here is pushed down so it's hitting the X gantry and just go ahead and tighten that up so the next thing you want to do is go ahead and auto home your device so we're gonna go ahead and click the button on the screen we're gonna go to prepare click the button and hit auto home my case this is a little bit different because I do have the BL touch but I'm gonna go ahead and show you what it does when I do the auto home just like that and it stops when it gets to home yours will be a little different if you don't have the BL touch it should go to the front left of the bed but mine goes to the center with the BL touch so once your bed is Auto home we're gonna skip to steps 13 and 14 and then we're going to come back to step 12 which talks about the alternate method using a thing of theirs file to automatically do this so step 13 we're gonna go ahead and disable the steppers just like we did before as soon as you do that you'll hear them kick down step 14 we're gonna go ahead and heat the nozzle up to 200 degrees in the bed up to 60 degrees you always want to heat the printer up before you level or in our case we're tramming the bed is what we're doing so we're gonna go ahead and go to prepare and we're gonna scroll down and we're gonna prepare PLA preheat PLA and it'll actually take it to 200 degrees on the nozzle and 60 degrees on the bed and that's exactly what we're looking for alright when your nozzle is heated up to 200 degrees and your bed is at 60 degrees what we're gonna do I better double-check that make sure disable steppers so we'll just go ahead and disable steppers quick then what we're gonna do is move your hot end to the front left side of the bed so I'm going to push them in back and slide this over like this and it should be right in the front left now if you notice mine has a little bit of filament coming out of the bottom of the nozzle and that will affect when you're leveling your tramming your bed so I'm just going to go ahead and take my snips and cut that off and there we go knot won't affect it anymore and we should be ready to go and tram or level the bed so then what we want to do is go ahead and take our paper that we used before and we're gonna slide it under and we're gonna slowly rotate the knob in we're gonna rotate it this way we're gonna rotate it out so we're gonna slowly do that and move your paper back and forth so we're gonna move it until until it buckles and make sure it's buckling from grabbing the nozzle not from hitting your extrusion there just like that so you'll feel a drag in there so you can loosen it a little by moving it this way so scrolling the wheel this way loosens it and this way tightens it but you want to do it just so you get that just so you get the buckle and your paper just like that then you want to go ahead and move it to the right front corner of your bed now now keep your paper underneath just in case sometimes the other side of the bed will be higher and you don't want to Ram your nozzle into the bed if that happens go ahead and loosen the knob on the side that you're moving to and it'll drop it down a little for you so we're just going to go ahead and do that on all four corners all right so once you got the back-left done you want to go ahead and move everything to the front left corner now and we'll do that here careful it's hot about the same spot you were in and double-check it if it mine's a little tight because the other ones moved so I'm just going to go ahead and loosen it just a little bit so there we go now if I hold on the end it's gonna be buckling just like that I'm gonna slowly move it to the other side now and it's too tight you see right here I can't pull the paper out so we're gonna go ahead and loosen that and that will happen so I'm gonna push it in just so it buckles just to fine-tune it a little keep the piece of paper under there and go ahead and move it to the back and just double-check where you're at so I'm too tight on the back so I'm just gonna go ahead and loosen it and we're good we're getting a good fold but I can still move it you know it's not completely stuck but it is giving me a good Bend move it to the other side keeping the piece of paper under just in case so now I'm way too loose on this side so once I got to the back rear again I'm way too loose so I'm gonna go ahead and raise that back that up just a little bit here so you start to pinch and then you get the paper that will buckle like this but you can still force it like this if you want to but holding the end it'll buckle so once you went around your bed two times what you want to do is go ahead and cool down everything so we're gonna go ahead and go to prepare scroll down and click cool down everything should start cooling down now and you'll be good something to note the next step you can actually slice a 5-point test to try or maybe a live level G code that gives you a measurable first layer and then you can finally adjust it real slowly with those knobs something to note also that the bed knob is point zero four millimeters per one sixteenth of a turn when you turn those knobs so you just need to move them very very slowly so there is step number twelve we're gonna go back to that now this is an alternative method it uses a thing of Thingiverse file that you can find in Luke's guide and I'll link it below it'll take the hot end above the bed coming down to zero at each corner and then lifting up and then going to the next corner and coming back down to zero what you want to do is first you want to start by heating up your bed like I've done already you want to make sure your SD card is initialized so go ahead and click one time scroll down initialize your SD card then what you're gonna want to do is make sure your heated up and you're gonna want to print from the SD card you're gonna go ahead and choose which one you want to use and you're gonna go ahead and select it so once you selected that file it'll actually take automatically and bring your hot end to the front left corner and you're gonna want to go ahead and put your piece of paper under here and you can do this just like we did before go until the buckles then what you're gonna want to do is click your button it says click to resume when you do that it'll lift up and take you to the next point I like to keep my piece of paper honor it just in case so then you're gonna go ahead and slide your piece of paper under lifting your bed until the piece of paper buckles just like we did before just like that click the button again it'll take you to the next make sure your papers under there then you're gonna want to adjust your bed again so your paper buckles just like that now we got a little buckle hit the button again it'll take us to the next point always keeping your paper underneath and adjust it from there just like that click it again it'll take you back to the front and then you'll want to fix it just in case here we go and you want to adjust it just so it you can slide it and it just buckles like that and then it'll take you back to the back again and it'll go around completely twice so as soon as you're back at the front right side for the second time when you click to resume this time it's actually going to start printing its gonna do a test pattern that's about point two millimeters thick it's gonna go all the way around the bed and then it's going to do four actually five so now it'll start printing then you go to the front right and if everything goes right you should see it sticking to the bed if not go ahead and loosen or tighten your knobs while it's printing to get it nice and stuck you want it nice and stuck just like this and for your first layer that should be great if it's coming loose and not sticking to the bed that means you're still too far from the nozzle still too far from the bed and you're gonna need to go ahead and raise the bed just a little bit in our case we seem to be doing good so once it's done doing that it's going to go ahead and make five total test circles our test patterns it's gonna draw three circles and then fill them in and this will allow you to make sure that your bed is adjusted correctly and that the tramming is done and you can start printing so when it's done you'll end up with five test patterns along with a perimeter just like this you can use this to measure thickness it all should be about two millimeters thick also if you look at the disk you can use it to see your first layer now what you want to do is get a great first layer like this make sure everything is two millimeters thick and you can measure that and adjust your knobs accordingly and you're good to go well there you go you should be leveled or trimmed as we like to call it please like the video subscribe if you liked what you saw and click the little

it's very simple all we gotta do is calibrate our extruder or estep and today I'm going to show you how hey everybody my name is Vijay and welcome to San Tube 3d your best resource for all things 3d printing related on this channel we do how-to videos tutorials troubleshooting product reviews and many more so if you're new to the channel go and hit that subscribe button the little icon on the bottom right of your screen with that said let's jump into our video for today so before we can calibrate we need to understand what is under screwing or over suiting and how does this calibration help you okay so imagine this little strand of filament here is from tip to tip a hundred millimeters okay so basically when you tell your printer to extrude 100 millimeters it should've shoot from here to here all the way through no problem if that happens you're in great shape because your printer is doing exactly what you're telling it to do but most of the time over a period of time or even right out the box from the manufacturer it's not cannibal it's not calibrated correctly so what that means is if you tell your printer to extrude 100 millimeters so at this point it starts and it goes through and let's say it stops right here so this is only 90 millimeters but you told it to do 100 therefore you're under extruding by 10 millimeters now sometimes it could be vice versa where you tell it to print or extrude a hundred millimeters but it might actually print 110 in that case you're actually over extruded so the point of this calibration here guys is to make sure when we tell the printer to extrude 100 millimeters it actually excludes 100 millimeters and this is one of the main reasons why you get the gaps in your print and understood it on all your prints alright guys so just if you're wondering this is what it looks like when you get under scrutiny see the wings right here you could physically see the line and the gaps and right here on the chest piece as well another one would be this right here you can actually see going through and this part is really bad and the last one would be this castle right here you can physically see the lines right there and to prove my point I'm gonna go ahead and turn off the lights take a flashlight on this and you can actually see right there and right there you should not be able to see those lines so there you go so with that said let's go ahead and get right into how to calibrate our extruder or Estep all right guys a few things you're gonna need to calibrate your extruder or Estep is basically some kind of a measuring device whether it be an old-school ruler or something digital you're also gonna need about three feet just to be safe about three feet of filament or one yard I guess if you convert it and some kind of a marker or sharpie where it's gonna visibly show when you make marks on here because we're gonna have to measure the filament to make sure that it's extruding correctly all right guys just a quick side note if you don't know what temperature your filament prints best at find that out I would highly recommend it so for example this film here right here prints best at 205 for the test I'm gonna increase it by five degrees so whatever you're comfortable temperatures for that particular filament I would recommend that you increase it by five just for this test so it's spills out smoothly through the nozzle the 3d printer we're gonna use today to calibrate the Estep will be the cree ality CR 10s so the very first thing we're gonna do is go and heat up the nozzle to the desired temperature that you want so for example 205 was the best for this filament that I normally create wait but I'm gonna go and heat it up to 210 so before I turn up the temperature guys one thing I do like to do is from the main menu so I can show you okay I go to prepare move access then I go to one millimeter and I'm gonna increase the height of my z-axis the only reason we're gonna do that is because when I'm actually doing the test and they're screwed I don't want the filament to extrude right on to the glass so this is something if you do it now you won't have to do it later on down the line so just increase this to whatever height you want all right so now that we got our z-axis raised I'm gonna go ahead and just turn up the temperature again this is based on the type of filament you use but I'm gonna go ahead and set it to 210 and once we get to the designated or the desired temperature then we'll continue from there so we got our temperature up to 210 we've loaded the filament that I was talking about earlier and for this test or this calibration I'm actually gonna use this ruler right here so what you want to do is you want to find a fixed point first so most of the time it'll be right where your filament goes in so this part right here that side is gonna be your fixed point so you know take your ruler you're gonna put it like so stretch up the film it and make sure it's straight and once you've got it just go ahead and Mark where the hundred millimeters would be so that's 100 millimeters right there now one thing I would suggest that you guys also do if you under scrutiny have filament leftover and you'll know exactly where your mark was but if you over extrude you're not gonna know exactly how much you were screwed by so from that hundred go and put that in there and just mark off 10 millimeters and then Mark off another 10 millimeters so you have a total of 120 millimeters hundred and ten and a hundred right there so if it over our suits we know exactly by how much all right so once everything is good your temperatures there your filaments loaded you got everything mark you're gonna go to your control box you're gonna go down to prepare you're gonna go to move access and I would recommend that you pick the point one if you're using AK reality and down here you'll see extruder okay once you click on that this will be 0 so whatever you tell it to exclude it will do that now just a side note guys if you turn the knob too fast here for some reason the kree a let\u00ed's to reset the software and then you'll see like a Cree ality logo and nothing will happen so I'll just keep loading over and over and over like if you shut it off and shut it back on so what you want to do is do it really slowly and what we're gonna do is extrude a hundred millimeters as you can see as I'm extruding or turning up the extruder numbers the higher it gets the more filament is coming out so I'm going to keep doing this until I get to about a hundred so there you go now I'm at a hundred I'm just gonna let it finish the shooting as you can see right there and then we're gonna check if it over stood it or understood it or if we're good to go all right so I'm gonna measure how much I actually over suited and again you're gonna go from the fixed point which is right there and go and go to 120 which is right there so it looks like thirteen point one alright guys so this is the formula that you're gonna use to calibrate the new see step value you're gonna do to put it in layman's terms what millimetre you told the 3d printer to extrude times the Estep value which is in your firmware now on this part guys on printers such as the CR 10 you can actually go into the menu and find the e step value which is located inside the firmware for the CR 10s and enter 3 it will not give you this in the firmware so you would have to find out from either your Facebook group or from somewhere online what the default estep value is that's set in the firmware and that's very easy to find out you can actually just Google that or just ask somebody on your Facebook forum for those of you they can get your estep value from your control box this is how you access it go and press that button go to control motion and scroll down until you get to something called Estep which is right there so you so multiply these two together and then divide it by what the printer actually screwed it so for example what we did today okay I told my printer to extrude a hundred millimeters right so I'm gonna multiply that by the CR 10s guys if for those of you that have it the default is actually 95 so this is something I did find out for my CR 10 it was actually 96 so whatever it was you multiplied these two together and then divided by what it actually extruded now I told it to shoot a hundred but it did more than that so out of 120 which I measured I had 13 7 left so I'm gonna go ahead and subtract that so 120 minus 13 7 is 106 so my printer actually extruded 106.3 so that's what I'm gonna put down here and and how I got the 106 guys again notice this was the filament that I had so let's say from here from this point to this point was a hundred and then I added a 10 and a 10 so this dot right here was actually in the filament feeder and this part was left so from that same fixed point I measured 120 to what was left and what was left was 13.7 that's what was left on the filament from the fixed point to the 120 so I subtracted 120 with 13.7 and that gave me 106 so this is how much the printer actually routed so now you just take that and divide it so you got a hundred times 95 which is 950 okay so you got 9 and you divide that by 106 so 9 5 0 0 / 106.3 and this should be actually my new value right there because my printer actually over extruded so if I divide it like so my new value should be eighty nine point three seven and at that new Estep value i should be extruding at a hundred percent now let's say guys for you guys you actually under exclude it so let's just say what millimeter you told the printer to print which was 100 millimeters right x let's say your value still at 95 we're doing the CR 10s here and you divide that by what actually screwed it now in my case it was 106.3 but let's say in your case it only excluded let's say 95 okay so you're gonna take nine five zero zero divided by 95 does get a little calculator should be a hundred but just to double-check / 95 so now you need to set your new value to a hundred millimeters and I'm gonna show you that how to do that if you have the CR 10 guys the way I showed you to find the step value you can just go in there click on it and then just change the number but for like the CR 10s and the Ender and other printers that don't have the e step value accessible on the control box you can actually adjust this in Kyra and I'm gonna show you how to do that alright guys for those of you that I can actually change it in the firmware itself again you would just go to control go down to motion and you're gonna go all the way down to where you see e step click on that and here you can actually change the value of what it should be alright guys so the first way basically is when you have access to your control where you can manually change the Estep which I just showed you how to do now for all other printers where you can't go into the main control box or the firmware and change the actual value they just got this is how you can do it sorry I don't have simplified 3d guys so I can't show you how to do it in that but I'm gonna show you in cure so what you're gonna do is you're gonna go to Keira Preferences printers and here you're gonna pick what printer using we're using the CR 10 so the CR 10 is highlighted I'm going to click on machine settings and what you're trying to look for is the start G code right here this is the default G code that you're gonna get with Keira when you select the CR 10 or your printer so what we're looking to do is add a line to it so we're gonna hit enter right under the G 92 space e 0 and you're gonna add this line right here so basically M 92 is what we're gonna enter space e8 9.3 seven which is the number that I got earlier in the video so all you're gonna do is just add that so basically what this means is this is the line and now you know type in the m92 here in E for extruder and the new value that you got and once you do that you're all set if you go back it's gonna be there from now on so now you're telling the printer that this is your correct new step value giving you better print qualities and hopefully eliminating the under scrutiny you guys have been having but that's it guys that's how you enter it for all the other computers right here the second way of doing it if you guys have any questions comments or concerns leave it down below I'll get back to you as soon as I can and if you guys liked the video give it a thumbs up if you didn't hey you know what give it it down it is what it is if you're new to the channel go and subscribe if you'd like to support the channel guys which would be very appreciated I'll put some links down below as well and with that all said thank you guys for watching and we'll see you next time", "m2Bl4_JUEI0": "church pavel is a house so beset and frequented by specters both visible and audible that none of the family which it shelters under its acre and a half of green copper roofs takes psychical phenomena with any seriousness for to the peverels the appearance of a ghost is a matter of hardly greater significance than is the appearance of the post to those who live in more ordinary houses it arrives that is to say practically every day it knocks or makes other noises it is observed coming up the drive or in other places i myself when staying there have seen the present mrs pevill who is rather short-sighted peer into the dusk while we were taking our coffee on the terrace after dinner and say to her daughter my dear was that not the blue lady who has just gone into the shrubbery i hope she won't fight and flow whistle for flow dear flo it may be remarked is the youngest and most precious of many dachshunds blanche peverle gave a cursory whistle and quenched the sugar left unmelted at the bottom of her coffee cup between her very white teeth oh darling flo isn't so silly as to mind she said poor blue aunt barbara is such a bore whenever i meet her she always looks as if she wanted to speak to me but when i say what is it aunt barbara she never utters but only points somewhere towards the house which is so vague i believe there was something she wanted to confess about 200 years ago but she has forgotten what it is here flo gave two or three short pleased barks and came out of the shrubbery wagging her tail and capering around what appeared to me to be a perfectly empty space on the lawn there flo has made friends with her said mrs pevel i wonder why she dresses in that very stupid shade of blue from this it may be gathered that even with regard to psychical phenomena there is some truth in the proverb that speaks of familiarity but the perils do not exactly treat their ghosts with contempt since most of that delightful family never despised anybody except such people as have vowed he did not care for hunting or shooting or golf or skating and as all of their ghosts are of their family it seems reasonable to suppose that they all even the poor blue lady excelled at one time in field sports so far then they harbored no such unkindness or contempt but only pity of one pevil indeed who broke his neck in vainly attempting to ride up the main staircase on a thoroughbred mare after some monstrous and violent deed in the back garden they are very fond and blanche comes downstairs in the morning with an eye unusually bright when she can announce that master anthony was very loud last night he apart from the fact of his having been so foul or ruffian was a tremendous fellow across country and they liked these indications of the continuance of his superb vitality in fact it is supposed to be a compliment when you go to stay at church pebble to be assigned a bedroom which is frequented by defunct members of the family it means that you are worthy to look on the august and villainous dead and you will find yourself shown into some vaulted or tapestry chamber without benefit of electric light and are told that great great grandmother bridget occasionally has vague business by the fireplace but it is better not to talk to her and that you will hear master anthony awfully well if he attempts the front staircase any time before morning there you are left for your night's repose and having quakingly undressed begin reluctantly to put out your candles it is drafty in these great chambers and the solemn tapestry swings and billows and subsides and the fire light dances on the forms of huntsmen and warriors and stern pursuits then you climb into your bed a bed so huge that you feel as if the desert of sahara was spread for you and pray like the mariners who sailed with saint paul for day and all the time you are aware that freddie and harry and blanche and possibly even mrs peverle are quite capable of dressing up and making disquieting tappings outside your door so that when you open it some inconjectual horror fronts you for myself i stick steadily to the assertion that i have an obscure valvular disease of the heart and so sleep undisturbed in the new wing of the house where aunt barbara and great grandmama bridget and master anthony never penetrate i forget the details of great great grandmother bridget but she certainly cut the throat of some distant relation before she disembowelled herself with the axe that had been used at agincourt before that she had led a very sultry life crammed with amazing incident but there is one ghost at church peverell at which the family never laughs in which they feel no friendly and amused interest and of which they only speak just as much as is necessary for the safety of their guests more properly it should be described as two ghosts for the haunt in question is that of two very young children who were twins these not without reason the family take very seriously indeed the story of them as told me by mrs pevel is as follows in the year 1602 the same being the last of queen elizabeth's reign a certain dick peverell was greatly in favor at court he was brother to master joseph peverell then owner of the family house and lands who two years previously at the respectable age of 74 became father of twin boys firstborn of his progeny it is known that the royal and ancient virgin had said to handsome dick who was nearly 40 years his brother's junior tis pity that you are not master of church peril and these words probably suggested to him a sinister design be that as it may handsome dick who very adequately sustained the family reputation for wickedness set off to ride down to yorkshire and found that very conveniently his brother joseph had just been seized with an apoplexy which appeared to be the result of a continued spell of hot weather combined with the necessity of quenching his thirst with an augmented amount of sack and had actually died while handsome dick with god knows what thoughts in his mind was journeying northwards thus it came about that he arrived at church peverell just in time for his brother's funeral it was with great propriety that he attended the obsequies and returned to spend a sympathetic day or two of mourning with his widowed sister-in-law who was but a faint-hearted dame little fit to be mated with such hawks as these on the second night of his stay he did that which the peverels regret to this day he entered the room where the twins slept with their nurse and quietly strangled the latter as she slept then he took the twins and put them into the fire which warms the long gallery the weather which up to the day of joseph's death had been so hot had changed suddenly to bitter cold and the fire was heaped high with burning logs and was exultant with flame in the core of this conflagration he struck out a cremation chamber and into that he threw the two children stamping them down with his riding boots they could just walk but they could not walk out of that ardent place it is said that he laughed as he added more logs thus he became master of church peverell the crime was never brought home to him but he lived no longer than a year in the enjoyment of his blood-stained inheritance when he lay a dying he made his confession to the priest who attended him but his spirit struggled forth from its fleshly coil before absolution could be given him on that very night there began in church peverell the haunting which to this day is but seldom spoken of by the family and then only in low tones and with serious meaning for only an hour or two after handsome dick's death one of the servants passing the door of the long gallery heard from within peels of the loud laughter so jovial and yet so sinister which he had thought would never be heard in the house again in a moment of that cold courage which is so nearly akin to mortal terror he opened the door and entered expecting to see he knew not what manifestation of him who lay dead in the room below instead he saw two little white robed figures toddling towards him hand in hand across the moonlit floor the watchers in the room below ran upstairs startled by the crash of his fallen body and found him lying in the grip of some dread convulsion just before morning he regained consciousness and told his tale then pointing with trembling and ash gray finger towards the door he screamed aloud and so fell back dead during the next 50 years this strange and terrible legend of the twin babies became fixed and consolidated their appearance luckily for those who inhabit the house was exceedingly rare and during these years they seemed to have been seen four or five times only on each occasion they appeared at night between sunset and sunrise always in the same long gallery and always as two toddling children scarcely able to walk and on each occasion the luckless individual who saw them died either speedily or terribly or with both speed and terror after the accursed vision had appeared to him sometimes he might live for a few months he was lucky if he died as did the servant who first saw them in a few hours vastly more awful was the fate of a certain mrs canning who had the ill luck to see them in the middle of the next century or to be quite accurate in the year 1760. by this time the hours and the place of their appearance were well known and as up till a year ago visitors were warned not to go between sunset and sunrise into the long gallery but mrs canning a brilliantly clever and beautiful woman admirer also and friend of the notorious skeptic monsieur voltaire willfully went and sat night after night in spite of all protestations in the haunted place for four evenings she saw nothing but on the fifth she had her will for the door in the middle of the gallery opened and there came toddling towards her the ill-omened innocent little pair it seemed that even then she was not frightened but she thought good poor wretch to mock at them telling them it was time for them to get back into the fire they gave no word in answer but turned away from her crying and sobbing immediately after they disappeared from her vision and she rustled downstairs to where the family and guests in the house were waiting for her with the triumphant announcement that she had seen them both and must needs right to monsieur voltaire saying that she had spoken to spirits made manifest it would make him laugh but when some months later the whole news reached him he did not laugh at all mrs canning was one of the great beauties of her day and in the year 1760 she was at the height and zenith of her blossoming the chief beauty if it is possible to single out one point where all were so exquisite lay in the dazzling color and incomparable brilliance of her complexion she was now just 30 years of age but in spite of the excesses of her life retained the snow and roses of girl hood and she courted the bright light of day which other woman shunned for it but showed to great advantage the splendor of her skin in consequence she was very considerably dismayed one morning about a fortnight after her strange experience in the long gallery to observe on her left cheek an inch or two below her turquoise coloured eyes a little grayish patch of skin about as big as a throttle piece it was in vain that she applied her accustomed washes and angulants vane too were the arts of her farders and of her medical advisor for a week she kept herself secluded martyring herself with solitude and unaccustomed physics and for results at the end of the week she had no amelioration to comfort herself with instead this woeful grey patch had doubled itself in size thereafter the nameless disease whatever it was developed in new and terrible ways from the center of the discolored place there sprouted forth little lichen-like tendrils of greenish grey and another patch appeared on her lower lip this too soon vegetated and one morning on opening her eyes to the horror of a new day she found that her vision was strangely blurred she sprang to her looking glass and what she saw caused her to shriek aloud with horror from under her upper eyelid a fresh growth had sprung up mushroom-like in the night and its filaments extended downwards screening the pupil of her eye soon after her tongue and throat were attacked the air passages became obstructed and death by suffocation was merciful after such suffering more terrible yet was the case of a certain colonel blantire who fired at the children with his revolver what he went through is not to be recorded here it is this haunting then that the pevels take quite seriously and every guest on his arrival in the house is told that the long gallery must not be entered after nightfall on any pretext whatever by day however it is a delightful room and intrinsically merits description apart from the fact that the due understanding of its geography is necessary for the account that here follows it is a full 80 feet in length and is lit by a row of six tall windows looking over the gardens at the back of the house a door communicates with the landing at the top of the main staircase and about halfway down the gallery in the wall facing the windows is another door communicating with the back staircase and servants quarters and thus the gallery forms a constant place of passage for them in going to the rooms on the first landing it was through this door that the baby figures came when they appeared to mrs canning and on several other occasions they have been known to make their entry here for the room out of which handsome dick took them lies just beyond at the top of the back stairs further on again in the gallery is the fireplace into which he thrust them and at the far end a large bow window looks straight down the avenue above this fireplace there hangs with grim significance a portrait of handsome dick the insolent beauty of early manhood attributed to holbein and a dozen other portraits of great merit face the windows during the day this is the most frequented sitting room in the house for its other visitors never appear there then nor does it then ever resound with the harsh jovial laugh of handsome dick which sometimes after dark has fallen is heard by passers-by on the landing outside but blanche does not grow bright-eyed when she hears it she shuts her ears and hastens to put a greater distance between her and the sound of that atrocious mirth but during the day the long gallery is frequented by many occupants and much laughter in no wise sinister or saturnine resounds there when summer lies hot over the land those occupants lounge in the deep window seats and when winter spreads his icy fingers and blows shrilly between his frozen palms congregate around the fireplace at the far end and perch in companies of cheerful chatters upon sofa and chair and chair back and floor often have i sat there on long august evenings up till dressing time but never have i been there when anyone has seemed disposed to linger over late without hearing the warning it is close on sunset shall we go later on in the shorter autumn days they often have tea laid there and sometimes it has happened that even while merriment was most uproarious mrs peverell had suddenly looked out of the window and said my dears it is getting so late let us finish our nonsense downstairs in the hall and then for a moment a curious hush always falls on loquacious family and guests alike and as if some bad news had just been known we all make our silent way out of the place but the spirit of the perils of the living ones that is to say are the most mercurial imaginable and the blight which the thought of handsome dick and his doings casts over them passes away again with amazing rapidity a typical party large young and peculiarly cheerful was staying at church peril shortly after christmas last year and as usual on december the 31st mrs peverell was giving her annual new year's eve ball the house was quite full and she had commandeered as well the greater part of the peverell arms to provide sleeping quarters for the overflow from the house for some days past a black and windless frost had stopped all hunting but it is an ill windlessness that blows no good if so mixed a metaphor may be forgiven and the lake below the house had for the last day or two been covered with an adequate and admirable sheet of ice everyone in the house had been occupied all the morning of that day in performing swift and violent maneuvers on the elusive surface and as soon as lunch was over we all with one exception hurried out again this one exception was maj dalrymple who had had the misfortune to fall rather badly earlier in the day but hoped by resting her injured knee instead of joining the skaters again to be able to dance that evening the hope it is true was the most sanguine sort for for she could but hobbled in nobly back to the house but with the breezy optimism which characterizes the peverels she is blanche's first cousin she remarked that it would be but tepid enjoyment that she could in her present state derived from further skating and thus she sacrificed little but might gain much accordingly after a rapid cup of coffee which was served in the long gallery we left madge comfortably reclined on the big sofa at right angles to the fireplace with an attractive book to beguile the tedium till tea being of the family she knew all about handsome dick and the babies and the fate of mrs canning and colonel blantire but as we went out i heard blanche say to her don't want it too fine dear and madge had replied no i'll go away well before sunset and so we left her alone in the long gallery madge read her attractive book for some minutes but failing to get absorbed in it put it down and limped across to the window though it was still but little after two it was but a dim and uncertain light that entered for the crystalline brightness of the morning had given place to availed obscurity produced by flocks of thick clouds which were coming sluggishly up from the northeast already the whole sky was overcast with them and occasionally a few snowflakes fluttered waveringly down past the long windows from the darkness and bitter cold of the afternoon it seemed to her that there was like to be a heavy snowfall before long and these outward signs were echoed inwardly in her by that muffled drowsiness of the brain which to those who are sensitive to the pressures and likeness of weather portends storm madge was peculiarly the prey of such external influences to her a brisk morning gave an ineffable brightness and briskness of spirit and correspondingly the approach of heavy weather produced a sombrance in sensation that both drowsed and depressed her it was in such mood as this that she limped back again to the sofa beside the log fire the whole house was comfortably heated by water pipes and though the fire of logs and pete an adorable mixture had been allowed to burn low the room was very warm idly she watched the dwindling flames not opening her book again but lying on the sofa with face towards the fireplace intending drowsily and not immediately to go to her own room and spend the hours until the return of the skaters made gaiety in the house again in writing one or two neglected letters still drowsily she began thinking over what she had to communicate one letter several days overdue should go to her mother who was immensely interested in the psychical affairs of the family she would tell her how master anthony had been prodigiously active on the staircase a night or two ago and how the blue lady regardless of the severity of the weather had been seen by mrs peverle that morning strolling about it was rather interesting the blue lady had gone down the lowell walk and had been seen by her to enter the stables where at the moment freddy peverell was inspecting the frostbound hunters identically then a sudden panic had spread through the stables and the horses had winnied and kicked and shied and sweated of the fatal twins nothing had been seen for many years past but as her mother knew the pevels never used the long gallery after dark then for a moment she sat up remembering that she was in the long gallery now but it was still but a little after half past two and if she went to her room in half an hour she would have ample time to write this and another letter before t till then she would read her book but she found she had left it on the windowsill and it seemed scarcely worthwhile to get it she felt exceedingly drowsy the sofa where she lay had been lately recovered in a grayish green shade of velvet somewhat the color of lichen it was a very thick soft texture and she luxuriously stretched her arms out one on each side of her body and pressed her fingers into the nap how horrible that story of mrs canning was the growth on her face was of the color of lychen and then without further transition or blowing of thought madge fell asleep she dreamed she dreamed that she awoke and found herself exactly where she had gone to sleep and in exactly the same attitude the flames from the logs had burned up again and leapt on the walls fitfully illuminating the picture of handsome dick above the fireplace in her dream she knew exactly what she had done today and for what reason she was lying here now instead of being out with the rest of the skaters she remembered also still dreaming that she was going to write a letter or two before tea and prepared to get up in order to go to her room as she half rose she caught sight of her own arms lying out on each side of her on the gray velvet sofa but she could not see where her hands ended and where the gray velvet began her fingers seemed to have melted into the stuff she could see her wrists quite clearly and a blue vein on the backs of her hands and here and there a then in her dream she remembered the last thought which had been in her mind before she fell asleep namely the growth of the lichen colored vegetation on the face and the eyes and the throat of mrs canning at that thought the strangling terror of real nightmare began she knew that she was being transformed into this grey stuff and she was absolutely unable to move soon the grey would spread up her arms and over her feet when they came in from skating they would find here nothing but a huge misshapen cushion of lichen-coloured velvet and that would be she the horror grew more acute and then by a violent effort she shook herself free of the clutches of this very evil dream and she awoke for a minute or two she lay there conscious only of the tremendous relief at finding herself awake she felt again with her fingers the pleasant touch of the velvet and drew them backwards and forwards assuring herself that she was not as her dream had suggested melting into grayness and softness but she was still in spite of the violence of her awakening very sleepy and lay there till looking down she was aware that she could not see her hands at all it was very nearly dark at that moment a sudden flicker of flame came from the dying fire and a flare of burning gas from the peat flooded the room the portrait of handsome dick looked evilly down on her and her hands were visible again and then a panic worse than the panic of her dreams seized her daylight had altogether faded and she knew that she was alone in the dark in the terrible gallery the panic was of the nature of nightmare for she felt unable to move for terror but it was worse than nightmare because she knew she was awake and then the full cause of this frozen fear dawned on her she knew with the certainty of absolute conviction that she was about to see the twin babies she felt a sudden moisture break out on her face and within her mouth her tongue and throat went suddenly dry and she felt her tongue great along the inner surface of her teeth all power of movement had slipped from her limbs leaving them dead and inert and she stared with wide eyes into the blackness the spurt of flame from the peat had burned itself out again and darkness encompassed her then on the wall opposite her facing the windows there grew a faint light of dusky crimson for a moment she thought it but heralded the approach of the awful vision then hope revived in her heart and she remembered that thick clouds had overcast the sky before she went to sleep and guessed that this light came from the sun not yet quite sunk and set this sudden revival of hope gave her the necessary stimulus and she sprang off the sofa where she lay she looked out of the window and saw the dull glow on the horizon but before she could take a step forward it was obscured again a tiny sparkle of light came from the hearth which did no more than illuminate the tiles of the fireplace and snow falling heavily tapped at the windowpanes there was neither light nor sound except these but the courage that had come to her giving her the power of movement had not quite deserted her and she began feeling her way down the gallery and then she found that she was lost she stumbled against a chair and recovering herself stumbled against another then a table barred her way and turning swiftly aside she found herself up against the back of a sofa once more she turned and saw the dim gleam of the firelight on the side opposite to that on which she expected it in her blind gropings she must have reversed her direction but which way was she to go now she seemed blocked in by furniture and all the time insistent and imminent was the fact that the two innocent terrible ghosts were about to appear to her then she began to pray light in our darkness o lord she said to herself but she could not remember how the prayer continued and she had saw need of it there was something about the perils of the night all this time she felt about her with groping fluttering hands the fire glimmer which should have been on her left was on her right again therefore she must turn herself round again light now darkness she whispered and then allowed she repeated lighten our darkness she stumbled up against the screen and could not remember the existence of any such screen hastily she felt beside it with blind hands and touched something soft and velvety was it the sofa on which she had lain if so where was the head of it it had a head and a back and feet it was like a person all covered with grey lichen then she lost her head completely all that remained to her was to pray she was lost lost in this awful place where no one came in the dark except the babies that cried and she heard her voice rising from whisper to speech and speech to scream she shrieked out the holy words she yelled them as if blaspheming as she groped among tables and chairs and the pleasant things of ordinary life which had become so terrible then came a sudden and awful answer to her screamed prayer once more a pocket of inflammable gas in the peat on the hearth was reached by the smoldering embers and the room started into light she saw the evil eyes of handsome dick she saw the little ghostly snowflakes falling thickly outside and she saw where she was just opposite the door through which the terrible twins made their entrance then the flame went out again and left her in blackness once more but she had gained something for she had a geography now the center of the room was bare of furniture and one swift dart would take her to the door of the landing above the main staircase and into safety in that gleam she had been able to see the handle of the door bright brass luminous like a star she would go straight for it it was but a matter of a few seconds now she took a long breath partly of relief partly to satisfy the demands of her galloping heart but the breath was only half taken when she was stricken once more into the immobility of nightmare there came a little whisper it was no more than that from the door opposite which he stood and through which the twin babies entered it was not quite dark outside it for she could see that the door was opening and there stood in the opening two little white figures side by side they came towards her slowly shufflingly she could not see face or form at all distinctly but the two little white figures were advancing she knew them to be the ghosts of terror innocent of the awful doom they were bound to bring even as she was innocent with the inconceivable rapidity of thought she made up her mind what to do she had not hurt them or laughed at them and they they were but babies when the wicked and bloody deed had sent them to their burning death surely the spirits of these children would not be inaccessible to the cry of one who was of the same blood as they who had committed no fault that merited the doom they brought if she entreated them they might have mercy they might forbid to bring the curse on her they might allow her to pass out of the place without blight without the sentence of death or the shadow of things worse than death upon her it was but for the space of a moment that she hesitated then she sank down on her knees and stretched out her hands towards them oh my dears she said i only fell asleep i have done no more wrong than that she paused a moment and her tender girl's heart thought no more of herself but only of them those little innocent spirits on whom so awful a doom was laid that they should bring death where other children bring laughter and doom for delight but all those who had seen them before had dreaded and feared them or had mocked at them then as the enlightenment of pity dawned on her her fear fell from her like the wrinkled sheath that holds the sweet folded buds of spring dears i am so sorry for you she said it's not your fault that you must bring me what you must bring but i am not afraid any longer i am only sorry for you god bless you you poor darlings she raised her head and looked at them though it was so dark she could now see their faces though all was dim and wavering like the light of pale flames shaken by a draft but the faces were not miserable or fierce they smiled at her with shy little baby smiles and as she looked they grew faint fading slowly away like wreaths of vapour in frosty air marge did not at once move when they had vanished for instead of fear there was wrapped around her a wonderful sense of peace so happy and serene that she would not willingly stir and so perhaps disturb it but before long she got up and feeling her way but without any sense of nightmare pressing her on or frenzy of fear to spur her she went out of the long gallery to find blanche just coming upstairs whistling and swinging her skates how's the leg dear she asked you're not limping anymore till that moment madge had not thought of it i think it must be all right she said i had forgotten it anyhow blanche dear you won't be frightened for me will you but but i've seen the twins for a moment blanche's face whitened with terror what she said in a whisper yes i saw them just now but they were kind they smiled at me and i was so sorry for them and somehow i am sure i have nothing to fear it seems that madge was right for nothing has come to touch her something her attitude to them we must suppose her pity her sympathy touched and dissolved and annihilated the curse indeed i was at church peverell only last week arriving there after dark just as i passed the gallery door blanche came out ah there you are she said i've just been seeing the twins they looked so sweet and stopped nearly ten minutes let us have tea at once", "hSttc_gUmiw": "hey what's up guys uh today we're gonna make an exhaust for krusty [Music] all right so here's what i got i got a couple of used pieces of pipe this is three inch i think it's connected to the mufflers of our old truck went over the rear axles there and out to the back we got two of those i got a u-bin that i ordered and uh two glass packs from summit those are three inch glass packs and then uh the pipe that's on the truck now is two and a quarter so i got two and a quarter reducers from three inch and then uh this is two and a quarter inch pipe so i'm going to cut this probably and uh connect this to the pipe that's on the truck so it'll come down and shoot back and put these on there and then run my three inch and put those on it i was thinking about making an x pipe with that with these two pieces cut a little off each side and weld it together all right guys i got my cut off this [Music] and i bought me a new welding helmet uh this one's got replaceable batteries got a little place right here just open up it's got aaa batteries in it all right so now i'm just going to cut this in half with my grinder let's safety second whoa [Music] all right here's the piece that bolts to the manifold that comes down real close to the frame there so i'm gonna try to kick it over with this little wedge piece and shoot it back this way a little bit so i'm gonna go ahead and tack that on there first i'm gonna put my bung hole plug in there all right i got that piece cut kind of the way i want it it's going to be something like that all right this is what i got so far i got them just tacked on there got both sides so uh now i just gotta take them off and weld them up and then you put these reducers on all right got that one finished up got some bird turds on there that should hold it let's see that weird bend i had to put in it all right here's the other one we'll weld it up real quick [Music] all right now i'm going to try to cut these bins off and make me an x-pipe right here so i'm probably going to cut it right here where it bends up both sides and then cut the front of each one of this off and try to weld them together there all right i got that kind of marked out i don't know how this will work i'm going to cut it find out let's see [Music] all right this is what i got so far not even close i'm just gonna put my grinding disc on there and keep grinding until it fits flush and then we're going to weld it up i got it ground down to where it's pretty close there's a little gap there i think i can feel that all right guys this is what i got i measured twice cut once and still messed it up so these really need to be over more like that so i'm gonna go measure again and then uh i think this time i'm just gonna give my measurement here and then just tack wheel these on and then stick it under there to see what it looks like before i keep grinding my pipe off here i'm just going to tack it up go see what it looks like this sucks because my truck is on the other side of the house and my garage and welder and everything's on this side of the house so this is what i got so far i did take these back off and grind it down and got my gap a little bit closer there i got the right measurement this time i got my reducer's tacked on so now i'm gonna slide it under the truck and make sure it still fits in there yeah so that looks like it's going to work like it uh i don't like how close it is over here to my fuel lines and all so i might cut this and shorten it up all right so now i'm gonna go ahead and shorten these up a little bit i'll probably make them even with that i got it marked here i'm gonna cut these welds off here right there right there kind of straighten it up a little bit and cut my bends off and then i'll take these bins and move them up and try to line them up and cut off what i need there all right this is what i got so far well it's not completely lined up with that one i think i'm gonna take off another inch all right here it is got it all tacked together uh now i just got to weld it up all right i got it all welded up got some good bird turds on there it's enough to hold it together so i'm gonna take it and try to put it back on the truck make sure uh it didn't work from the heat make sure it still lines up and everything and then uh i'm gonna take it off and try to wire brush it off and put some paint on it all right it's lined back up here got it all bolted on so that's what we're working with so it don't hang down at all it's tucked up in the frame there so i'm pretty i'm pretty satisfied with that uh i do need to get some exhaust hangers i got some tie wire holding it up right now i'm just using this wire brush on this drill to clean it up with i got this thing hanging in the tree by a piece of string so hopefully it don't fall i'm gonna paint it with this high heat paint [Music] all right there it is i still got like i said i got to get a exhaust hangers the tie wires holding it up for now i don't have money to get it right now so i don't have to wait but uh all i got to do is put the oxygen sensor in and hook up transmission lines and we'll be ready to start it so next video we'll be starting it up guess that's it for this one till next time see", "lRoCwxRZsvU": "good morning the server of the doctor VAX channel and today we're going to follow up on two other videos I've made in the channel in the past two videos where I replace the extruder on a printer when you replace the extruder on a printer you need to recalibrate the printer in many cases because perhaps the gear that is pushing the filament is a different diameter and there is a parameter in your firmware in the printer that says how many turns are required of that gear by the stepper motor in order to extrude one millimetre of filament so you need to verify that's that's calibrated correctly if that's calibrated incorrectly your printer will either over extrude or under extrude so stay tuned and let's learn something together [Music] [Applause] [Music] this video today is going to be a combination of some hands-on demonstration and a Google slide deck which I'm going to use to explain the concepts let's start with the slide deck and I'm going to walk you through the steps we're going to take then I'm going to demonstrate it on my under-five printer let's get started the first step is you need a way to send G code or commands directly to your printer almost every 3d printer has a USB connection most printers support connecting that USB connection directly to a computer and then using a program on that computer you can send commands now my particular case the computer i connect most of my printers do is actually a Raspberry Pi it's a very small microprocessor base single chip chip computer and I run a piece of software called optic to print there is another video on the channel about how to set up octoprint and you'll see a link for it however many people have not done that so I'm going to highlight three programs you can run directly on your computer a PC or a Mac or even in many cases a Linux machine that you can use to send commands to your printer the first is repeating your host that's the verb I prefer I find it easiest to use with a very clean user interface when you go to download it'll ask for a donation there's a link on the bottom if you choose to not donate you can just skip that and download it completely free it is open-source the second program is simplified 3d simplified 3d is a paid slicer it for many years was considered the gold standard of slicers the free slicer such as Keira or slice 3r have become much much better and there may not be a gap between them anymore I own a copy is simplified three-deep and I really don't use it anymore the next altar of is pronterface pronterface is very interesting it's a Python program it's completely free it's not updated very often but it's often recommended by printer manufacturers we're gonna use 4 PT or host today to interface with our 3d printer the next step is you need to go to your printer and you need to mark off and we're actually going to do this right now so let's switch the screen here the view we're gonna mark off using a sharpie a hundred and twenty millimeters of filament why 1:20 well we want to measure a hundred millimeter extrusion but if we mark off a hundred millimeters and our printer over extreme suits the line is going to be somewhere in the Bowden tube we won't be to see it by marking off a hundred and twenty and then extruding 100 in most likelihood we will be able to see where we've marked the line the next thing we're going to do if we look back at our steps here is we're going to extrude a hundred millimeters of filament then we're going to measure what's left here's a mark from a previous test and I can see here that I have 20 millimeters left that means my extrusion was perfect in many cases it won't be this printer has already been calibrated now we need to do just a little bit of algebra to calculate our new extruder value remember if the measured value is greater than 20 millimeters our extruder under extruded if it's less it's over extruded so to begin with we need to know how many steps our printer thought it should take to extrude 100 millimeters so we take the value it 95 times 100 it thinks it should use 9500 steps let's assume when we measured it was 29 instead of 20 millimeters so it under extruded by 9 millimeters therefore the actual extrusion was 91 millimeters and we can use that to calculate a new value new steps times 91 is equal to 95 times 100 we simplify that our algebra new steps is equal to 95 divided by 91 therefore new steps is equal to 101 4.4 finally if our extrusion is not perfect we need to use repeater your host or octoprint or simplify 3d we need to use a program to interface of a 3d printer and to send a command to it saying change the parameter change the value in the firmware to the correct new steps per millimeter of filament okay let's go to our computer now we're going to plug in our 3d printer connect with the cable and we're going to look at a demonstration of how to do this I'm plugging in the interface and I switch the screen now to repeat of your host and I in a prior time I took and I went to printer settings and I selected the USB port of my host now sometimes it's hard to figure out what port to use an easy trick is go to the screen click on the pulldown menu and take a look at what's displayed then plug in your printer click on the pulldown menu again and see the new port that shows up that's support we're going to use most printers will work at a hundred and fifteen k bits per second a baud rate you if that doesn't work you can try higher or lower transfer protocol should be left to auto detect I prefer to set this option for ping pong communications that means send one command wait for the printer to reply that will make it slightly slower but I think it works more accurately click apply and ok ok now we're going to click on connect the connection was open and then repeat your host sent a series of commands to instruct the printer to display its current settings and so we can see here there's a variety of information displayed here you'll see that on my particular printer I'm not using the standard ender firmware I've upgraded to the Marlin firmware from th 3d which is a patched version of the open-source model and software that has some additional features enabled in particular in my case a feature for auto bed leveling that I use on the Ender 5 I'm going to clear the log now to make it easier to see what's happening first before I attempt to calibrate my printer I need to set the temperature we're gonna set it to 206 it's going to set an M 104 206 command I could have also done that from the front of the printer now I could click on act here and I can see the second by second temperature reports I'm going to wait for my 3d printer to come up to temperature okay it's at the correct temperature now and now I'm going to send first to command to put the 3d printer into absolute mode then I'm going to set my current extruder position e zero to zero we can see here that now XYZ and E are at zero and now I'm going to send a command to extrude 100 millimeters of filament at a speed of 100 millimeters per minute the F commands are in minutes not seconds and we're going to see this move and then we're going to see how close to this mark our printer comes so I'm gonna send that now and we can see now that we are extruding filament it's coming out of our nozzle here it's a little stuck there we can see it coming out we have a nice clean extrusion coming out we can see that here now this length is not going to be a hundred millimeters because we're extruding a hundred millimeters of the original filament the actual length will depend on the nozzle size and the flow rate in a variety of other factors that's not important to us right now what's important is how much filament is pulled in when we ask it to pull in a hundred millimeters does it pull in a hundred millimeters since our F command was F 100 it's going to go for a full minute okay it stopped we can measure what's left and once again it's 20 millimeters are left because our printer is properly configured now we need to send a command to set the correct steps based on our measurement just to be safe because we don't want to mess this up let's find the line with the m92 we're going to copy that we're going to paste that in here and the e95 is the value we want to use because our printer was calibrated properly it is this value right here that you would change if you can't clear new steps value we're going to clear our log we're gonna send that command if we turn on ax we'll see we received an okay now if we were to print it would use some new steps per millimeter but if we turn our printer off it would go away so we need to issue an M 500 command which will save the current parameters in the EEPROM and it says settings stored and now we can turn off your printer and turn it on and it's recalibrated okay folks the Google slide deck that I used to explain this will be attached in the notes that has all of the steps you should take once again use a you bring your printer up to temperature you send a command to extrude 100 millimeters a filament you measure to see what was actually extruded used the little bit of algebra and the slide deck to calculate the new steps value you use an M 92 command to save that put that value back into the firmware and then I'm 500 to save it to a EEPROM ok I hope you learned something today this was beneficial if it was give me a thumbs up subscribe click on that bell recommend this to your friends have a great day and let's continue to learn things together [Music] [Applause]", "6PL_rSPZ3M8": "hey what's going on guys Danna from on BOTS here and in today's video I'm gonna show you guys how to calibrate in layman's terms I'm gonna be showing you guys how to make sure that your 3d printer is spitting out the correct amount of plastic that it thinks it's spitting out so why might you want to do this well if your 3d printers East Epps are not set correctly then your prints are either going to be over extruding where they will have all sorts of sag and they won't look very good or there will be under extruding where it's not laying down enough material and then they will be really brittle and fall apart and also not look good either this process is just gonna make sure that say if your 3d printer thinks that it's extruding a hundred millimeters of filament that it actually is extruding a hundred millimeters of filament now this is something that you would want to do if you are building a 3d printer from scratch if you upgraded a 3d printers extruder so that way it's got a different gear ratio now or if you're just having serious issues with under extrusion or over extrusion on your 3d printer there are things that you can adjust in the slicer such as flow rate but the first thing you should be doing before getting into any of that is making sure that your each steps are set appropriately so in this video we are going to be taking a look at how to do it I'll take you guys along with my process of me doing that on my own machine here and in the end of this you will be able to make sure that your 3d printer is actually extruding the correct amount of filament so without further ado let's get into the video so [Music] for starters let's go over some of the few things that you will need to actually measure the e steps and calibrate them on your 3d printer for starters we're gonna need some filament I highly recommend a just light colored PLA material that is easy to mark with a permanent marker we're also going to need some digital calipers this will be used to measure the extrusion length that we are wanting to have the printer extrude a permanent marker to actually physically make those markings on the filament and a USB cable to interface the printer with our computers on the software side I recommend using pronterface links will be in the description down below this is an old piece of software that works incredibly well and is simp to use for this kind of stuff once done with that go ahead and turn on your 3d printer navigate to the temperature and set the temperature of your hot end to whatever you'd use for PLA in this instance I'm just using 210 wait for that to heat up or if you're editing use editing magic to quickly get to temperature once that temperature load up that filament into your hot end just push it all the way through you want to make sure that it is actually extruding out of the nozzle once done we're gonna set our calipers to a hundred and twenty millimeters so that way we can mark 120 millimeters on our filament we're gonna have it extrude a hundred millimeters but the reason why we're marking it at 120 is if for some reason your extruder is over extruding and you only marked it at 100 millimeters well when it extrudes 100 millimeters it will actually go beyond that you won't be able to see your marking so by marking it 120 millimeters we're giving ourself a little bit of slack in case it is over extruding or under extruding the easiest way I found is to take the bottom portion of the digital calipers and have that place up against where the filament would enter into your extruder or into your guide tube and then just take a sharpie and Mark it at the 120 millimeter point which should be at the bottom of your digital calipers make sure you mark it well enough to where you'll actually be able to see it this is again why I recommend using a light colored filament now jumping over to pronterface we're going to connect to our 3d printer make sure that the extruder or the hot end I mean is still at temperature I go ahead and hit 210 again just to be certain that it's not cooling down then we're gonna send over a m83 command in the bottom right if you just type it in and hit Enter or send it'll send that over once we've done that we're gonna go ahead and tell the 3d printer to extrude 100 millimeters of filament I will go ahead and paste on the screen here the command of what you want to send over to have it do that then sit tight and let your printer extrude the hundred millimeters of filament once this is done grab your digital calipers and just like we measured before at 120 we're gonna measure to see how much is left if all is correct with your extruder it should be at 20 millimeters since we told it to extrude a hundred and we had to marked at 120 in mine there's 50 millimeters left over which clearly shows that mine is severely under extruding which is what I expected because it just changed my extruder next we're going to go ahead and send an M 503 command which is going to display a bunch of data on our 3d printer looking through this you'll find a row that says m92 it'll have your XYZ and or East Epps my e steps for my extruder are set to 93 so you're gonna want ahead and write that down once you're done with that you're going to need to open up a calculator and do a little bit of bath so we can get a little information that we'll need here the first thing we're gonna do is take a hundred and twenty and subtract the length that was left when you measured so in my situation I had fifty point eight left from the extruder to the part that I had marked and so when you subtract 120 by that value it'll give you the actual length that was extruded make sure that you write down that actual length next you're going to need to take what your current Estep value is which mine was 93 and you're going to multiply that by 100 which will give you the actual steps taken so in my situation that's ninety three hundred now take that value which in my case is ninety three hundred and divide it by the actual length extruded the value that that gives you is the new accurate steps per millimeter value which is what you're going to want to change your East steps value to to do that we're gonna send over this command which I'll post again as well it's just m92 and then you're gonna add e and then whatever that value is in my instance it's one thirty four point four so I am setting my printers east steps the extruder to that value then send over the m500 command this is just gonna go ahead and save that value once done with that I went ahead and rebooted my printer sent over the m 503 command and just double check to make sure it actually updated and as you can see here it's now showing a one thirty four point four and I know that I am good to go once again we're sending over that m83 command and we're going to extrude another hundred millimeters of filament in this case once now that we've upgraded or updated the e steps it should be at the value that we're expecting and there should be right around 20 millimeters left over once it's done extruding take your digital calipers again and again the goal there should be if we marked it at 120 millimeters and we told it to extrude a hundred millimeters there should be 20 millimeters between the marking and where the filament would enter into your printer in this instance we are at tea point to which to me is perfect if you're still far off you're just basically going to repeat this process until you get closer to a number that makes sense and it's reasonable but yeah that is it you are ready to go and I am excited to be able to print with this new extruder on Mike reality under three I hope you guys really enjoyed this video and that it was helpful it took a lot longer than I would like to admit but I think the video turned out really good and hopefully will

under\n$200 this has a dual gear drive to push the filament this has a single gear\ndrive with an idler but did you know you can buy that dual gear drive and put it\non Ender three well we're gonna try that I'll show you how to install it how to\ncalibrate it and is it even worth it on today's Filament Friday Filament Friday is\nbrought to you by these patreon supporters here's a standard extruder on\nEnder three it's got a gear and an idler wheel and the whole frame is made out of\nplastic here's the dual drive a drive on both sides and an all metal frame and\nactually a stronger spring this is the one I'm going to use I bought this off\nof amazon.com I'll put a link to it in the description below along with links\nto other locations where you can get the same extruder here's the close-up of how\nit works it grips on both sides of the filament and they're geared so they turn\ntogether so the first thing I want to do is set a baseline so I need to measure\n100 millimeters of filament so between these two marks is 100 millimeters next\nI'm actually going to take off the PTFE tube because I want to try this with no\nresistance no hot end no PTFE tube nothing so I'm just going to push\nfilament through you can see the little marks and I'm gonna line that up so\nfirst mark is right at the beginning and then 100 millimeters later is the second\nmark in order for the machine to move any filament it has to be preheated even\nif we're not connected to the hot end so I heated it up to 185 degrees C and then\nI go into the prepare move axis menu down to extruder select 10 millimeters\ncrank it up to a hundred and then let this thing run and now it's been pushing\nthe filament through you can see the dot on the left and the hundred millimeter\non the right and it stops right at the hundred millimeter mark and that's\nbecause I've got my machine tuned if you go into control motion and steps per\nmillimeter you'll see the e steps this is how many steps\nthe stepper motor has to go to move 100 millimeters some of the early machines\ndidn't have this but all the latest ender threes and if you've upgraded to\nthe silent board you have this on your menu now I'm going to screw the PTFE\ntube back into the extruder and then we're going to push some filament\nthrough and through the hot end I'll measure out another hundred millimeters\nbetween the two marks and I'm actually gonna push this filament until that\nfirst mark is lined up so you can see the filaments losing out as I do it now\nI'll go to the prepare move access extruder ten millimeters crank up one\nhundred millimeters again and then we're gonna let this thing around and see how\nclose we get so here it is moving and if I let this run out it'll stop at some\npoint now we're at 185 degrees C here and you can see it stops way short like\n24 millimeters short of where I would expect it to be so let's crank this up\nto a higher temperature I'm gonna go to 205 which is typically what I print it\nwith this filament see how close we get so let's try it again at 205 now 100\nmillimeters push it into starting point let it run and it stops pretty close but\nnot perfect right there so we're looking at about six millimeters so clearly\nthere's some slippage going on as soon as we had the PTFE tube and hot in it's\nslipping on the gear but at 185 degrees C it's like 24 millimeters of slippage\nand 205 it's only six millimeters of slippage so let's try the other extruder\nso let me show you how to remove this the first step is to take the filament\nout and I'm gonna take the screw off of the bracket or the arm and in the spring\nand then I'm gonna disconnect the PTFE tubing and pull the wiring harness off\nthe clip and then there's a screw at the front here take that off and then\nthere's one at the back corner take that off you have to disconnect the motor\nfrom the wiring harness it just pulls out and there's one last screw that\nholds the motor and now you can remove the motor and the last piece of the\nextruder here's the kit that I bought I'll put a link to this in the\ndescription below it is a kit so you have to assemble it so let me show you\nhow this works eventually we'll get to this where the\ntwo pieces drive the filament on both sides and the motor turns the idler gear\nthe first thing I did was put the screw into the bracket this will actually be\nthe adjustment screw for the tension on the spring and then there's a screw that\ngoes into the arm and this will actually hold the spring in place there's an\ninsert that goes into the arm that goes in here and it is a tall screw that goes\ninto that insert and then this arm will mount to the bracket like this and screw\ninto the motor and then the spring will go between the arm and the bracket now\nwe got to remove the gear from the motor there's two set screws to take it off\nthe new one has one set screw so you want to make sure that set screw goes on\nthe flat side of the motor shaft now we're ready to assemble so you bring the\nbase of the new extruder to the machine and tighten the first screw to the motor\nthen tighten the second one on the right front don't tighten that one all the way\nand in the background don't quite tighten that one all the way it gives\nyou a little wiggle room next we want to adjust the gear so it lines up with the\nfilament then we can bring in the arm put that in position and tighten it in\nplace now go back and tighten those other two screws and back out the\ntension screw this insert goes into the spring and then the spring pops over the\nscrew on the arm and pops into the tension location then tighten the\ntension screw until you start to see the spring turn\nreadjust the arm screw so it's tight but still loose enough to move back and\nforth and we're ready to test I marked two spots hundred millimeters apart I\nset to extrude it to extrude 100 millimeters so it starts extruding and\nlet's see how close it gets not too close it's way off thirty millimeters so\nwe need to adjust the Estep so we take the hundred millimeters we expect - the\n30 millimeters we measure divide that into the hundred millimeters and n times\nthe east steps and we get one thirty five point five seven so we need to\nchange re steps to 135 point five seven so how do you do that you go into the\ncontrol menu and then you go into motion and then you go into steps per\nmillimeter at the bottom and then you go all the way to the bottom of that you\nhad the e steps per millimeter one thirty five point five six say I've\nalready changed it you want to go to the control menu store\nsettings click on it and that'll save that setting come back to another\nhundred millimeters I started the extruder to extrude 100 millimeters and\nhere's where we're at now after the change to the east steps you can see our\nalmost perfect so we're gonna go with it now we need to change the coupling on\nthis guy to the big coupling it came with it and put the PTFE tube in place\nso now we can test it with actual filament\nthere's even a locking clip for it so I marked 100 millimeters of filament I set\nit 285 degrees C it's extruding and this is where it stopped so if I measure this\nor six millimeters short of perfect much better than the other extruder 185 let's\nsee what it does at 205 so a 205 degrees C the filament has gone through we're\njust waiting for it to stop this is the second mark and then we can measure and\nthere it stopped and if I measure six millimeters same thing we got at 185\ndegrees C so now let's do a comparison 185 degrees C you can see the stock\nextruder slips a lot more than this double gear drive but what about at 205\nat twelve five percent really the same they're both stopping six millimeters\nshort that seemed to be a standard slippage six millimeters short of what I\nexpected but what I liked is it's the same on the metal one\nwhether it's 205 or 185 so now we can recalculate if I use the six millimeters\nI can get a new estep of 144 point two and with those new e steps that should\ncompensate for the slippage so here's a test that's the second mark and sure\nenough it stops right where I want it so essentially zero error as far as print\nquality I'm not seeing a major difference between the dual extruder and\nmy original extruder when I compare prints but I'm happy with the results\nand now I've got consistent flow that I can trust so maybe I can make some more\nimprovements within the slicer settings but right now the printing about equal\nso isn't worth it well based on what I've seen getting that consistent push\nno matter the temperature is a definite advantage it gives you consistent flow\nand therefore smoother prints so I think it's worth putting on under three spend\nyou consider it's on a $600 printer that you can put on the sub $200 printer for\nnot a lot of added cost and it's metal so it's going to last longer than the\nplastic one that comes on the under three now having said that I did notice\nsomewhere underneath the gear so heavy grease under there is highly recommended\nbut overall I think it's an improvement if you like what I'm doing here maybe\ncheck out some of the videos that are popping up if you want to help support\nthe channel patreon is one way or by thru the affiliate links in the description\nbelow and if

and today we're gonna talk about under extrusion now this is something we all experience at some point it's not just when you go to Taco Bell too often anytime you're printing with an FD M 3d printer you run the risk of having under extrusion the thing that's really frustrating about this is if you ask 10 people what's going on you're gonna get 10 different answers and the reason is there's more than 10 causes for it so what we're gonna do is walk through each one step by step so hopefully you can better understand what's going on and troubleshoot any issues with your 3d printer let's start with how to identify under extrusion what does it look like well in most cases under extrusion is going to look like this it's gonna have missing plastic in the sides of the model you're gonna have gaps in layers those are the areas where the plastic did not extrude properly for one of a host of reasons and you just have a gap now under extrusion can also present itself as a brittle model maybe there's no gaps at all in it but due to the under extrusion the individual layers did not properly bond together and you can literally pry the model apart with your bare hands layer by layer both of those are under extrusion the most common issue or common cause of under extrusion on a 3d printer is temperature you're printing too fast for the temperature you're melting your plastic at and it can't fully melt in time to extrude so it has under extrusion how do you fix it well two things one you can up your temperature 2 you can decrease your print speed or you can have a combination of the two now this is critical when you up your temperature only do it in 5 degree increments you can very rapidly go from under extrusion caused by too low of a temperature to under extrusion caused by too high of a temperature what's the difference well at too low of a temperature the met plastic is not fully melting so it can't go through the nozzle therefore nothing comes out and you have under extrusion when you have too high of a temperature you get heat creep going up the length of the hot end into the areas that should be cool the plastic where it should be solid starts to deform it's reached its glass transition temperature and it bulges that causes drag and it can't be pushed cleanly through the system resulting in less filament coming out and under extrusion so again if you're adjusting your temperature go in five degree increments it'll make it much easier to identify that sweet spot a lot of times you have a roll that printed great for a while and then it starts having under extrusion what's going on is that roll has absorbed moisture that's affecting the temperature at which it will effectively melt so it's very common to have to raise the temperature five or ten degrees by the end of the roll if you've had it for a while than what you started out printing ass so just be aware of that watch out for your temperatures and speeds now almost as common is simply the film snagging up before it feeds into the system if you've taken your filament on and off of your printer a few times and you've let that end flap up into the spool it's very easy for the end to get under another wind of the filament and it snags so you always want to tape that loose end of the filament to the edge of the roll or one of the side little holes you can snake it through so it doesn't work under the other filament loops if it has you're gonna have to untangle it because it's just going to keep tangling up every few turns and causing binding and drag and under extrusion for you so that's a very common cause of under extrusion for you on these printers now on down towards the extruder if you have any kind of filament guides make sure the filament is feeding cleanly through them if they're not that could be a snag and that could be holding you up specifically on the kree ality under three the filament guide on the extruder where the little lever is that you squeeze on the spring that is made of plastic and in just a matter of weeks or even a month or two the hole in that plastic can wear from being a hole to being more of a triangle shape than that filament rubbing through it and it erodes down it will start snagging and causing under extrusion on you that so I recommend in Mike reality three build video replacing that out with an aluminum extruder I have that linked in the product description or in the video description here for this video but it's just four screws you can change it out in about five minutes and it's really worth doing you're gonna have to do it at some point with the under three because that plastic lever will not last very long so snagging is another common issue just look for places along that filament path that it could be hanging up another cause of under extrusion that people overlook very easily is the slicer sometimes you can get the wrong filament diameter listed in the slicer for slicing your models this just happened recently with kira 3.5 in cure a 3.5 the under three profile had the filament diameter set to 2.75 millimeter when in fact uses 1.75 millimetre filament this caused the slicer to think for every millimeter a filament that was being pushed into the system almost a third more filament was actually being gone through than what was which resulted in under extrusion so make sure your slicer filament settings the diameter you have set matches the diameter filament yet your printer actually uses again it's really easy to overlook this and you can get really frustrated looking for a mechanical issue when in fact it's a software issue next bed leveling if you try to print your first layer too thin in other words your nozzle is too close to the bed the amount of filament that's supposed to be coming out can't and it starts backing up and that creates a partial clog it will heat creep will go up the length of the filament and it will swell and that will cause drag so check your first layer check the skirt that printed around it if that skirt doesn't feel like fishing line if it feels completely flat you're too close to the bed you need to real 'evil and that will resolve your extrusion issue now filament feed gear on your extruder that gear with this teeth that grips the filament if that clogs if it gets a lot of plastic shavings in it it can no longer grip the filament for feeding through the system and that can also result in under extrusion now related to this if that's clogged it's a good bet that you have plastic shavings in your Bowden tube as well if you have a Bowden tube feed system so you can clean the filament gear first take your filament out of the system clean the filament gear with an old toothbrush if it looks like you have plastic shavings down in your Bowden tube if it's a Bowden tube system and not a direct system what you can do is simply take the Bowden tube out of your printer and use some compressed air to blow any shavings out and that should resolve it for me Bowden tube is so cheap it's only about a buck for the length necessary unlike an under three I would just put a fresh one on and be done with it but if you want to try cleaning it you can't just use compressed air and that should work now also on the extruder gear most printers have an adjustable spring tension for that feed gear if you have too loose of tension on it it's not going to grip that filament tightly enough to feed through your system what you have to do is there will be a small screw or screws that will actually tighten down or loosen on that spring to add more spring tension on those feed wheels check that make sure it's gripping tight enough and if not you can adjust it now unfortunately if you've got like an ender 3 or a CR 10 you can't do that it's not adjustable the spring is always at full force if that still isn't enough what you can do is shim it you can put small washers or shim stock in here between the extruder and the spring which will compress that spring more and put more tension on the feed wheels it's a really easy fix just get some washers that will fit over that screw take it out but the washers on and put your screw back in and that's all you need to do just get a few thin washers and put them on one at a time until you get good good reliable extrusion you don't want to put too much tension on it because that's going to make the feeder gear dig too tightly into the filament and that's gonna grind it down especially on retractions which we're going to talk about next now if you have under extrusion in an area of your model that is highly detailed and has a whole bunch of retractions it could be you have your retraction number set hi now remember your feeder gear when it were tracks it's pulling that filament back and forth over that gear every time that gear contacts that filament it's grinding it down some it's digging into it so the longer the length of retraction the more times that feeder gear is going to pass over any given point of that filament during the retraction process if you have a whole bunch of retractions in a one area of your model that can grind that filament down to the point it can no longer reliably grab it so how do you fix this well there's two issues here in both cases what you're wanting to do is reduce grinding on the filament the first way you do that is adjust your tension on the feed gear you want it tight enough that it can properly grip the filament to feed it reliably but not too tight to where it's actually grinding it down and creating a gap so you've got to find that sweet spot if it's too tight it's gonna grind that filament down and cause under extrusion if it's too loose it's not gonna grip the filament tight enough to feed it and you're gonna have under extrusion again so you've got to find that sweet spot where it's just barely making an indentation in the side of the plastic but not too deep of one and this is something you're just gonna have to develop a feel for it basically what you want to be able to do is on sections of filament that have already run through the extruder run your finger along them you should be able to feel the dig in the side of the filament from the feeder gear but it shouldn't be too deep and again it's something you're just gonna have to play around with now the other thing you can do to help alleviate this is reduce the length of your retractions having a retraction that's like eight or nine millimeters is way too much for me on an Ender three my retractions are usually set around five millimeters six millimeters wouldn't be bad but anything beyond that is going to start because of the usual amounts where you you start having in detail models lots of retractions in a certain area you're gonna be going over the same length of filament again and again and again and wearing it down so try to get that retraction length down as low as you can without inducing stringing but you really don't want it much over six now this next one is more particular to the Cree ality series of printers the Enders and the CR tens on these printers the Bowden tube goes all the way through the heat sink through the heat block or through the heat break into the heat block that Bowden tube then meets up with the back of your nozzle now they should fit tight so that your filament goes straight from the Bowden tube into the nozzle what happens with these printers is Cree ality uses a very poor quality connector that locks the Bowden tube into the hot end is this a little screw piece there are about 50 Cent's online I've got them linked in this video to put a better one on in my under three build video I actually recommend that so the first thing you do is replace those pneumatic couplers for the Bowden tube the ones that come from Cree allottee are crap they will fail sometimes in a matter of just a few weeks they're gonna fail what does that mean well when that clip fails when the teeth start breaking off your Bowden tube is going to separate when you have a retraction it's gonna get yanked up with that filament away from the nozzle that creates a gap that gap is going to get filled with softened molten plastic when that happens that plastic that fills that void is going to start causing drag on the filament that's feeding through the system and that causes your under extrusion it will also create issues with your retractions making them less defective too and result in more stringing so as I mentioned earlier if you're singing Inc seeing increased stringing on your model and under extrusion the problem is your Bowden tube has separated from your nozzle and what you're gonna have to do is take the felt heat it up take the filament out take the Bowden tube out take your nozzle off clean all that out and then reassemble it I have a nozzle changing video on this channel that I'll walk you through the whole process it's not hard but we've already covered it to there so I'm not going to go through the process here but that's your problem you have to clean out that molten plastic a really easy way to do that is when you get it all apart while it's heated you can just stick a toothpick down there it won't harm the aluminum on the inside but it's enough to pick off the plastic and get it cleaned out to reassemble okay this is for under three owners and some of the other core ality printers that use the same high-end the factory that assembled these ha ends made a mistake they left the two alignment screws shown here on the left and right on each side of the heat break in when they assembled the unit these screws were meant to be taken out when the hot end was done and the printer was assembled they weren't and they even applied the insulation over the heater block over the screw heads you can't back them out without having to remove that insulation so what do you do should you remove these well I have several under threes and I have not removed mine because I've not seen any issues with under extrusion if I ever do I will take them out at that point but for me it's a case of if it's not broken don't fix it now if you are having issues with under extrusion it could be from this what's happening is heat from the heat block is transferring up those screws into the heat sink that's the part in red with the individual fins for cooling when that area heats up it's meant to be room temperature when it heats up it can cause the filament inside of it to reach its glass transition point and soften slightly as you do retractions it's going to stretch that filament out when it pushes it back in it's going to deform it that is gonna cause additional drag which can cause under extrusion it can also create a clog so as I said I've not seen any evidence of this with mine I've left mine in if you want to take yours out go look at my video on this channel for replacing nozzles I take you through the whole process of how to remove the insulation from the heater block at that point you can remove the two screws and then you're going to have to install replacement insulation what I show you in that video is how to put on a silicon sock over the heater block to replace the factory insulation that you have to remove to get these screws out so I'm not gonna cover all that here that's all been covered already in the nozzle change video you can go check that out if you want to take these screws out now one other issue with Bowden tubes is when you get down to the end of the role of filament and the filament is more tightly curled that can cause problems if you have a Bowden tube feed system because that tighter curl is trying to run through a straight tube and that's causing drag that's gonna cause potentially some under extrusion so if you've been printing fine and all of a sudden you're at the end of your roll and you're seeing the under extrusion try on taking the filament off the Roll straightening it out a little bit and seeing if that resolves it odds are it will now the final cause or an I shouldn't say final there's others but the final of the more common causes of under extrusion is a partial or fully clogged nozzle or hot end how do you tell well what you want to do is pre-heat your hot end up do it 2 to 10 to 15 release the tension on your extruder in the case of the under 3 you just squeeze this arm in so you can manually push the filament through the system if it comes out cleanly through the nozzle straight line coming straight down no problem you don't have a clog if it comes out is a thinner line that wants to curl up just on the end of the nozzle then you have a partial clog and I'm going to tell you how to fix that what we're gonna do is called a cold Pole and I hate this term because it's misleading every time I tell people they need to do a cold Pole they think they're doing a room-temperature Pole and try yanking the filament out that's not it this pole is actually done while heated just not heated enough to melt the filament so what you're gonna do if you have a Bowden tube feed system you want to remove the plastic from the system heat the nozzle up remove your plastic filament then remove the Bowden tube you do not want to feed the plastic through the Bowden tube for the cold pull if you don't have a Bowden tube system all you got to do is release the tension on your extruder feeder and manually insert a length of filament a piece of filament about 1 foot long you're gonna manually insert it down while the hot end is heated to 210 or 215 into the nozzle you're gonna force it in there until you see it come out of that nozzle or and if you can't get it to come out as far as you can then on your LCD screen on your temperature control you're gonna dial that down to 90 degrees what's that gonna do well as the temperature drops the plastic in that nozzle is going to solidify but it's not going to be totally hard it if it's kept at 90 degrees it is above its glass transition point it's still gonna be slightly soft when that temperature hits 90 you're gonna give a sharp yank up on that filament and then look at the end if it's clean you didn't have a partial clog if it has little bits of dirt in it or darker debris what that is this charred filament that started blocking it so what I want you to do is if you had that on the end that charred filament that darkened areas cut yourself another section of filament reheat the system up to to 10 to 15 feed that filament in put it down to 90 and do another cold pull keep doing that until your filament comes out clean and then you know the nozzle is clean reassemble your Bowden tube if you had it and you're done if you need to change the nozzle if it's if it's too bad clogged and you can't do a cold pole to fix it then you need to look at my nozzle changing video and it walk you through step-by-step how to put a fresh nozzle on your hot end okay so that's it that is pretty much all of the causes of or the more common causes I should say of under extrusion on an FTM 3d printer now please click that subscribe button on your

tutorial next week [Music]", "-k3qgRx4jgk": "oh yes can I get drunk that's it [Music] what is up guys welcome to the vlog today's video is a very special video for me because today marks a very important day and the Evo turbo build process before we get into all that I'm almost a 300,000 subscribers I'm just a lot of you that are watching this video are not subscribed yet what are you doing if you're not subscribed there's so many awesome things coming up for this channel the Evo to rebuild is probably around 80% done we've got so many mods coming in for the tight bar possibly getting a new shop space it's lots of awesome things coming up so do me a huge favor take two seconds out your day and hit that subscribe button down there and have some fun but either way the Evo turbo manifold is now done it's on the car and the turbo is mounted as well I wanted them to wait for me to get here before they actually did it didn't have enough time because obviously they want to get this thing and done as soon as possible they had to go ahead and mount it so you get measurements for the radiator as well as the intercooler and then and start getting everything for oil lines and fuel lines and all of that stuff but right behind me right now is the Evo and I'm about to show you guys how the turbo will be mounted the wastegate the manifold it's freaking awesome check it out here is so the turbo sticks right up front put that bolt X bumper you'll be able to see the turbo the wastegate the intercooler should be massive so the turbo will be clocked just a little bit so we'll probably have about half of this intercooler fitting from here down here all the way across so that is one of the craziest things I've ever seen like Wow even from this far away the turbo just looks like being able to see that from the grille of the bumper is just gonna be insanely especially on the street at shows and stuff like better it's better than I could have ever imagined I mean the polished look and everything is just so mint the welds Rick and wastegate down there so obviously there will be some changes in the positioning of the wastegate and the turbo and stuff just to be able to route the exhaust and the wastegate dump out the hood and then the turbo needs to connect to the intercooler directly so the coolest thing about this is no one else has this which is like my favorite part oh so I don't know what happened but I really strained my back at the gym and it is not good so now that you guys saw the manifold the turbo setup and the wastegate what's left to do so not too much but the very important stuff so we still have sought to run the exhaust stomp to stop the run the wastegate dump when you need the radiator to come in size up that intercooler cut it mount it oil lines fuel lines and then reroute the battery to the trunk so we have all the space we're getting close to the hardest part was deciding on and designed for the manifolds dictating the manifold made polished and welded the hard part is done we have mounted the turbo that is like the biggest issue with coming up with a custom turbo is being able to fit everything make the manifold and make it work which we have executed and ty stood and incredible job so you can just buy us over the shelf everything part by part is picked by me and enticed to make this thing come together as one so this isn't something that you just buy off-the-shelf may send you a generic man no we designed this I helped design it they measured it they built it specifically just for this one car no one else will ever have this manifold which is something that means a lot to me so now that I said all that my Tomei exhaust and the tests pipe before this evil eight will be for sale it'll fit an Evo eight or nine so if you're interested and have pretty much brand new Tomei exhaust and testified email me put my email on the screen right now and it's in the San Diego area I wouldn't like to ship it so if you're in San Diego LA hit me up and let's get this thing sold other than that I mean that's pretty much oh I do have a question I want to get this painted what do you guys think the engine cover should be painted should I get it reg a different red or silver black I need help deciding that and that needs to get done pretty quickly so leaving the comments down below what color you think I should paint the engine cover using overview this needs to be painted also think I'm gonna switch this out for black because I'm afraid that since its position Rennicks to the turbo and the manifold it's gonna get really really hot and then the red will start fading and turns like pink or white or whatever I don't want that so I'm gonna do black I think but either way it's gonna look insane since the bumpers right here I want to go ahead and mount the bumper up just so you guys can see what it looks like with the bumper on there and the turbo and everything I think that'll look really cool [Music] okay so generically this is bumper obviously is not fully on but this is how the trouble will look up but oh my god oh my god that is wild so imagine the turbo with the intercooler that goes all the way down like I cannot believe that this is my car yes oh we bro slowly but surely this thing is coming together and it's going to be insane [Music] alright guys that's the update on the evil that I have for you guys unfortunately like I said they couldn't wait for me to put this on I wish they could have they do a lot of the work primarily at night time Jonathan I think comes in around 5:00 every other week so a lot of the work it's done when he comes on his late night so I unfortunately can't be here at that time she because number one shops about two hours away from me then you have to add in traffic and the number two I have a lot of business stuff that I'm working on right now because the next legends drop is June 10th which is going to be amazing to blow all of your minds some of my best designs yet so I'm very excited on that but alright before traffic hits let's head home and do this Q&A goodbye this is amazing nice work okay guys we finally just made it home it's been a long day but when I got home I actually had this package waiting for me at my door for any large package and I think I know exactly what this is we're gonna do a little unboxing before we get into the whole Evo Q&A so enjoy unboxing [Music] okay after a ton of struggle getting this out of the packaging we finally know exactly what was in that package so we have three different support bars you have your front bumper support bar to go in the engine bay if your lower front support bar and then you also have the middle lower support bar so I'm not that 50s out of the packaging just because I don't want to you know like this has hardware and I don't want to stuff these out before I actually put them on the car but hopefully when I get some time to put these on the car it'll make a huge difference in the handling and keeping this car super stiff while driving you know on the track or even on the street and stuff so hopefully there's huge difference huge thank you to ultra racing for sending this out I'm super pumped to actually put this on the car all this being said let's go ahead throw this in the tie bar let's do the Evo Q&A [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] alright guys so now we've got everything done I posted up on Instagram and Twitter that I was doing a QA on the Evo so let's read some of these off of Instagram real fast and then we move to Twitter I'm not gonna do too many but let's just see so timeline on the Evo is returned so once the inner cooler and the radiator come in which will be within the week everything will start moving fast so I plan to have this evo done by week fast San Jose which is July 1st weekend I'm not a hundred percent on that you'll have to double check on me but the Evo's return will be a tweak fest to San Jose so be a lookout for that how much horsepower I'm not gonna be pushing on the Evo the Evo is gonna stay around 450 horsepower you know I remember it's on a stock block nothing is built on the motor besides you know the whole turbo build so I want to push it too much the turbo is actually rated to hold 700 horsepower but of course I'm not gonna push that much keep it around 450 it has a built differential as well as a built transfer case so I want to worry too much about any of that but if the motor decides to go we'll build the motor and then push as much power as we possibly can after another build so for now 400 to 450 horsepower why not turn the Evo into a track car and also show car that's exactly what I'll be doing I feel like the Evo is gonna be so good in so many aspects that why just beat it and use it as a track car when I can have it for both so I plan to have a set of show wheels and a set of track wheels and kind of adjust suspension accordingly to whatever event that I'm attending so you guys will see the Evo a lot of shows as well as some track videos of Evo but you gotta remember I also have a type R as well and Type R is a beast on the track so there'll be a lot of Type R and Evo track days which would be cool what was my inspiration for the Evo build I told you guys this when I first got the car but this will be my last question the inspiration for the Evo build was actually I first fell in love with Evo when Han gave Shawn the Evo and fast here's Tokyo Drift I know they did that whole like really cool scene where they did the walk-around of the car and then him drifting it and it's such a fun car it was such a cool car that movie and really I had no idea what an Evo was when I was that young but that really opened my eyes to that car and I love the body saw how small it was it was very compact and very raw inspiration was fast furious whenever it are whenever Han gave Shawn the car that was like probably the coolest moment for me seeing Evo either way that's envy it for this video I've been with me only a couple more weeks until that thing starts and it's running and it's going to be it's going to be one of the craziest Evo's out there I promise you that so very excited also a lot of the tie bar parts should be rolling in now so get pumped for that thank you guys for watching be sure hit that subscribe button if you haven't already we are so close to 300 K and there's so many awesome things that's coming up for this channel all right guys I'll see you in the next vlog Pisa", "fxmGExRFjKo": "we're talking I love this car [Music] [Music] what is up guys good morning and welcome to the vlog to start today off we are dropping off most of the banners that were ordered I have three left to go just because people gave me the wrong address so I'm still processing those orders but I'm about 40 banners gonna ship out and that's it April 15th is the next drop if you're wondering all of t-shirts banner stickers all that stuff on the next drop but today we're actually gonna be installing a tome a titanium test pipe instead of that custom one that we made a subscriber actually sent that out to me I can't remember his name but whenever I can we hit that box give a huge shout out to him either way let's go bring these and drop these off [Music] [Music] that authentic alright we've got the test pipe but now we just have to wait for Sean and get off work so we can go in his garage and start putting that thing on now I'm pretty positive the car is gonna sound the exact same but I just like since I have the tomah exhaust I now have the tow mate test bike it's all titanium and it all matches maybe just a little bit different I don't I don't know if titanium sounds different than like steel or whatever I don't know but see you guys when we get to Sean's amps you catch me off guard with the other side all right John this is what we got going today mess a nice pipe yeah nice titanium pipe I want to give a huge shout out to Tyler Tyler plays a subscriber who sent me this thank you so much dude I really appreciate it he had this laying around that he wasn't using anymore so he saw that I got the Tomei exhaust and he wanted me to have his home a test I bet he wasn't using anymore so the boxes sink check out a little bit and actually he did use it before but it's in very good condition there's no dents or scratches on it at all which is awesome and he wiped it down before he actually used it so there's also no fingerprints which was pretty gnarly and it's just missing a nut so we have all the Tomei bolts just missing one nut which will be fine because we have something running using it's probably not gonna make too much of a difference because we already have a test pipe on the car but this is titanium like I said earlier and I wanted to touch any test pipe to match the exhaust instead of the stainless steel test plate to a titanium exhaust so we'll see well do all before startup and after startup and then me and Sean will go drive around just to see if it makes a difference what do you think I don't think so but it's good to have matching let's go ahead and install it [Music] it's decided before and this is my vlog dude alright just before I forget let's do a start-up with the current aspect that we have on which is now just like a custom one that me Mickey and Evan made from my older exhaust it's just like a stainless steel pipe that we welded and made fit to a test pipe so I'm gonna do a little startup with that and then we'll do a startup with a Tomei after they started here Sean all right all right we got a boys lift this thing up and unfortunately we don't have weed on the lift yet yeah lift this thing up super high because we don't have a lift and it's gonna be hard for us to get left ridge under the car without a lift and then figure out what bolts we need who's calling me here I'm vlogging dude figure out what the bolt size is and then we will get started let's do it all right Horace lift it up let's see if you go on the roof oh yeah well we can do this yeah we can do this good thing is I didn't have to drive very far so cars are hot and what you got going on there boom all right well as you can see here is the test bike that we made and so we spray painted it black and this is just stainless steel and then we use some gasket sealer because we did have some exhaust leaks because when we cut this pipe it wasn't exactly correct so now we want to worry about any leaks and we want to use this gooey stuff we're gonna go and take this off we these are all Seventeen's so shouldn't be too bad there you go yeah good progress here are you happy with it really all right oh no no what that was to be the Buffalo's rescue me Chester yeah totally fine man why did this fall where did this hanger go off the hanger where's the hanger there is no there's no hanger that connects the exhaust all the way up here it was any over by itself for goodness oh this just hangs unless it's connected to my Doubtfire what well alright then why is this on so tight there we go Oh gross TV seals Krusty yeah oh so crusty that's you yeah difference and pipes heroes getting the sunset see this much much better for the students nice pipe nice pipe pretty easy in Seoul so we're gonna go ahead and pull all that back in and then we're gonna start up see how it sounds actually I didn't do this last time because we were on the lift and the car was already up in the air but I'm gonna start this car with just open header I really want to see how that sound is be pretty loud [Music] like some crusty back on before we get yelled at that was a bee dude that was not fun so we got all four in but surprisingly this Tony type didn't wind up perfectly we twisted it like every different way you could and the holes just wouldn't line up every hole was just a little bit off so we did have to use some force and twist the crap out of this thing to make the bolts go in there but we got a member and go ahead and tighten these down secure them and then this is gonna be good and ready to start up Sean listen yep okay starting [Music] honestly I think it does sound a little bit different I think it does I might just be going crazy I think it sounds like cleaner I don't know it definitely said it sounds different to me yeah so you're not least I just put my hand around it to make sure to feel Bernie exhaust scaping from the gasket and there's nothing so we're good boy sick that's good to hear and we're gonna go ahead drop this car and then take a little Drive [Music] I have to watch the video but like in my head I think it sounds different like the tone of it is a little bit different kind of a cleaner sound yes Rasputin yeah less raspy that's a good that's a good word for it I don't know well probably able to tell better when we go back and edit the video but in my mind I think it sounds different we're gonna clean up in here and go for a little Drive I honestly think it's like it sounds different maybe a little hotter the flow louder I think so will seem to hit out higher rpms that's so crazy got a copy of car that caught me super off-guard you what was that that was fast I don't know I can't I'm gonna leave it up to you guys what do you think do you think that it's that the test pipe made any difference at all or my just like going crazy I don't know I honestly think it did I I don't know we're gonna head back to Shawn's house [Music] [Music] Shawn's got his car back in the garage we're about to take a little break and go to the gym we got back today so do some back once we're done with that me and Shawna actually go for our night cruise and we are going to maybe shoot me and Shawn I actually don't have pictures of NSX and UVO together yet can you believe that yeah I know well she finally finished so if I know so really get some pictures done and I'll take you guys along for that [Music] I brother hi guys as intended for today's video hope you guys enjoyed that the Tomei test pipe is freakin awesome so I'll see you in the next vlog peace out", "0b27XgAGe-Y": "good afternoon everybody and welcome to hammer down motorsports today we have a fresh new box with something special in it for the Camaro so we are headed over to Westies shop we have another thing that's waiting for us there as well so hopefully we can get both of these things done today so we're kind of in a rush so we don't have time for the normal intro but we're gonna start the vlog from the car and do a cold start right here thank you whoever invented the backup camera I know where I'd be without alright on that note let's talk a little bit about exhaust now on this car if you don't already it has the American Racing Headers one in seven eighths headers with the long tube setup and into the quad tip exhaust system that they have for the six gen Camaro now this system will replace an NP P system and in my case replaced the non NP P with a single tip on either side and I swapped it all over to now look like it had an AP and originally because I ended up having to replace the lower diffuser as well but now that we've got that all done the car sounded great compared to what I had before it was so much louder I just loved it didn't drone on the highway or anything like that obviously we are driving and I can speak to you guys just fine it's not a real obnoxious noisy kind of thing I went for cats on this car because of the state inspection and all that kind of good stuff and I was like alright I'm gonna get a catalytic converters because I didn't really want to get stung on inspection or something like that it'd be a new car I didn't want to have to take it in and have them say well it fails you have no cats and whatever and then try and get cats after the fact so for that reason I did buy the Kadett system from American Racing Headers so I've got some high flow catalytic converters on here and now that I've been driving it for a little while I've kind of gotten used to the sound and more so what I did is I went through SD because he's a dealer from American Racing Headers and he ordered me up some off-road connection pipes now these aren't exactly other kind of a more of a gray area or maybe you shouldn't be putting them on on the street kind of thing but I figure since I'm gonna have the catalytic converters already if I do have never with any kind of issues over them I do have them to just bolt right back on not a big deal so we are going to be putting the off-road connection pipes on the 2017 Camaro SS today and I'm gonna give you guys a sound clip of what it sounds like before and after and I hope it's a dramatic difference because I'm excited to make this car louder give it more flow and hopefully pick up a couple extra horsepower okay so we're at Westies shop what we're gonna be doing now we let the car cool off I'm gonna bring it into the shop then we're gonna swap the cats for the off-road connection pipes but first what we're gonna do with our trusty decibel meter I'm gonna put it by the exhaust with the ARH cats high flow cats and we're gonna see the difference in how much sound we're gonna get without the cats after we've got this all changed out so let's do our before shot right now and see what kind of decibels it makes with cats okay 113 point 5 with the AR H high flow cats so let's see what its gonna be like after we get those swapped out with the off-road connection pipes [Music] so unfortunately for me today there is a car on the hoist which is a kind of a longer-term project and it isn't exactly an easy one to take on and off so we're gonna leave that one on the hoist and do this job on the ground but at the same time I'm gonna be able to show you guys that this can be done at home as long as you have a couple of jacks and Jack's dad and aren't afraid to get your hands dirty a little bit so let's go underneath and see what kind of situation we're dealing with what kind of situation we're getting jack stands out of the start a deal well the situation where you have to remove a bunch of plastic skid covers and beautification plates and to make it happen why just to make it look pretty does it I don't think it's sexier without it I mean I guess it's not quite as aerodynamic without it you know it's not quite as smooth on the bottom so it's gonna be a reason for it it's part of the aero package must be part of the off-road z71 skid package absolutely I mean we are doing off-road connection pipe so this is kind of more the off-road package for the SS so we remove these covers from underneath and they kind of go right in this area where the jack stands are placed gives you enough meat so you just feel safe underneath here without a jack stand trying to pop off the control arm or something like that but it's gonna give us enough room to get at these catalytic converters and get rid of them [Music] [Music] okay these are our high flow cats these are our off-road connection pipes as you can see nothing but straight through these ones here have our catalysts inside which is giving us a restriction so it's time to open her up [Music] keh off-road connection pipes are installed now it's time to do a decibel meter test all right well we picked up a couple more decibels on a cold start which is not really a super cold start because this engine somewhat warm already but we're gonna take it out put it under load and that's really the true test of how loud this thing's really going to be phonies all right well it isn't a huge huge difference taking off the high flow cats and putting on the catalyst mid pipes but it definitely gives you a little bit more of like a throaty sound when you rev it but it doesn't make it like obnoxious and annoying to listen to while you driving down the highway it definitely does not have a drone or anything like that but when you're getting into it you notice that it's got a lot more of a throaty sound and it actually sounds much better in my opinion so if you're thinking about getting rid of your high flow cats and you want a little bit more extra sound and a little more flow probably pick up a little bit extra horsepower it's probably a really good idea because I am definitely happy with the fact that I did that so if you liked the video don't forget to

"[Music] don't get me as high as you do as high as you do [Music] i just want you to myself [Music] uh just want you to myself [Music] i just want you to myself", "WlSSa19_gMY": "hello and welcome to a new episode on my channel in the today's episode we will calibrate the extruder and the e steps of Mike reality and the three why and how you find out in this episode enjoy [Music] but why we have to calibrate our extruder well at the moment I don't really know if I have to calibrate my extruder but the intention at the end is that our CD printer extrude the exact amount we want to extrude for example if you want to extrude 100 millimeters at the end the printer should exactly extrude 100 millimeters and this is interesting I will show you how I will do this and all we need is a laptop our printer and a USB cable and that's it and now I will show you how this works for this we need the software pronterface i will leave a link down below way up in completely free downloaded this software and install it on your Mac or your Windows PC no problem but the first thing I will do is I will remove the screw from the extruder to see my filament this is the first step I will do and then move the filament to the point where it comes out of the hole that I have a good view on this for the men this is the first step second step will be connect your computer and printer with a USB cable very important and then turn your printer on and then we have to switch to front of face first of course we have to make a connection this is very important so you have to choose your port in my case it's the CS Cu USB serial and then I connected can connect to the printer and on the right you see the response of the printer very important is that you just run pronterface I had problems while also opening cura and that that could course that you will won't get a connection to your printer so very important and then you should be able to to move your xso and this works very good that's it first step done we have a connection and now it's time to test the extruding because to prevent a cold extrusion is important to make the temperature in the nozzle I will set them to 185 now the temperature is going up see it here and then it's very important this is interesting we want to extrude 100 millimeters and now it's extruding so this mistake atop this will take a little bit of time extrusion done now it's time to measure the lane we are close it's 98 98 millimeters so now very important we have to type in the M 503 and interesting is this row and especially the e90 sweetcorn now we need the help of our of a calculator and calculate our new setting because we know with the e93 we just get 98 millimeters of filament and for this now we have to calculate the new value so we want to have 100 millimeters of filament but we just get 98 and now we have to take this value against this value and so this is then our new value and for this are just going and copy to the whole the whole line and then writing down this number at the end nine four eight nine very important to use a dot eight nine and send what you can do also I something a little bit strange because it won't get any response from the Pinta printer type in the m500 this will save the value and then of course again the m5 or three and then we see that our new value is set there now I will push I will push the filament back and do another extrusion and see if the new value is better now and of course this should work for all of your printers because the way is the same to all of the printers and of course you can repeat these steps as often as you need until you have the best and perfect setting for your extrusion so take your time no varies you can't damage anything but this is a very important point to calibrate your ease steps okay extrusion done and this is now absolutely perfect I'm exactly at ten centimeters exactly so I got the right value and for this I'm fine and my extrusion ruda and East Epps are now calibrated perfectly okay guys that was the way of calibrating our extruder and each steps normally it should be a very very tiny new value and always should be relatively close to the amount we want to extrude but maybe this little point could give us more print quality and better print results hope you enjoyed this episode guys if you haven't subscribed I would really appreciate

calibration any experiences you may just leave a comment down below I would really appreciate that wish you a rest pleasant weekend guys take care of you think about wetness day a new episode of one week wants to reprint cool objects from cool creators my name is Alex and therefore 3d printer guides [Music]", "--eg0rwbpBA": "what's up inside is deuces jacket vaping insider today we're gonna be going over and our D T a yeah it's been a minute since we've done an rdta so let's cut down low let me show you everything about the Thunderhead creations max our DTS before we get into the video click the link down below in the top comment in order to join our Facebook group you can see I got the gunmetal one one thing I really like about Thunderhead creations I like that packaging I like the fact that they put their stuff in these little sacks and tubes it's kind of neat man it really is they do a nice job with their packaging you get a bunch of spare o-rings a chimney extender some spare deck screws you get a bunch of squonk pins of different lengths because you can extend the size of the tank which I'm gonna show you the one that I'm using later on in the video I put the extension on you get a Phillips head screwdriver that is rather nice this is your rdta this is your 13 millimeter extension glass I like the way Thunderhead creations packages their stuff man they just do a really nice job there's the extension glass right there you need to use the chimney extender in order to run this glass alright and that'll make sense in a minute when I show you the rdta here is the rdta again in this nice little metal tube another nice thing that Thunderhead creations does is see that it's on its own a deist and so that's kind of cool if you need an a/d stand you can just keep this off the tube and you can screw an a/d into that really nice gunmetal I mean look at that drip tip that drip tip is just gorgeous branding that's pretty subtle it don't bother me alright you can see we got bottom air flow we got side air flow with honeycomb alright I'm gonna take this off the stand I'm gonna break it all down for you in a second you can see the shorty glass right you can see that's the shorty glass but this thing is also squonk so some people might want to leave it in surety mode you know because especially if you're gonna run it on ask Wonka you might want that lower profile gorgeous gorgeous drip tip I mean check that out goon style drip tip all your other drip tips should fit fine in there you can see the o-ring on the inside all right definitely a snug fit but once you get some juice on there it'll loosen up a little bit top cap comes off like so okay there's the deck we're gonna go over that in a second let's go over the top cap for now you can see a semi conical design you can see these plugs right here they they do two things they plug up your juice fill port and they also lock the barrel in place so nice job on that alright let's pop this thing open let me show you what we're talking about here see there's your airflow adjustment right there you can see it steps down alright so kind of cool there it is wide open nice cuts nice machining nice knurling over here you can get a really good grip on it I like that and now you can see the conical design a little better as far as the barrel section goes there's your honeycomb airflow right there there is your bottom airflow now they work independent of each other you can either run both air flows open for a super airy vape or you can shut one down or another or you can run them in combination keep the bottom half way open the top fully open vice versa whatever way you want to mix it up you can do that look at the thickness man nice thickness on the barrel really really nice machining loving that gunmetal they did a nice job on this as far as build quality goes so here's the deck like a y-shaped deck right kind of unique right I'm gonna tell you why it's almost like a reverse drop deck right instead of dropping your coils in from the top what you're doing is you're sliding them in from the bottom your leads are going to point out here and you just give it a haircut wick it up and you're ready to go now here's the bottom airflow right here obviously the side airflow was gonna come in from the side here but right here is the bottom airflow there's the chute for the bottom airflow okay if you look inside you can see I'm going to take it apart in a second but you can see the the the squonk section I'll show that to you in a minute here are your two fill ports right here they get plugged up when you put the barrel on here are your wicking ports right here you just dip your wicks into there okay right here these are hex keys okay and you just open them up just like that all right let me show you the bottom of this thing and let's take this thing apart on the bottom you can see we got a gold-plated 510 this is a non squonk mode alright we're gonna put it in squonk mode in a second I'm gonna show you exactly how to do that we're also gonna keep it in shorty mode though alright cuz I already got one in tallboy mode in order to take this thing apart you just screw off the bottom base just like so okay and it just comes off just like that alright again really really nice machining very very impressed with the machining now you can take their flat-head screwdriver that's provided I think I mistakenly called that a Phillips head in the beginning of the video but it is a flathead you take that out right there just like so keep your finger on the deck and it comes out like that now what you want to make sure you do before you swap out the pin make sure you take this peek insulator right here take it off the original pin and put it on the squanching pin don't run this without the peek insulator you safety first you want that squanching pin with the peek insulator and you can see the hole right there for squanching okay once that's installed correctly again keep your finger on the deck and just push this thing in and screw it down now you can see there's a flathead cutout right there so you can use the provided flathead screwdriver to install the squanching pin okay just please make sure you put that insulator ring in there right that's very very important okay and there you go now it's installed and now let me show you see right there see that little slot right there that's where your juice is gonna drop down from when you squonk okay so now it's in squonk mode now in order to reassemble it we take the base and there's a lot of threads so just spin it on there just like that make sure you tighten it down nice nice and tight and now it is in full squonk mode let's put it on a stand let me show you how to build this thing so the first thing you want to do you want to open up all those posts all right once they're all open you take your coil shove it in from the bottom and your quails gonna look something like that right it's gonna look a little out of joint what you want to do is you kind of want to hold it in place and you might want to get a coiling rod to do that you might want to just like get a coiling rod and hold it right where you want it right just like that right get a coiling rod hold it into place make sure it's right above that airflow right then while you're holding it in place take your hex driver and just tighten it down don't go crazy give it a nice tightening just like so and now with your coiling rod in place you can make your coiling adjustments but look how easy that was look how perfectly installed that was and look how easy that was I mean crazy easy to build on right now what you want to do is you just take your leads and you just give them a haircut right on top here boom pull them forward a little bit get that flush cutter in there boom haircut one side already installed now we're gonna turn it around and we're gonna repeat the process okay now we're all built check that out huh kind of neat right really really easy to do let's see what we roaming out at 0.1 3 that might come up a little bit all right now here's one thing that's kind of annoying right with this rdta is that you really can't you really can't stroke the coils you got to kind of do them one at a time you can't stroke them at the same time which is kind of annoying but whatever man it's no big deal it's so easy to build if it takes a couple of extra seconds to get the hot spots out who cares you know that's the way I feel about it right get all the hot spots out now it looks to be glowing evenly from the inside out all right now we're gonna take this thing and I'm gonna show you how to wick it up so now we're gonna take a nice long piece of cotton because we're wicking for two coils all right we're gonna make it nice and pointy on one end give it a nice little point so we can get it through the coil we're gonna pop that point right through just like so nice resistance you hear that that's exactly how you want it and now how you want to cut a cotton on an rdta in general is go right down to where the glass starts right there get your vape ears and give it a snip same thing on the other side go down the way that metal starts get your vape shears pop it right off just like that now we're gonna repeat the process on the other side there we go all built and wick maybe the other side's a little longer we'll pull it out a little bit even it out a little bit but absolutely perfect right there right now this is the reason I really love these scissors to vape Cheers they're nice and pointy and I don't have to go around switching tools out right what I can do is I can just take them and tuck them in with the points of the scissor see that's why I love the vape Cheers not only are they great scissors that cut great but they're great for placing your wicks same thing on this side pop that cotton in there just like so and you see you see how it kind of Peaks out that's how it should be kind of Peaks out that's how you want it and that's it it's all built and wikked now what we're going to do is we're going to juice this thing up so now what you want to do I'm going to be using some that one vapes apricot custard now you do is you want to wet that quail wet that cotton up get it started do the same thing on the other side get the cotton started kind of paint it up a little bit right and then right here is your fill port right so you want to stick your bottle in there give it a squeeze nice squeeze until you see it coming out the other end you know watch over here there you go now it's all filled up maybe juice that cotton a little more okay get it started and let's see if we got veep oh yeah we have veep there we go now like I said the nice thing about this rdta is that it locks the barrel into place let me show you what I'm talking about see that it locks that barrel right into place the coils are right in front of the airflow now we're gonna lock this down boom boom and now let me show you how the air flow works see how the air flow works independently I can shut down the top I can shut down the bottom if I want to right see that I can open up the top see the see the honeycomb I can do it in any combination that I would like I could open up the bottom half way a little bit if I want some more air just be forewarned this is an extremely Airy rdta alright one last look at it all put together let's go over those cons and pros we're gonna start off with cons as usual first kind is gonna be man this thing's got way and I mean way too much airflow you air flow hogs are gonna love it but man I got the side and the bottom open I mean it's like breathin listen to this I mean there's like literally no restriction the only restriction you get is all that metal in the deck I mean it's it's incredible you airflow hogs are gonna love it you people who like flavor probably aren't gonna like that end of the spectrum of the airflow because it's gonna dilute the flavor another kind is gonna be that short drip tip not a fan of that short drip tip it's beautiful but I just wish it was a little longer staying on the short drip tip theme you're gonna get some bacon lips on this one if you build low and chain vape and let me explain why I said it before there's a lot of metal inside this rdta I think it heats up the addy unusually higher as opposed to most rdta so if you chain bait this thing at like 95 a hundred Watts that top caps gonna get hot and you're gonna get some bacon lips baby another kind is gonna be on the side airflow right when you adjust the airflow it's very very hard to see those holes close up I wish they would have made the cutout part on the top cap a different color so I can see what I'm adjusting here another kind I got to throw up just because it's a Thunderhead creations atomizer I hate doing this but I gotta be honest with my subs they don't have the best distribution they make great products I love their solo RDA I think the one RTA is one of the is the best single coil RTA on the market right now the problem is every time you order you got an order from China nobody really has their stuff in the States hopefully Thunderhead creations fixes that and get some distribution in the States let's go dunderhead creation and the last cons gonna be the fill port right you kind of gotta like angle your bottle in there I wish there was a little bit more space actually in this case I probably would have liked some type of side fill all right but otherwise real real nitpicky stuff not a lot of stuff that's a deal-breaker let's move on to the pros first pros gonna be man the packaging the packaging on this I love the way Thunderhead creations packages stuff they do a bang-up job with it next pro's gonna be that wide airflow range this thing's got a super wide air flow range you can go from a really restrictive DL almost a mouth to lung to a wide open air EVP the range on this thing is phenomenal I like that innovative deck that y-shaped deck that reverse drop style deck awesome job Thunderhead creations it's got some nice build quality it's super super easy to build and wit its squonk able you air flow hogs are gonna love this thing this thing's got gobs and gobs of airflow you get tons of extras right you get you get all the o-rings right you get 510 driptip adapter you get four different five tens Thunderhead creations that a great job giving you extras you get the extension kit the little pipe the glass awesome awesome job it's got nice flavor this has got really really good flavor in fact the way that I like to run it the best is I shut the bottom airflow off completely and then I shut the top airflow of the side air flow and I get banging flavor on this thing and you guys know I'm really not an rdta guy let me show you what I'm working with here though I'm at point one at a hundred watts I got some apricot custard in here let me show you fully saturated very dense very flavorful I gotta tell you this is probably my favorite rdta that I've ever tried it's it's up there man it's fantastic and if you open up that airflow that wide open airflow and you crank some more wattage through this thing this thing is a massive cloud chukka I like the capacity and the fact that you get two different capacities the airflow on this the airflow on this is smooth I got the top row of the side air flow shut bottom air flow shut check it out it's just nice and smooth man I thought well that metal in there was gonna create some turbulence it's pretty smooth a little bit a little bit on the noisy side but I expect that with an R DT a let's put this through our five star rating system first category is the looks category I think it's got a real solid look to it I love running it on the carbon in shorty mode it's available in a bunch of different colors and it's got some really nice build quality to it in this category we're gonna give it a solid four stars in the building and wicking category I love the innovative deck I've said it before it's like a reverse drop style deck when you give it a haircut on top I'm diggin that I like the fact that coil placement is very easy extremely easy to wick I think it's a great build deck especially for somebody who's never built before it's super easy to build on in this category I gotta give it four and a half stars one of the biggest scores I've ever given any atomizer in this category as far as performance goes it's gonna score high again I told you guys it's one of my favorite Rd TAS ever and I'm not an RD ta guy I'm more of an RTA RDA guy but I love using this in shorty mode as ask Wonka I get bang in flavor if I want to chuck weather systems I just open up that air flow and let it fly baby we're gonna give this four and a half stars in the performance category another really high score as far as value goes I've been seeing anywhere from 21 to 28 dollars now the problem with this is if you're gonna get it on the cheap side you're gonna have to order it from China you're probably gonna have to wait but I'm telling you this one is worth the wait however I can't ding them because you got to order it from China I feel bad dinging them on distribution I still think it's a good value ultimately the thing that sucks is you're probably gonna have to wait for it but if you can get it under $30 it's a really good value with a high-quality vape on an RD ta I gotta give it another four and a half stars we're gonna take all these stars we're gonna add them up and come up with a total of seventeen and a half stars we're gonna take these seventeen and a half stars we're gonna divide it by four and we're gonna come up with a total score of four point three seven five and I gotta tell you I was a little shocked when I saw this score mainly because I really don't hand out high scores and this is one of the highest scores I've ever given an atomizer but I want to put it in perspective it's a high score for an rdta so just keep that in mind as well when you're looking at the school let's go over some of the specs on the Thunderhead creations max rdta it measures in at 25 millimeters in diameter and 44 millimeters high it has a y-shaped build deck with a 32 hole honeycomb side airflow 2 or 4 point 5 ml capacities are available in shorty mode it's 2 MLS in big boy mode it's 4.5 MLS it is a squonk Abel rdta that is available in black gunmetal rainbow blue gold and stainless steel don't forget insiders head on over to our Facebook group very civil very newbie friendly very active we would love to see you there we also started a brand new reddit sub forum I'd like to see you there as well and that's it insiders that's all I got for you guys today I'm gonna catch you guys on the next one in the meantime you keep living that vape life we're out of here deuces", "03fQciqSdVM": "dual Xeon an ender 3 let's do it my name is Jim and this is the edge of fat [Music] so recently I just did the printer mods direct-drive upgrade on my under three there been a lot of comments in the notes of that video saying that this is too much weight on the gantry and it could cause sagging so I reached out to Tim at th 3d and they just released there under three dual z upgrade kit perfect timing he sent me one over and we're gonna install it today right on this end or three so why would we want to do that well it's gonna help eliminate the ex gantry sagging that people are saying that this upgrade makes now it's been proven that these things stock can print really really good but why not spend some money and make it print even better a couple cool things about this it works with the standard or the pro so you don't have to worry about which version of the under three you have it has a 90-day warranty from th treaty if you have any issues in that 90-day warranty they'll hook you up all you got to do is contact them and say hey I got this from you and this is what's going on enough talk let's get this package opened up and let's see what's inside so as you can see it all comes very nicely sealed in this plastic which is really cool to see from th 3d they've got a new machine it can seal everything and that looks really professional okay so in the package you should get everything you see here there should be 4 m4 screws with tea nuts for the bearings and those are actually already installed in here and those are for the bearing blocks not to mention the two bearing blocks right here with the bearings pre-installed which is pretty cool too m3 screws with tea notes and washers for the belt a pulley right here then you get three m5 spacers and three m5 screws for the gantry bracket wheels you also get a tensioner bracket right here with a tensioner pulley you also get another m8 pulley you also get the z rod the belt and an all-metal dual z bracket that already has the brass nut and the two m3 screws in there so that's everything you get in the package let's get to the install so the first thing we need to do is go ahead and make sure that your filament is removed from the machine I just went ahead and cut mine you can heat it up and pull it out as well if you want to do that so make sure the filaments removed we need to relocate our power supply here I'm gonna set mine on the desk next to it for now but I'm also during the first print going to print the relocation file and there's a bunch of files right on the page of the instructions on this so you can actually go link them and you can print a file that moves this over for you and then it's attached still but it's over here for me today I'm gonna go ahead and remove these two screws with the allen wrench that came with a kit and then I'm gonna set my power supply right on the side here when you do take the power supply off you want to make sure your X gantry is all the way up as well now go to your left gantry where we're gonna add the new dual z2 and we're gonna remove these two wheels to do that there is a nut on the back go ahead and hold that with a vise grips or a pliers or a wrench whatever you have and then take your supplied allen wrench and take these two wheels off now we have these two wheels removed and I did use the small end of my double sided wrench to get those off please note that we are gonna use everything again except for this bolt now we're gonna do is go ahead and remove these two bolts and that'll release the left carriage here right off the X gantry now you want to hold it when you get this last bolt because as soon as you do this is gonna be free and it'll come off now that we have this plate removed remove this wheel the same way you did the other two remember we're gonna save all the parts except for the bolt something to note that this last wheel is the eccentric nut now what we're gonna do is put this carriage back together the first step in that would be putting our eccentric nut and wheel back on what we need to do that is a one of the longer bolts that came in the kit one of the spacers that came in the kit the existing eccentric nut the wheel and the washer so take your new bolt and put the washer on there then take this and push the bolt into the backside so it looks like that now if you look at it like this it kind of looks like a J and that's how we need it so the eccentric nut is next and we're gonna put the flange side in like this then your wheel then a spacer and then what we need is we need to take the other gantry and put it in the second hold down just like we did on the first one like that so what we have here before I tighten it is we have our screw going through with the washer on this side then your eccentric nut with the flange in then your wheel then a spacer that came with the dual z kit and then your lock washer tighten it in but not extremely tight right now because the wheel still needs to move and we want to put the other wheels in and get it straightened so now I have it snug but not all the way tight and you can see this is what it looks like tab here for your new z rod your eccentric nut up here and what we're gonna do next is reattach this to the frame so take the piece we just put together and slide it right behind now in this side just like it came off and just like we put it together there's a little divot in the frame for that screw and make sure that screw sits in that divot now take the two bolts that came out of the frame originally to remove the frame piece and something to note about these two bolts you want to get them snug but do not over tighten them we're actually going to be adjusting the X gantry and you want to be able to do that a little bit with those bolts next thing you want to do is just slide that down just a hair like this on one side and we're gonna reattach these two wheels and by moving that down a little bit it actually makes it easier to put the wheels in now we need to reinstall these two wheels first we're gonna start with the bolt then we're going to take the spacer that came with the printer then the wheel then the new spacer that came with a kit and we're gonna do both wheels like that so line that bolt up push the air line this bracket up slowly and then push your bolts through and we're gonna take the last two lock washers and install them on this side take your wrench vice grips or whatever you're using for the lock washers and then your allen wrench and tighten these up but do not over tighten them these will still need to move and slide up and down now we want to look at the bracket and the X gantry and just make sure they're flush together and they're level here if they're not that means your X gantry actually could be crooked up or down so just make sure that when you put this together it's all flush and level if you didn't have that go ahead and loosen these two bolts just a little bit make them flush and level and tighten those bolts back in next we want to adjust these two bolts right here just to assure that this is just a little loose so the zee rod can slide through it fine now when I got mine I noticed that the brass was actually on top which is upside down I took it off I put the brass to the bottom and I put my screws back in now we're just going to take our allen wrench and it's tight right now and we're gonna loosen it one full turn you see how that's little loose little trip Z rod will travel through there we might tighten that a half a turn later or right now I like that now pop the end cap off if you have one grab one of the bearing blocks here make sure your T nuts are loose turn them so they're flush and flat and put them in now the bearing should be up in the top here take an Allen wrench and spin those kind of quickly and those T nuts should lock on so I did not tighten it yet but it's in there and the T nuts are locked in now with that bearing block installed what we want to do is go ahead and lower our X can tree so I'm gonna go ahead and do it with my thumb here we want to find something like this mini roller filament here that I got with the under five to put underneath the X gantry cuz what we're gonna do is loosen the top screw here of our grub screw and we're gonna take the factory or the stock z rod out and we're gonna use it on this side so what we need is something to hold your X gantry from crashing and you want to be very careful because you don't want that to happen next loosen the top grub screw then remove the existing z rod push it down through the bearing lock that we just installed and then screw it down into this carriage right here now that it's pushed in what we want to do is make sure this bearing block is straight and and your z rod is straight up and down and tighten it in it will hang over the edge just slightly when it's perfectly straight now grab the pulley that came with the kit and set it on top of that Z screw and lower your Z screw on this side just so it's flush with the top of your new pulley just about like that tighten the two grub screws in now we have the two grub screws tightened the z rod here it's flush with the top of the pulley and that's gonna hold it so it doesn't fall anymore something to note there is a grub screw locked right in here what it does is it keeps the bearing in the block if you're bearing pushes out press it back in and go ahead and tighten this grub screw here now grab the other bearing block just like we did before and we're gonna install it on the right side so pull that cap off the right side get your grub screws ready just like we did before slide them in use your allen wrench here to spin them kind of quickly and they'll lock themselves in it will overhang just a little bit like we did with the other one with this just a little loose take the new z rod that came with a kit and push it down through now it should slide nicely you want to screw it down into the carriage here long is it straight as you see it'll actually slide right down make sure it's nice and bottom doubt maybe raise your gantry up and then as you set it back down this z rod will come down as you set it back down you'll hear it bottomed out take your allen wrench tighten the top of the grub screw here and then double check the bottom to make sure that one's tight now take the other pulley and set it on top of the other lead screw and tighten in your grub screws just like we did before do not over tighten though you don't want to strip the pulley out now take the included belt make sure it is all untangled and straight and the teeth are on the inside and put it over these two pulleys so take the tensioner that came with it and install the two T nuts in and you want to make sure that the washer is on the top and we're going to set that in the extrusion here and we want to leave them loose right now so it should be roughly in the front in the in the center and it should face the front of the machine spin those in and and make sure that that now locks into place I'm just gonna make sure that stays but I'm not gonna tighten it too much and make sure that the pulley is facing the front of this machine so this is the front of machine now I removed my spool holder so you guys could see this row your belt around that pulley just like this now you should have what looks like a triangle with your belt going around all three pulleys so I assumed in a little bit and as you can see we have our triangle now this is your belt tensioner here and what we need to do is tension the belt by pulling this forward and back so we're gonna pull this forward so the belt is you tight as you can see he not overly tight but tight enough just like any of the other belts there just make sure there's not a ton of slack in it once it's pulled tight and your belt is tight tighten down the two back bolts that hold it in here and you should be good now keep in mind I did take off the filament holder it usually sits right here I'm gonna put that back on either over here over here if this is in the way you can actually slide it one way or another to get it out of the way of that film and holder if you want to use it next what we want to do is make sure that these are not binding and you can do that by moving this up and seeing how difficult it is now it's gonna be a little bit harder or a little bit different because now you're you're pulling the ii z rod here but if you're if it's really too difficult and you're binding what we need to do is take your allen wrench go ahead loosen up the two screws in there and that'll adjust this here so i would suggest going all the way up and then all the way back down with this one at least loose i loosened them both and i went all the way up and then all the way back down and now i'm spinning very freely and very easily when i got that nice free motion I held the block in place and I tightened them in and that's how you stop the Z wobble which was the next step now once you made sure your Z wobbles gone with both of the screws you want to flip the printer back around and we need to check the level on the X gantry you can do this multiple ways you can print level blocks and there are some files in Tim's instructions to do that if you want to we do the X gantry rework if you follow the steps in that I'll link it below everything should be Denny ER awesome for you now what I believe is what Luke at field teaches and what we need to do is just measure both sides and we're gonna we need to actually level your X gantry to your frame not to your bed but to your frame and to do that we want to make sure both within one millimeter of each other and just for the heck of it I would when I put this back together just doing this enough times if you watched any of my videos I was watching this so I'm gonna go up to 80 millimeters on this side I'm going to click over here and I have right under 81 millimeters so I am man I have dead close to being almost dead on so I have 80 millimeters here and if I come over here I have about 80 and a half it's it's so close to 80 right between 80 and 81 which is perfect cuz we only need a one we only want a one millimeter difference on both sides so you can follow hit Tim's instructions with the leveling blocks if you want or you can use the X can't riri work because make sure your X gantry is perfectly level to the frame not to your bed but to the frame and when you're done if you have a ruler you want it within one millimeter on each side that's how you know you're good all right so that's it we have successfully installed the th 3d dual Z upgrade kit on my under three once you get the Z rods not binding spend some time and do that make sure they're not binding at all and that everything is nice and it moves nice number two make sure that your X gantry is level print the leveling blocks before if you want follow my X gantry rework from Luke Hatfield in the videos before either way just make sure it's level like we talked about before next thing we need to talk about is the eccentric nut and this carriage on this side here you need to make sure that that's rolling very nicely before you put it together I was following the steps and I'm gonna make the recommendation to Tim to throw it in the steps right before you attach it to the frame here I think we should put the wheels on and then check you know that it rolls nice and then attach it to your X gantry but what I did was I just adjusted the xcan tree and tested the wheels so when you adjust them you should adjust it so all the wheels are tight but not too tight and enough to turn it with your fingers still if they're too tight you can't turn it with your fingers that's way too tight you need to back them off a little bit if they're way too loose and they just spin that's too loose so just make sure the eccentric nut is good on this carriage and it's rolling nicely that's gonna help everything travel much better now what we're gonna do is turn it on and we're gonna do an auto home just to see if everything's working okay and make sure it goes up and down by itself so we'll go to prepare Auto home and we'll let it do its thing everything is going like it should the belt is turning and it's turning both sides of the gantry which is awesome and we've honed so that's pretty cool so everything is working as it should we've successfully installed the duals the upgrade kit like we talked about and I think we're good to go especially if you have the direct drive printer mods upgrade this is probably a really good thing to do just to give yourself a little bit of assurance on that left side there if you're looking at the printer on the right side of that gantry so it's not going up and down by itself I hope you learned something today and as always keep printing hey everybody let me know in the comments below what you think of this upgrade you'll like the video give me a thumbs up click that subscribe button below if you want to see more and in the Belle right over here if you want to see the next great video that comes out we look forward to

put a statement out there saying that listen people can say whatever they want to say you know what i'm saying and leave it at that time no i know part of the drama there he took the high road he's being classy you don't want no part of that drama i'm not the one to say they didn't get together and odell didn't want her you know them starry enough for them behind closed door or something freaky

how then she went into calling who's next popcon oh no no papa no want him kind of conversation dear my girl he and he's not a canadian rapper so let me get puppy mix up them feel like say he was a rapper from canada because i guess he spends so much time in canada and when he's in canada he's around drake a lot if drake is on the ground there so i guess they associated him with being some canadian rapper so popcorn put all the liquor video from action was a my girl but a real authentic jamaica can hear that and don't try that that kind of thing there so that is where that energy is coming from and that is who she is she is actually a porn star adult actress adult film actress slash whatever else you have going on pass around in the industry not man run through it already and she

"0QoenJo94Ag": "hey filmmakers shomba here in this video I'm going to show you a life that I built which is the light that I'm using right now to film myself with it's a LED strip light I can actually kind of say it's a kind of a keynote LED light it's like a cube light but it's with LED it's a very short one it's like half metre like 50 centimetres and it's powered with a Sony NPF battery and yeah it's also quite portable and quite small to take around with and for the moment I find it's quite bright so right now I'm using the 1022 on a speed booster and the ISO is on 400 and the shutter speed is 150 so it's a quite bright light and yeah I find the look is also quite pleasing because yesterday I did a few test shots filming my helmet and it looks quite nice it actually can get the Kino light kind of look with it mainly you can see inside the reflection it's a long tube lights that's used instead of a small LED panel with a lot of small dots or a big soft box which would like have like a big square reflection in it so it's a nice thin long reflection inside and yeah let's show you the actual light so this is the light it is a actually a LED strip light you can find this on eBay and I'll have a link in the description below to all these parts and the great thing about this is actually I can attach it with a hot shoe mount to my light stand like this and it makes it actually quite easy to yeah attach it to anything so I really like that it has it's unable to attach to a cold shoe or hot shoe like on how I've did it on here so that's one of the big plus sides that you can attach it to a very standard mount and unable to yeah aim it how you want to instead of having to hold it the whole time also it's quite small and quite easy to take with you and also to hide in areas to light more interesting stuff so right now if you want to buy this there is two versions of it so one is pure white and the other is one white the one I got is pure white with which is around 6000 kelvins the other thing is when you get it you get it with the black and red wire so you don't get this small plug with it but it's not that much of an issue so you can buy this small plug which is like one buck and then ya adapt it to it or solder it onto it which is not that much of an issue and then powering it's there is so many possibilities you can use a RC battery you can use a wall adapter that converts to 12 volts and how I use it is with a Sony NPF battery plates that converts the seven point 4 volts to 12 volts so here you can see Sony NPF battery and there we go that is very bright and yeah right now I'm using a different light here which is more about 4000 Kelvin so you can see that this light is more blue but yeah I find this quite nice you can also attach it to a wall or anything and yeah able to attach it to a small what adapter and then put it onto a lights and it's a great thing for interview wise I think using two of these be bright enough but if you want to light up an entire room with it you probably want to have like a row of four of these because the brightness of this is pretty bright but it is around thousand lumens if you want to write an up a big scene you might want to go more towards like 4000 lumens so able to have like more lights but yeah I feel like this could be a very nice light to use to film a lot of products with it so you did see the test video with the helmet and it gives a nice and different look then using a our D panel as this is like a fin long yea LED strip and it gets like a certain look that you will get with a keynote tube light so yeah that was mainly everything I want to talk about this so it's an affordable LED lights this part cost you only like 8 bucks that depth are here or the plug here cost you like 1 buck this adapter plate costs only 24 bucks so it's not really that expensive and yeah you can adapt it to a lot of power sources so there was mainly it if you want to see more upcoming videos please

not even say source my sauce but that's how we figure from my sauce right no because the thing does get real everything i have told you so far is going to happen has happened and i'm sticking to my source people on a wait but come have some voicemail that you need to hear but i have been told i am not allowed to put them out until certain things happen and those certain things are happening by way of the jamaica gleaner just an hour ago contract killer makes a tearful confession to the murder of portland businessman's wife now we're talking about mr beech's stout of course a contract killer has detailed how he lured tonya mcdonald the wife of popular portland businessman everton beachy stout mcdonald to a deserted roadway in the parish and watched as he subcontracted another man to stab her repeatedly you hear that now the details of how it all went down is right here is this we are listen wickedness increase man may i tell you and i got questions but i'm gonna ask those questions when we get to the point watch this so the details are outlined in the home circuit court on monday after denverin minot who is 56 years old pled guilty to murder for his role in the july 20th 2020 killing of this young lady now minot was today sentenced to 19 years in prison and ordered to serve 10 years before he becomes eligible for parole people the way this murder was carried out in such gruesome fashion you can see why i make videos that say that jamaica's justice system needs a overhaul there is no way on god's earth under god's sun moon and stars that a man should be able to commit this type of a heinous crime against a female even or anyone for that matter and walk away with 19 years but it seems like 19 years is what they gave him because that was his reward for sealing the faith the nails in the coffin of mr everton beach stout i'm gone people i'm done go and listen to my videos again that i put up when my source was saying him done him done him done him done him done him done him done him done that my full confession him done so far we are dancing and look at this our full confession in details now justice vivian harris who imposed the sentence calling the killing horrifying let me just stop and say something livestock vice cartel got 35 years right before he is eligible for parole something like that he's doing a life sentence for a body they never found for stuff that pretty much was made up and this man walk away with 19 years do the maths anyways back to the story because we are getting into the full confessions of the details and again and the details of the full confession and again i am taking this directly from jamaica galena right now now my nuts confessions were contained in a caution statement that he made to detectives that were assigned to the major investigation division two weeks after the partially burnt body of the 32 year old businesswoman was found with its throat slashed inside her car in sherwood forest in portland remember the voice note where the girl said if tell your truth sasha bad shabbat shabbat shabbat shabbat shabbat god no the person said also is only because shabbat saw why our body end up up thistle which part it did so was she having an affair with one of these men that she trusted him so much for driving to our car go pick him up and i carry him gums go somewhere was that the case and beach found out and he contracted him as one of the men who were actually having a relationship with her for killer but listen to the story the man made the confession in the presence of two justices of the peace so it wasn't something that was made to one person somewhere wankana and somebody is saying that when you get to the justice of the peace you have already made this confession to some constable some arresting officer somewhere some questioning detective somewhere that's a next level level 3 no is when you are before a justice of the peace they had two justices of the peace standing there so this man sure of what he's talking about everton mcdonald also known as mr mack who is 65 years old and another man who is asha barnes have been arrested and charged with the gruesome slaying now my nut in his caution statement which was cited in court by prosecutors claims that he was contracted by everton mcdonald to kill tanya now of course i respect that jamaica glina has to say claims that he was contracted because we're dealing with the legalities of things right but this is a confession so he confessed that he was being contracted but we don't know if he's telling the truth or not is that what they are saying from a legal standpoint a confession ima tell the truth there is no other business with the law that brought him here except for this case and what happened to this young lady no he said that the arrangement was that a payment of 3 million dollars would be made for the killing of mr ma of mistress mcdonald one prosecutor disclosed sighting straight from the caution statement so the man tell them say a 3 million but that's not new news because that's been out there for a while now that it was 3 million dollars that was paid but this man is telling them that it was supposed to be a payment of 3 million dollars why somewhere they are firing at work called waco to salty as frown win i work hard even i work two jobs for years and still don't have 30 grand save up the payment of three million dollars would be made for the killing now minot who is a fisherman who i was already told that was a fisherman so anyway mandatory is a fisherman who also resides in portland claimed that two that [ __ ] thought gave him listen upon the people [ __ ] told gave him clear instructions this is in his confession in court on paper on record and in front of two justices of the peace the man said that [ __ ] told gave him clear instructions on how his wife should be killed he didn't want mrs mcdonald to be shot the man said but that she was to be stabbed stubborn up in our upper body and burn the body he told detectives according to prosecutors god almighty what a wickedness stop yo this is different from you just saying yo killer when you don't do it just send me the you know malevolent so much but may not even want no that's not one of these cases the man calculatedly cold-heartedly designed the way in which she was to go stab her up in our upper body and then burn the body this is what he told detectives according to the prosecutors now minot admitted that he gave the work to another man he gave the work to another man because he didn't want to do the bloody part of the work but him have this big contract that's worth three million dollars so of course it's easy to give a portion of that money to somebody who none do nothing with them life or crush out weeding them hand me every deal or this is how they get their money right so he gave the work to somebody else he revealed that he was on site he was right there when everything was happening him and manduit right and this is the details he revealed that on the night of july 20th tanya mcdonald who is the wife who was murdered picked him up in our toyota accio motorcar and we thought it was a bmw all along but that's a for another story picked him up in a vr car right and he indicated to her that he was going to pick up another man in port antonio so i'm saying now pick up somebody else but why did she pick him up where were they going what were their plans for the evening somebody sent her i forgot give him a ride um pick him up and drive him drop him off somewhere or did she have dealings with him outside of what beach he knew about that's how emily get into right there anyhow he revealed that on that night july 20th tanya picked him up in our car and he told her where to go say my go pick up somebody else right typical thing all three of them traveled after she picked up the man towards sherwood forest where she was found he said that when the youth asked tanya mcdonald to stop and turn around the car as we approach this three-way intersection he said that might not recall stepping out of the vehicle after tanya complied with the request so after the man said turn around okay i'm say not stepped out of the vehicle right where y'all go i'm afraid you know cerrone is a dark is what she said people we could actually quote these as her last words right way i'll go i'm afraid i don't know you know cicerone is a dark she's probably saying which particular come on that is a dark place you can imagine right now according to minot the other man got back got out of the car as well after he got out of the car and then he got quickly back into the car so might not step out of the car and the other man john paul took so maya probably said do we know and him jump back in the car right that's how it's going according to minor the other man also got out of the car quickly after he got out of the car but he jumped right back in so may can't see anything else but the person who is confessing minot who got the job the contract the three million dollar contract to make it work make it happen actually said do it no and he jumped back in the car to do it he said right nessa do you would grab a renault and grab tanya rubber around the head rest people the headrest is the part of your seat in your car where your head rest back pawn vehicle is it's adjustable and you can pull it up and them thing there so grab our around the headrest you can imagine him grabbing her head squeezing it backwards into the headrest for who already steady and them start wrestling they were wrestling because she was fighting she was like what the [ __ ] yep i'll start fight he said he then saw when in situ he said he then saw when you the stubborn and then he saw blood coming from her two sides and from her back and from her neck so i'm stop stop stop stop stab her up this is what the prosecutor revealed in court straight from his witness statement now minor said that the man had a bottle containing some unknown liquid may maybe gasoline or something else that burns faster miner said might not said that after the car caught fire and he left the scene to call everton mcdonald beach stout to tell him what had happened the work is done boss would do the work everything good wow 100 years and nothing less is what mia said anyway it says that the san san police reported that while the scene was being processed and i told you guys this because there was the eyewitness that told me that he was there and he saw it but mckenna reveal who yet he said that everton mcdonald arrived this is the sunshine police said that everton mcdonald arrived and he identified the wife's body and identified her car now my nut which is the one that is telling all the silence testifying he apparently was wracked with guilt so i'm just breakdowning at tears and he told the police everything including his role in how this all went down im say miss mark trust me too much she believing on me a me makes you go up there this is what he said while he was crying listen to that miss mark trust me too much what does that mean that those sound like them you have no [ __ ] [ __ ] sex relationship that's all like somebody tell her if i go pick him up right pick up so-and-so and drop him over someone suffer me please right and she didn't know she was going to her death

glory until you have about me with shabbat sharma crocodice damn honest to the apostles and yo this is a great millstone and preaching salutations to the archaeon to the elect that are scattered across the four corners of this earth pushing the shoot down in faith and in sincerity shalom island brothers from the great millstone he's in camp and this lesson is going to be entitled let the wicked be wicked still because uh you know today came home from work you know as the usual and i knock on the door and it was uh opened it and it was some of my uh my friends you know from high school you know stopped by to visit me now these were guys that that knew of the truth all right and they still know it to a certain extent you see and they know that i know the truth or that i be in the scriptures to a certain extent they don't know what i fully do like they don't know that um uh like in great millstone or i go on the highways in the byways and teach nothing like that i don't know any of that uh but you know i thought it was just gonna be a little friendly conversation you know we're just talking and uh you know one of my uh one of the guys kept saying yeah bro the most high this the most out of that so you know i'm kind of like brushing it off you know i really want to get into it and then i just i couldn't resist i i don't i forgot i forget the whole how the whole situation went right but they started talking about the scriptures and me being around you know ah i couldn't i couldn't even i couldn't even hold back and just start trying to go not nothing too deep but keep a long story short like you can't explain anything to these people right because i damn i got a headache going back and forth you see uh hey jake is jake is gone jake is completely through i'll say this because everything that i said jake would uh refer out to my bro this dude was like way off the deep end with what he was saying like it makes you just think like huh what like how like what are you talking about and you see i was just like man i said hey little bro hey you gotta go i like go home bro hey go home i had to i had to come take me a nap bro you see that's how bad my [ __ ] head was hurting see but yeah that's what this lesson's about hey man you can't you can't really say that to these people man just just just let them have it right just let them have it bro let them let them do whatever they do right what he said was what he kept saying this is this is what kind of got me what he kept saying was yeah uh that stuff you learned yeah i've been in it way before you yeah i was learning the way before you i think that's what kind of like kind of like irritated me a little bit and made me say something no but yeah but let's get into it this is revelation 22 and 11. if he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he does holy let him be holy still right so you see somebody ain't got this truth man you see the lifestyle they live in right you see what they doing right here in the world that they ain't no damn good you know that you know they it's just that the truth is not form all right bro you don't even i don't even like try to stress it don't even say anything you know don't let people get you out of your character you know don't don't even don't even try to waste your time trying to convert somebody to believe what you believe it you see because you know it'll be to no avail it wouldn't it wouldn't it's not going to profit anything it's not going to work and you're going to waste your breath basically you see you're going to be saying all this and all that or going to the scriptures and hey people's mind is not going to change you see so he says he does unjust let him be unjust still he he which is filthy let him be filthy so just leave him alone man just leave him alone and you will it will bro it will be the situation would be much better if you don't even engage in none of that with anybody with a friend or a cousin family member you see just just let it go right you don't know how to say anything to nobody or you just prophesy i said you going always in about what you prophesied you know you do your videos right and the videos the motorcycles were able to reach whoever it needs to reach to you see this is matthew 7 and six to give not that which is holy unto the dogs neither cast you your pearls before swine as they trap them under their feet and turn again and render you right if not that which is holy to the dark what is holy this word all right what is the pearl this word give now that was just holding to the dogs and casting not your swell before swan talking about this truth right he says let the less they trample them under their feet and turn again and render you right because this word is holding up to us we have high reverence you know for the scriptures for you how about me i was shy and when we are telling people these things we are trying to help them expl you know understand where we're coming from and everybody is not meant to understand because you still got two-thirds of israel and they're not going to receive this information how you want to how you want them to receive it all right they they they're going to take it in and and spit it right back out at you right and say say say something that's going to just just piss you the [ __ ] off right and you know you're just going to realize that it won't even work saying anything you see people they're going to despise the words of how boston i was shot they're going to despise the scriptures right here you as you you holding the word with high reference and and they're going to despise it right and it could make the situation you know worse or i guess for me i got a goddamn headache out of the situation this is uh proverbs 14 he said we go from the presence of a foolish man when thou perceiveth not in him the list of knowledge right so once you even just get a little glimpse of something that anyone is saying you know don't even don't even say anything see leave them alone let's let them let them spear out their minds and spew out their foolishness right and carry on with your business and see we ain't here to try to convert every single israelite see only a few would be will be saved you see so it says go from the presence of a foolish man so you can get the hell away from whoever it is please do it please do it right because you sit there and listen to all of that amen and you have you got to have a strong mind so i couldn't take it you see like jake is bugged out proverbs 17 10 a proof enter it more and into a wise man than a hundred stripes into a full sense of proof of correction what is more profitable for a wise man you see you know all my whom the most i will open to understand the correction then it hundreds stripes into a fool then the fools are getting beat with 100 stripes you see because it's hard to it's hard to do anything to a fool you see it's hard to change the fool's mindset they have an obstinate mind they're stubborn you see they're they're foolish you see proverbs 24 7. wisdom is too high for a full he opened the knights muffin and gate you see so this wisdom not understanding that we're teaching that we preach but this is this is information from another realm you see uh this information was given through the holy spirit so if the holy spirit is not working with the individual that you are telling the truth to or that's hearing this truth right but they're not going to get it they're not going to be able to receive it right that's why they will despise it you see what people hate what they don't understand you see so say the wisdom is too high for a fool you see so in those type of situations man it ain't even worth it you see it'd be better off just like the scriptures say let the wicked be wicked still and let the unjust be unjust still all right it would be wise to leave it alone all right and i i i knew this you see but hey sometimes you mess up you see i was i was kind of sucked in you see into the situation you see because i got irritated and annoyed and i kind of just you know i had to say something right but you know i cut it short right and i made the [ __ ] leave so yeah man with that i'm gonna say shalom"}
