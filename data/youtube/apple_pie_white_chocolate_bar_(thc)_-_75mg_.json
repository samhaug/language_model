{"lUnNZTAcmAc": "[Music] hi I'm will and welcome to my kitchen today we're gonna be making some wheat apple pies we're kind of modeling them after that nostalgic like drive-thru apple pie I'm sure you bought a few those when you're stoned but now can you do both it wants to birds it won't stone [Music] yes so here you see we've got about an ounce of D carbs weed that's all ready to go to makings to sea water so I'm gonna bring it over to the stove okay so we've got our D carved wheat here but before we deal with this we're gonna melt some butter we've got about it pounds worth of butter in here when you turn your stove on you want it pretty much as low as it can you just want a slight simmering we're gonna mix this butter in [Music] take your time don't worry about the pace just take it slow so nothing burns you're not gonna put the lead in until it's all melted so you know that Shakespeare could have been a STONER in 2001 anthropologists actually found marijuana residue left over into his personal smoking papers okay it's all melted so now we're ready to add the wheat to the butter there we go so now we're gonna turn the oven far down close to simmer really and we're gonna keep it at that for two to three hours while we gently stir it that's gonna be a while but once it's done we're gonna strain it through cheesecloth and then just let it cool down for a while after that it'll be ready to go for our project see you in a little bit okay so we've got our weed butter it's all cooled and ready for cooking but first we're gonna have to peel and dice some apples Honey Crisp this is a Honey Crisp apple which is really good for baking because it's soft and sweet and it doesn't require a lot of other additions to it just peel the Apple essage so these are very soft apples which means you don't have to cook them in the pan for very long and so they won't get as burnt and there's less of a chance of losing any of the THC content okay now that the apples peeled we have to dice it up you want the pieces to be small but not too small [Music] we want to make sure you're being really careful when you're with your fingers when you're doing this [Music] oK we've got all these now can put them in this bowl [Music] and we're gonna go over here to make our filling okay so now we're ready to make the filling I'm gonna put this down and then we're gonna put in two tablespoons of the wheat butter that's equivalent to about 80 milligrams we're making five to six pies that's like 15 milligrams each per try and so after we've put that and you just want to dump all the apple slices if you want to turn this step up to like a medium temperature you don't want to burn it too much and then I'm gonna squeeze half a lemon over at the apples this is gonna trick them from oxidizing they won't get all brown and green okay we're just gonna cook these for a little bit see you're waiting for that pulse to get soft and warm and then once they reach that point you're ready to add the rest of the ingredients this is really easy filling to do there's a few steps involved but it's actually pretty simple it doesn't take many ingredients and it's really delicious so I recommend it starting to look just about right I think we're ready to add the rest of our ingredients so first we're gonna add a bit of cornstarch this will help thicken the consistency of the filling and then this is just cinnamon for flavor [Music] now some nutmeg awesome nutmeg is pretty awesome that's quite a twist okay now you need a big thing of brown sugar oh it all kind of came out in a clump you just want to mix it evenly throughout and blast you just want to add some water then you just want to keep mixing it up just keep stirring till you get that really nice thick consistency apple pie obviously is an American tradition this is a bit more of an alternative America but it's still really delicious and the way we're making them it's great for on-the-go it's amazing for a picnic a festival it's just a good thing and if it gets you high then that's just a bonus yes okay turning the heat down simmering okay so once again starts to get really syrupy you want to pull it off and let it cool okay so now we're ready to cooler filling so we're gonna just empty it all off onto this tin foil pan I'm just kind of spreading it out so it just can cool quickly nothing too complicated okay so now our filling is ready to be cooled so we're gonna put it in the fridge for like five minutes so we'll check on that in a little bit okay so now our fillings been cooled and we can move on to making our pie crust so we're just gonna be using a store-bought crust if you've made it yourself you could cook it with wheat butter as well but we just did it with the filling this time you want to cut it into two squares but one thing you have to pay attention to is you have to make one of them larger than the other [Music] shutting it down [Music] okay so now you sprinkle some cornflakes onto the dough all of this will have a stronger base to your crust when it's cooked okay so after that we're ready to add our filling you want to use a few spoonfuls not too much keep it in the center don't bring it towards the edges and then the reason you make the bigger one is you put that on the top so when you seal it it feels really well and it doesn't like explode in the oven or something so you just put it over and kind of fold the edges of both sides and and then once you're done with that you can take a serrated blade and just gently cut a few openings in the pipe definitely excited to get these things out then they're gonna be sick as hell I think then after that it's pretty much ready we can put it over here with the rest okay they're pretty much ready to go in the oven now they look pretty good to me you want to put them in the oven about 425 Fahrenheit and sleep it in for a half an hour but check on it after 20 just in case [Music] do you know that the cannabis use of adults 15 older has now outpaced the growth of use of any other age demographic and they're done look they look pretty awesome like they're fresh out of the drive-thru or something remember they're about 15 milligrams each no when you're dosing but have fun if you're able teen I know I'm going to enjoy thanks a lot take care take care", "8sIqJ2MaIRY": "[Music] what's going on guys I'm so loud 710 them back with another video today's video it's gonna be well I don't know if you guys can even guess what this is so far I posted it on my story on Instagram but you guys have me

cracker crust then all the confuse hope you enjoy the hi neighbor team PS to reheat preheat oven to 225 put in for 5-10 minutes until it's warm so that's because it comes inside of this like container and stuff it's like super official and all that but they're saying to put inside the oven because you could put metal inside the oven but to be real I'm I'm not I don't want to go through all that so I'm just gonna put in the microwave take it out of this it looks pretty good yeah I don't know a little interesting-looking you guys be the judge of this would you eat this does it look like a mushroom what does it look like to you oh [ __ ] I'm gonna microwave this and plug it some ice cream on it and see how this tastes I'll probably get smacked ace [ __ ] I can't wait okay I put in there

cream throws me off not used to that I'm used to like a really complementing taste apples and coffee really weird usually vanilla ice cream really does the trick I mean this is a bad just so interesting like what a weird flavor in my mouth I think I'm gonna that's why I didn't want to eat the whole thing this is so good it doesn't really it doesn't even Taylor edible if you like if I eaten this when it first came out the oven when they had first made it then it would have been like crispy and like good and stuff it's still really good but the consistency it holds right now I'm telling you like I wouldn't trade it it's still so good but this is like so crazy how it's just apple pie and it has we did it when I was in Cali well me and sky were out there bruh I'm telling you there was this he's this event we went and there was these two vendors they were so cool I'll tell you why we met them and they had edible guess that's honey edible shrimp edible shrimp it was so good they said for 40 bucks they make you a whole plate of full at a bowl like a full edible meal you could have garlic noodles cornbread the shrimp like broccoli whatever you want it like everything will be medicated every little thing so I'm like bird like if they make you [ __ ] like that it make it [ __ ] like this why am I even eating regular food anymore like I should everything I should eat is infused by it like from now on just just by law mmm doctor that a bunch of that that hit that bite takes a lightweight I couldn't think of the word there's something pink on this bike so I don't want to eat it supposed to be pink but I don't think not like to be on streets I'm not like the biggest connoisseur of like cookies brownies cakes frostings I don't like stuff like that but apple pie and some where do I get down on that I'm gonna say it the last two bites for like my stomach to just settle down for us thank you I can't eat that much in one sitting I mean that I don't look back I did one time that was crazy but I didn't eat all the edibles like fully through I'm actually eating this whole apple pie so it's kind of hard to eat the whole thing I'm trying to get my appetite back all right I'm high as a [ __ ] let's get it I this is like [ __ ] partially melted and the okay the ice creams melted but I will find cold as [ __ ] let's just get it I didn't care gonna force myself to eat there's not even wondering anymore so cold I'm just doing it for the high down and 220 milligrams I my tolerance is so much higher than that is this worth it like at this point what am i eating 10 milligrams and um I'm done at first I felt like the luckiest person on earth and now it feels like Fear Factor yeah I was super interesting now I'm just gonna wait like what like 20 30 minutes for it to like really kick into my system and [ __ ] I'm gonna come back show you guys my reaction to this hopefully I'll be a little stony out early no probably gonna smoke some more in this pen get more high anyway yeah 23 minutes I'll be right back oh my god dude I like I hear me explain how I feel it's like we because usually a hundred something like anything less than 300 doesn't normally do anything to me well I think it's the way I metabolize everything metabolize is definitely honestly like if you eat like gummies versus brownies versus whatever is gonna hit you differently apple pie for the win like I don't even I don't even know how a taboo he's like make your ice quit but I'm like [ __ ] up off the pen too I've granted I was just like two more hits off the pen though what they

The evenings are getting cooler.  The leaves are beginning to change and here at Tweetsie Fudge Works we can smell fall in the air. Come on in\nand let us show you some of our fall treats. One of the things that says fall\nmore than anything else is our harvest of apples.  And so today we're going to\nmake apple pie fudge. We start with our granny smith apple.\nIt's the same type of apples that we use when we do caramel apples and I've got\nthis little gizmo that was actually invented in the 1700s that automatically\npeals the apple,  slices the Apple and cores the apple all at the same time. We take those those slices cut them into smaller sized slices and we cover them\nwith a combination of cinnamon,  clove and ginger. We add a little butter to it and\nmelt all those ingredients together. And we add that to our basic fudge recipe. We start cooking the fudge\nand then we add some chocolate some marshmallow cream and a little bit of\nflavor to kick up the spices. Cook it to 236 degrees and pour it out on our\nmarble slabs. Once it's sitting on our marble slabs we begin to work it up and that means that the fudge has to begin to grain off or begin to build up a\nsolid grain.  Once we build the grain up then we decorate the fudge with some\nwhite chocolate and a little bit more of the apple pie spice. The fall season is really beginning to\ncrank up here a Tweetsie! So come on by Tweetsie Fudge Works and taste\nsome of the fall treats that we have for you! My name is Gary Dinstuhl,  thanks\nfor watching!", "EqGPpQktjMI": "[Music] my [Music] [Applause] [Music] i [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you guys aren't starting without me are you we would never have we ever done that in the past craig no well i guess today's a good day to start that smells really good i know guess what flavor i have no idea mmm my favorite [Music] and all the flavor of the smell is leaving i'm not all of it i get the smell it's all gone oh god better than real apple pie this does smell great might have just an apple pie wow or one of those mock apple pies i didn't it's the ritz crackers that was crazy though yeah didn't it taste exactly like it yeah it had like the exact same consistency yeah it looked kind of like it too unless you really pulled it apart it looked just like apple pie what what was it that made it all like did you just add water to it or something i don't know it was like ritz crackers i want to say cream of tartar lemon juice not that many ingredients did you did we even put sandwich what i don't know what that means what happened time to write it down oh okay we're trying to keep track of when we pour it on the table and when we're done there's a little stevie pavlov over here yeah like the dogs eating when they ring the bell i remember uh there was an episode where kelso was trying to explain pavlov experience experiment and he was like yeah then pavlov's mouth would water you're gonna feed the dogs and his mouth i don't know what that's it counselor yeah are you sure i'm telling you that's somebody sure is like it's fun it's so great just a smidge darker than that last one can you guys cook longer or what it smells so good no it was the same just sometimes they just come out there you know what it smells like did you guys ever have teddy bear toast no what's uh yeah your butter toast and then you just put a bunch of like cinnamon sugar on it um well yeah oh you have that every morning yeah salmon on my toast that's what this smells like to me i had too well i had almond butter banana cinnamon toast i don't have sugar in my cinnamon though because we need i don't really need it oh it's good though it's all crunchy all that sugar sugar and butter is a great combination i don't think you'll find too many people that'll argue with that i like cinnamon and toast and with coffee everything's good with coffee in the morning i would like to say that nothing tastes good with coffee the coffees oh your mom just got me something good hate coffee hazelnut that's some good irish cream oh good stuff you tried the the coconut yet coconut coconut coffee i mean no i haven't had that one all right so are you gonna do the color this time or i'll switch it up or yeah i'll do the color this time you think that's gonna take me forever over here yeah you're fast fast max lifting kettles every day okay ready yeah just just kind of red you know a little ready i did three drops last time so maybe only like one drop can do it dad that's good i believe in that thanks all right red and brown or something yep everyone's favorite part it's your boss an accent so here i am give you some bostony to say say you lost your car keys i lost my cockies i don't say you lost your khakis i lost my khakis have you seen that one where it's like how to check to see if you have an atlanta accent it's like something about aaron's urn or something like that yes yeah atlanta can tell us yeah i don't know what an atlanta accent sounds like though i guess they say like iron instead of aaron that's what i picked up from that 30 second video and then if you say you do a british accent all the british people were like there's 34 of them yeah 44 or whatever i don't know like you walk three blocks in this different accent yeah and i've heard that in italy um people have like such strong accents in north versus south that a lot of times they need transcendence or like at least like huh yeah what it's the same language and then sicilian too is like an actual different language that's funny so i was thinking about learning a different language i was like okay so i could learn italian and then still go to italy and people be like yeah what well that's like when uh i guess what they taught us in school too it was like so formal that like nobody in italy can understand it yeah so it was like when giacomo came and the other kids in italian if i tried to talk to him he's like i don't know what you're saying yeah nice countertop wouldn't it be look at all the lines you could pass the dirt test no yeah yeah not even close oh there's a big bubble there though it's getting bigger do you know anyone who would want to pop it no oh there we go that's a good sound you're putting more sugar in there yeah put all this sugar in that candy i don't think it's gonna be very healthy max don't tell anybody but this stuff is like almost all sugar i'm shocked that all this candy is made of sugar well not that shocked different types of sugar yeah we got our powdered sugar we got our syrup sugar got our water sugar technically invert all right we got right side up sugar upside down sugar we got dog sugar pate sugar cocktails and a little bit of tartar sauce cream of tartar sugar me and mac's always together we're making all kinds of sugar you guys got a sugar boat control the lieutenant dan onoga lake for sugar beds i like how he runs and jumps right off his boat still going right into the pier you turn it down you've got new legs that's one of my favorite movies it's fun to watch great one only we should watch it while youtube's video's gone i'd like to watch uh score scope one day and try to drink 23 dr peppers 23 dr peppers that's right he's like when i met jfk i drank 23 dr pepper you ever tried to drink a lot of soda no so does that really fit with me one time i i just had this goal for some stupid reason uh like i went i was uh hanging out with my friends we so we used to like go for a run and then we go to trappers and we got like pizza and stuff and then for whatever reason i had a stupid goal of having one cup of every fountain drink a whole cup yeah i don't know why no one asked me to do it i was like you know what i'm here to do it and uh you saw that fountain dispenser and you were like accepted and i didn't feel good say that before or after yeah yeah so don't try that at home kids don't try the fountain the fountain challenge did you ever do the one where uh you mix all the kinds of soda into one cup oh yeah that's good oh i wouldn't suggest that one either i would i guess it depends on the fountain yeah oh man they make me think i miss fruitopia almost ready now apple caramel a caramel apple caramel apple caramel apple pie and that's where we're going to talk about uh green apple caramel yeah but we'd have to get green apple flavoring this is great yeah i think that'd be good too i never thought we could use caramel i thought it wouldn't work but we tried it and it worked do you guys have to add anything because you guys usually have sugar in the peanut butter no no just uh just got to get it not too hot and not too you know not too hard just just enough so it uh flows a little bit yeah so it's more like a viscosity thing yeah yeah i don't know what the temperature is but you can tell just by looking at it it's good to use yeah and you guys just did the the one batch over there so far that was the first one you guys ever did with kevin first time we ever made it you can see the caramel in the color yeah so the the bottom is uh you guys didn't color that but uh yeah the brown is definitely it really comes through you can see it right max yeah sure why not look at him go is it nice just being able to throw half the batch yeah half is good it's about half as much as how much half is good sometimes less is more that's really running huh no i'm just fast no buddy you look slim oh fast he's been fasting oh that's what it was looks cinnamony yeah that's going i almost threatened to sprinkle cinnamon and or maybe got some cinnamon flavor some other time yeah we might do try sometime yeah cinnamon apple pie filled with caramel urban candy what else did we do chocolate cover it and then coat it in peanuts wow yikes it's starting to sound pretty good guys and then just break it all up yeah i like the way you think do all that work yeah break it up you tap it one more time okay thank you wait hold on oh there we go that's close wow this thing seems extra hot are those those flames look a little bit higher too they're bluer than normal i think they grew like three inches overnight they're extra flaming yeah that's probably what it is you've got a big slab on me you don't know that's what candy's made out of her sugar and meat meat all right we're gonna do a throwback here but do you remember the pilot episode of powerpuff girls power fuzzy girl kids the fuzzy little kids no fuzzy lumpkins was the bad guy place it fuzzy the fuzzy little kids in the first episode yeah you don't remember no he has a gun that turns everything into meat he turns like the whole the whole town into meat that's how he says it put it on later i'll culture you guys okay yep this cooled off to like just the right temperature so perfect five minutes might might actually work out pretty good all right oh the caramel made that weird noise did you hear that wow [Music] i'm telling you i just want to keep like a large melted pot of caramel in my room it smells so tasty you put it up so it's like yeah see like if you make like a little divot then it all kind of goes down okay so it's all right okay i'm getting too close to you don't worry max it'll be okay if it doesn't work out you can just blame him let's see i'd rather just have a batch that comes out it looks like peanut butter yeah yeah it totally does for those of you who don't know water it's basically candy glue so he's painting some candy glue on there okay don't get you got it on the canvas did i i wanted to be too easy on you ready ready and you guys don't want to get it on the canvas because then the candy glue becomes candy glue for the for the canvas yeah it does not be not as ideal as it sounds yeah it's a little sticky it's kind of like a turtle yeah doesn't it so it's cold spot there it's cracking maybe it's just a bubble yeah maybe it was just a bubble oh boy whoever gets this is a lucky duck that came out even better once it was all folded up [Music] [Music] it's real purdy you want some nachos dirty buddy there's the caramel [Applause] there it is with his hands yeah i try every time i don't know if you remember but uh like when you were trying one of the first couple of times i was like what's that do with your eyes closed and that's you know you can't see it so it's all by feel free now yeah it does smell really good in here it's oh man i i don't want to like tease you because i know you can't have it but seriously this i don't even like apple pies and viewers still don't have their television one of these days guys it tastes better than it smells about the higher a smaller vision uh well with printers they have uh was a black cyan yellow and magenta and you can make pretty much any color from that i wonder if maybe i'm completely off but i wonder if there's a way to do something like that with smells um but then it would have to be in like the editing program you'd have to program the smells or like you'd have to have like a smell sensor on the camera just to replicate it yeah well i guess at a certain point they could just be like like maybe like it's chemical components and then just recreate those but you'd need like some sort of like molecular building block or something you know yeah you'd need a way to dispense it from your computer or phone or whatever too remember just a nose on the computer like it smells just come out of it smells coming out of the nose looks like one of those hands like from the old cartoons what do you think that someday someday imagine all the new notes one day when you're 150 it's gonna be around all right only a couple more years you just won't die you're gonna have great great great grandkids steve you said you were gonna take over 50 years ago hopefully we'll have grandkids someday got great dogs yeah we've got two granddogs hopefully they'll have kids after this thing is over it's working tease them too i can't wait till you have this so that you know you can send them over to my house and i'll load them up with sugar and buy them a bunch of toys we'll tell we'll tell the grandkids about the eyes in the back of their heads we'll get a new grand prize if they don't behave don't call them on the phone grandparents did you move the heater because it was getting a little too cold yeah i just want to keep it warm i don't want to lose it or anything did it seem you're shivering yeah sure is nice and it's cozy here it's the middle of august it's getting pretty cold yeah yeah i mean we're in the northeast so you know chilly year round up here but now that it's been 90s all the time now next month will probably be uh freezing yeah the wind would pick up every february like the whole you know when i was going there now they have like you know an enclosed bridge but when i was going up there everybody had to walk across campus on like a bridge over a yeah in the middle of winter on top of the hill back in my day we had to go to class barefoot hill in the snow both ways and we were grateful a lot of time on that last one so see that caramel's still right in there give you the darker spot right there yeah since we can't have people over for christmas party i definitely do not feel very motivated to decorate for christmas or halloween your snowflakes were so great yeah i just got rid of my tree because i thought we were moving then when i'm done with i throw it out the front window yeah i wonder how the holidays are going to be with uh with all this like all right are there still going to be like christmas well i guess a lot of people have family and the kids and stuff whereas like it's just me and carol live in our apartment like all right i don't i don't really well we have a um everybody be doing it for our official artificial one huh everybody will be facetiming and doing all that i mean you still are i only know where we're going for thanksgiving well it's mom and dad's house unless you guys want to come over but i feel like you guys don't ever like doing that cleaning i don't want to leave my own house i just got comfortable it's really the first time i've seen this woman this year so trick you remember the show gargoyles yeah we were just talking about it the other day my mom got like all three seasons from the library yesterday are we really gonna watch this who's watching i don't know i don't know is she gonna watch them yeah maybe mom what are you doing watching cartoons gargoyles he's like from the 90s like what i grew up with yeah yeah right like you're like coming home watching me like watching teletubbies or something while while eating fun dip and gushers what kind of well yeah we did what uh what food did you guys have back then you don't have now or that was popular back then you remember not too long ago burgers they're all the same really except for uh saturday nights once in a while i have jippy pop you know what that is right like a type of popcorn yeah but it's in a salt they sell it in a little pan with a handle and you put it over the stove back and forth and it's aluminum and aluminum comes right up jiffy pop yeah yeah stuff like that it used to be a big treat to get soda once in a while on saturday nights now of course everybody has that every day but when it was a treat it was more fun yeah when we grew up we didn't have soda in the house ever no we didn't want you to have that yeah once in a great while yeah basically just a family party yeah that sounds familiar i remember drinking tons of juicy juice in the giant cans and you have to pop a hole on both sides i remember capricorn oh yeah those commercials with like the silver surfer type oh now i do you remember the garther's commercial yeah it freaked me out even when we were kids so you gotta start coming over here because you're kind of running out of space yeah yep three of these and two of those i guess we only had it because i asked for it yeah i remember i had fluffer and others when i was a kid yeah we're captain crunch yeah did you ever put it on the sandwich captain crunches did the test of time yeah he cut through your mouth up what cereal was popular way back when and it's still popular today the frosted flakes so tony the tiger yes rice krispies cheerios raisin bran a lot of the same ones yeah blueberry lucky charms oatmeal oatmeal you guys had oatmeal we had to go out in the backyard right next to the sliced bread sliced bread oh pre-sliced we're living in the future now i don't know if there's any more caramel in there the last two i kind of that kind of set to the side i'm like i don't know yeah it might not be any caramel there's a tiny string maybe is it going to come back later or something it looks like is that's why you're asking for help no [Applause] apple pie would you call me that was funny pie [Music] oh boy is that hard a little bit yeah i'd say like if you want to try it this is probably the safest piece there's definitely nothing to know i've had the the apple pie hard came for it's really good yeah like seriously it's one of our most accurate flavors yeah yeah i can imagine that caramel with it i know it doesn't hurt i know i don't want to tease but really that caramel it just blends together so good well we're going to need a taste test eventually our odd game this is a nice done here maybe this one have you guys tried this yet yes i had a piece did you have a piece gonna have to try um piece i'd be kind of irresponsible if you didn't and we can't have that i know i guess we're gonna have to stack it right there because there's no pace heavy filled though yeah pretty you guys just did what the peanut butter fluff filled yes peanut butter thank you where's the fan over there yeah the fan's a little challenging you have to burp the bag yep i'm trying to get it so the label doesn't fly away in between yeah pretty yeah that is nice it is pretty i'm gonna use that no there's only all right good work kids all right time for a taste test oh a big piece of a piece little piece well that's a real piece i would like a piece with caramel thank you i'll just eat this cheers i didn't get a piece of like real caramel on it earlier either very good i did was really good dad can you describe yours it was really good most delicious i was really surprised how good it was yeah it's awesome if people try this we're never gonna make enough that's all we're gonna be making it is very good yeah did you get a caramel on that piece together it was weird because first all i had was apple and then when you get to the center the caramel was there i was like oh yeah it's kind of a little bit like razzles you guys ever have those razzles um they start out i don't know if it starts out like gum and then it turns into candy or if it starts out like candy and it turns into gum but they're kind of like that like where the candy mixes into the caramel a little bit like you get to chew on it for a little bit and it's all sweet it is chewy it's much more chewy than our other rubbing candies it kind of reminds me of the powdered crust a little bit though yeah it's good but i love caramel i'm not even a big fan of apple pies and that's really tasty so it'd be like caramel or apple pie or both you're going to like it yes i'm still licking the caramel out of my teeth i know it is so sweet good job guys", "2cf3nqBzWLs": "Today is a video that introduces

Filling chocolate with various fillings If the filling is hardened, it will be completed by covering the chocolate on top like before.

be making some weed mac and cheese so for this episode we're gonna be needing another batch of Kennin milk the recipe for that is four cups of whole milk remember always hold one two three four okay and then two cups of sugar and cream which is equivalent to this and finally a quarter ounce of marijuana nice so just like the milkshake episode we're going to fill this up about halfway with water and then we're gonna put it on our stovetop [Music] fresh you know bombs aren't just good for smoking they also make a lovely Vaz I'm just gonna pick a few of my favorites and it also has a perfect spout to water them", "0DR3s3E1VwM": "first pass of the day first batch this morning what is tiny bit more look at that you'll be a professional one day you gotta just think in this turn you know yeah they're just having had the bigger bag I don't know why but you take sugar sugar right [Music] fewer forgotten ahead that no don't think so it's just a habit so i'ma start today I've never really looked it up to see exactly the properties of it to what it really knows what my father and my uncle's always said it was just to stop cracking it's for the hood if this for the sort of cheese a fan on the go outside Karen which I get other people yeah most smell outside like you when you said you were a kid becoming on getting off the bus right yeah I'd smell the candy and you knew what we were doing hey I can smell on the park console packs the old days was following the publication small not yeah [Music] [Music] regular [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so every lemonade was going to be the first batch but I I messed up with it like that because I didn't do that all right with them we're supposed to be 24 Compaq for you - 21 are you it's just because you most of the time to do 21 pounds yeah I'm just not to have it I put it together and that was that yeah yeah I realized later worse things have happened to it oh yeah like what crack mean one so for this condom good part that's the other day you guys burned that didn't happen so we're gonna just pour half yep that's good you'll have to scrape the kettle yellow they might want to get the last chick a mini letter then we're gonna add strawberry in the kettle some actually go ahead and do the lemon oh no I've got one 3/4 I believe you you crunched the numbers I wrote down what was she putting they're pretty stronger remember we just did this driver this one oh wait you did write it down yeah you said to take point here two and three quarters it's one of the worst it's I got it written down I'm telling you three quarters it's two or three quarters for lemonade one three quarters for card remember we were just talking about how strawberry gets three shots here double batch and lemonade gets the five shots yep that makes sense next doesn't think this he'll be very awkward but he does I'm just his heels they were dug in okay okay I guess worst-case scenario just isn't growing strawberry well do you put too much strawberry and it takes chemically don't want that this good I just want to make sure it was like a compass it's so cool over there if you like it does smell a little bit chemically but also like Captain Crunch and over here there's no men women hands huh well just look lemon oh my god yeah this smokes just like oh yeah it calls just like hold yeah well it was calling off a little bit you want to stay in there bring it back to the basement we have to pour this bench Craig yeah so you need me recycling me out right here okay let's not burn that to you it's so annoyed so I was thinking some crazy candy related thoughts I mean some off-the-hook stuff I'm almost afraid to say it but I miss it because I forget it but don't forget it I'll remind me know the savour would know nothing not to see every line of every candy I was thinking of what if we put something crunchy and like what if we got crushed up Oreos and added into peanut butter peanut butter full mandatory all just murdered us for reals yeah and peanut butter and then maybe a free chocolate cover yes yeah so I have an idea that I am pretty certain would work be and I know that because one of our viewers actually did it and sent us pictures and it came out really great they did caramel filled ribbon candy well we totally want to do that don't try that our example yeah they didn't yeah well we had apple pie so should we do that which go for our plans the summary only it's a public experiment but SMERSH Mona seems to change this all up yeah it's over I'd still like to try that out because I'm gonna be me but yeah that would be pretty cool but then I had another one we're talking about I came here what flavor ribbon candy we were talking about the other day Cara was there she's saying well what could we fill that flavor with cuz you don't feel things with they ask you how you are you just have to say that you're fine when you're not really fine but you just can't get into it marshmallow fluff chocolate I was thinking what if we took actual cream max actually cream some crushed Oreos in the back into cream request Orioles in the cream and then we put that in urban candy justic Crisco and confectioner sugar make our own Oriole fill and fill it with that we could make like oh my god because we could take the the chocolate liqueur uh-huh like a chocolate flavored ribbon candy and then really ribbon we did anyways yeah and then just fill it with Oreo filling oh okay if you put it in just cream I think that they would get like Siamese huh I really like well I was also thinking wouldn't it be interesting if we crushed Oreo into creamy feta green Oreo cream green I'm talking to treatment we make for our starters I know crazy but I think yeah I'm saying just take some cream you've you know and you'll drop it don't don't starts facets that in the middle of ribbon candy and then you can have a flavor whether it be Oreo or whatever that you're like fruit flavored oils we could do anything if we did if we put out your ice cream oh we have people are want maple maple pecan and there's my crunches I just asked for fresh pecan and oh wait crushed up Oreos to cover the whole thing okay yes Oh ain't you glad well if you wanna you can make him 24 cuz the watermelon all the watermelon we need maybe should make it 24 we I mean we need so much watermelon orange you glad this is probably so wait you something take it down put in the hook yeah oh yeah you see that's way too soft it's just sticking to the table so let's talk about strawberry lemon-aid so I don't know if you picked up all that wasn't we flavored lemonade this one we played strawberry I was dropping here no we figured instead it's like pouring both in there we thought we'd keep himself at the trial that's how that worked out and we we might get some point inside football flavors in one pedal and see how that works so today is May 30 and this strawberry lemonade is going into our fruit and friendly bash but by the time you guys see this video I'm friendly badger probably sold out yeah and the strawberry lemonade assuming it tastes good cuz this is an experiment we're just trying it out but hey let me taste great Oh strawberry tastes great alone why would the taste great together me so that time you see this video we'll probably be doing separate flavors women in is a separate flavor to buy as a standalone flavor yeah because we we just tried that out with watermelon and put that video up one yesterday can't start out with 120 bags of it it's gone and that's where we're making more today kind of on the fly we're gonna make another 48 pockets today but there's just so much to candy makers can do out yeah they're giant they're trying valiantly but it's kind of like trying to push a boulder a really big one up a hill and sometimes it rolls back with crushes this is what Mitch fossil wants to make up strawberry-banana hmm right I think we should do a bunch of bananas in a bag blueberry banana mmm banana Irish cream Oh banana anise banana peanut butter banana peanut butter would be killer good the Elvis heart candy you certainly feel tired just watch me yes I mean do you wish you were me I'm not tired I just thought the water table should be much more bringing it over warm seems like a good idea until you realize that like you can't trap the air in felt school that just means that you're no longer just doing this for fun just do more work for longer yep yeah your mom kicked in my side you see I like its second form the strands in it and stuff like that's usually like you know when it's super cold it's not it's very pretty quick get that nice silvery look though that'll be cool yeah if you pull it can you call it too much like was it was like I'm a lot of it way more because it kind of stopped oh no it'll it'll keep trying Baltimore white yeah yeah we've never thrown into like it like right now on rough you just saw but like it just got a lot paler yeah kind of go on for that like silvery can I make it a hammer please hammered telling the cameras that's a beautiful collar hey how did you do this it actually feels fluffy hey I think you pulled it you really did this is puffy feeling are you calling me yelling Oh yellow yellow belly how'd you make all right we talked about like the Old Yeller esque movies like what was up with that what you're like let's make kids really sad Shiloh Old Yeller what's the other one Bambi there's that one between two ferns do you remember occur between red fern where the red friends grow that's what I never saw it though wait what the book yes I've never seen that car hmm yeah classic motif boy s dog boy doesn't have dogs yeah the brave doesn't have

one this color here this light right here there's a little bit larger there you go do it do it you well yeah this one's really soft a college dealer plates I can tell this is 24 pounds I didn't realize he was gonna be together the old days we've done this before but we put him back to the back what flavors we gotta do that way to do two flavors in one yeah [Music] I guess Lord or twenty pound batches pete'll it would it would save us a whole 45 minutes of cook time you know what is it your arm zone would you be able to pull it oh you'd pull it in two different two halves you know they'd be two separate flavors I mean one flavour ran into the next warm funny this way we used to do it to save time especially if you're doing half batches you don't want to cook up like 10 pounds of time does Oh I forgot to bring moving or [Applause] yeah I saw that because they're talking about you have a second favorite SNL star you know first or second favorite you have the ranking in your head I mean Will Ferrell's probably but I really like John Belushi is Santa present shiny all right so what do we have to do for the water bug and we're going to throw the green is that what we did

down they said why not cut the cake machine then turn it down that way you don't have to chomp it three times well if you just put it in there just do boys once the front it the second time to chop you know wouldn't be any faster anyways you have to wait until max both ways we do it three times just goes like we have it's such a wide base so we can fit three ropes on it so we just try to fit as many as we can so that we're not wasting time walking back and forth there's no Sun strength so you should have been say you got to me so it is a little difficult to tons you usually get down on your feet yeah what can you got the ham coming wow you won the unlucky lotto thanks thank you guys I guess I won't go buy a lotto ticket lose money what that happens the wood for you yeah very happy to

white chocolate baking pieces add to that 1/2 cup of apple pie filling and when you're selecting it out of the can try to get more apples than filling and I cut up the apples into smaller pieces just to make it better for mixing set that aside and in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat place three quarters of a cup of unsalted butter three cups of white sugar add to that one cup of heavy whipping cream 1/2 a teaspoon of nutmeg 1/2 a teaspoon of allspice and one teaspoon of cinnamon and a dash of salt now you're gonna cook this over medium-high heat continuously stirring until it starts to boil once it starts to boil cook and stir for an additional four minutes when the four minutes is up pour this mixture over top of the white chocolate chips and that apple pie filling if you're using a stand mixer you can attach the whisk attachment and then beat this on medium speed for about two or three minutes until all of that white chocolate is nicely melted and it's nice and smooth and don't forget to scrape down the sides of the bowl and to go to the bottom of the bowl to make sure all those white chocolate chips are melted pour the fudge mixture into it prepared 8x8 8-inch square baking dish that's been greased I lined mine with some aluminum foil that's been greased and then put this in the refrigerator and allow it to set in harden three or four hours or overnight now you can garnish these pieces of fudge using some dried apple or in this case I'm using some cinnamon snap cookies this fudge is delicious it has a great apple pie flavor and it is a very

awesome", "cFUOlgxWUyo": "what's going on my peeps welcome back to a brand new BuzzFeed test now this one has come very highly requested by all of you people thank you for those and it's not like I've been putting it off or ignoring it I've just had it in the schedule try to get some structure in this hectic month and we still got three weeks left so it won't be over anytime soon but today we're gonna be trying out the caramel apple rose tart pie what do you call this thing I don't know and let's be honest all of us here have been around long enough to know that this little 3 second clip of them layering all the apples like this so perfectly ain't gonna be that quick so let's timidly jump right into this one [Music] before we begin quick shoutouts to my beautiful grandma for letting me use her kitchen and get it all filthy and gross mine was just in shambles the other day so thank you I love you but let us begin now unlike in tastiest video I am gonna make some homemade pie crust and I'm gonna use the very same recipe from Katy Perry's cherry pie cuz that thing came out amazing I started with two and a half cups of unbleached flour I then took two and a half sticks of unsalted butter and chopped them up into cubes again I know this is a ton of butter but that's really the only two or three ingredients in this pie crust so we kind of crumpled that together and I learned the last time that you want to actually keep your butter pretty cold during this process because on top of this you're gonna add in some ice-cold water apparently this will allow some of that butter to remain intact until it bakes and it allows that crust to become flaky I don't know that's just what I've been told so moving right along I took that giant mass of dough I kind of rolled it out onto the counter and kneaded it a bit separated it into two halves rolled both of those out of it let them together wrap that whole thing in plastic wrap and you have to let this set in the fridge for at least thirty minutes we cannot begin to work on the star of the show our apples I had a variety of different ones I think one of them was Honey Crisp Golden Delicious and Fiji I had a few different ones and I peeled them up with this nifty contraption I guess only grandma things and once those were all peeled I chopped them up and tried to make some even slices with these I'm not sure exactly how thin to go on these I kind of just made a guess but I did try to get them all to the same size so they cooked at the same length of time so I just tossed those all into a bowl and set it off to the side for now and worked on my sugar mix that is going to coat all of these apples 1/2 cup of white sugar 1/2 cup of light brown sugar 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and then 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg pretty simple stuff sprinkle that over top of all your apples give them a nice thorough toss and you want to let these sit and sweat out those juices for again another 30 minutes now while I let those apples rest I grab my dough back out of the fridge and gave it a few minutes at room temperature so it's a little bit easier to work with and then started to roll it out nice and thin tried it too very carefully roll it off of the counter and then flip it on to my cast iron sorry if you couldn't see that it was a little bit difficult maneuvering here unfortunately clearly I cut off too much of the dough so I had to cut and roll a whole new piece and stick it in that empty space there and once I kind of mashed the two together it looked like this might work so I then just took a fork and stuck a bunch of holes in the bottom of this I still just to this day don't know what this is for so if you know let me know in the comments but now we can begin to shovel out our apples out of that juice you can see how much liquid came out of these things and slowly one by one throw in our apple slices into this massive cast-iron skillet now you can see what I was talking about this is gonna take me all day and side note I had to skin and slice up two additional apples for this so I think I use seven in total so once I filled up the entire pie crust with our apples you want to cover it with some tinfoil throw it into your oven for 30 minutes at 375 then you want to take your foil off and leave it in at the same temperature for another 10 minutes and while that's finishing up on our stovetop you want to dump in your juice from your apples let that reduce by about half and then add in a quarter cup of heavy cream I think I might have added this in a bit too early that did seem a bit too liquidy when I did that unfortunately but I let it reduce a bit more and I'm hoping that when it sets and cools down it'll thicken up a bit but we'll see so I took our pie out of the oven and I'm not too mad at how this is looking shockingly Oh the Apple stayed in their places and kind of held that rose form so once it cooled down I just drizzled my caramel over top and I tried to cut a piece I think this was still too hot because this was very difficult but I eventually got one so let's give it a taste [Applause] that's good now this is actually a whole new piece that I just cut from the one I just showed you on camera that's why it's still intact so wealth the apples actually seemed really well coached which is crucial in a proper apple pie cheers boys and girls in celebration of the fall oh my gosh the app will still do hold a bit of a crunch so if you like really soft mushy apples you probably leave in the oven for a bit longer but the taste is phenomenal I will say that and some of the parts that it has a lot of the caramel on it it's a bit on the sweet side but overall I'm very happy with this and I have very high expectations for apple pies as my lovely grandmas who I just left makes very good ones so highly highly recommend this if any of you guys just went apple picking and you gotta find something to do with them I'm giving this a very solid 9 out of 10 hope you guys enjoyed this week's BuzzFeed test if you did leave me a like on it I would really appreciate it I'm gonna warn you all now there's a very slim chance but it might be possible that I can't get a video out on Monday if it doesn't happen I'm very sorry just know that I'm trying I'm trying really hard further than that follow me on Twitter Instagram have an awesome weekend and I hope to see you", "nZ3cZsK95A8": "[Music] what's up y'all my name is barbara atway welcome back to my channel so today's video we are making the copycat caramel apple pie apples from rocky mountain chocolate factory please be sure to like comment share and subscribe and let's get started [Music] all right so to begin all of the ingredients and tools you'll need for this recipe will be listed down below in the description box so be sure to check that out right now we are just thoroughly washing our granny smith apples and wiping them down to making sure that they're completely dry um backstory i love these apple pie apples from rocky mountain chocolate factory they are my absolute faves every single time i go to the mall doesn't matter if it's a failed shopping trip or a successful one i always make sure i stop by and grab apple pie apple thinking about it now the amount of money i've spent on it low-key ridiculous because every apple is like 10.55 with tax included and like girl you really didn't be spending all that money when it's really that easy to make at home so we are going to do it today so i am removing all the stems from the apples because you don't really need them and then i'm going to take my um bamboo skewers or like any like use a popsicle stick if you want whatever you have on hand and we're just going to make sure that is firmly placed into the center of the apple and then we are going to place them in the freezer while we prepare our caramel [Music] now on to the caramel we have our butter in our pot now we're just going to let that melt down for a little bit swirl it all around make sure it gets all over the pot and everything this is actually my first time making caramel ever usually i just use like caramel syrup and stuff but you know i thought it shouldn't be that hard and i want to make like a salted caramel so just like a little bit of sweet and salty and like a little bit of tartness from the granny smith apple but anyways as you can see i added my brown sugar and then i also added my milk and we're just going to break down the brown sugar and making sure that the butter is everything is all incorporated together you don't want any lumps or anything because you want everything to be a smooth consistency okay [Music] so we're going to let it reach a boil and when it does we're just going to let it boil for about one to two minutes so that it starts to thicken and the consistency is like a like um i don't know how to explain like a thick syrup you don't want it runny at all because you want it to be able to stick to the apples so um i'm also stirring it as it's boiling because i don't want it to burn at the bottom [Music] and when we remove it from the heat we're gonna add our vanilla extract and a little pinch of salt for that salted caramel taste [Music] and you want to make sure that it cools because i have watched too many episodes of chopped and too many episodes of cake wars where people dip their finger and it's basically burnt off ain't nobody got time for that so you just want to make sure it cools to wake um to when it reaches that thick consistency and now you just want to grab a plate put some parchment paper on top of it and we are going to dip our apples our apples have been freezing in the freezer for like a couple of minutes now so it's as you can see the caramel is immediately sticking to the apple okay um grab a spoon and just make sure that there's like an even spread all over the apple making sure it's getting all over and then you want to scrape off the bottom so that it doesn't pool when you put it on the parchment paper for it to set [Music] [Music] never had a hot dog little  mayonnaise [Music] bye [Music] all right so now we are making our cinnamon sugar topping on it or whatever so i'm pouring my white sugar and my brown sugar into a bowl and then i'm going to add my cinnamon and we are just going to make sure everything is blended together very simple not too much work um just whisk it up all together so there's like an even consistency and there's not like huge chunks as you can see so we're just gonna break that down until everything is even [Music] and now we are going to switch out our bowls because we now have to melt our white chocolate as the caramel apples are setting okay so i'm just going to be using my hershey's chippets pure white chocolate chips i used about one and a half bags and i just put put it in a glass bowl you don't want to put it in a plastic bowl or else it's going to melt and i mean it's going to like burn and it's going to curdle and then your chocolate is going to taste disgusting okay so put make sure it's in a glass bowl pop it in the microwave um i put it in the microwave for about a minute 30 but every 30 i mean every 30 seconds i mean i was taking it out and then stirring it so that's how i reached the consistency as you can see right here so now it is time to dip our apples and prepare them so great okay so as you can see i brought the caramel apples out of the freezer we are going to dip them straight into the white chocolate again this was actually kind of hard to be honest with you because i didn't want to make i didn't want to melt too much white chocolate to where like i had like a waist um but i didn't want to make too little and i think because of the bowl size i wasn't able to like really like work it in but um as you can see i had to like grab a fork and just make sure that it was spread all across the apple um just to make sure that the cinnamon sugar would stick and um i had to add extra uh skewers so it would hold because the apple started to get a little bit heavy and i felt the stick starting to like get a little wonky okay so um i'm grabbing my um cinnamon sugar with a spoon and just sprinkling it on but also rolling it you could do either or if you don't want too much on the um surface of your apple um sprinkling it is a good option if you want a lot of cinnamon sugar i guess rolling it is the better option because it's pressing against the chocolate to where it will hold okay so we are just going to continue doing that for the rest of the apples and then we're going to place them in the freezer to for them to set for at least 5 to 10 minutes just to make sure that nothing is falling apart [Music] okay [Music] so after our apples have set in the freezer for about five to ten minutes here it is it's not as smooth as you you know the stores have it but it's homemade and that's the best part okay so we are going to slice it open as you can see everything is held together everything is set it looks beautiful and it tastes even better um i don't bite into my apples i cannot do that girl i got sensitive teeth um so as you can see um i am slicing it up and removing the core just to make sure that i could just like pop them in my mouth and then um this is the final look i really hope you guys enjoyed this video it tastes so good and it's so easy to make bang for your buck instead of paying that 10 55 every single time i've been going to the mall but you know look at it get into the styling though like i really did that i really did that but i really hope you guys enjoyed this video make sure to like comment share and subscribe and i will see you guys next time okay bye [Music]", "Tm2FamhmPIY": "Welcome to how to cook that\nI am Ann Reardon There have been lots of requests for an easy\ndessert recipe so this week I am going to show you how to make three quick and easy\napple desserts. Firstly the apple pie with a great shortcrust\npastry which is probably the most complicated out of all of them even though it is still\na simple dessert followed by super quick apple turnovers which are great if you've got lots\nof people coming over at the last minute and then finally a gluten free apple crumble recipe. To start with for all three desserts we need\nto turn on the oven and then prepare the apples. You can either use tinned pie apple which\nhas nothing but apple in it and a tiny bit of salt or you can use fresh apple. If going with fresh then you need to wash\nthem and peel them. There is not right or wrong way to peel an\napple just as long as you get all the peel off that's fine. Once they are peeled core them and slice them. I have this really handy apple cutter which\nI like to use for this job it cores and slices them all in one time which speeds up the process. You can of course slice them using a knife\nand then cut the core part off each piece. Place the apple slices into a saucepan with\na tablespoon of water then put the lid on and cook over medium high heat for about 5\nminutes until it is hot and bubbling then you can turn the heat off and leave the lid\non and just leave it to sit there while you get you pastry ready. To make our pastry for the pie you will need\nbutter flour sugar and one egg and a little bit of milk. All of the recipe quantities are written on\nthe website howtocookthat.net there is a link to the recipe in the description just below\nthis video. Put your flour and your butter into a bowl\nand then use a knife to slice the butter into smaller pieces. Then rub the butter into the flour using your\nfingertips. So you are basically just squashing it between\nyour thumb and your fingers and rubbing as you go. But making sure you get some flour in there\nwhen you are doing it you don't just want to be squashing the butter you want to be\nsquashing it into the flour. Continue to do that for a few minutes until\nyour mixture looks like this, there should be no big lumps of butter in there anywhere\nit should look like fine breadcrumbs. Add your sugar and mix it through well. In a seperate bowl put a little milk and your\negg and whisk them together with a fork. Then pour it into the flour mixture and stir\nit with a spoon until it is roughly together and then use your hands to squash it together\nmore and knead it until you have a smooth ball of pastry. At this point you should wrap your pastry\nand put it in the fridge and leave it to rest for half an hour and that makes it easier\nto roll out, but because we are doing quick desserts we are going to go ahead and roll\nit straight away. Put it on some baking paper on your bench\ntop and roll out your pastry until it is reasonably thin and big enough to cover the whole base\nof your pie dish plus a bit more because we've got our pastry for the lid there as well. Then pick up your pastry and flip it over\non the paper and then carefully place it over the dish. Peel off the baking paper and then going around\nthe edges lift and lower the pastry, pushing it into the corners and making sure there\nis no air bubbles trapped underneath your pastry. Then using a knife trim off the excess making\nsure your knife is leaning backwards so that the pastry is still over the rim of the dish\nso there is something for our lid to join onto. Add you apples , Add you apples, I make my pies nice and full,\nthese apples will drop down a bit when they cook so if you start with a pie that has apples\nthat are flat then you will have a sunken top once it is baked in the oven. Sprinkle a little sugar and cinnamon on top. If you like you pie really sweet then you\ncan add more sugar and cinnamon to your apples before you put them in the pie and mix it\nthrough but because the pastry for this pie has some sugar in it I don't think the filling\nneeds to be really sweet. Roll out the rest of your pastry and check\nthat it is big enough by holding the dish over the top of the pastry. Flip the pastry over and peel off the baking\npaper just like we did before. Then using a knife to cut off the excess pastry\nagain leaning the knife outwards so you are leaving some pastry on the rim of the dish. You can leave it plain just like that or use\nyour thumb and your finger to pinch a pattern all the way around the edge of your pie. Take your knife and stab the top of the pie\na few times so there is space for the steam to escape. This stops you from getting a huge air bubble\nat the top of your pie. Place it in the oven and let it bake until\nit is crisp, golden brown and ready to eat. This will take about 30 minutes. And you have a beautiful pie stuffed full\nor apples. Dessert number 2 is super quick apple turnovers. Using some store bought puff pastry sheets\nand tinned apple add some cinnamon and sugar to the apple and stir through. Now this puff pastry that I am using is not\nsweet and that is why we are sweetening the apples to compensate for that. Cut your pastry sheet into quarters cutting\ndiagonally across the middle. Spoon on some your apple and then fold the\npastry in half pressing on the edges to seal it shut. From last weeks video there was a lot of requests\nfor me to do a draw my life in video, for those of you who are new to how to cook that\nthere is a draw my life in chocolate video on the channel so if you go to how to cook\nthat click on how to cook that and go to the chocolate playlist you'll find it there. Place your apple turnovers onto a baking tray\nand then take a fork and press down along the two joined edges to fuse the two pastry\nsheets together. Bake them in the oven until they are hot and\nyour puff pastry is crispy and golden. Serve them immediately and you can add ice\ncream or whipped cream or custard to those. If you've got a favourite dessert recipe that\nyou like to make when people are coming over and it's a last minute thing put the name\nof it in the comments below so everyone can get heaps of ideas of what else they can do\nwhen they are in a hurry. For our third dessert we are going to make\na gluten free apple crumble. Use some almond meal or almond flour and rub\nsome butter into the almond meal. You could use gluten free flour but I just\nfind in the crumble dessert it's a bit pasty on the top of your mouth when you eat it so\nI like to use almond meal in the crumble instead. Now gluten is just the protein in wheat and\npeople who have coeliac disease or gluten intolerance can't have any gluten in their\ndiet so they cant have any wheat at all so we are making this one gluten free. If you do not need it to be to be gluten free\nthen you can use all purpose flour for this recipe instead. Mix in your sugar. Then spoon some apple into your bowl,you can\nmake one large crumble or you can use smaller bowls and make individual serves. Top with a generous sprinkle of crumble mixture. Bake until the apple is hot and the crumble\nis golden and crunchy. Add some ice cream or some whipped cream and\nenjoy.

first recipe we're doing a dessert we're going to do a sugar cookie cream cheese cheesecake bars with an apple pie filling on top so i'm going to talk about the ingredients and what i'm using so the first ingredient we have we're gonna do apples i have three granny smith apples that i'm gonna use as well as one egg one carton of cream cheese we're gonna do cinnamon and vanilla and i have all-purpose flour and sugar right here so we're going to get into cutting the apples dicing them up i'm going to put them on the skillet with some cinnamon and sugar and kind of let those cook for about five minutes [Music] okay so next i have my apples in this bowl i'm gonna go ahead and preheat the oven to 350 but i'm going to put these on the skillet with one tablespoon of sugar and some some minutes some cinnamon and i'm gonna mix it together and then put it on the skillet [Music] so i am putting the cinnamon sugar apples into the skillet i'm gonna brown these for about four to five minutes until they're crispy and they almost look like an apple pie filling and then i'm gonna let these cool for 10 minutes before i layer them on top of the cheesecake mixture that i put on top of my sugar cookie dough crust so while my apples are cooking i'm going to take an 8x8 pan and i'm going to line it with foil so it's going to look a little something like this so i totally forgot to talk about this in the beginning but you need a roll of the pillsbury sugar cookie roll this is going to be going at the bottom of the dessert so it's almost going to be like the crust but you're going to want to save half of it for the end so what i'm doing here is i'm just taking my pillsbury cookie dough from the roll that i got at any local grocery store and i'm mixing it with like a tablespoon of cinnamon and i'm just kneading it together until the cinnamon is evened out and then i'm gonna put this at the bottom of my foiled pan and in the next slide you'll kind of see how that looks so next with a mixer that you have you're going to add your whole package of cream cheese [Music] next you're going to add a tablespoon of vanilla you're going to add a tablespoon of flour you're going gonna add a half a cup of sugar you're gonna add an extra two tablespoons of sugar [Music] and lastly you're gonna add one egg [Music] you may have to scrape down the sides if you have a kitchenaid mixer so it should look like that super creamy fit and it should just look like a cheesecake next you're gonna pour your cheesecake batter over the sugar cookie dough with the cinnamon so next you're going to take your apples that you cooled for about 10 minutes and put them on top and then for the best part you're gonna sprinkle the rest of the cookie dough on it in little chunks so i'm gonna stick this in the oven for about 40 to 45 minutes and then check on it and what you see here is the final result i cut them into bars you don't have to cut them into bars if you don't want to i just kind of like to pick them up and eat them the sugar cookie on top just really baked well in the oven i'm really glad that i added some vanilla to the cheesecake mixture that's normally what i do when i add cheesecake so i did that i got a little hint of vanilla in there which was tasted so amazing um if you want the full recipe it's going to be down below i got it from the pillsbury website and i actually found it first from a girl on tick tock that i follow i will link her tick tock username down below she makes amazing recipes i found that recipe and then i looked online and i

um but it was the first time that we had all five of our children home for for the thanksgiving all five of our children yes we have grandchildren and yes we see them every year but i don't get to see uh all five of my kids together in one spot because one lives in west texas one was living in california and then of course three here in east texas where i live so it was just the best blessing to have our all five of our kids home have our grandchildren we were missing three grandbabies or it would have been perfect absolutely perfect but my husband's birthday was this weekend as well so you

sold out but this weekend i opened my mailbox and there was one in there for me and i was so thrilled so i left everything in the box minus one item which i'm gonna show you and i thought oh thank you miss sharon i miss you sweet carol um i thought i would just show you what's in the box okay so here we go and by the way i'm using this new light ring that i got it sits on this desk that i have in the kitchen now instead of my baker's rack and uh so it's it's right here and it has a little clip and i stuck my phone in it and i i hope it looks good and sounds good and does that you know i'm always trying to improve things but so let's get down to the unboxing if i had glitter i'd blow it all over the place so the first thing that i noticed in the box was this lovely wonderful coffee mug and it just says stay warm and chow on it is i've been using it all weekend ever since i got it i'm like oh i just love it so much i've been using my raydon mugs for like a year now and i still love them but i just think it's so pretty and so unique and my husband has one that's white with the uh little black dots on it a little black ram so i kind of feel like we're kind of unified in our coffee cups now it is a great cup isn't it okay so let's get on to what's in the box i'm gonna hold the box up because there's something special in here that i want you guys to see i have not found it on their website but only one spot and i'm sure that sometime today they will be putting this up on their websites for so for anybody who is loving keto chao y'all i put some links up you i just posted so be ready i know one place you can get this right now but the individual's nuts not yet i can't find them so in the box for my bundle i had this wonderful mug then s'mores lemon meringue pumpkin spice caramel a chocolate mint chocolate i want to make sure that i don't get down to it okay egg dog how festive is this y'all oh there it is there it is oh let me get let me get down to these here i'm gonna still do this another lemon meringue a pistachio a wonderful set of the uh electrolyte drops the fasting drops and the magnesium drops but isn't that adorable that'd be an awesome little re-gift wouldn't it all right so there's that all bundled up and cute then i'm not i'm not getting down to that right yet i'm gonna give it just a second so this was really cool i wish i had one of those little books that you could put things in but they started doing these wonderful look at this recipe cards love it you know i love cooking with the keto chow i mean they're wonderful meal replacement shakes and all but i adore uh making things with their products because it just makes everything so easy and delicious so this is chocolate peppermint fudge the recipe is on the back then there is the ultimate pumpkin spice cheesecake card camp out s'mores no bake cupcakes lemon bars i wish they'd put one of my recipes up on these that'd be cool mint chocolate soft fudge oh i'm gonna save this last one pistachio bars with cream cheese frosting it's kind of weird looking but i'd give it a try uh keto eggnog loaf another one i i don't know about that one there's one more recipe card but it goes with their newest flavor that they are releasing today today today today and it is apple pie i know i i get i get so excited about things right like y'all just like oh is that that was that was it do you love apple pie if you love apple pie then go ahead and give me some hearts and some likes if you love apple pie because i adore it adore it and i have not tried it i'm fixing to try it for y'all to let you know how it tastes if you'd like me to try it show me those thumbs up and we can make it up i might have to get up and move around in my kitchen and all but you know dab i knew you were gonna lose your mind i knew she was going to be like oh my god [Laughter] pam says i must be the only person that doesn't like keto chow and lost a little bottle of electrolytes hey i have the big bottle of electrolytes and i always carry that little bottle in my purse and just refill it it's so convenient and i really and then i have their daily minerals as well so they taste terrible i think it was tracy greece who said i i'm really curious about them but i was worried about the taste they taste disgusting now i'm not gonna lie about that you all know how i am i don't like it but it's good for me and it does help it helps keep me balanced especially especially for me in the summertime once i you know i i'll drink water drink water drink water but i'll sweat sweat sweats wet sweat and then i just my electrolytes drop right out those help immensely better than any of the other stuff that i've done okay so that that is to me the thrill is this new flavor of the apple pie keto chap here's my thought process i only have two so what do i do i make one in a shake so that we can try it and taste it and i'm already thinking apple pie pancakes to me that sounds delicious they've got these uh what they've got already apple pie spice snickerdoodles they've got a recipe card in there for that kayla muscle cramps are killing me up your magnesium girl i'm gonna tell you right now up that magnesium keep going if you get too much magnesium it can't hurt you you'll just poop which hey everybody loves pooping right but find that level and bring it up up up until you're in that place where your muscle cramps go away and then you go to the bathroom then i stay next day just quite regularly nice you know a little poopy conversation there for you um but that's what it is most of us sodium salt you don't think about it but you know salt your stuff all day long um eat foods that are rich in potassium you know avocados are more have more potassium in them than a banana does your spinach has potassium certain fish is high in potassium i think it's cod um spinach god there's one more thing i was going to say that's really nice and high in potassium use your electrolyte drops so i i find that magnesium is my culprit if i get enough i don't get the muscle cramps and it took me a while to realize i'm 600 milligrams every day without fail every night i put them right on my uh end table my nightstand in my bedroom it is the one thing i've been more consistent about than any other supplement i've ever taken is every single night before i go to bed i take three magnesium glycinates go to sleep and i don't get as many as i used to i've always had problems with it but i don't get as many as i used to all right so yeah i'm thinking apple pie pancakes um this one i'll have to do a cooking thing and when i do cooking i'll probably do that on youtube so this one we can try i'm sure excited so here's the thing yes avocados lillian are super high in potassium as well as mushrooms there we go that was what i was gonna say mushrooms are really high in potassium so uh as a matter of fact speaking of mushrooms i am doing some uh video today for youtube and i'm doing mushrooms i'm doing mushrooms three ways i'm going to be making stuffed mushrooms because that's what i want for dinner tonight [Laughter] and then i'm gonna do um uh uh just i don't know i've got two big portabellas and then i've got a whole thing of portobellos the smaller ones in my fridge gotta use them might as well cook might as well do something i mean it was a long last couple of weeks in november but it is december 1st and we have got to get busy again right y'all said you missed me well not all of you but some of you missed me so we'll we'll get busy with some things today all right so i'm going to get up and i'm going to let's see should we use butter okay so when you're using keto chow if you're not familiar with it i will tell you quickly what you want to do is i find it's easier to have a shaker cup you don't have to have the keto chow want any shaker cup will do if you don't you can use a blender or any shaker method you want but i do like to do that and so uh you get to adjust the amount of fat that you want to use for your needs when you do this i like to use about two tablespoons two tablespoons of fat and if i use butter it's 22 grams of fat okay um if i use avocado oil or olive oil or something like that then that's 28 grams of fat for two tablespoons but according to the package you know they've got it all the way up to like a half a cup of cream which that's just too much for my marsh cream it's just too much for me um and then i've got a quarter cup of avocado oil so i mean that you could really up your fat if you're needing to um i was talking to my daughter elizabeth she's like okay i'm all about my keto now i'm back on it dog on it and uh she's really for the she said for the first time all this time she's been doing keto it's like i really never knew what my fat looked like so she laid out her fat for the day 123 grams worth she's like oh god she because i was not eating anywhere close to it and it was a good good thing that she mentioned that because i was like you know sometimes you don't realize what that amount of fat looks like so you know if you need 100 grams of fat think about it a stick of butter is 88 grams so you still need more than a stick of butter in your body i mean you can use bacon fat you can use avocado oil you can mix it all up but think about your avocado slices so by just thinking a stick of butter plus some avocados plus maybe some bacon plus maybe a fatty cut of meat or some ground beef or something like that easily you can hit a hundred grams of fat a day so let's do this i'm gonna i can't move this uh camera okay it's sitting on my desk it's plugged in and the cord and all that stuff so i i really can't so you're just gonna see me moving around in the kitchen real quick um and let's try this out all right i should have i could have shoulda woulda you know me dang it i'm real so and and i'm self-conscious i'm going to tell y'all i've got a thing going no i'm not saying that here i go i'm going to put 14 ounces of water in here and then i'm going to grab some avocado oil because i don't want to use my microwave so i'm just going to grab a couple of tablespoons of fat and i'm just going to put them if you're doing butter you guys melt it and then [Music] shake up your shake and your water and then add your butter and shake it again and shake it really well it will incorporate and not glump up on you okay so there's my avocado oil and now i'm gonna grab this oh my arm does not want to work it just doesn't oh yeah let me smell it let's smell it oh it smells like apples and cinnamon tap that into there and i will tell you the longer you let these sit in the refrigerator the better they taste the thicker they get oh i got a little bit of mess here and then we're going to pop the lid on make sure that your shaker is snapped down because you do not have done it before and shook the stuff all over the place there we go and shake there we go good morning miss dory and now we can shake make sure everything's snap snap screw gotta really use my left arm i have i have done something to this right arm it doesn't work miss sandy though sent me for selex last year when she looks his back went out she sent me a care package with homemade cbd oil ointments and salves and creams and tea bags and he used it a little bit but then his doctor told him no you can't do that because you're on pain management it might mess with your uh you have to drug test if you're on uh pain management so he didn't get to use it but i tell you what since my elbow and arm have been messing with me um it's helped me at least with the pain level okay dory got one too i'm so happy for you so here we go yeah we get them but they were sold out they were sold out before i ever got one these people are so amazing let me tell you what that is wonderful so you know that prior to these new flavors they've been doing this year chocolate peanut butter cup is the schiznet for me and then along came lemon and lemon was my bestest friend all summer long i love love love the love their lemon and then they came out with pistachio hey i'm okay with the pistachio not my top favorite it's just it's there it's mild and it makes it good for when you're incorporating it into other things then s'mores came along s'mores are good too again i'm just like it's good it's good i you know i still like peanut butter cup and lemon meringue top now i can say this it's so tasty  is asking if i use these for a meal yes there are times i do uh most of the time like you know but even celix my husband loves these he's like hey he likes the next strawberry that's his favorite he loves strawberry but yes when you want a meal and you don't want to cook this is perfect for those of you who don't want to cook this is perfect for people who are on the go this is perfect for people who have jobs and they need some to be able to take something because you can you can get your own little shaker bottles for real and uh mix these up because with this kind of fat right here that i used with the uh avocado oil or olive oil or whatever ghee whatever this will last 10 days in the refrigerator so you can easily meal prep them stick them in your fridge grab and go for when you're on the run out shopping off working off doing whatever you're going to be doing uh keto child shakes are convenient i took them when uh celix had surgery i just made them up the night before we had to be up like at three o'clock in the morning and drive 50 miles so um anywho yeah so convenient complete meal replacement shake just to give you a little info here i'll just grab the chocolate i don't know i left the other apple pie there but these have a third of your daily nutrients so i'm gonna tell you when you stop and think about a multivitamin or trying to do three meals which on keto who does three meals literally we usually do two a lot of people only do even one meal a day for real one really good meal so what these do is they give you one third of your daily nutrients they and they also include a third of your electrolytes there's no other shake that does it so i just i met these guys in 2018 and if you've ever met chris bear chris and miriam they are the most beautiful little couple we ever did see they love up in utah and he is the developer of this but he is a science dude he's like he's very he'll admit to it he's nerdy as i'll get out in an in a cute way i don't know what miriam thinks about that but hey i'm i'm not married to him he's sciency so when he developed this he thought of everything he thought about the nutrients that needed to go into it he thought about the electrolytes that needed to go into it and then really most importantly you can have all the healthy stuff you want but if it doesn't taste good you're not going to get anywhere and this product uh i i they're they're i'm like you're you're what sorcery is this this is good stuff because i have gone to walmart i have bought uh protein shake powder whey powders uh protein powders you know i've bought it at sam's club i've bought stuff on amazon i've had companies send me their products and all of them have that protein flavor that protein flavor and i don't know what he does but it doesn't i think the only one of his that uh one of theirs i should say that doesn't have that does kind of you can kind of taste the protein is the vanilla and it's just so stripped down i mean heck i think at one point on his website on ketochow's website they actually have a recipe on how to make your own i mean who does that he's so they're so awesome so anyway i wanted to do the review i wanted to do the box opening in front of you guys um is there a list to be on for ordering would like to order and willing to wait okay stop laughing dana you know what i wish that you could have pre-ordered these or if they would just let you buy it and but these are going to be holiday flavors at this point what they usually do is they will introduce a limited flavor and they will only sell it in these single serve packages which is cool because they want to see what kind of response people are they're going to get they want to know if people like it or not and depending on the feedback that they get and the orders and the sales that they get they can determine whether or not something is successful and it's going to go so you know when the lemon meringue hit i mean it was gone that quick you just had to get it so they sent this to me and they sent me a cute little note saying hey don't tell anybody about this apple pie flavor until december 1st it has to be on tuesday you can't uh tell anybody before then that's our little secret i and i was so tempted i was so tempted to just open this up and taste it but i thought no if i can't even tell them about it until december 1st then i won't try it until december 1st that way they can get my response because if i don't like it i'm going to be like not one of my favorite flavors and there are a few flavors that i'm not real thrilled about y'all i love their sweets over their savories i find that their savories are good for cooking with as as a straight up soup or something not my favorite but when i'm making like a chicken pot pie or something i can i can use the savory chicken which i have up in my cabinet it's great it's a it's a good way to know that i'm getting all those nutrients and protein um anyways back to the limited edition so when i went on their website this morning i went looking straight away to see if the apple pie was available in the single packages yet and they're not and they're on mountain time and i'm on central so but i did find the chef's bundle okay um the chef's bundle let me see if i can pull this up right here and look at it let me tell you if you haven't looked at the the post that i sent out this morning look at this listen to this okay uh the holidays let's see they have this chef's bundle and with it you will receive a chocolate mint two savory chickens two cookies and cream four eggnogs one pistachio two chocolate one apple pie one banana one savory taco and an awesome cutting board [Laughter] so and it's eighty dollars for that all of that right but but wait there's more let me i'll pull it up here so uh it is only sixty dollars uh instead of 80 right now that's why i'm saying go go go go go go and yes i'm an affiliate but i don't care i i i was really disappointed i mean i couldn't keep up with their big sales they had going on from thanksgiving all the way through monday i mean i was like swamped with family and birthdays and thanksgiving i did not have any time to be sharing links with y'all i you saw me just post a bunch of them yesterday i was like okay so yeah 65 for the ketochow december chef bundle while supplies last that's why i was like hurry get them so and i shared the link it should take you straight there straight straight there all right i'm so excited about it but we're going to move on this morning i'll sit here and drink my shake and and and drink my coffee with you guys and i'm going to give you what uh what's up for december how's that and everyone let's find out what's up for december wait there's something else in the box oh it was this they sent these little secret flavor cards so that was kind of cool that's why i shared the picture yesterday of a secret flavor so let me put this all back up in here there's hubby say hi hobie i put this all back in the box are you putting stuff on my counter again are you putting things on my counter what's in the you went bag the store oh cool we were down to the last bit of coffee this i was like we're out of coffee okay let's let's just i'm gonna look at the feedback real quick okay by the way stars are enabled for anybody who wants to send some stars i appreciate it appreciate it uh let's see here oh can i oops you know me let me get my finger out of the way see if i can get that oh i don't want stars i don't want to give myself stars i don't need stars for myself well i kind of do but you know what i mean i hit the jackpot yes okay scrolling scrolling yeah sharon she's like tens of rubble but deb is a a rebel lover but she's also a keto child lover um dana said i'm so sorry i've been absent i need to start over perfect let's just stop right there stop wait a minute fill my cup put some look in it hope they don't get me for copyright infringement on my great awesome voice but we're moving on all right so let's just stop right there dana it is december 1st today is a new opportunity i've been looking at all kinds of little inspirational posts you know every day we get the opportunity to have a fresh start some days you might have a big fail some days you might just have a great one but the important thing is every day you get the opportunity to have a fresh start um over the last couple of months i have been you know just kind of giving people ideas for you know meal plans a holiday strategy if you will like you know enjoy your holiday if you're not there but then get right back up on your plan and eat keto so this month i'm thinking let's just eat keto let's not put any special restrictions on it let's just eat keto it doesn't matter if you're you know fasting it doesn't matter if you are limiting yourself to one meal a day it doesn't matter if you're eating fat bombs it doesn't matter if you're avoiding dairy you know there's all kinds of ways you can do your keto journey okay and you want the maximum results and you want to get back to where you were but you know i've been i've had this whole week of celebrating uh and i woke up choking i haven't done that in over two and a half years almost three january first will be three years okay and i had not had any of my pre-keto symptoms of gerd and i hadn't had any symptoms of choking wake up in the middle of the night because you're choking on your own stomach acid because you ate something that did not agree with you that was not probably meant to go in your body but you did it anyway right you ate the cookie you ate the roll you ate the turkey you ate the everything okay um so i thought to myself let's just do this let's just take december and go out with a bang my my plan for myself for this month is to just eat keto and stay accountable for me i'm staying accountable accountable by coming in front of you guys when i started my keto journey i remember it was january 2018 when i started the group when i started my own keto journey day one with everybody else and um just going along doing my thing and and probably about three and a half weeks into it i had gone to my sister-in-law's birthday party had a few drinks got my butt handed to me because i i did not realize what alcohol would do to a person on keto i had to go home but when i got home all i wanted to do was eat something you know if you've had a few drinks and it hit you hard i was on my third drink when i was like i gotta go home and i wanted to eat and there was spaghetti in my refrigerator because my husband and my grandkids live here and they they eat whatever right and i pulled that bowl out and i grabbed a fork i was just going to take a big old bite of cold spaghetti try to soak up some alcohol and it was like even in that altered state of mind i was like if you do this you're gonna let people down and i have said this over the years and i don't think i've said it often enough this year but having this group having people who are in the same boat as i am who have the same addictions like i have who who suffer and and struggle and go through real life just just like me because that's what we do helps keep me accountable if y'all if if i did not have this group and i had done two years of keto and had wonderful results and then dealing with what i've been dealing with for this last year 2020 um no telling how much even more weight i would have already gained i would have fought i would have failed without y'all i would have so you're always there in my mind every time i come in front of this camera and i look like i've gained five more pounds i know i know that you know in my head everybody's looking at me and i'm thinking oh but you guys give me the strength to keep trying you guys give me the strength to keep going to not give up to fight right on through this like everybody else i struggle just like anybody else i have my good times i have my bad times like i can go weeks and be perfectly perfect keto and then all of a sudden derailed whether it's an emotional issue anger frustration uh screw it all i don't care i'm just gonna do this and then i have to fight my way back in to my keto you know so i want to go out of 2020 on top not on the bottom i mean can you relate to that um and we can do it together we can we can do it together and that is my plan december 1st start this out get on here share the keto product sure enough yep i'm doing that but second of all i'm just putting myself out there i'm going to i'm take a picture i challenge you take a picture of everything that you're going to put in your mouth whether it's a drink or whether it's food take a picture of it post it post it in group post it on your own page post it on instagram post it wherever you got to post it but take a picture and say here's my accountability there is a keto rehab post in the announcement in group where you can keep a running track of everything that you're putting in your mouth it doesn't i mean it doesn't have to be you don't have to be strict and you don't have to be perfect all you got to do is stay on the course so that's what i'm going to be doing i'm either gonna be taking a picture or taking a video or doing something to do my keto that way i can go 31 days guys 31 days i can make a new post if you want would you like a new post a december 31 day challenge just keep it keto that would be a good one just keep it keto no special rules it's not like it's an egg fast or a bacon fast or a water fast or you know anything like that it's not a clean eating challenge it's just keep it keto go out of this year with 31 days of keto enjoy your fat bombs make keto candy if you want to for the holidays do cookies do whatever just keep it keto that's all we gotta do that way when new year's comes january first we'll be like you know what yeah we got this by january 1st we ought to be ready for some fasting we should be ready for some clean eating we should be ready for all kinds of things that we need to be doing and just and then just keep moving forward that's that's all we got to do is keep moving forward all right so there we go uh let's see hello two and a half years keto but two powerade zero helps i take two dropper fulls of ome uh mega mag okay dr barry's suggestion good morning miss tina i miss you too good morning debbie cathy rebecca happy december 1st to you too and miss dory lynn okay put your almond milk and fat first then powder then water mix is easier i put my water in first and then my fat and then my powder on top of it it works it works really well and i like water i don't know i don't feel like i need it i mean i guess you could make it richer if you want to especially with certain creamy varieties like a vanilla would be perfect but i do like the water less calories less carbs uh oh dory says she accidentally spilled the beans yesterday smooth move girl let's see ah dory loves pistachio for cheesecake what a great idea idea here we go um is there a list to be on for ordering we covered that and they do make wonderful ice cream laura yes keto chow ice cream is good and i did this oh just i think it was a week or so before thanksgiving i had had a really nice lunch you know like my first meal was i think we had gone to chili's and i had taken my own butter and so i had had like steak and and double broccoli and i had salad so i had a good meal and then that night i was like perfect i had my keto chow shake i think i used the s'mores as a matter of fact and it made wonderful ice cream i just threw it in my churner my ice cream maker and i sat down and i had ice cream for dinner whether you drink it like this or you freeze it hey who gets to enjoy a whole pint of it it's the best way to go especially if you love ice cream ah see yeah she said my note said november 27th well initially yes that was the idea but then they sent an email out afterwards saying oops no not till december 1st oh well i don't think yesterday was too bad too big a deal let's see y'all are saying hi to celex he's i don't know where he went outside he might be he bought the stuff to redo our insulation because the the insulation on the water pipes outside need to be replaced and everything new um i think that's what he's out there doing let's see oh thank you miss linda oh thank you for the stars y'all patty says my gosh you are us we can do it yeah y'all i just you know last night okay so we didn't do anything for my husband's birthday um i pretty much tore the house apart trying to get my christmas things going he just pretty much hid in his bedroom doing his thing watching tv and whatnot so we didn't do anything then yesterday he wanted his birthday celebration so i was the dd and we we stayed busy um and i met a guy last night while i was there and he asked me he said why keto for real life people what's the difference between real life and and not i said you know think about it y'all do you know anybody or did you don't have to know them but you know of them like on tv or whatnot whatever i mean i look at tv ads i watch the dr oz show or the doctors or the so that all these professionals are out there they got the smarts they got the diplomas they got all this and it's so easy for them to just look at you on tv with their glamorous lives and and their perfect little you know advice on how to just eat less and do it this way and then they've got the the commercials the infomercials out there with these little tight-fit young girls and guys who are just so fit just working out and doing this and i'm like i cannot relate i cannot relate to any of that i mean do i wish that i was that healthy and fit sure but for me real life is this i mean it's the day in it's the day out it's the it's the financial worries it's the relationship with the spouse it's the kids running around it's the grandkids it's it's you know national disasters happening all around you people losing jobs whatever you know it's the dog and the cat chasing each other and knocking everything down as they go that's my that's my reality that's what i relate to you know i don't relate to a bunch of these fufu pretty purty people not that i got anything against them hurrah huku good good good but don't try to sit there and push that stuff at me i can't relate i i i relate to real food i relate to real celebrations i relate to you know budget [Laughter] and and things happen and and dealing with it and still trying to be successful on our keto journey while we're dealing with real life not tv fantasy worlds he's like i get it okay uh said me too i just drank a coke zero for the first time in over a month and now i'm mad at myself don't be mad at yourself i have a i got coke zeroing diet coke in there i mean i get it if if it triggers you or if it does something for to you that that prevents you from losing weight you know you work on that but i would rather drink a diet coke or a coke zero or any diet soda and enjoy it versus a coke with sugar in it you know what i mean i mean i'll never forget here the summer before last and i thought i had bought regular sprite zero for cocktail hour you know and for two or three days every evening say let's get in the shower and then he go we get our little cocktail together go out on the porch and we use those tall beach glasses you know what i mean the tumblers and i'm pouring my stuff in and all of a sudden on day three i look and i'm like holy hell i had bought regular sprite so every day i was drinking a can of sprite a full sugary sprite and i'm full on keto and i'm still losing weight like nobody's business thank god i was fat adapted but you know it's not gonna hurt to have that diet coke i'm not i'm i'm not i'm not a keto police y'all know that about me right there's things that i allow myself that other people would just they're like that's why you so fat you know i always hear that voice in my head my my youtube channel you know it's got sucralose in it sucralose is terrible no sucralose is fine for me call me dirty keto i guess because i'm okay with it i i do draw the line sometime like i don't sit there and i wouldn't drink them on the regular though i i drank maybe three diet cokes a week oh debbie i wish i had lost weight girl no it's just good lighting and a root powder in my hair and yeah okay you want to hear something what do you think of this sweater you like the sweater i don't really i mean i do and i don't it's comfortable i like the the the black and white flat check but i feel like i was as big as a house in it uh and it was mine and i gave it to my daughter who lost weight and then gave it back to me because i gained weight and i'm like well thank you for keeping some of my fat clothes now i haven't gained all my weight back and i haven't even gained half of my weight back but it feels like i've gained it all back oh goodness oh thank you for the stars y'all oh gosh let's see um [Music] i hear yes yes yes yes yes bought my dim today speaking of which yeah i got it right here guys so i will tell you about the first two weeks that i was taking this i was doing the one dose a day this is the smoky mountain nutrition once daily capsule dim bioperine estrogen metabolism support um it says one tablet is a serving and it's 200 milligrams and my first week and a half man my inflammation was just coming off started feeling balanced out that's what i even more so like i'm doing my hormone replacement therapy which made me feel human again but then this came along and it and it even helped more now if i wasn't eating off plan on again off again i bet i would even have even better results with this um but i did up it elizabeth is taking 400 milligrams a day and i checked it out and it is safe so i started upping it um once a day with a meal whether it's your early meal or your evening meal just do this because it helps avoid some of the side effects that can take place with it so um yeah back to this starting today i kind of knocked it off through this last week of of eating with the family and eating all the stuff that made me feel terrible it's terrible when you don't drink you wish you had because if you're going to feel like crap you might as well you know i've had a good time but let me tell you it just wasn't worth it but yes i i love the damn elizabeth she's taking the dim and i'm telling you she's and she hasn't been perfect either she's just now straightened straightening her path out but i'm telling you that girl she's always carried weight in her thighs and her rear ends you know that's where and on her lower hips when she starts to gain that's where she starts gaining first and when she's trying to lose she loses everywhere but right there it's like her stubborn spot and since doing the dim and and really not much else different it's like she's just she's melting melting and now she's doing her keto and taking her dim so i'm kind of thrilled with that if you need a link to that guys that just go to it doesn't matter my page group you'll see the amazon link store where i'm i've got my own storefront it's right in there under the health and beauty stuff for them because i've got supplements all listed so you can find them there oh let's see i'm in every day i've got a toffee keto chow in my fridge making ice cream later the toffee is see that's one of those flavors that i'm like i could take it or leave it i like it but to me that one is super super sweet this one is just right dana says we are not purists we are everyday people yes we are there's no point in trying to be a purist either i just can't i buy the tiny cans of diet coke and enjoy once once a week see there you go i like those tiny little cans too i either like the tiny little cans or the tiny bottles i the 10 the bottles are 10 ounces i think i love those because i can't finish a 20 ounce or a 16 ounce i i'll buy them because they're usually cheaper um and then i'll open it up take a drink with with my meal because that's when i want to have it as with a meal i don't want it in between meals at all um and then i put it back good morning miss naoda uh love that plaid love this sweater woohoo okay do you recall when you were staying here for 2019 ketocon we were drinking these wonderful margaritas yes girl that was another time that we found out there was some sugar happening but we enjoyed them anyways i mean everything else was keto ms sharon had got the most beautiful table set up we had she had this beautiful welcome party for us when we went to ketokon last summer in 2019 it was wonderful so if we had a little bit of margarita mix it is what it is agave yeah see there you go hidden another word for sugar um linda says i'm excited to see if it helps me with the inflammation and issues will you know that if you have been on again and off again on plan that the inflammation is ungodly so thankfully once you get on plan usually by day three three inflammation is is just it goes down so rapidly you guys just by eating your fat just by having it um so you get quick relief i know that right now i'm puffy um oh y'all saw that my this hand was killing me i wrapped this finger good and i'm not gonna do that you know kind of but it was this finger right here that i jammed uh in my door and then a mini blind caught it and it just took the whole thing and twisted it was swollen and then i hit it with a knife so i cut the same finger that a spring and then with the eating off plan aches and pains are so much more uh noticeable like it's it's terrible plus the inflammation is water gain it's water weight as well so get back on plan make sure you drink your water if you take supplements take your supplements um get yourself a strategy going i sit here and i'm thinking like just eat keto do what it takes i've got my i got my keto chow shaped if i want one of those and i'm not gonna clean up my fridge all right so i wanna i'm just gonna put this out there because this is another thing i was just running through my head like all right get a plan together throw it together for everybody clean out the fridge empty out and i'm like no no no when i started my keto journey in 2018 i did not go in my pantry and take out everything that wasn't keto you all saw me probably earlier this year i'm like i'm cleaning everything out i don't want anything keto that's not in here husbands everybody's keto well they're my fair weather keto friends okay sometimes they're keto sometimes they're not and this year i have been on and off on and off on and off but when i started keto in 2018 it was here it was here inside my heart that it was nancy this is for you this is for your health this is you and these people getting together and it doesn't matter because that stuff's always going to be in there if you live alone and you want to get rid of it and that's your thing to help you do it but for me i i'm not gonna do that i've got to tell myself no to this and i can do it because i have done it before so it's not like uh you know hey y'all i'm struggling and i've told them i am i said my addiction is raging man raging um what i will ask and i think that is is a better idea rather than cleaning out my cabinets and tossing out everything that's non-keto i'm only asking my family to not enable me so if they come back and they've got sonic and and they've got uh cookies from walmart or they've went and bought whatever because they both go out and do their thing and come back and say would you like some i asked them to not enable me do not offer things to me if they are not keto okay i have to deal with what's already in the house and make the choice on my own to say no i'm not doing that and i i really don't need you to come in and try to offer it to me and and they're like okay that's fine i mean my daughter said the other day i'm sorry but i know you love these would you here i went to this new place that has real street tacos and she knows i love tacos and i was on doing good and she's like but it's only two little tacos just that's all and it's so easy to go all right it's okay but then i baked two tortillas now you know it's like and that's just it's just it's a never-ending thing so ask your family members if you have them who live with you to just not enable you stelix is doing his own cooking for the most part right now seriously [Laughter] i'm gonna do me he's gonna do him and in between if i make a meal that's pretty much keto then that's fine but i'm really just not messing with it okay bonnie hello hello uh linda says i haven't had the toffee yet i'll be my first time hopefully not too sweet for me huh it is one of their sweetest ones for me it's a little too much tomate okay all right bonnie says i'm struggling this year also i have to get back on it for inflammation and pain in back and knees exactly we are going to take this yo i mean seriously seriously i i'm even at a point i hate trying to say guys that i want to do something because every single time i try to plan something this family and my life get in the way and i don't get to follow through which i don't like doing that i don't like being a person who's not following through but i mean i literally just want to take little short video clips or pictures of everything and run them together and post them on a daily so that you can see this is what i had for the entire day you can see what i'm eating you can see what i'm drinking water is important i've got to get a pitcher of water out that's what i've got to do i got to set a pitcher water out on the counter and just empty it that's what i need to do because if i don't set it out i won't finish it if i see it then i'm more like oh you got to drink that you got to empty that pitcher of water so little tips little things that you might do for yourself to remind you to make sure you're drinking your water that you're getting your electrolytes in that you're eating keto i think that's as difficult as we need to make it and then you know do do whatever you have to do to tell your family hey i have got to do this it's my ride or die i mean i if i keep doing this i'm going back to it i don't want to be breathless again i don't want to wake up in the middle and like choking on my own stomach acid it gets out of my lungs and i just can't even i mean literally i'm just drowning in my own stuff i'm like no where's there's your sign you know okay deanna says it's like telling an alcoholic it's okay to have a beer because it's not hard liquor yeah yeah it's it you know we have to eat when we we have to eat yes and i won't kid you there's been times i'm like i just want to eat what everybody else does i don't want to think about it i don't want to cook it i don't want to deal with it but what other option do i have you know i can keep it as simple as i need it to be i can make it meat and veg any old time i can cook up eggs and bacon there's it can be as simple as i want or it can be as extravagant and flavorful as i want it it's not convenient that's why they have these kind of things like products not all the products are great but they do have stuff for us if we want it you know but i know that no matter how sometimes we get in that little thing you know it's like being um an alcoholic or a drug addict okay like you can you know you don't want to do it you know that you you shouldn't do it and you make up your mind not to do it and then everybody comes over to have a barbecue and brings us you know cooler full of beer and wine and you know whatever other things they've got and you're just like oh i'll wait till this event is over and then i'll start fresh on monday after this is over hmm well except for one thing then the next week it's another event and then it's always something you have to just say no i you got your beer in your cooler i got my i got my near beer over here you know i got my closest thing to it or i got my own stuff my own iced tea whatever it happens to be you just have to make up your mind to say no or be prepared i got granddaughters two granddaughters birthdays coming up y'all i swear november and december are crazy for their birthdays we've got and uh holidays so i'll be facing two birthday cakes in the next week uh a christmas party uh the following week uh where there's gonna be all kinds of stuff there and i i feel like i'm at the olympics or one of those tv shows where they have to you know do the obstacle course that's what it's like in my head can i dodge the bullet can i make it up the hill can i climb over this without touching that you know it's like if we stick together we can do it all right yes yes yes um there are no better other options when we get right down to it yes ms sharon uh bonnie says your roll bread and jelly recipes have saved me so many times thank you for your recipes especially at holiday you're welcome and that's another thing um i thought of like do i try to create new stuff for you guys i mean i know y'all listen to me but at the same time recipes are kind of a big deal you know that new recipe comes out and everybody wants it but i don't know about going out all out for newer stuff this month i'm gonna put it like this i'm gonna be i'm in the mood for mushrooms i made a little bit for myself i did make keto for for thanksgiving and then i ate things that weren't not not too bad though i chose one item but it was keto thanksgiving it was awesome but you know i was like um i don't know that i i want to to just go all out and and just get in the kitchen to get in the kitchen you know what i mean if i'm not in the mood for christmas cookies then i'm not making christmas cookies if i'm in the mood for mushrooms which i am i'm going to do a video about mushrooms and they just happen to be very clean and they happen to be very delicious and you can make them as a wonderful appetizer to take to a holiday party or you can eat them as a meal for all by yourself it's like going to chili's and ordering nachos you know what i mean instead of having you order an appetizer that's me i live on appetizers so that's that's the way i'm going to approach this month whatever i'm making i'll share creating i'm over it for this month i'm done with it 2020. and i'm going to tell you the hook that got me that just was the pie crust the amount of flour loop and flour the amount of ingredients that i tried over and over and over and i got this great pie crust last week again i told you i'll be back on wednesday i'll share with you i got pictures to prove it the pie crust the edge of the pie crust freaking delicious delicious i came up with a way to do it difficult technique no it was pretty easy but when i put the filling into it the filling went down and cooked into the crust and it came out smushy and it was another big fail so i was like i'm done so whatever i'm cooking i'll share with you all this month that's the best i can do but i don't think i'm creating anything new that i am aware of yet um having to remind yourself that food can't be a hobby for some of us yeah well me particularly that that very applies very much to me food is a hobby me creating recipes is a hobby like my brain starts thinking i mean i haven't even i don't even know what i did with that other apple went up there i almost left it up there the minute i got this i was like and looking at it i hadn't even opened the package and i was thinking of pancakes already how do i do that oh i already got it and i will i might have pancakes i might have pancakes tomorrow and if i do i'll record it and we'll put it out there but it became becomes a past time for me it is a hobby for me to get in the kitchen and figure things out and create and eat let's just keep it keto that's all i care about this month you figure 31 days you could be fat adapted by the end of the month how would that be how would that be how wonderful would that be being fat adapted by the end of the month it is hard to say no but we have to yes we need to angie says i think you need to focus on you nancy and we will follow and learn oh thank you i i yeah i mean to be just quite frank i almost wanted to take this whole month off i've been doing keto going on three years struggling with keto during my third year um feeling burnt out just putting it out there and i remember another person who's been doing keto for a lot of years said take off the she told me this when i very my very first year of keto take off the whole month of december because it's slow people aren't into it as much and that's that this is the time of year that i take off the whole month and i thought yeah that's nice it sounds nice but there was no way i could do that because i was like no we're we're on it dug on it and we we i was creating stuff all over the place but into the year three i'm just like yeah it'd be great just to say okay i'm not doing anything i'll be back in january see y'all there uh and i was that close to making that decision and i thought no i can't do that i don't want to do that if i was totally on plan and i had been doing everything i needed to be doing the right way i probably could have done it but because i want to end this year on a strong note and because i know not only have i struggled but i know so many of you have struggled as well we need to do this we just need to get through this month and focus on eating keto that's that's it oh thank you bonnie i personally appreciate your hard work when you're trying things to perfect for us i love i trust your recipes so don't spend a fortune on things that taste terrible by others there you go yeah it's trial and error um linda says i don't think there's any need for you to create this month relax as much as you can thank you thank you thank you [Music] um let's see sheila said i had to give up dairy cause a lot of bloating and it can it's funny um tomatoes for elizabeth we were talking about that you know just certain foods and you the longer your keto and and you start really understanding what works and does not work for you uh i'll give you an example and i know dory's in here she she'll she'll she'll jump in on this conversation right here but for me personally one of the things that i love or a couple of things that i love that i never knew that i had an issue with were peanut butter tuna love them oh and tomatoes i love tomatoes i can eat raw tomatoes like in salads but tomato sauce tomato juice i found that those three things cause me a lot of pain in my body when i eat them stomach pain heartburn i i always got i had issues with you know acid reflux and heartburn when i was not keto but you couldn't pinpoint anyone food and being keto and then incorporating those foods in the same pain would come back so i learned that i have some sort of intolerance those foods just don't agree with me um and so yeah you learn these type of things dairy can be a hard one and i will say this when it comes to dairy products uh if you notice that it's things like cream cheese or heavy cream or cottage cheese or you eat some people even yogurt it's the softer dairies that that can be problematic for some people but they don't have problems with hard cheeses like the parmesans or the hard aged cheddars or any of those firmer cheeses because the the firmer and the more aged it is the less lactose is in it it's it's it's more just hardened fat and you might not have as much trouble so i hope that gives i hope that helps you a little bit just try you know different types of dairy and figure out which one it is you know eliminate all of it for a week or two and then one at a time incorporate something eat a piece of hard cheese does it work for you did it bloat you did it cause problems okay the next day you're like okay i'll try a little bit of heavy cream bloated there you go you know you know okay thank you thank you um i felt the same way and got off boy did i regret it with just the pain itself yes it is so painful to be non-keto debbie says as a type 2 diabetic i can't take time off and there you go we have our reasons peanuts nightshade veggies and sheila says thank you all right y'all i'm about done with the shake i'm wrapping this up i do like i say i'm going to you'll see me in in the next video because i'm fixing to uh do some mushrooms up and i want to get them on tape while i can and share that up on youtube make sure that you check it out if you haven't gone to youtube and subscribed please do so and make sure you hit the notification button so that you know when i've uploaded something new or i'm doing a live um thank you all for the stars i appreciate it if you could might consider becoming a supporter on facebook or youtube you're more than welcome i appreciate that and last but not least y'all just keep it keto don't worry about all of the the rules don't overthink it just keep it keto all right that's my goal december 1st through 31st let's do 31 days together use your tools your tips and your trades and you can't get the holiday bundle but you can get the chef's bundle and it has the apple pie in it i shared a link with y'all remember fats first moderate protein low carb and get you some", "q37UwDMvgzE": "good afternoon everybody i'm alexandra and on the line from cabot cheese I work for Cabot's marketing department in the health and culinary program I'd like to welcome you today for a webinar on baking substitution science on behalf of home baking association and the farmers who on cabot creamery just a couple of things to note before we begin if you are having trouble seeing the visual part of the presentation please email health info at cabot cheese com that's health info at cabot cheese calm and our team will be their best to help troubleshoot with you this webinar is also being recorded and will be available at a later date we're also planning to provide the powerpoint presentation itself which will be available for download in case you'd like to print off any of the recipes or any of the tips here from our speaker today and will keep you informed on where you can find these in the next couple of weeks another thing to note is the questions box on the webinar control panel on the side of your screen please type in any questions you may have there and we'll address them verbally right at the end as we can get to them we'll also compile a list of questions asked which will be available along with the recorded webinar and presentation at a later date for the dietitians on the line we've applied for continuing professional education credits and we'll notify you about these upon approval and for those of you on twitter we like to encourage you to tweet about the webinar and any cool facts you learned from our speaker today so you'll see our twitter handles there right on the screen as well as the hashtag making fun and then lastly in a few days we'll be sending out a post webinar email which will include a survey about the webinar itself we'd love for you to take a minute to fill this out and the plus side is that each person who submit the survey will receive a baking resources packet from us and HBA so for those of you who are in a familiar with habit we are a dairy farmer owned cooperative of over 1,200 farm families throughout upstate York and New England and we've been in business since about nineteen nineteen the best part about Cabot in my opinion is that one hundred percent of the profits go right back to our farmers when you purchase any of our products which includes our award-winning cheddar cheeses freestyle yogurt and butter so at this time I'd like to welcome our speaker today sharon davis who's a 30-year veteran family and consumer sciences educator and licensed secondary teacher we met sharon through our membership with home baking association which we joined in about 2010 sharon an executive director of HBA charlene patent both do wonderful work in growing and supporting the practice of home baking something that's of course near and dear to our hearts as a cooperative of farm family sharon graduated from iowa state university with a bachelor of science in home economics vocational secondary education over two decades sharon has continued her education with Kansas State University the American Institute of baking Test Kitchen bakers and for professional associations in addition to authoring and co-authoring many baking educator resources she has taught more than 500 food nutrition and baking seminars at local to international level for a variety of educators including those in 4h in boys and girls clubs as well as childcare providers school food service Cooperative Extension and family and consumer science educators her professional development has continued as a nutritionist Test Kitchen director spokesperson and consultant to various organizations like the wheat foods Council Hodgson mill and finally as program and membership development for home baking association Sharon enjoys growing and preparing her own foods with her husband Greg and children katieandchris in Manhattan Kansas so now that you know a little bit more about us we'd like to get to know a little bit more about you I'd love to administer this poll and if you could please give us your best answer that would be great okay and here are the results of the poll so everybody knows who is joining us today thank you very much for participating so today our goal is to provide you with a few reliable and affordable nutrient-rich making substitutions and resources which you can hopefully extend to the individuals and families user or of course apply them to your own everyday life so with that said I'll now hand the reins over to our speaker today Sharon hello I want to welcome you all to my test kitchen and also wish we could see each other face to face but let's just go ahead and I look forward to hearing your questions at the end of the presentation as well so we'll look forward to you using that that option in entering this topic if it's important for us to realize that there is so much we can do with baking substitution and today we're going to focus like the picture shows on work we've done with other food professionals this is an extension group that I worked with recently but today with this substitution science goal that we have we want to look at substitutions that can be affordable can be done at home yes they can always be done in a professional kitchen as well we want to look at the ingredients functions because that predicts how we make the substitutions you can't know ingredient is apples to apples so we have to make sure that we understand what the function is that were altering when we make a substitution we want to see things being nutrient-dense in other words we aren't just doing this because we don't have anything else to do we want to be sure that the additions we make have some impact that we're looking for the methods you use the temperatures are really important to success so I will allude to that but you want to remember that the methods and begging are much more precise than most many many cooking methods where you can put a pinch in of this and a pinch of that in baking we do need to measure accurately use the proper tools or scales for that and then be sure that we do methods like preheating properly the oven cooling things properly and then breaking resources and questions will follow but we will offer throughout this this PowerPoint many many excellent resources for you so first of all let's just make sure that we're on the same page that we are indeed spending our hour together well in fact people bake a lot nowadays and they do so for this age-old reason to treat family and friends with love to be handcrafted for from me to you but as you notice that gold highlighted one this has moved up over the years to sixty percent on in terms of the reason why people bake they want to control the ingredients in their food and they and they feel using need to control it or they must control it to improve some outcome in their life so this mintel research um is important to us you notice if you drop down a couple more there's saving money research sources are important so sometimes we will bake for ourselves because the alternative is more expensive when it's not done for us when it is done for us and then the last want to ask you I beg you with educators to note this thirty three percent of the people pulled in the mental survey would bake more if they just knew how so pass on what you know the benefits are multiple for baking and you'll see them just kind of thrown up here I mean if you if you look at even the first one you can cut calories because not only did you invest calories and preparing the food but you also can control the ingredients literacy science math tech all of those are part of part of the equations so if you go down the list they're all goals that we hope to achieve today through what we're talking about I highlight those arrows nutrient variety fruits veggies nuts we want to see both all boosted for nutrient density calcium potassium protein can all be benefited and of course we can gain the whole grains whole grains are indeed the best thing you can do to boost your antioxidants fruits vegetables follow portion control is absolutely essential please take note it's another thing we can control so we're going to move into the first ingredient category in baking liquid and I just want to say that we use this first because liquid the function of liquids is huge and you first of all see that moistens and hydrates everything that you put in the in the bowl in mixing bowl and indeed you would hear this huge clamor if you could hear the ingredients talk they would all be wanting some of the liquid that you add because they want to be hydrated they want to be dissolved they want to have them their ingredients blended together they then when the heat hits the combination it that liquid will turn to steam and it will expand the air sales it will gelatinize the prod the starches and the product the proteins in the product and that gives its structure it will provide flavor texture and richness that we depending on what kind of liquid you use it can add nutrients and it certainly holds moisture in the product and it will aid in browning I use this lovely pumpkin raisin bread as an illustration because hydrating the raisins is important conditioning and we'll talk about that twice in this PowerPoint but the liquids are not static in a baked product they can move in and out and around throughout the product how you cool the product is important cool it on the cooling rack take it out of the pan after that minimal moment in the pan of cooling so that it cools properly and the liquids don't move in the wrong direction for you to staling fruits veggies are a great liquid substitute we can use for many recipes we use water and milk and we'll talk briefly about that but remember that most fruits and veggies are about eighty to ninety two percent water even if they're hard like a sweet potato that sweet potato is still mostly water so it makes a great addition in many quick breads from pancakes to waffles to loaf breads anything like this strawberry muffin top on masterp you read the water content of fruits and vegetables will add up to three fourths of a cup of water to your batter so just take that into consideration if you decide to substitute take a cup of water instead of using a cup of water you're going to use three-fourths of a cup of vegetables puree diminished then you want to cut that water back appropriately your whole grain baking benefits from using these fruits and veggies as an ingredient especially yeast breads will stay moist or longer your whole grain baked goods of any kind that the brand content loves that extra humectant see of a fruit or vegetable in the bread so sometimes and often i will just add that half a cup of grated carrot or mashed pumpkin or mashed sweet potato I have left I would just put that in maybe reduce my liquid by one or two tablespoons and then I know that I have that boost of nutrients as well as moisture and human see if the fruit and veggie is acidic you want to be sure you reduce the baking powder and use a little soda because the batter's acidic level will change and it would react better and do better if it has the soda and not just the pure baking powder so a guideline might be then if you're using have to a three-fourths to a full cup of an acidic fruit like um the sea rhubarb comes to mind because it's just about ready to be pulled in my garden then you have that rhubarb sauce you're going to use it in a in a bread or going to use it in something like a waffle or a pancake you want to use a little soda as well dairy ingredients are great ingredient for liquid substitution if you've just got pure water in a in a recipe for one thing you want to remember that milk is of course mostly water ninety percent but the remainder solids are absolutely essential twist their proteins and lactose which increases the sweetness and the Browning of the product you're going to boost the fighters and vitamins and minerals because they've been added into or enriched in the milk fortified would be the right word I think and then it delays sailing yeast breads you want to be sure you scald the milk when you're when you're substituting in more milk and remember that yeast likes to have at least two ounces of water per package of yeast 14 bounces a package of yeast and that helps it to function more properly and meant more properly in the in the dough or batter so on scalding yes you might say well thats old-fashioned no it's not to take away bacteria pasteurization takes care that just fine but scalding stops enzymatic action so you will actually see an improvement in the volume of your bread there is Baker's use a high heat dry milk and King Arthur Flour is one source of that for the home baker substitutions whole milk just dispar just so you know this um i have read that many many people use only carry skin up at home because that's what's best for our hearts and that's very true but if you have a recipe that calls for whole milk and that richness would benefit the product maybe you you want to make that substitution with two tablespoons of butter for a cup of skim milk that will equal whole milk sometimes a recipe will call for heavy cream and you'll say well i don't want it to be skin but i but and this gives you that chance to do the substitution down from heavy cream to a lesser amount but still not lose all of the richness of the butter flavor sour milk and buttermilk both that that thing my grandma did 1 tbsp lemon juice in the bottom of the cup the liquid measuring cup add the milk whether it's a non-dairy or a dairy milk it could be almond milk if you have a case to your lactose intolerance but you add in that lemon juice or vinegar and stir it up to equal one cup and you will have soured milk within about five to ten minutes now we have a new kid on the block that everybody is excited about it's Greek style yogurt & cabot is helping hostess today and I want to thank them for that greek-style yogurt is unique and that it is 90 to 100 percent higher in protein than in than a regular yogurt it's been strained so it has less lactose and frequently has less sodium than many of the ingredients we might use in baking so it's a great addition to their options between moisture content you notice it's about ten to fifteen percent less moisture than yes so you may want to then just liquefy it slightly with a little milk I'll show you it just below here you will automatically reduce saturated fat and increase protein by substituting yogurt for things like sour cream creme creme fraiche a and other ingredients that are higher in fat you use it to top waffles lior parfaits mixed smoothies and puddings is one of my favorite things of late to do it with do a substitution with you fin it slightly when you want to sub it for buttermilk and my primary reason for using yogurt a Greek yogurt instead of buttermilk is the wonderful reduction in sodium and we'll see that later too so you use a sort of a cup of milk two thirds of a cup of Greek style yogurt and you will have a cup of buttermilk it's subs well 1414 sour cream and creme fraiche a and what I want to put this dramatic piece of information up there if you're using a two-percent Cabot greek-style yogurt you go 1 for 14 sour cream you will automatically take away 40 grams of your fat 23 grams of saturated fat and you will boost your protein content by 17 grams that is exciting baking functions of fat it's important to remember that fat and baked goods has a wonderful role to play you might as well maximize the benefits butter is one of the one of the ingredients that does that it doesn't mean that you have to use a hundred percent butter and everything you bake but butter brings you the richness of its flavor it will tenderize the crumb and all fats in fact do this with the exception of oils which you have to you have to trade out some things with oil substitutions you get a flakiness in your viscous your pastry your croissants your scores you get Christmas in your cookies crackers and pie crusts and it delays the scaling which is which is a great deal so remember your baguette has no fat and it has to be baked fresh every day you're on your crescent roll that that you make with a half a cup of butter for six cups of flour that crescent roll will store longer because of the fat content large amounts to interfere with your formation so you have to keep that in mind the more fat you put into a yeast dough the more gluten development structure development you see change less can be more and when you're working with quick breads especially older recipes or or quick breads that call for as much as a cup of oil you can easily substitute a variety of mashed or grated fruits or vegetables depending on what your outcome wants to be one of my favorites is canned pumpkin or mashed sweet potato because you get such a big bang for your buck so if I have a recipe quick bread recipe muffin recipe that calls for maybe two thirds cup of oil or thur or have a cup of shortening I will go ahead and cut back that fat to have that or at least a third less and and substitute that in that ammonium with the canned pumpkin even one tablespoon per serving of pumpkin added gives you a boost of thirty five percent of your daily value value of vitamin A and that's fabulous another sub you can do for oil in small amounts and get a big bang for your buck is flax meal so let's say sometimes I will just cut that two tablespoons of the oil or the butter or the shortening and for that I will put in six tablespoons of flax meal that will give me the equivalency in oil but it also gives me look at the profiler 30 600 milligrams of mega 36 grams of fiber and five grams of protein and all that for just three tablespoons of flax meal greek-style yogurt does some cool things and you look at the chocolate chip cookie over on the right you'll see that a cup of butter can be substituted with a half a cup of unsalted butter and then a fourth of a cup of your playing greek-style yogurt and in this case two percent is fine you could use ten percent but the analysis here was used with two percent so it's less 52 grams of saturated fat and 727 calories for that substitution you make it a little more spread in that cookie then you would get with butter because you have a little more moisture but the truth is I it gets well worth gaining these attributes unless you're looking for the standard Toll House cookie that you've grown up with and then that the substitutions can make a difference what I might also do though is okay I need a little more fat maybe i'll put in some flax meal and so with that substitution you're looking at there under the cookie you probably could add in three to six tablespoons of flax meal and end up was even a little more crispness because of that oil content of flax meal southern Cabot light cheddar cheese this can also be a great way to maybe you want to reduce your shortening or oil in a yeast bread and instead use a cheese you'll get the flavors the nutritive value of that cheese protein for fat can also be done in a greek-style yogurt pie crust which I'm excited about in terms of a new opportunity we've seen lots of tried and true recipes for pie crusts but this one contains the beauty of butter which gives you that wonderful cold solid fat needed to cut in and make the layers with the flour you don't need as much salt when you're using a salted butter so you'll notice that's only a fourth of a teaspoon but then you use that half a cup of cabot two percent plain Greek style yogurt and what you do is it tenderizes the gluten structure in the product both butter and yogurt have a little bit of water in them they immediately begin to develop gluten if they if you handle the crust pastry too much so on that yogurt helps diminish that gluten development because it's acidic some people we use up and I've heard everything but vinegar is a common one my grandmother you see her using in a pie crust and we see vodka used as well but all of them are used to help modify the gluten so you don't get a tough pie crust other substitutions I want you to know scones biscuits shortcakes anything where you're looking to use heavy cream or sour creams again heavy cream can be substituted half cream with half Greek style yogurt you might want to use a fourth of a teaspoon of baking soda if no soda is called for and then knock back your baking powder slight cheesecake tiramisu again we can make that beautiful substitution of half a cup of yogurt for for us and plus the four ounces of cream cheese and that could be in wichita light cream cheese for the fordham marscapone you have to forgive me my my pronunciations are weak sometimes I've just to midwestern have your cake well the cake itself is not low-fat most cakes aren't so prepare your portions accordingly we do not have to cut the cake in 12 slices instead cut it the way your great-grandmother did when she served tea or book club I remember it well they served smaller portions and what we do today but the frosting on this one is what excites me most when you look at this you see the chocolate frosting is a half a cup of plain Greek style yogurt half a cup of unsweetened baking cocoa that would be the not Dutch processed just a plain baking cocoa the one teaspoon vanilla extract one fourth teaspoon cinnamon and then the about a pound of confectioner's sugar so you don't get less sugar if you look up in the little red box there you don't get less sugar so much but you do get up cut in calories and the calories were cutting come from so little fat and then the sodium is way down on this to you get ninety five milligrams grams less sodium then you get in a canned frosting so the column on the right would be either a homemade buttercream or a canned buttercream frosting the one on the Left pertains strictly to this on Cabot's chocolate frosting when we move on into sweeteners and sugars we realize that on the diversity is wonderful we have all these choices and first and foremost know where sugar comes from it is a natural sweetener that we've been eating for two thousand years it indeed helped us to determine whether something was poisonous versus good for us so sucrose itself table sugar if you will brown sugar profession oh sure are derived from plant materials either either cane share candy cane excuse me sugar cane or sugar beets and on that plant has stored the carbohydrate that it derived from photosynthesis and either its root or its nectar plant parts like stevia stores its its its sweetener in its plant part as well so it's a similar concept fructose and lactose are of course a native natural sweeteners in milk and fructose and fruits and in many things like the corn plant honey all cap Reuters baking functions then vary based on whether it's a liquid sweetener or whether it is a granulated sugar so creaming with granulated sugar is important to aeration in many batters and doughs and you want to do so adequately especially with some of the substitutions we have listed coming up you want to be sure you fully cream your batter or your dough you're fat and your sugar so if you're not sure about that you should visit our test kitchens at home baking or you can also see our own video sequences on creaming on how to how to get enough aeration of course the type of sugar you use will add or vary the flavor whether using an agave nectar whether using honey whether you're using on molasses or corn street but what it is that sweetens your product it will help Brown the crust it will help maintain freshness and hold the moisture and of course its food for yeast not to a point a really really sweet yeast oh that would be like a cup of sugar with six cups of flour would give you actually a it would delay the yeast action it would actually soften the glutens and make on that product moves more slowly now we offer a baking lab manual you'll see the photo here on the right and it is a tremendous resource for you to have lab 7 is all about what we're talking about right now but i do want to draw your attention to that lab manual because every ingredient we're talking about motion the material we're covering here is covered plus 20 times more in the baking lab manual the three basic classifications of sweeteners and sugars are cool they're either caloric their artificial natural and caloric their artificial or they are a sugar alcohol polyol which we don't use those typically in home baking the last category in home baking we tend we tended like to use natural sugars and sweeteners so those would include agave nectar corn syrup someone like Cairo corn syrup that is not a high fructose corn syrup shouldn't be confused with that whole process that's used beyond the corn chips we use in our home baking honey and molasses marshmallow cream sorghum sucrose and that would include granulated brown and confectioner sugars and then the new kid on the block here is stevia so sugar and stevia is blended by cnh and domino in their product called sugar light which will go to in a second and talk a little more about the benefits that brings and some of the substitution points sweetness in life I mentioned the 2,000 years but remember that consumer pallets sometimes don't accept home-baked because home-baked will be less sweet than commercially baked at times and that sometimes true because what we have going on is an accustomed palette to very sweet beverages so the non natural sweeteners that are used to sweetened beverages can be 1,200 times sweeter than natural sugar so when we flip back to products that we make it home which may use less sugar in the first place and then they aren't as intensely sweet as what people might be used to consuming sometimes you have to back away become more accustomed to what you're doing at home fresh baked however has the edge because it can be not as sweet and use less total sugars and still get more flavor because of the freshness it's it's not had to stand up to shipping and packaging so our commercial bakers have a challenge and again many of their products will advertise a ride home baked but they may have to alter their their formulations just because they want to deliver to you as nice as it can be delivered in a package we have to apply portion sense and this I mentioned earlier again I just can't emphasize it enough sometimes we think we cannot have some of the sweets we have but one of the biggest issues we have is we just don't know how to cut the cake we cut it in 16 pieces when it should be cut in 24 or we make other mistakes with our muffins but at home we don't have to do that so 20 years ago a muffin with an ounce and a half today many muffins will be as much as four ounces so more than double the calories for you educators you should go to the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute I'm after our presentation and check out their PowerPoint you can use it in the classroom it shows the comparative changes in portion sizes decrease your mouth that you use as well consider a drizzle like this k rose syrup slope add spice cake they just drizzle the dish the frosting on is perfect it's more than enough if you want to just sift powdered sugar over your chocolate waffle or your your cake and or bar instead of icing it and that might also give you just the amount of sweetness you need corn syrups and can also work well enough sugar glaze that allows you flew iddah tea and glaze that's really attractive as well when you think about comparative sweetness for calories we come out really very close on Drive a syrup honey and cane sugar tablespoon 4 tbsp sweetness for sweetness sugar and sweetener substitutions then many of us are trying to find a way maybe to work with a diabetic client or maybe we ourselves just say I don't want to give up my latte or my soda pop that sugar is important in my life so where am I else can I cut my sugar again what you might want to do is first start with portion sizes secondly how frequently do you consume any of the above that we've mentioned and then you think about how much sweeter is agave nectar if I used it I might use two-thirds cup of it when I was going to need cup of sugar when you do that you want to reduce your liquids to a quarter to one third cup in the total batter for every two-thirds cup of agave nectar you use so you may need to do that just so that you can see the benefit of the agave nectar sweetness in comparison to sugar amounts honey um by the way you have a great guide for all of that on a cna C&H sugar and the domino sugar website they have it in spades on agave nectar use their test kitchens and worked hard on that honey is basically a hundred and twenty-five percent sweeter than sugar so if you use honey on you again could use slightly less and then if you don't have honey onion you're in your pantry then maybe you're going to need to substitute 2 cups powdered sugar plus one-fourth cup liquid will suffice to substitute for a cup of honey as needed again whenever you liquefy the sweetener you're using in your baking you have to adjust your liquids and then sometimes the acidity changes honey is one example that the honey board recommends that you use a half a teaspoon of baking soda for every cup of honey you use in your baking molasses and sorghum won't offer you wonderful flavors and I love to notice substitutions sometimes I'm out of brown sugar when I'm baking and you can take a cup of granulated sugar and simply cream in two tablespoons of molasses or sorghum and in a pinch I've used dark corn syrup as well and you'll end up with a cup of packed brown sugar it works well on so feel free to do that in a pinch when you just don't have quite enough brown sugar on hand corn syrup dark or light of course it's comprised of four coast and sucrose it is not a high fructose corn syrup and we recommend that you go to a site like karo syrup where they will give you really good specific recipes that have been developed by their chest kitchens for baking but again that corn syrup will give great attributes to your products of connected see but also chewing us to your to some of your cookies or other products you're interested in baking sugar and stevia light because you can use half the amount of sugar you would have called for in a in a recipe you automatically reduce your caloric content and then the stevia course what it this the sugar gives you the granulated function the stevia gives you the extra boost of sweetness that you need to make it work to cut your sugar in half your package gives you get great directions you can see a picture of a therapist and then also the website see an agent domino have again use their test kitchen knowledge to help develop great recipes here is an example of a non baked product where you substitute in and out different sweeteners but you end up with basically the same amount of sugar per serving so on the one on the left it's been awful lot of type on one slide I apologize but we used a solo marshmallow cream and it gave a really light fruit dip we didn't we went ahead and use the noisy tail light cream cheese we use some Greek yogurt along with it and we came up with this lovely light citrus fruit dip which is ideal for right now as the strawberry start coming in but again it was just 1.7 tsp sugar / dip serving we went ahead and then switched over and try to light agave nectar as our sweetener you see we only used a third of a cup for that and with a little vanilla extract and cinnamon and again we came up with one point three teaspoons sugar / dips serving so again it's a matter of realizing the 2 tablespoons is enough dip as well cookie traits Christmas I just want to run through these because sugar and fat the two functions we've just covered are really important for how your cookies turn out in a cookies of course are one of our favorite things to bake in the US on the stiffness of the dough and will make a difference and less moisture will make a difference in how crisp the cookie is so a very crisp cookie is typically low moisture it has high fat and high sugar and the recipe it will have to of course take long enough for the carmelization and gelatinous in to occur and then moisture to any moisture in the butter for example to evaporate a small-sized earth in shape like a pues le would be an example of a thin shape that's very crisp store these cookies to prevent them from absorbing moisture so I'm just going to give you my tip which is I like to bake a whole batch of cookies but then I like to freeze immediately after cooling about two-thirds of those cookies or more sometimes I will I will freeze almost the whole batch that gives me after I've eaten warm ones of course but that gives me a chance to keep them fresh without the chance of them absorbing more moisture my other tip is give away half of your cookies always give away at least half of a recipe you'll make lots of it friends and um you will need more than you need cookie trays for softness this is important again I'm usually there's more moisture in the mix so that gives you some opportunity to put in more fruit purees pumpkin grated carrot zucchini anything you wish to put into an oatmeal cookie for example you'll use lower fat and sugar automatically soft sugar cookies or one that just go back that was the popular cookie of the day back when my grandmother was around and part of that was because they do they could use less sugar and less fat because of cost and because of the war and so we might go back to some of those wartime recipes and say maybe they had it all together there sweeteners that will give you that softness and chew too or agave nectar honey corn syrup molasses sometimes we under bake them to get that attribute and I want to just caution you on that you may be sure your cookies are done you don't want raw dough in the middle but you do just bake them to done this and they will bake another minute on the cookie sheet after you take them out of the oven so keep that in mind and want to over bake them either I want to draw your attention to on our website home baking org we have a section in our educator resources called kitchen science & cookie science is a lesson in that an abbreviated version in that and then our Baker's lab also has Lebanon you'll also has multiple cookie science pieces to it chewing us similar to softness but again you're haven't you will have a higher sugar and liquid content a lower fat content so if you can live without the crisp cookies you will automatically typically have lower fat content sometimes you can get that chewiness with a higher proportion of eggs ok and then don't don't confuse egg whites with egg yolks the yolk is the fat portion that white is the protein portion and the whites will give you lots of structure but sometimes they will toughen things because of that pure protein that they are more mixing to develop the gluten or a stronger higher protein flour will also change the outcome the chewiness of that product if you're having too much spread you might consider this you will just crease your spread by using the superfine sugars that are available in some in some baking aisles you also if you blend the fat and sugar to less of it more of a paste and not so much of an aerated mixture your spread will decrease slightly um half shortening and half butter are a great way to see that cookie bake and set on in its the shape you want and I put cold after butter to remind you you do not want to over soften your butter and never use a butter substitute low you know reduced fat butter in a product unless the recipes been written for it you will automatically add too much water that cold butter is important if you can take the stick of butter and just slightly bend it that's that's warm enough and if you're using a mixer you don't really have to soften that butter at all just put it in the mixer turn on that turn on the beater attachment and you will see the butter softened just fine momentarily be sure you pre-heat your oven that controls spread as well you put a pan of cookies in the oven that's not fully preheated they will either get dark on the bottom or they will spread too much before they can set the other thing is of course cool your baking pans before you put the next batch on it parchment liners will also help you control spring now browning sometimes is something we see change with the change of ingredient substitutions if we decrease sugar sometimes we'll see less browning than we want so you might consider putting some dry milk in the mixture that will also increase the Browning if you change a sweetener to a honey or an agave nectar you might see it go up so you may need to decrease the the baking time you may need to decrease the oven temperature you may need to tent the product before the last 15 minutes so these are three options that all will help where stevia and sugar blend is concerned you want to be sure you follow the package directions and remember that there might be another ingredient if you're browning is of where you want it to be then you may want to turn around and use milk or honey for some small portion of that the ingredients one of the ingredients that will help with browning reducing salt and baking as a goal for many people this day and age we want to see our sodium reduced and at home we can do some things that it's harder to do on a commercial level you we typically use table salt and that is fine if you're using a kosher salt you actually for the same amount of sodium need to use perhaps more because the granulation sighs so salt does matter it adds flavor but it also has a function one of them is to control yeast to use too little yeah your yeast action may move faster one thing you can do is use cold or liquids to try to slow that e section down if you really must reduce your yeast more salt more than you typically should for good functionality and then it strengthens the gluten structure of the baked goods so you want to be sure you use enough salt so that it strengthen that gluten structure or you were going to real crumbly kind of crumbly structure to your bread too little makes the texture dense and heavy flavor will be flat or easty so they reset flavor component you should not be using potassium chloride in baked goods / if they are standing potassium chloride it just doesn't function well it doesn't have the same function on order the flavors works frequently so it's better to try to look at where all the sodium sources are in the bread or the yeast or there another use product but the baked goods daily sodium and potassium targets take a note of that potassium level we know our sodium target but do you know your potassium level because that's where these substitutions can help if we're using more whole grains if we're using more fruits and vegetables in our baking we will boost our potassium nuts or another 10 all of these will really help on potassium levels ready to eat of course is one of our biggest problems with too much sodium they are working on it too it's a high target piece of the puzzle but it in delivering food that's ready to eat and processed it's a big challenge look at these two comparisons so when you do it yourself the home repair is on the right side and I picked a favorite of our family chocolate instant pudding quick to do when I grab the box and I put the milk in I get 270 milligrams per serving if I take time and cook it myself and one of my favorite new recipes is this Cabot chocolate greek-style yogurt pudding when I prepared that recipe I immediately cut my sodium in more than half and that can be done across the board whether this is the rest to use or another one refrigerated biscuits in the can 360 milligrams I try to get really close on the serving size their 360 milligrams per biscuit and for your homemade clabber girl baking powder biscuits you're going to end up with 90 milligrams and again you're using a full tablespoon of baking powder but the salt can be controlled whether that use unsalted butter in that biscuit whatever you choose to do you can control that slightly Baker's choice brownie mix on it brownies are sometimes so much better than people give them credit for in terms of just so the values they have in them but the sodium still going to be higher in the box mix so keep that in mind if you want to do a little scratch Baking yourself on Betty Crocker's all-time favorite brownie scratch recipe will give you somewhere between 14 and 70 70 milligrams per brownie based on how you cut the brownie one slice whole grain bread commercially baked it's going to run around 170 milligrams or more and then your whole grain breads at home you can you can bring them down to 75 milligrams to 140 so to sum up and reducing sodium fresh home preps help smaller portions use some herbs choose unsalted butter you immediately save 90 milligrams of sodium per tablespoon of butter in the recipe so it's a great quick move greek-style yogurt again we mentioned that again you'll save sodium the light cheddars on like Cabot's is less in sodium than many of the full fat cheddar cheeses or other cheeses you've got to read the label check it out you can always cut your salt hopefully by a fourth of a teaspoon in many things especially if you've added Jesus seasonings or olives I'm these are all salty ingredients even milk brings sodium into a mix always try a yeasted waffle or a pancake I mean honestly we always think of these is chemically leavened but the yeasted versions are often times less than sodium because you can control the salt and you really only need a half a teaspoon per four cups of flour excuse me a teaspoon of salt per four cups of flour per package of yeast sometimes you can cut that back even more if it's something that doesn't you're not going to need it it doesn't have to have a long fermentation it will just rise more quickly again chemical leavening do provide sodium so in the muffin you're going to see coming up you're going to notice that I didn't put any salt in and yet I had plenty of sodium so and that was because of the Lebanese I want to take a generous minute or two to talk about weed flowers first of all but it is the structure of our baking so you want to think about what structure you want if you want stretchy strong dough like for yeast breads or even for quick breads that are packed with fruits and vegetables and nuts and dried fruit like raisins if you want a strong structure you need a hard wheat and that will be either all purpose or bread flour your softer reads will make a lower protein flour that's like a cake flour or a pastry flour and that will give you the tenderness you're looking for in those products all purpose is a blend of both self-rising is an all-purpose flour but it has the leavening in it several resources are good for you North American Miller's have some wonderful resources about how flowers made in cornmeal and then we could start offers some great resources to whole wheat flour substitution then any recipe you have to remember if you what you want is whole wheat if it's enriched bleached all-purpose it's not a whole wheat it has great attributes but it's not whole wheat and if it's if it's the germinated brand germ or pearl those terms all mean that it's also not whole grain it's still often enriched so that that is a good good thing to note any recipe can be half whole wheat flour let me just say that one more time any recipe you have should be able to be made with half whole wheat flour so if it calls for a cup and a half of flour all purpose do you use three fourths cup whole wheat and three fourths cup all-purpose you should be coming out okay if you're using good measuring methods and you see that little boy measuring the upper right hand corner there he's stirring the flower fluffing it up spooning it into the cop and he uses a knife to level it off a flat edge of some sort and so don't cut your corners or you should weigh your flour for pro really good accuracy whole grain on any label and in home baking as well means that you need to have a grams of whole grain ingredient per serving that could be cornmeal it could be oatmeal it could be weak whole wheat flour any of those will give you whole grain goodness so if you want to go more than half holy flower remember just try it and what you might do is if the acceptance of the coloring able is too dark for the lead with our eyes people in your life I'm try a white whole wheat flour and you'll see multiple options for that on the ground the baking aisle now but what it means is it's a white wheat the brand code is white instead of red or at least it's kind of a golden color and it's it will give you a lighter colored product it hasn't been bleached it's just white cocoa or chocolate will help you mask coloring soak and spices and veggies and other things brighten up the color or the flavors in a whole wheat product and i find it yogurt sour creams milk sour milk buttermilk all of those will help lighten up my quick breads so i frequently will try to use those as well especially when they're one hundred percent whole wheat you do not need more yeast in a holy East bread sometimes you can get too much ease that way so go to our baking websites that that offer use to research like that you'll see them in our membership section it's important for you to note that right now there's a there's a whole trend that says wheat is what our issue is with obesity it's important to look at the data we can offer you lots of that in spades through many of our members as well as the weed dudes Council but just note that in the year 2000 from the year 2000 to the year 2012 we have consumed almost 12 pounds less per capita of wheat flour so that means I mean our OB cities there are overweight is there but it isn't wheat flour that's necessarily the culprit in terms of ingredient allergies I want to quickly go through this to note that you should always get it diagnosed because if you don't have that as your issue it will make life easier for you and less expensive celiac disease is a disease it is not an allergy and it requires a blood test intestinal biopsy to determine it and therefore you want to encourage your clients to get that not just to come in and say oh my doctor suggested I go gluten free because what that will do it adds stress to their life lots of extra costs and often less nutritional value so the good news is that really only about two percent of our population may be up to five percent of our children have these allergies to ingredients and gluten hovers around one percent for celiac disease and then non celiac disease gluten sensitivity is estimated between one and six percent follow the research use good solid research when you're working with those issues egg baking functions I'm going to skim through this and cut to what we can do to substitute for eggs but just note that they do leaven they do give structure and they certainly give nutrition if you need an egg substitute you can substitute for one or two eggs and quick breads cookies muffins borrowers pancakes and there's three options that we use to egg whites and a half teaspoon oil will work it will be tougher though as a product you can use three tablespoons of water and a tablespoon of flax meal for every egg large egg and you can use a fourth of a cup of soft silken tofu cream well cream your butter and your in your sugar well then add your egg substitute and cream some more so you get plenty of aeration dairy substitutes include soy rice almond milks you should always compare them nutritionally with dairy milk and then um just one for one cream cheese again you can use a tofu based cream cheese substitute and that is 12 ounces of silken tofu two tablespoons of vegetable a teaspoon of lemon juice and a pinch of salt if you need to bake with nan wheat flours remember that the substitutions go like this first of all if you don't want to change the recipe at all you just want more variety of grains in your product you can take anywhere if you have a cup of flour you can use this up to a fourth of a cup of that cup of flour as any bland of non-lead ingredient and you shouldn't have to change your recipe I will say that if you use rye or barley flour you'll still get some gluten which can help you with your structure if you have a wheat allergy and you just have to get rid of the wheat then you need to use a bland just partly for texture and flavor party for functionality none of those non weed flowers except rye and barley will give you any gluten so you have to realize you need to use some guar gum or santhome gum at least a half a teaspoon per cup of flour to give you structure gluten-free is typically the same thing although they are not the same remember we barley and rye are not gluten-free and sometimes oats are neither but again the guidelines are on our website under the asura gluten-free and then we have multiple members that you should click on they will offer you things like land o'lakes does here gluten-free flour blends or agro corn starch has some great gluten free waffles our yeast companies test kitchens have come up with good gluten free guides bob's red mill has been much work as well as hodson villain king arthur flour let me show you my my trial and then we'll be done here today i took a great recipe to start with it was it was tested in the Kansas wheat Commission's Test Kitchen it's a whole white wheat muffin but I decided the things I would change about it and they turned out pretty well I took away part of the butter you see I went with a third of a cup and instead i used some golden flax meal for part of the oil or fat I then used hacked or even less than half the sugar by using sugar and stevia light and I threw in a tablespoon of molasses for a little extra color a little extra richness and then I sided I wanted to be multigrain so I it calls for two cups of flour so I took away a half a cup of the whole white wheat flour and I used a whole corn meal I used some brown rice flour and called it good and then I used my soda and cinnamon I used to have a cup of raisins and from there I used from a liquid grated carrot milk and Greek style yogurt and this is what my product looked like it has a nice kind of a crunchy too from the corneal great color I would have added more raisins and probably some nuts dispar taste but the carrot was all of the moistness was sufficient in my first trial I want to say to remind you to you keep on top of your baking temperatures we have great guide cards that offer you guidance there's also information on our website but you want to be sure your raw eggs are cooked completely and you want to be sure the internal structure of the breads are set so you need somewhere between 140 degrees for quick breads and 160 and then with yeast breads you clear up to 190 degrees for gelatinous ation cool those products properly wrap them after they're cooled and when you free you should freeze them and not refrigerate them if possible unless they're sweet in like cheesecakes offers you non-profit information online order forms and cover non-profit were very affordable we have 30 member test kitchens we have farmed kitchen resources and we want to award you money for your work so check us out now I want to thank you and Alice other questions officially a few minutes for them so let me take a look and see what we're adding up first of all I have a question that says should you remove two tablespoons out of the cup before excuse me I don't see the question completely here before adding the two tablespoons butter or margarine when substituting skim milk for whole milk yes put the two tablespoons butter in and then add the milk skim milk that's a good point where you find flax meal you should be able to find it in your baking aisle or your cereal aisle either one of those this is where you will find it and go with flax meal not the whole flaxseed what was the website that showed portion history is the nest the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute and we will post we will post that as well I in the in the online PDF of this this PowerPoint I'm glad to hear this is helpful thank you very much are there more questions if there are no questions I'm going to go ahead and I just want to move on one slide to remind you to do the post survey receive our free resources and and also you'll see the website will carry the recorded webinar now here is my email i invite you to ask questions if you wish to and i will i see i have a couple minutes i'm going to go back to questions and answers one question i have is parchment paper is too expensive to suggest and working with poor families substitution the substitution is what we have done forever which is simply if you unwrapped a stick of margarine or butter you rub that over the cookie sheet you take a your hand or your clean hand or you take a paper towel or napkin and you put a little vegetable oil on it and you rub that on the pan so greasing still works parchment paper is something that we find to be and I still consider it kind of a cool luxury because I didn't grow up with it either we didn't afford it so but it does have great attributes in terms of saving your pans from getting gummy trans sprays are also a lecture me truthfully and they aren't always so great for your pans baking temperatures may make the pan get gummy from the pan sprays so really a little oil or shortening or by greasing the pan is adequate anyone questions I can't thank you enough for coming online today I hope you look for on the resources we mentioned I flew by the gluten-free and the baking substitutions for flowers but on our website is a great lesson called baking for special needs and I encourage you to go online and look for that lesson it has much of the material and information that I covered in that slide our baking lab manual has even more so you may want to obtain a copy just to have as a resource to work with your clients it gives you so many great guides in it thank you very much okay everyone this is Alexandra again calling from cabot I just wanted to come back on the line and say thank you very much for attending this evening in this afternoon depending on where you are in the country we do see a few more questions coming in but we're just about at a time here so what we're going to do is we're going to post a list of questions and answers for you along with the recorded webinar and a copy of the PowerPoint presentation those will be available on both kappas website and home baking associations website and will shoot you an email in the next week or so to let you know where exactly you can find those resources more importantly to we will be sending you out a post webinar email by the end of the week which will contain a survey which we'd love your feedback on we just would like to know if we met your expectations what we can do better and what you'd like to see next time also anybody who fills out a survey will actually receive a free baking resource packet from us so please do take a minute and fill that out and I guess I will close up now thank you everybody for attending and I hope you have a wonderful evening thank you so much for presenting sharing wonderful job you", "gnk5hy0Oxh4": "[Music] so [Music] hi guys it's latina it's here again

apple pie is going to be enhanced with this vanilla and cinnamon from madagascar thank you again sandy from free on this so first i'm going to make the sugar dough in a food processor cream butter salt vanilla sugar and almond milk and then i'm going to throw in the egg blend well and throw in flour in two times mix to combine wrap up and chill fair enough this recipe requires some work so don't panic just plan things ahead make the crust one day and the other things the following days next in the agenda tour shell so we've got enough pastry here to make three pies work out about a third of the dough until soft enough to be rolled out the pastry though should remain cool and supple so you want to roll this out into a 5 millimeter or point 20 inch thick disc separate work out about a third of the dough until soft enough to be rolled out if it gets too soft put it back in the fridge for a little bit the pastry though should remain cool and supple since i am using a fancy brioche mold as you can witness you want the dough to be a little thicker than normal good news you can use any tart pen you like yet i am just showing you a fancy way to making a multi-layer spy to get all of the details about it tips and tricks at brunoalbus.com the refrigerator is your best friend freeze the tart shell before baking and pop in the oven at 350 degrees fahrenheit 180 celsius for about 20 minutes egg wash and bake again look at that papa how gorgeous egg wash the inside and bake again for a few more minutes this is what i love about baking you just combine a few ingredients together and this is with what you end up with isn't it amazing to follow let's make the hazelnut cream the same protocol as a sugar dough i'm going to cream the butter sugar hazelnut and almond meal and then the egg [Music] how's the nut cream done next i'm gonna bake two healthy nut cream cookies for my two fancy pies though if you use a traditional top pan pipe out and bake the hazelnut cream straight into the raw or blind baked tart shell next we're going to prep our vanilla ganache monte which is an upgraded chantilly infuse the vanilla in half of the hot heavy cream blend in white chocolate add gelatin and the remaining chilled heavy cream along with some sour cream chilled overnight next we're going to take care of the apple marmalade i'm going to bring to a boil the apple juice throw in there a couple of cinnamon sticks cover and let infuse for about 30 minutes remove the sticks add the agar gar mixture and cook for 2 minutes and chill overnight next i'm going to peel some apples peel core slice out cut into botone and then cubes it doesn't have to be perfect the texture of the apple cubes mix in the marmalade as we're gonna see it later gives a very pleasant mouth feel so i am going to saute half of the apples in butter brown sugar and cinnamon for about 5 minutes on high heat meanwhile i'm gonna blend the chilled apple juice marmalade [Applause] and the secret ingredient is le monsero look at this texture this is incredible then i'm gonna fold the cooked and raw apples into the apple juice marmalade next the crunchy paline mix milk chocolate with butter pineness bread or nutella and crushed corn flakes or fernandina so the crunchy paliner is going to give a sensational mouth feel guess what we are ready for the montage with vanilla chantilly ganache malte to medium firm pigs wow i mean look at that this is so good you can definitely feel a very pleasant aftertaste from the sour cream which goes so well with apples this is the full season by the way so take advantage of it this is the perfect dessert for your holidays and it will definitely surprise your guests i hope dear fans you have enjoyed this one of a kind crunchy apple pie episode to

that being said that's a grab one of the smaller sisters here I see any of like wow real real soft or light real lightweight tree right here Wow nice stuff you're getting a real like different aroma off this one it's the most sweet but at the same time it's like alright to explain exactly the Roman is coming off of here but you can see trichomes deeply embedded in each cracking crevice and look at this living in fear yes this is a cross between a white fire 43 and sour apple you can just see the trichomes this all over shining glistening it almost looks like the letter in the way to me let's say that closest thing could get that wasn't expecting there look at that camera doing a real good job focusing we try to focus it one more time we're on the ground my leg is no way to see the trust

this is why we choose quantity over quantity and as I just ripped this open its smelly even more sweet you can just see the trichomes stretch and look at that up our fingers look at that right there you see it yeah we're not exaggerating when we're talking about these tries like it's just stuck on my finger like I don't even need to bring up any others like it like just a big sister we see the big sister is before you know we get to breaking her down into the bow but let me get this big sister see ya she looking trying to get the natural lighting off of it okay so this is the natural lighting of the natural color I'm assuming it's kind of hard to get that natural color especially with a fluorescent light like this being a necklace you see Wow look at that just all over the strain let me see if I can get it get one more focus in here trying to hold this [ __ ] still I doubt it unshaken oh yeah there we go the natural color you see the charm listen I'm not exaggerating I don't like a force up in here so it is negative weird my fingers are shaking and [ __ ] but yeah this is that sour apple killer I'm excuse me this is the jungle apples from jungle boys you see it you're not exaggerating here so let's break her down and get into the bowl so we can see truly how she tastes hope you guys are ready for this so I get this on here this it's not different man I would just go sit in there if I could I would say right there yeah let's get into the ball hope you guys are ready for this yeah yeah yeah you see everything is broke down packed and ready to go and as I was breaking this down this train is the most light and fluffiest I've come in contact with in a while I was so surprised on how light and fluffy but sticky at the same time I was so surprised like you can see the trichomes is still glistening all over the little hues of purples we're looking nice long orange hairs so it has to it has a little taste of everything here just we've seen a lot of strains and you know this one's different so but that being said let's get into the bone and see how she truly tastes because yeah you see this is that new jungle apples strain from jungle boys so cries we'd seen a white fire 43 and sour apple so with that being said let's burn this fire you don't get it as immunity for the session how ironic is that music night off not working all right yeah do it wakes all over the place if I usually have it tangled up I wrapped tell me why I had to come in if that was gonna happen you guys let me get something out there my stuff it just a little bit was I gonna do this instead of hard sometimes you gotta find a hole in the bottom there we go yeah did you guys sorry about that striking around - that was the first that assumes but real smooth real [ __ ] smooth excuse my language said I'm gonna curse my man and it had a nice little aftertaste of like apples right I don't know if you got to be thinking I'd be like exaggerating what they said but I taste something back there and it tastes it tastes like an apple [Music] yeah it has some type of taste to it it's real smooth though but I would consider it being an apple taste but you know everybody else has their own taste buds and way of tasting things but it tastes it's tasty I could just say that it's tasty not really feeling it yet but it's in a 30% or so maybe a creeper you see it that's the white ash all day every day I'm starting to feel it kicked in now it's starting to feel really on the hive inside like really in the middle like I'm feeling it in my body and at the same time stuff on my head too but it's a nice one not too much there's not seeming too strong but it's kicking in so with that being said I'm giving the jungle apples eight out of ten make sure you guys like subscribe and stay tuned more flavours coming soon until then turn", "kVI6X3fVnQY": "hey guys this is girl hermes welcome back to my channel says today we is getting lit if you are not 21 over please click off this video but today you guys i'm going to be eating some edibles so i decided to copy stoney gummies but i actually had these before but honestly just one like tab is it is enough to get you you know buzz or feel high but i'm gonna have more today okay i have it in watermelon i have it in papaya and i have it in cherry lime so these are all of the different flavors you know what i'm saying and this is how they look like so it comes with five gummies it comes with five gummies and it's extra strength 350 milligrams of thc so i'm guessing that the whole entire package is 350 milligrams my friend gave me one tab before and i just felt a little high i don't know i don't know you know what i'm saying but i'm only gonna have two today so i'm going to pick two two gummies that i want i'm gonna have two of those i'm also gonna have these nugs so these are medicated chocolate cookies and cream nugs you know what i'm saying so we'll see how these look like once i open them so i'm going to pick two of these i'm just going to pick two random ones and those are the two ones those are the two i'm going to try for you guys all right so i have these two in my hands so let's see what they are this is the cherry lime and this is the papaya i love you want to try the watermelon but it's cool it's cool so i'm gonna try the papaya first y'all my hardest raisin a little bit because every time every time i eat edibles y'all it literally don't work for me i either don't feel i either don't feel nothing either i stepped through it whatever the case may be i've never like had a full-blown high off of it edible but anyways this is the papaya it looks orange it's orange and like i said before these are little tabs i do not suggest consuming this whole entire thing y'all but 350 milligrams isn't a lot for me you know what i'm saying so it all depends on your tolerance we'll start off with start off with one and then move on so we rip one off this is the papaya one so let's try that it's currently 6 37 and yeah it usually takes an hour or so for edibles to kick in way longer than smoking you know i'm saying way longer time than actually hitting a joint so there we go and you just gotta suck that bad boy out you know what i'm saying so this is i don't know how many milligrams in here but not bad at all no wheat smell no we taste no saying very discreet if you're trying to be discreet so no issues with that now i have the cherry lime one i want to take that i'm so scared i'm looking getting scared i don't know if i should just have one of these and then one of the nugs all right how about this i'm gonna have two of these right and then in an hour at 7 30 i'm going to see how i feel i don't feel like you know super lit then i'll take the i'll take the nugs as well so i'm gonna take another cherry or should i just try the nugs right now right all right i'm just gonna try the nuts instead the the nuggets then but with the nugs you guys this is 450 milligrams you know what i'm saying 450. it's definitely higher than the sony gummies so i might not even need another stone yummy i might take notes for me don't i might take another stoney gummy depending on how i feel so these are just chocolate bars in here i thought it was going to be those nugs that are chocolate but it looks like weed you know what i'm saying that's what i thought those were going to be but i guess not but anyways these are some pretty it's like a pr it's like a cube it's like a chocolate cube and this is cookies and cream cookies and cream is my favorite if you did not know because in korean my favorite chocolate bar it's one of my favorite chocolate bars and yeah so let's give this a try don't smell like weed i don't think it's that good it has it tastes like cookies and cream but it has a like an aftertaste to it it tastes a little like it tastes a little spoiled you know what i'm saying i don't know so with the nugs you get six you get six chocolate um bars and these have and there's different flavors of these also so i got cookies and cream and yeah you guys it's kind of sexy it's currently 6 40 and i'm going to come back in an hour or so to other you guys so stay tuned you know i'm saying all right so i was pretty comfy in my bed as you guys can see but i don't care about the setup right now but anyways you guys it is one hour later you know what i'm saying where's my phone right there it is one hour later and it is 7 38 you know i was saying i took the idols around an hour ago and i honestly don't feel anything like i don't feel abuzz i don't feel slightly nothing so so with that being said i'm going to try the other one of the gummy sony gummies i'm going to try the cherry lime one now since i don't feel much at all i'm going to try the cherry lime one now and yeah the 75 milligrams per chocolate bar and with the gummies it's 70 milligrams per gummy so i've had i have one stony gummy i'm about to have another one so that's 140 plus the 75 that's 270 milligrams yeah i don't think that's much for me so i'm going to take another one i'm about to take another another tab this is not good cherry lime but anyways you guys it's 7 42 now i'm about to wait another hour and another hour i'll be right back if i still don't feel nothing i'm gonna have another chocolate bar so let's see y'all by the way i paid 20 a pop for these so i'm pretty sure i could find these cheaper online but i paid 20 a pop for these and for everything but are they worth it i don't know because i don't know because it's like i have to eat a lot for me to feel anything so watching some youtube videos about to go back to that i'll see you guys in a little bit okay honestly i feel a tad bit like i felt have a bit high you know i'm saying but okay um

windy outside speaking a lot of noise now I was eating something easier today and they are absolutely amazing oh I don't know if I'm ghetto well that's ingredients oh that's a lot of text a lot of very small text so 200 grams well there we go yeah I was even going to the day for some reason I thought that we're gonna be Riley's even though the picture doesn't show them to be around I just thought that a cookie so they're gonna be around no they're like this so you have to already the other night really enjoyed them also I'd seen that it was apple pie cookies and I didn't see the bit about strudel so I thought that was just gonna be apple pie but no they're better than that now sometimes apple strudel can be a little bit overpowering because I have too much spices and things input this is a beautiful balance between apple pie and apple strudel hmm it's a nice crunch but it crumbles it crumbles very nicely look at that beautiful Apple in obviously but a few of the fruits I think I'll check the package um let me see that's really small text no but you can see by the picture there are other things in there I think currants raisins couple other things I really can't read this there you go Apple raisins donut is really tiny writing but they are absolutely beautiful oh yeah like I say they've got a very nice crunch to it but they crumble beautifully see Oh a little smack on there nice beautiful so if you see these anywhere I would get them right car number weary : I really can't nevermind so they might thereby Berber I think that's what that says so I would look out for that apple pie cookies I really don't know whether we're I think they were in pound world I think so yes or the word pound so please subscribe for daily content thank you for watching and I will see you in the next one", "B0K8c2iTjG0": "hey everyone it's time for a spooky bake today i'll be making an egyptian mummy apple pie it's extremely adorable spooky and super easy so let's get baking all right we'll start off by making the short crust pastry put some flour and butter into a food processor and pulse it for about 30 seconds [Music] you should end up with a crumb like consistency just like this add your sugar a little bit of cinnamon and pulse again until it's evenly mixed this will give the pastry a nice warm color next add one tablespoon of 15 milliliters of water and pulse again for about 10 seconds finally repeat again with another tablespoon of water the consistency should be like sand at this point [Music] dust the surface with some flour and gently push it together to form a dough be gentle because it's important not to overwork the dough otherwise your apple pie will become too tough and if you don't have a food processor you can of course use store-bought pastry or even make this by hand this needs to rest in the fridge for about 30 minutes so let's wrap this up in cling film before moving on to the pie filling let's talk about apples i'm using pink lady apples here because i like the tang which balances out the sweetness but feel free to use your favorite apples here jazz apples or even granny smiths are also good choices basically anything with a bit of a tang is good next peel and cool your apples go slowly because there are a lot of apples and you don't want to cut yourself [Music] then cut it into one centimeter pieces just like this if you want a bit more of a bite then you can also chop them up a little bit bigger [Music] before we cook the apples i'm also going to mix some water and corn flour together we'll use this to thicken up the filling later on [Music] in the large pan melt some butter and cinnamon over a medium heat once fully melted throw in your apples and sugars to cook for about 10 minutes make sure you give it a stir once in a while to stop it from burning at this point pour in the cornflour mix and stir until it thickens up just like this remove from the heat and let's move on to lining our baking tray grease the pan with some butter i'm using a 35 by 10 centimeter tray with a removable button you don't have to go over the exact same thing but make sure the overall area is about the same it's time to roll out the dough make sure you flour the surface and rolling pin generously roll the dough out in both directions into a sheet about half a centimetre thick and make sure it is long enough to cover the whole tray to pick up the pastry sheet without breaking it i'm going to wrap it around my rolling pin this makes it much easier next gently lower and unroll the dough onto the tray if it rips a little that's fine just use your finger and push it back together and make sure the pastry hugs the tray properly just like this once you're happy with it take the rolling pin and run it across the top of the tray this cuts off any excess pastry that's a neat little trick thing you think time to fill the pie the key thing here is to make sure the filling is flush against the top of the tray i've used an offset spatula to do this but you can also achieve the same result using a fork or spoon to make this look like an ancient egyptian mummy i'm going to take the leftover pastry roll it out and cut it into little strips about one centimetre wide you can also use the tray to gauge how long each strip needs to be now for the fun part lay the strips across the pie in the random pattern just imagine a spooky mummy as you do it and it will come out looking great finally make an egg wash by mixing an egg and some water together apply a thin layer onto the pie before baking at 180 degrees celsius or 335 fahrenheit for 20 minutes so this recipe was inspired by the every nuke and cranny food blog all the measurements and link will be in the description box below after 20 minutes in the oven it should look lovely and golden brown you should also be able to smell the caramelized apple too leave it cool at the room temperature before removing from the tray time to give it some character get your edible googly eyes and carefully paste them into the pie they don't need to be perfect and all that's left is to cut into it and enjoy it smells absolutely divine and the apple filling is super gooey and caramelized let me know if you enjoyed this recipe and if it's spooky enough for you take care and i'll see you in the next one", "xq4tmWQmcBU": "what's up guys welcome back to my channel hope you guys are all having a lady day if you are new here don't forget to smash that like button subscribe to the family i really need a name for you guys comment down below any suggestions you guys like would like to call us like what can we call us something cool my name is rocio what can match with rosie the only thing that comes up to my head is roosters and i don't wanna got you [ __ ] roosters because i don't even like [ __ ] chicken like actual chickens in real life the animals i'm scared of them enough of that though i'm gonna be reviewing this really pretty cartridge today look at it it's so [ __ ] pretty it's the new edition the new strain addition to roaf the strain is apple pie it's a hybrid and the packaging is definitely different than the other ones it's like a i don't want to say rose gold because it's more like on the pink side with some sparkles on it and then it has some gold as well i mean maybe you can just call it rose gold right but i don't really like apple pie but we're gonna see what this is all about this is a half gram and i'm really digging the packaging let me before i open it though let me go ahead and let you guys know how much thc percentage it does have and this contains this holds up to 88 i mean this has 88 oh look at that right when we open it the packaging is gold definitely different it has the rove what has the r right here for rogue which is [ __ ] sick i think i'm gonna keep this packaging just because of how pretty it is i really like like packaging that grabs my attention and this for sure grabbed my attention even the cartridge itself is so different i wish i would have brought one of the older ones to compare it but if i do i do have one at home i will be inserting it to show you guys the difference oh look at that it does have a big-ass air bubble though i think that was because i did have the cart in my car like upside down and also what i do know is that these usually come black i don't know it it came red this time which is pretty interesting and i just noticed this one says happy holidays how cute all right enough of that i'm pretty sure you guys want me to tell you guys how it tastes is it getting me high [Music] and let's talk about to blinkers get you more hmm are y'all fans of blinkers or nah personally i don't like taking blinkers every single hit that i'm taking out of a cartridge obviously i mean i don't know if anybody's out there like that but i feel like majority of us that do do blinkers we won't be doing it just for fun it's mostly like well we will do for fun but we'll only do it for like challenge wise i used to think for a while um when i was first smoking cartridges that inhaling it inhaling the smoke longer by just holding it until like there is no smoke to exhale was like much better and it would get me more high and i came i ended up doing some research and turns out it don't even get you more high the longer you hold your hit so there's no really reason for you to be doing that i connected it to my every let's go ahead and take it oh my god it tastes super super super good super super good i do have it on one of the lowest settings on every because i didn't want to see um i wanted to taste more of my cartridge and that tastes like apple pie i never tried apple pie but i feel like this is how apple pie would taste because i can taste the apple flavor but it don't taste bad god definitely i like the flavor i mentioned this i mentioned this the other day that i i haven't i have said that i like more um constituents on the terpene side but and i so i think i like strange that tastes sweet to me on the flavor side it's fun smoking them i'm gonna go ahead and change the setting to green i've got more clouds in the green setting i can still taste that flavor for sure but i for sure notice that i got more clouds right off that hand the thing i do i like about rope is that i feel like no matter how long of a hit i take or even just a hit in general because for all my cartridge smokers you all know there comes a point where cartridges just mess with your throat it like feels rough on your throat from smoking it so much but i feel like rove i've never had that problem with rope it's always such a smooth hip and their flavor um accuracy is on point like all the time i think my favorite one from them is wowing like wowie is such a good strain i wonder if in the future they will come out with any live reds and cartridges because this is not live resin this is only distillate the only thing was that they did have like a special edition the strain they went all out with the packaging shout out to bro not sponsored obviously but they they're doing it right have you guys checked them out which is your favorite strain i definitely recommend trying this straight plus it's a hybrid mixture of both indica and sativa so i actually just checked you guys i don't know how i was mentioning oh you know they should make um they for sure should drop live resin they actually do would you guys like a live resin review on robe versus regular regular distillate uh just live resin review comment down below make sure you guys drop a like any comment to show you guys support i really appreciate you guys who show endlessly love we are now at 7k [ __ ] subscribers like i don't know it's just so damn mind-blowing like damn we hit we did that we did that [ __ ] right before the year ended 8k coming soon [ __ ] y'all hella coming in glitch and y'all always show how support there's some haters out there we ain't tripping off them okay hope you guys all have a good [ __ ] day and enjoy this video and until next time", "t5-6Bm96NNQ": "hi there guess what is going to happen today do you remember the vanilla creme patissiere apple pie i made at my brothers for those who follow me on instagram i bet you do remember reaching more than 100 000 instagrammers truly amazing here we are [Music] [Applause] [Music] i'm back first i'm gonna make the custard and infuse the milk with vanilla meanwhile i'm gonna make a mixture of egg yolks sugar flour and starch mix the whole thing together at once indeed you don't need to beat the eggs and the sugar first it's totally useless [Music] and you're gonna end up with this how gorgeous by the way this is a great trick to cool down your custard faster put your baking tray in a freezer bring milk back to a boil and temper the egg starch mixture pour it back to the remaining milk whisking swiftly bring to a boil and cook custard for 2 minutes without stopping whisking then transfer the pastry cream onto your frozen baking tray line with plastic wrap let it cool completely and chill in the refrigerator in the meantime i'm gonna get my tart shell done using a nine or nine and a half inch 24 centimeter diameter fruited tart pen that should be generously greased next i'm gonna roll out my puff pastry scraps just like that so the reason why you want to grease your tap pan with butter is that the dough will more likely to stick to the mold be gentle when you apply pastry against the edge of the pan and then create a quarter inch thick lip just around the seam of the pan then trim off excess dough and lift up the lip you just created tart shell done freeze it until ready to use and to make this beautiful pie i'm going to use those amazing apples they are called hidden rose apples they are produced here in america in oregon beautiful pink color and those taste like strawberry lemonade quite interesting well if you can't find those good news you can still using other variety of apples such as golden delicious granny smiths pink ladies honey crisp royale gala so that's your choice but look at this that is i'm so excited because i have never tried those apples before so it's an experiment and i'm pretty sure it's gonna be marvelous next i'm going to smooth out the pastry cream like creme patissiere look at that it's completely chilled it's beautiful i'm going to remove the vanilla beans you want to reuse this i'm going to rinse it let it dry so wait until you've got a few and then you blended the whole thing with a powerful blender sift it and you've got your vanilla sugar from scratch how cool is that perfect for your warm churros money feet now you're gonna end up with something smooth without any lumps and this is exactly what you are looking for all right baby let's add the creme patissiere and then we're gonna arrange our apples in a beautiful way grab your frozen tart shell pipe out creme patissiere and overlap your apple slices into tight rolls indeed think about one apple per serving this spice got eight be generous generosity always pays off top with some of your homemade vanilla sugar and bake for about an hour a good pie reminds us of our childhood and when you create emotion with it you've conquered people's heart i hope guys you enjoyed this exceptional apple pie episode well to get the full recipe go to bruno albus.com for now please subscribe like my page on facebook and by the way try this out take a peek and tag me on instagram bon appetit and see you very soon this is it you", "Bm-0FX4bJjM": "so am i filling here and as you can see it's much chunkier and almost a little gross looking at this point because that pectin and the coolness of the room has started to kind of react so this is about us Oh since I want the stulosophy farted in my ears with me a lot smooth they're just fishing uh probably more at the moment anyway so I've rolled out some pieces already so I'm gonna go ahead and just you just lay this in and since it's been in the fridge for a little while sounds waiting so it's a little firm so it's a little easier to pick up but you're gonna do the same basic idea that you did yesterday just press this slash form it into the edge shell I'm gonna let all this excess just kind of hang out there sometimes when things fall people fall right and then I have this piece which I deemed more appropriate for my lattice cos I'm not gonna put my filling in just yet and just like form it cut my strips and then put it all together with right glasses so for the lattice you still want to roll to the same basic shape and size that you wanted for a regular crisper Foreman and then you need to start playing strips so these have a straight edge or a ruler I know you guys have the rulers and then each wheel or whatever helps them and ideally you see my rulers are the funny enough numbers but you wouldn't you mark straight like you guys do in your chocolate class we have to cut all those brilliant but this ruler is awesome and only ones here and fighting grip because it has a mark right in the middle you can see through it so I can just kind of cut based on that guys I like the lip of it you're going to go at about either a half to a little more than a half maybe by these strips okay it doesn't matter what you do have by these loans are consistent that's really so with this ruler strips that are the width you've seen maybe those tools the tools that you can get there like a doctor who does use the real doctors on girls well it's like a doctor but it has strip so you meal and it shreds out to a lattice if you're doing a lot of the men but there's nothing better than a perfectly so from here the middle line of my ruler lines up perfectly the cut marks that I need so again you can fight over this thing before you can do a little they don't have any flour down on my table right now because I'm pretty confident I'll be able to pick beans up it's a little bit dry since it's been in the fridge but if you have freshly rolled you may want to do a small bit of flowers to save yourself the agony of trying to field-strip off tables so from here and then going to not was filling as cool ish it's probably not cold but it's at least not hot it's not gonna melt anything you should be able to use almost all iment alright because ideally it's to manage fries that you just made if we made it in a team of two but you would really just have to kind of look at it and decide if you need to use at all or if you have to hold some back because you don't want to be like yesterday's because it's not going to be well the lattice doesn't hold up nicely in a large don't so you just want a slight dome to the pie you just want to make sure it's as full as it can be without being like you don't want it to be black you know I think okay so just a slight dome I usually end up using almost all of it and then I save a little bit to do at least one mini five because I really like and I don't like cherries I don't least and don't like them they're not my favorite I appreciate their flavor so you're gonna do your five strips across or seven if you're doing a little more than a half an inch width if it's more like five eighths five is usually appropriate and if you're doing a half sometimes seventy-two program but either way you have to have enough strips number one and you have to make sure that the width of your strip and width of the space in between is sort of people all right so I'm going to start with the longest one and I'm going to go straight down the middle and then I'm gonna take something maybe a little bit shorter and I'm gonna try to match the width of this space-wise place another one and then maybe a short one for the side and will across that way and then the same thing in the other direction so they end up with five stripes across that's mine makes sense to me five because something thinner it might make more sense to do all right for this one I really wanted to focus in on straight lines even strips perfect squares okay when we do it we're going to do a different Pilate er you're going to give some minis and then you can kind of get fancy but angles and the diamonds whatever you want to do for this I really want you to focus in on the correct all right from here it turned it and I'm going to start to do the lights on the inside so you take the middle one you bend it back and then not the next one but the opposites longest strike rate down the center and then fold everything back and I take two outfits well those backs just be very gentle with your dough because it could potentially crack as you're trying to do this almost and then one last time with the middle and the two outside I'll show you a little technique at the end when I'm finishing it the car behind it fixing it you we start with another step if you have enough but there's a way to hide it so you really want to focus in on these poles the squares making sure that they stay square and that they're relatively even all the way around that you don't have something better like this far apart something of that far apart the other side you start with two golden and then you have the last so it's perfect lattice up-down up-down left-right left-right doing this with Apple is the easiest because apple pie filling is kind of like the color when you do look very and cherry the Bluebird and Charlie will eat if it's hard to not get marks just don't worry about it too much but they could go away so from here I'm going to I never trim off the outside edge so sharp very nice but this works best and just kind of cut down right along the outside edge of your chin try to keep your strips and wait like don't let the and then I'm just going to work matches to make sure that they don't if you don't seal them somehow and others and Penzias will pop up and everything so using flour because a lot of times at work and try to do it you don't don't relax too much otherwise it's cool this also sort of evened out both the second layers because what happens if you have like thin layer there technically under I think some of it burns and some of it is kind of helping to make sure that you've got an even layer kind of all the way you've done that and we want to take your night one more time and trim again because it's to squish out it doesn't look something and then which there you wanted to go completely plain and that would be pretty much with Chile hey watch it if you have some craps or if you want to get fancy you can take some scrap pieces because our going to be rolling all of your dough at once you're gonna need to cut some discs for your mini pies all right so I used my largest ring cutter I just rolled out a piece of dough just like horrible and then I cut and I had some extra pieces here so it's taped them and I'm going to use some of these fun cutters that I have to punch out some shapes and you can do fall leaves you can construct everyone just borrow them so you can little cut and then press the spring it's a little mark into the dough all right and you can like if you have a crap you just put a couple there I don't want coal thick covered in but you know but we've there make one there something you know sort of nice is fine right if you do that you probably you do it now I might just pick them up and they wash underneath them and stick them back down again just to all right so that's gonna go into the clerk and I'm going to let it chill for like at least 10 minutes then I'll pull it out and I don't wash it just to quickly show you how this works you have that large ring cutter from your set you cut out a little disk place it in just kind of same idea just kind of press it in and try not to have a fold or anything like that I have streusel topping I want you guys to do at least one full top and one in the little mini Atlantic and then after that our perigee right some people like to roll out dough and just use cutters and cut out of a bunch of shapes and like kind of lay them over the top sort of so you know whatever get created you just live in and then you have fillings with these fillings the same thing with Apple you want them full but not heaping you don't need it to spill out everywhere it's kind of messy now and again chair so when doing a full top x fired penny at your pad whatever works for you you want to make sure you have a vent hole so this is where these little fun cutters come in I always like to do the sort of quintessential to verify my Romanian I brought my son last night so I just kind of played tonight I don't know anything it's huge just like that but you know you can do different cutouts you can even then white glue these back on you know a little sign on the top whatever works for you if you want to get fancy and you have little fingers you you just roll it try to encapsulate the bottoms over grab the bottom at the same time try to roll together so from there doesn't look like much but if you kind of the one thing about a flute is that you always want to make sure it sort of sits atop the edge of the pipe if it hangs out too far over chances are it's going up right so you want to make sure that it sort of sits in tight and then from here I can you will and if your filling is spewed in your like mine let me and I want to chill this it's a little easier to clean up to because everything has to be chilled and then for this one I like to do mini lattice and you can go with your ruler and your pastry wheel or the width on this is not extremely important just trying to go for it try to be as I linked you odd numbers unstuff but I probably could do four across the floor across my body to be free makes more sense and with this one hits little tricky trying to make sure they're squares a brat - you know is going through perinephric item move things around as you've seen fit to make it more a little Hey", "S4zjNt10xYA": "hey lovely people so I just wanted to do a quick update and review of stony patch stony patch edibles because I noticed that in the video and the first video I posted about this edible a lot of people were telling me this isn't what they were getting so poor oh wow like the first five times I went to go purchase this in DC they came in a cube shape like this there was just like cubes and very chewy like they're just like a barian gummy type of edible now this is the first time so I've been purchasing these things for a couple of months now and this is the first time I'm actually getting the pack that people are talking about which look exactly like the original sour patch kids and they look like this okay so I'm just gonna eat one right now this is the first time I'm seeing them looking tasting and feeling like actual sour patch occasion I have to admit that when I tried these compared to the ones I had been getting before these the ones that look like sour patch is are less powerful less potent I got what I would eat like - I really wouldn't feel anything but these I would need like a half of one of a half of one of these squares and it would be good the texture is different as well so I really don't know what's going on according to both packages they both have the same ingredients they both say they are in compliance with the CA prop 215 SB 4 xx section blah blah blah I'm sure there's some type of DC law but I don't know um so yeah maybe I would have to eat more of the sour patch kids ones in order to feel something but the other ones we're buying like I am not sure why they're such a difference but yeah I just wanted to make it update to let you guys know that I did I finally know what you're talking about when you're saying oh my pad looks just like the sour patch cake okay I get it I know I know what you're talking talking about now but when I like I said like when I first started getting these for the first time they look like the squares like this this is like what I was introduced to when I was interested introduce this Tony fetch as a product so yeah I'm wonder with that Bell no idea everybody look it up anyway if you have any questions comment below and I will get back to you of course yeah and have a good one here", "YPObmVG7rO0": "hi everyone I'm really excited to tell you about our seven flavors that are back on the menu this spring debuting in March it's March so that means st. Patrick's Day we have our shamrock Pie for a limited time it goes pretty fast and that pie has a dark chocolate cookie crust bottom we make our homemade pastry cream and flavor it with mint and then we put whipped cream on the top and the chocolate Andes and then on top of the whipped cream it's really delicious so The Veronicas raspberry divine pie is so delicious and everyone loves it and everyone gets really mad when it goes off the menu we can't possibly have all of these pies on the menu year-round and speaking of raspberry pie really excited to let you know that the raspberry pie is on the menu here this spring and you'll be happy to know that the sandra's lemon sunshine is back on the menu that is such a delicious pie with the graham cracker crust bottom and then we have a layer of the cream cheese filling a layer of our lemon meringue filling and then we have whipped cream on the top of that it's really delicious and our very own Sandra has created that pie we have also made a very small amount of our corn beef and cabbage pot pies and that is corn beef cabbage potatoes and carrots they are located in our front freezer so you can take them home and bake them they take about an hour and 20 minutes maybe an hour and a half at 350 degrees so also on the savory end of things we have to keep a con the menu they're very popular we do the Mediterranean quiche and the broccoli and cheddar quiche both of those are limited time only so there's a link below to our online store you can pre-order all of these pies be sure to subscribe to this channel and login and let me know in the comments below which flavor you are looking forward to the most so give me a thumbs up if you're Irish and I'll see you next week [Music]", "7P4KWLjq-h8": "hello friends my name is jen and i love cookies today i am reading another cookie i have been anxiously awaiting that is huge so these cookies are from world's best dough and actually you might be able to see it better on this side their cookies are huge so i have ordered four of them they came in this box with some cute stickers um they are very heavy before i have our kitkat apple pie strawberry pop tart peach cobbler pie and [Music] white oreo and cream so as you can tell all of these are massive um they recommended that i heat the one that i want to eat in the microwave for 45 seconds so i'm gonna do that and i think i'm gonna go with the kit kat apple pie today because i'm in sort of an apple mood so of the four i think this one might be the flattest and it's about of medium weight so you can see it is quite thick and it's also huge if we use my standard palm scale you can see it is in fact bigger than my palm this is what it is it's my face um it does smell pretty aptly i see like broken up apple pie kitkats on top of this and potentially some other apple pie as well so this is what it looks like on top and then as i mentioned it is quite thick i am expecting this one to be stuffed on the inside so pretty excited to find out but now i'm gonna go stick it in the microwave for real and i will be back so what i immediately noticed is this cookie actually got larger in the microwave so you can see that it has kind of split here and i'm afraid to try to pick it up yeah i don't think i can try to pick it up i think it will fall apart so this appears to be a consistent shine with cookies where they're like oh you should microwave it but then it's like when you do it falls apart and you can't actually eat it i'm going to try to pull off this section no that's i'm going to have to eat it with a fork so next time i eat one of these i'm not going to microwave it because i want to be able to eat it without a fork but i just think that's gonna be the only option here it smells amazing though it smells like your bacon cookies and i just stuck it in the microwave for 45 seconds i'm a little worried i'm gonna burn my mouth but we'll see what happens this is a special cookie it's like i don't know if it's just because i really like the apple pie kitkats but this tastes really good i did not burn my mouth which is a plus um i'll show you i'm gonna eat a little bit more of it before i show you but the texture is very similar to the um cookie pie that i just rated we're like it's so gooey on the inside but not in a way that's alarming it's like oh yes this cookie is baked but because i heated it up it's now very gooey on the inside so you know how when you make cookies you're supposed to take them out of the oven when they're not 100 done yet because they continue to bake on the cookie sheet and that's what you how you end up with nice soft cookies as opposed to overbaked crispy ones and then you take the cookies out of the oven and you don't want to wait to eat them so you eat one right away while it's still like really warm and gooey that is what eating this cookie feels like it's like baking those um break and bake pillsbury cookies and then eating it like literally fresh right out of the oven um i am gonna try to show you i do i'm starting to come across some filling here it looks like it might just be more broken up kitkats which would make sense or possibly some white chocolate chips but this is what the cross section of the inside of the cookie looks like so far i don't feel like it's the gooeyness of it is accurately reflected in the camera but you should know that it's very gooey okay so the filling that i could see previously was in fact just white chocolate chips but i have now reached a point where there is clearly an actual kit kat right there in this cookie um also the more that i eat the top i can confirm this crumbly stuff on top it's definitely just broken up kit kats kit kat did not break up well with my fork so now i've just kind of like pulled out a layer of this kitkat which is interesting i've never seen kit kats come apart by layer but it's probably because they were microwaved the wafer portion of the kitkat is a little bit like chewier um than it normally would be which i don't love eating it by itself but when it's mixed in with a cookie like with the pieces on top i think it's good um it's a little strange though isolated also this will probably surprise nobody but this cookie as a whole is overwhelmingly sweet i feel myself getting cavities already but the dough itself isn't too bad actually it's like it's the parts with the kitkats i think let's try so just the plain cookie dough by itself is a reasonable amount of sweetness but with the kitkats mixed in that's what make me feel like i'm getting cavities actively but it's so worth it because the mixed in apple pie flavor is so good so while i was a little upset that i had to end up eating that cookie with a fork after i microwaved it i'm gonna go ahead and say it was absolutely worth it of like gooey on the inside cookies that i've had this one was by far the best executed the outside stayed nice and cookie like and the inside was just very gooey so it didn't make me feel like it was undercooked the texture was just like wonderful the warmth made it like really delicious and melts in my mouth i'm pretty sure the dough that they used for the cookie itself was like more or less standard sugar cookie dough but something about it i think in addition to the fact that it was warm made it uh particularly good i really liked the broken up kitkats on top and scattered throughout i think the white chocolate chips that were mixed in were a nice touch but honestly unnecessary um i only encountered two like actual kit kat pieces that were longer portions of the kitkat as opposed to broken up and i think i'm glad there weren't more those were not my favorite part of the cookie they just ended up like a weird chewy texture that i didn't particularly like but when they were broken up into little pieces they were really good so um because this is the best executed gui on the inside cookie that i've had and i was a big fan of the apple pie i am very much looking forward to trying the other three cookies that i've ordered from here but with this one i think i'm gonna go with an 8.2 so as a reminder that was the apple pie kitkat cookie from world's best dough i found them on instagram they have drops as far as i'm aware four times a week i think it's tuesday wednesday thursday and saturday um tuesday and saturday are normal cookies wednesday are protein cookies and thursday are vegan cookies so the ones that i ordered are not protein or vegan cookies but after that first one i would definitely be willing to try either um and i think these ones actually ship internationally but i'm not sure in any case you can definitely follow them on instagram world's best dough on instagram um it was a great cookie i am very pleased with that experience i am going to probably go brush my teeth now though um if you like watch me talk about cookies please like comment and or subscribe below thank you for

welcome and for those who I knew and to say thank you for stopping by as you can see today we're making some apple roses this happy world is filled up they do look kind of completely edible pretty simple I can assure you so to start with it - to do this let's just get some flour in a bowl we are looking for we are actually looking for kind of some puff pastry dough so right here I have my flour I'm just going to add my salt and my sugar into this flour my baking powder also and then and grabbing my eggs preferably what we're looking for is a puff pastry but I'm using regular dough because I'm gonna use cutter place to make some biscuits so right here I'm adding my heavy cream I love using heavy cream because he's like three-in-one for me okay my extreme one what I mean is instead of adding butter and milk and I and water I just used my heavy cream so it tends to do like three things in one so that's right rubble and I love the texture I usually add me so right now I'm just going to use my hands to elude these dopes properly to get something close to of piece pieces when I'm using exactly puff pastry we're going to pretend we're going to pretend that were using puff pastry so right here I have my apples and listen to people's I'm just gonna cut them cables and if you like you can call them as a tease but I'm just going to slice them first before so I'm going to be slicing them very thin slices for the first one I've sliced that's to be I'm just trying to make it as thin as possible so that when I start rolling them in the pastry it won't be that difficult to roll so now I finished I put it in the bowl and put water and I put some lemon just to be able to keep the color so it doesn't change the color doesn't really follow the actual but I made a mistake here I ended up put living the lemon inside the water for too long and it changed the color but after this I put it in a microwave for about one minute just you know soften it a little bit without a dream do we water like I said I left it for too long so you see how soft that slice is that's what I'm looking for so right now I have my sugar and cinnamon I'm making cinnamon sugar revolt my dude right there as you can see so I'm brushing it now with my water melted water and I'm gonna drizzle a generous amount of cinnamon on top was fighting over the pastry I'll be lining up the apples on top of the dough so I lay down the apple slices place one overlapping the other already so we're folding them half up all the way worth for them to do up I will press them down to seal now we're drizzling some cinnamon sugar again well this way it depends on you depends on how if you really love it will be really sweet you can put more now I'm gonna just roll it [Music] not too tight from holding the petals in position at the same time I'm just rolling slowly you roll from one end to the other don't make it to be super tight because it's gonna expand at the end when you're baking it so at the end you have something that is similar to rolls so you transfer this to your run you can just put it in because that's what we're going to be using to bake this lovely then at this point you can just give a find out touch of your cinnamon sugar on top you do the same to the second one you fold it up nicely and then you put your egg wash or your water for this I'm using water and brush with water and then you sprinkle your your our whole ceiling on top if you like again just like you did for the first one it's your choice sometimes you can put more whole family or you just do it out for this role and eat no food but for the first one I call the Sun look at that can help that leeks so we're going to transfer that to already greased ramekin drizzle some generous amount of cinnamon sugar how sweet you want it to be you can just put it down right now I'm going to put it in the oven for 350 while you can make it 400 I just want a movie for 350 for about 45 minutes okay and then voila is ready look at how they look - really really look gorgeous you would see and then you just let this cool before you unmold them from the oven time so it's really well have to really look gorgeous they look so beautiful and it tastes incredible so I just take this final touch by drizzling some sugar on top some powdered sugar look at that so thank you so much guys for stopping leave the comments as usual make this and the outcome thank you for watching", "-ZlLDm7YR3s": "/ very briefly is a new product that's out and being used very frequently by many people is called CBD oil so what I want to verify with you and go over is that that is not psychoactive which means it doesn't change the way that you think but here's the main difference you have the cannabis group of plants so there's two plants you have the hemp plant and you have the marijuana plant the marijuana plant has a lot of THC in it if you look at the percentage it is greater than 10% marijuana THC psychoactive the hemp plant has less than 1% THC in it so what it doesn't have an THC it makes up for and CBD oil so here's the hemp plant this is high in CBD oil low in THC this is low in CBD oil and high in THC so something kind of interesting between CBD and THC is their chemical structure okay this is a little bit of science chemistry but it is related these are called isomers because they have the same atoms but just rearranged differently like this one has one chlorine and it's on the first carbon whereas this one has one chlorine and it's on the middle carbon so they have the same molecule sorry same atoms just different configuration well the same is true with CBD and THC they are basically in the same family they have a lot of the same features just one does it make you high and the other one THC makes you high but the other one does not so here is the difference THC and CBD you see see 21 21 carbons 30 hydrogen's and two oxygens so it's crazy how just a different arrangement of the atoms can lead to such a different experience inside of a user's body so I'll finish with this informational video with all the weed trucks and imagery all over New York these days you might think to yourself hey marijuana legal now not quite what these companies are selling is actually something called CBD it's found in everything from lollipops to lattes and business is booming CBD products are part of what is estimated to be a roughly 1 billion dollar industry in the United States and it's perfectly legal so what the CBD have that marijuana doesn't factor the matter is we're kind of in the midst of the CBD craze right now Martin Lee is the director of project CBD an educational platform that focuses on cannabis science and therapeutics CB d stands for cannabidiol that's a component of the cannabis plant that has significant therapeutic properties but it's not intoxicated that doesn't get you high like THC as it happens not all cannabis plants are created equal take a look at these two varieties one is marijuana the other is hemp one gets you high the other doesn't the key difference is what's on the inside THC and CBD are the main components THC is what makes you feel high and marijuana plants are loaded with it hemp on the other hand has hardly any THC at all but what it lacks in THC it makes up for with higher amounts of CBD now CBD won't get you high but it does have a redeeming quality it's legal and at least according to the marketing it has a relaxing effect so since this stuff is all the rage let's see how it's made so once you have a cannabis plant one simple way to make extract can be done in your own kitchen as simple as using olive oil or butter and heating the trim from the plant or a little bit of the green material from the plant obviously that's not very useful for mass industrial production - to be cooking up something in your kitchen with butter and cannabis but the more common way involves a specialized complex machine one very widespread way is using what's called a supercritical co2 extraction it's ground up to be to have the texture initially of like a coffee grind and it's poured into vessels literally of a supercritical co2 machine it will stay in that machine for upwards to 24 hours under different pressures and temperatures at different times of the extraction process and ultimately you'll end up with a thick golden oil that's very waxy and texture you can also extract it using ethanol and hydrocarbons you can find this oil in a number of different products these days it can be administered in various different forms it might be ingested it might be applied topically they even have CBD oil products for your pets I stopped by a cafe in New York which sells all sorts of CBD infused products I tried a CBD matcha latte and a CBD macaron these snacks tasted great and I felt a little more relaxed after it was hard to tell if the CBD was actually doing anything for me or if it was all in my head scientists are actually still trying to figure out exactly how CBD affects the body so there really is a scientific basis for understanding why CBD can work but we're still really a long way of mastering the house still CBD may have more benefits than just a relaxing afternoon some initial studies have shown that CBD can help a number of different medical conditions in fact in June 2018 - FDA approved the first CBD drug at the dialects which is used to treat epilepsy so who knows perhaps we'll be seeing CBD in more places than just cannabis decorated vans in the future", "A0PKAfe-63s": "Hello!

gone yeah big thanks Ashley [Laughter] yeah", "B_z4yAX6Grw": "what is going on my peeps welcome back to a kind of sporadic middle of the week video so for this oh you're wondering about my sweatshirt where I got it and where you could get yours it's in the tough part of the description it's the david seymour store go click on in the link and check out the stuff i always feel so filthy doing self promo at the beginning of a video like that look but anyways today I am doing geometric pies part two if you guys were around last year around this time I made the part one it's just to give you some extra ideas on how to change up your pie game for the holidays now obviously the inspiration from this for BuzzFeed and myself comes from the Instagram page local kitchen which posts a ton of really interesting and difficult designs for pies today I'm picking out two to get some inspiration from this one with just like a bunch of shapes punched in the top because I think that'll be somewhat easy and then this one a mosaic of some sort which I can already sense is going to take me hours to complete I have seen a few comments and I've gotten a few tweets asking me to do this video this part too so thank you to those of you who have so let's get right into it [Music] so guys if you have watched to any video of mine in the past 2 years that involve pies or pie crusts you would know where I'm going with this this recipe is the Katy Perry cherry pie crust it's super easy if you forgot some pie crust at the store or you just don't want to eat doughy chemicals I suggest you give this a try the only key here is to keep the butter as cold as possible that way you will get that flaky layers of butter when it melts out in the oven kind of like the same concept as a croissant but like I said it's just really easy and once you've got them into disks like this I just popped it in the fridge and in the meantime we're gonna start working on the actual pie fillings not just like last year and every time I make pies you have to do an apple pie come on it's just it's my favorite pie it's the best pie ever created in my opinion typically it is better to use a variety of apples in your pie that way some will get a little bit soft there so I'm will stay more firms and will be sweeter you get the point unfortunately today all I have are these agretti Smith's to work with I spent some time peeling them all and then coring them trying to remove any extra little hard bits in the middle of these pieces and now for the most pivotal parts the most specific measurements just throw a chest up in the bowl where your apples cinnamon brown sugar normal sugar lemon juice kind of like any food related video Logan Paul has ever made ever as my grandma always says you can never have too much cinnamon and sugar and this is looking good so let's prepare the crust a word of advice if you take your pie crust out of the fridge and this happens just give it some time at room temperature it'll eventually warm up a little bit and you'll be able to roll it out I think it's cuz that butter just hardens up so quickly in the fridge that it's really hard to work with that first but you should be able to roll it out after a few minutes I laid my first one down in the bottom of the pan and then tossed in my apple mix-a-lot of the apple juice has kind of been pulled out by the sugar this point so try to not dump it all in there or else you'll have an apple soup and now with the top crust instead of doing a bunch of like circles and squares like she had all I could really find was a piping tip and this weird pill shaped molds I don't even know what this was from but I'm gonna use it the thing that I like about this is it's just limited to what you can find in the house or what you can buy in the store like any shape theoretically should work for this whatever you think will look the coolest whatever won't hopefully rip into pieces as I try to move it from the countertop on top of my pie thank the heavens it did not fall apart on me and what's it trimmed around the outside of the pie and brushed a little egg wash on the top this one's ready to go but I'm not gonna put it in the oven yet until I have my strawberry one prepared so yeah for this next one I figured I'd try something that I've never made before which is a strawberry pie last year I did blueberry which ended up being really expensive who knew blueberries were so expensive well for this recipe I just followed a random one I found online basically consisted of water and cornstarch and sugar brought to a boil I took some time to remove all of the stems I trapped a bunch of strawberries in half I want to say I ended up using five cups at the end of this and of course you want to give them a wash to get any other dirt off of them and apparently all you need to do is throw the strawberries in with this weird gelatinous mix at this point it does have jello as well which is an arch-nemesis of mine I don't love anything involving jello but I just followed the recipe and I left the mix to the side while I rolled out the bottom crust once again and laid it in my second pie tray I dumped in the strawberry mix and now unlike the last pie I'm gonna have a cover on the top of this to try to get the top as flat as possible for that mosaic pattern and that's looking pretty much good I'm hoping it doesn't seek down too much in the middle when it bakes but I took all of my crust scraps and the little circles that I cut out from last pie and I died that already using some gloves so I didn't have red fingers for the rest of the week and now begin the grueling process of I want to say two hours cutting out triangles and isosceles triangles and parallelograms and try to piece together the top of my pie this was not fun in the least bit my pieces were even bigger probably two or three times as large as the one from the Instagram picture god knows how long it took her I don't even want to know cuz this took me a long time but now that our two pies are complete I toss them both in a 400 degree oven the strawberry pie is only gonna get about 35 to 40 minutes I took the foil off halfway through so the crust could get a little bit of a brown but you do want to leave the apple pie in for at least an hour as I pull them out it's the moment of truth the apple pie first that is a yikes from me you can't even really tell what the shapes were supposed to be this is a really good like expectation versus reality and not for the strawberry pie which I took out of the oven earlier thankfully this one looks a little bit better the shapes kind of look decent still upon cutting it to it though I realized we had some problems this is probably the soupy aspire ever seen in my life it looks more like a milkshake I scooped some pieces onto my plate and I guess we got to give this a try now can we get a picture of what I was originally going for and now cut back to this come on man that's not even funny I mean if it tastes good who really cares like these pies are for me and my family so whatever honestly it tastes great that pie crust is like it's impossible to mess up it's so good the apples are cooked well they some a little bit of a bite on the inside which I like the flavors good so I mean it's ugly but it's a tasty ugly party and now for this disaster again if it tastes good I don't really care I wouldn't bring it anywhere I'd be embarrassed as all heck but let's see it tastes good to me I don't know if anyone would eat that at the sight of that especially with the weird red pie crust on top but it tastes fine like I said last year this video is not to show you a specific recipe it's just to give you some more inspiration so it's not that typical pie crust on top that everyone uses so I call it a semi success I do hope you guys enjoyed today's video though if you did give me a big like once again my merch isn't a top line of the description my twitter and instagram are down there as well new video for you friday have a wonderful Thanksgiving to those of you who celebrate it oh then I'll see you right back here next time [Music] well next it is not happening until two hours it's too cold in our house that's the problem do you know what tripe trypophobia is well you're gonna learn because my comments are about to be flooded with it it's the irrational fear of a group of holes you've never heard of such a thing it's there's like pictures of like groups of straws for many holes don't pretend like you have it now just cuz we're talking about it cuz when I was a kid I used to having weird dreams about like plastic straws", "CVsx4OYsbGs": "this caramel dipping sauce is so good and there's so many uses for it you can use it on pancakes you can use it with your apples you can use it in your coffee and of course it's awesome over ice cream it's also the perfect gift because anything you make with your hands shows love and it's not super expensive and yet it's fabulous everyone's gonna love it and they'll want the recipe now at the end of the video I do have one more surprise use for this caramel dipping sauce just hang tight one of the secrets to this caramel dipping sauce tasting so good is you need to Brown the butter and you see when you see those brown specks coming up on your butter that's this point I want you to stop cooking it stop browning it and go ahead and add the remaining ingredients which the ingredients more tips and tricks and everything will be down below in comments no problem this recipe doesn't take long the only time consuming part is once you've got all your ingredients incorporated you do need to cook it until it thickens up I do have to give you one warning once you make this you're gonna have to keep making it because everyone's gonna ask for it again and again if you're gonna give this as a gift I use the really small ball jars but you can use any cute decorative jar you want I have tons of little plastic kitty bags that I keep on hand for every holiday and every occasion use whichever ones appropriate and I like to put one caramel sauce in each one and one Apple in each one and then decorate it accordingly if you don't mind when you see the picture of my little puppy Rosie please subscribe to this channel so we can keep in touch and I can get new recipes to you if you have any requests let me know and for my surprise caramel apple pie that's what I also use this recipe for and that will be in my next video as always happy eating everyone [Music]", "MXDrGe4kbmk": "well Harley you guys aren't good at following instructions a couple days ago on Instagram I posted this photo with the four options for what you guys wanted to see this week and I very clearly row in the description the comment of mine with the most likes wins no extra comments will be counted only the likes on my comments well - all 462 of you that have commented on this so far learn how to read I'm very sorry for the people who had to scroll up 28 pages to get to my original comments but the geometric PI is one with just over 1100 votes and clearly you only picked this because you think it's gonna be the hardest and you guys want to torture me for some reason I'm gonna take on that challenge today I'm gonna try really really hard to get these rights so with all that being said let's get right into it not as much like in the Katy Perry cherry pie video we're gonna make some homemade a pie crust and it's pretty straightforward I started with two cups of flour some sugar and some salt and gave that a quick list and into my dry ingredients i cubed up eighteen yes one eight tablespoons of butter this is just over - space - like two and a quarter I was obviously mixing this by hand because the butter is still so cold it was just easier to do it this way but I then added in a few tablespoons of cold water and although the recipe calls for six tablespoons I only had to add three before this ball forms together and now that my dough is looking good I wrapped it in some plastic wrap and threw it in the fridge while I made the filling now obviously for a blueberry pie you're gonna need a lot of blueberries and I had to buy four cartons in the store which we're $6 a piece that's gonna be $24 for blueberries this is a very expensive pie but to those I added some sugar and salt again along with some tapioca starch and lemon juice now the tapioca stuff is very easily found in the jello aisle I also don't really know what it is or what it's made out of but if it's anything like gelatin I really don't want to know and now that we got our bowl of blueberries and Andres prepared we can hop right back over to the dough I cut a little bit out of it and rolled out the bottom circle for the pie at first this was a little bit breaky and hard to work with but once it comes back down to room temperature a little bit you can roll it out pretty easily plop that into my pie tray along with the blueberry filling and as you can see we're a little bit short with the amount of filling that we're gonna need but should still work the same and with the remainder of my dough I had to roll it out even larger and you're supposed to cut this in some thin strips I don't have a long metal straight edge ruler like this I just can't find one so I'm gonna try to do this by hand and get these as straight as possible as you can see they were coming out a little bit on the thicker side I'm just hoping I'm gonna have enough strips to complete that whole spoke pattern the top but once I cut as many as I could I threw down a little plastic cup in the middle and tried to form the same design that they had in the video I'm not really too sure how far apart to put the strips er at what angle with the middle of the pie and it came out looking okay definitely not the same as pasties nonetheless I threw it into a 425-degree oven for 15 minutes and then let it finish at 375 for another 40 minutes in the meantime I'm gonna work on pie number two which I'm Way more excited about I whipped up a quick apple pie filling which is my grandma's a famous apple pie recipe in other words just throw a bunch of random crap together until it tastes good it's just basically consisting of some salt lemon juice brown sugar regular sugar and cinnamon you get the point and when that was complete I had to whip up a second batch of dough for those of you keeping tally at home this is now almost 5 sticks of butter used in this video now this time before I add it any water I grabbed a handful of the dough out because we're gonna dye that a different color on the top but with the rest of it I added in the water like I normally would and finish kneading it together and with this other stuff I want to try to dye it red and in the video they use some roasted beet roots I use that a few weeks ago and I don't feel like staining everything in my kitchen again I'm gonna use a copper out some liquid food coloring just add a ton of drops of that and a very little bit of water and after a bit of meeting you got this nice pinkish red which should work pretty well also side note it seems as if in their video after they bake the pie that the red dough on top loses its color anyway I don't know how that happens or if it was an editing mistake but just to be safe we're using the nice artificial food coloring it just like before I rolled out the bottom half of the dough to put on the bottom side of the pie tray and this time with the rest of the dough I want to try to get some nice even strips and like I said I don't have a rule so I went around my house and the closest thing I can find was yeah I found this dusty old level in my basement and tried to clean it off I'm hoping I'm not going to catch any rusty metal disease from this construction meets baking that's what I'm going to call this segment clearly though I made a good decision because once I was lining up all the strips this was working pretty dang well including with the red dough which by the time I used it it was a little bit too warm actually so warm that I didn't even need to cut it I could just push the level down into the dough and cut it like that top 10 weirdest things I've ever done on the show maybe it's gotta be up there either way I finished cutting my strips tossed in the pie filling into the pie tray obviously with the bottom dough and then started to make my almost like a bacon weave on top except with the different colors of dough I had a lot more red also so I did two stripes of red one of white and alternated that on both directions obviously this process takes a very long time I left a little space between each strip because I didn't think I was gonna have enough and luckily I was right because I ended up using every ounce of dough that I made and once it was complete just like the last pie I threw it in at a high temperature first with some tinfoil on the top this time and then just turn the temperature down and let it cook another half hour I was pleasantly surprised to see that both of the designs pretty much stayed intact let's try to get some nice even strips and like I said I don't have a ruler so I went around my house and the closest thing I can find was yeah I found this dusty old level in my basement and tried to clean it off I'm hoping I'm not going to catch any rusty metal disease from this construction meats baking that's what I'm going to call this segment clearly though I made a good decision because once I was lining up all the strips this was working pretty dang well including with the red dough which by the time I used it was a little bit too warm actually so warmed didn't even need to cut it I could just push the level down into the dough and cut it like that top 10 weirdest things I've ever done on the show maybe it's gonna be up there either way I finished cutting my strips tossed in the pie filling into the pie tray obviously with the bottom though and then started to make my almost like a bacon weave on top except with the different colors of dough I had a lot more red also so I did two stripes of red one of white and alternated that on both directions obviously this process takes a very long time I left a little space between each strip because I didn't think I was gonna have enough and luckily I was right because

the temperature down and let it cook another half hour I was pleasantly surprised to see that both of the designs pretty much stayed intact I think the first spoke one kind of seeped into the blueberries a little bit but they still look pretty good so I got a piece of each one and now it's time to give them a try why hasn't anybody thought of colored pie crust before I feel like somebody has had to do that but I've never seen it I'm going to try the blueberry first because it's their filling recipe so I have to judge it a little more seriously it smells really good though I'm normally not the biggest blueberry pie fan we got rather eat apple pumpkin cherry over this but alright um but this is really good I don't know if I've complaints the crust is cooked nice the bottom isn't soggy it's not super grossly sweet I'm happy with that not out of ten and now mine which is probably not very good since I just threw stuff together nevermind that tastes really good the apples might be a little undercooked they kinda are still too crunchy but it tastes really good if you have the time or the means especially even for Easter this weekend if you're celebrating that's a really good idea just throw some food coloring in it and it comes out pretty good I'm impressed but I hope you guys enjoyed today's BuzzFeed tastic", "3VT5vmu6TR8": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "tiydbycHA44": "today I'm going to show you how to make these rose shaped pastry desserts using an apple take your Apple cut it in half and remove the call like this then carefully slice each half of the Apple into thin little strips put all these into a bowl and cover them with two tablespoons of lemon juice to stop them browning next cover the apples in water and put them in the microwave for five minutes to make them nice and soft if you prefer you could do this in a saucepan on the cooker whilst you're waiting sprinkle out some flour lay out some puff pastry and roll it nice and thin use a sharp knife to cut it into strips like this then take one of the strips and spread on a thin layer of apricot jam when the apples are nice and soft take them out of the microwave and drain away all the water then start layering the apples one at a time over the edge of the pastry it should look like this fold over the bottom half and carefully roll it all up into a rose shape pretty cool huh place them onto a lightly buttered cupcake tray and bake them in the oven for about 35 to 40 minutes at 190 degrees C which is 375 degrees Fahrenheit when they're ready carefully remove them and leave them to cool and to finish them you can dust them with some icing sugar or add a little cinnamon they look really pretty and they taste great you can serve them as they are or try adding some custard or ice cream I hope you've enjoyed watching this video if you want to see more you can click on the links on the right hand side or take a look at my youtube channel page stay safe have fun and as always thanks for watching", "SmpeZqyWJaM": "hello and welcome back redneck stacking fear reviews now I bet y'all can tell me without even looking at my title or anything what this review is gonna be about by looking at my hat I will praise stupid done' but that's how it's gonna be today I look stupid I'm fine with it so Krispy Kreme has three new pie themed Donuts two of them I feel like you know they really had stuff like this before that if I had all three similar things before but you got a chocolate one you got an apple one and you got a cherry one so I'm gonna try to go through this pretty quickly I cut them all in half chocolate one does not look too promising I don't even know if the cherry wants specially filled apple one half of it look pretty well filling other half didn't I'm gonna eat the hat that's pretty well filled but we'll run through this real quick and I'll tell you what I think um I did stick these in the fridge overnight so might not be as good as a fresh doughnut would be but we'll see the other half a pie tomorrow and I'll probably stick the microwave and I won't review that but I will review today the ones that I did not heat up it feels fine it's just a little more firm from being in the fridge so yeah I'm gonna start with the chocolate won't well no I like color I do chocolate last even though it looks like the most disappointing that I'm gonna start with the cherry well I like chocolate hot even if there's the potential for a disappointment so I'm not sure if this thing was supposed to be filled I don't reckon so cuz it looks like it's got quite a bit of cherry on top so I will like look up and make sure but we'll see how it just tastes in general and I'll give a rating based off the taste basically it's not bad but it's nothing special about this donut and just top of a cherry flavor so you just want a regular Keystone at top lip cherry Ison I reckon that will be right down your alley I'll give it a seven because it's not in a special but it that's kind of please and taste i F pie yeah this one looks like it's duck type of apple pie stuffing you were to expect there's got like a camel topping on it basically and some streusel we'll see let's one-stop potential it has really good a lot harder it comes out it's cold but just kiss a job done I genuinely feel like I'm eating an apple pie that won't easily get to ten no doubt about it and now will probably be the best one of the three because I don't have high hopes for this chocolate one but I definitely recommend that one very sure no no chocolate one so far I just say so nice trout with chocolate icing but that Topman they got on it I don't know if it's just regular ice and what it is it's pretty good and it's not bad but the fact that it lacks icing in the inside I mean Phil takes away from the purpose and the best buy I had a whole doughnut was the spot that had chocolate killer and it was still good doughnut but the fact that it was disappointing and filling was just not there I have to give that a 6 because you know I could just buy me a regular price doughnut iced with chocolate and it being the same thing if that would have had more chocolate filling it would have sufficed for what it's called a chocolate pie donor um but it was okay but it was my least favorite um my favorites apple pie and I would you know more likely I would say most Krispy Kremes are probably going to have more filling in their chocolate pie donor than that but it's not bad and I would recommend trying all three for sure I'm just telling you that I'm giving out of six because it was a disappointing doughnut from my experience that doesn't guarantee it will be for yours say if it had the filling in there I might give it a seven and a half or eight but it's a six for that one right there and I've been to a lot of Krispy Kreme they don't have the highest quality when it comes to filling a doughnut but I did like the apple pie and I saw the other half of apple pie doesn't look quite filled so well so I might not be happy with that part of it but I made sure to try the part that was realistically trying to you know be what the prototype of this was and that's perfectly fill donut that reflects what they were trying to make out of this and so I gave down a ten out of ten because it was really good and other two were fine and ever everything but if you were to go to Krispy Kreme and say I just want one doughnut get down pop donut so those will be out till after Thanksgiving and then we'll price you some crispy dangerous I wouldn't expect anything - wonderful - amazing just like with Halloween we didn't get anything new we just got regular flavors so I know Krispy Kremes occasionally we'll do like a random donut it's not around it's like not a usual DotA but I'm not expecting that so yeah till Thanksgiving I hope y'all check out Krispy Kremes pie donuts they're worth it I'll be around this whole week we'll see how many reviews I get in eight a lot today if you check out my Instagram redneck snack and food you'll notice that I've got a your tailgate box way overpriced for what it is I gotta tell you a box from Bojangles and I've eaten like half of it I have two sides half the chicken which it was eight pieces of chicken so I hate four pieces of chicken so I've had a lot of food today so I might try and sneak one more review in today cuz I really want to get in at least two per day but we will see depends on how my stomach feels but if I'm not back just y'all have a good day and I'll be with you all the rest of the week for sure um but make sure to comment like subscribe if you have it and definitely share this video you definitely want to put me out there with three Krispy Kreme hats on my head someone called me the Krispy Kreme Pope yesterday and I say that's a compliment I take that as an honor but anyways I will be back soon and I don't know how soon but it will be soon so I'll see y'all around guys have a good day", "UsBaRVdplw4": "what up so how do you like that Marcus dude cinnamon and sugar on Apple's is amazing and you should eat them more often I've never had a puff pastry before of you know pixel is it that much different from like a pie crust or it's like apple pie to me so it's supposed to be like great uh-huh where do you think this will I have to play when you think of apple pie thank you it's okay like it's not something that I would normally choose to eat but I don't regret it when I do so you'll eat it if I hand it to you yeah but if I say hey it's ready do you want something to say no I will be putting in any requests so earlier and I was like hey do you want some you're like not right now you're just gonna do that until I handed you a slice which is what actually happened I handed you a slice and I was like try this that's my approach to apple pie but then when you tried it you didn't regret it right it was good so when you're eating it you're not like dude I need to eat this more often your brain never says that no trying to think this tastes better than I then you remember yeah I'm trying to think what my brain does that with I feel like that's cotton my brain kind of does that with donuts it's always like no I'm cool but then if I if I eat one it's like no but I think it's really good you know whereas you you're like I don't regret this as your chewy never thought that what Union donut I've never been like hey brain I don't regret this which is like a subconscious way to say you're kind of regretting it what you're trying not you're trying to dr. Phil it just keep it yeah anyway so this is the easy recipe um I made a little bit too much so in my blog I posted I guess adjusted recommendations but since this is my first and only time ever making this it's just kind of like shooting from the hip anyway so I'm sure you could figure this out all on your own but I used a pound and a half of apples which was a third too much so I'd say a pound of apples is probably more than enough so this one that I'm filling right there is not over stopped and it popped beautifully and then the one after this i overstepped so the the sides kind of pulled apart which I don't know that's fine by me no problem um we'll see everything is edible all right I don't need any of that trying to focus I I don't know I think Apple like baked apples are completely underrated because I underneath them because I never eat them and I don't know every time every rare time that I eat them I'm like damn dude this is like so like clean and delicious like these don't have a ton of sugar these are not crazy sweet um they're definitely sweet oh no it's just way different than eating something else what would you rather be eating what do you not even you think about the word regret when you eat what kind of pie we regret what do you never use the word regret in your mind waited eating in the realm of pie yeah we're like dessert motakay well I will okay i'm rephrase that what about fruits like what kind of fruit pie would you be like  yeah hurry up yet two seconds for the only fruit pie I've ever had was apple pie all right how many other three you're not qualified to answer dude cherry strawberry blueberry all the Perry's each bus time saw strawberry pie all the time seeing one right now Strawberry Shortcake there we go it's a cake listen dude the emphasis is on fruit apples of different Apple any dude no this is way close very close anyway anyway the full recipe is on the blog and dude that caramel does not taste like caramel kind of it's delicious it tastes like coconut had a baby with some maple syrup even though it's just brown sugar but it was easy to make all of the details are on the blog and peace the out strawberry shortcake", "4VHinzj-sAE": "i want to find this girl i know i need to take her out i set a snare in evening air made of faith and hope and down i want to spend some time with her learn the secrets of her train i wouldn't mean to cross the line and look into the other side forbidden to my kind forbidden to [Music] mankind i need to hang out with my love the raven head it's bright i know i'll never dance like her or keep her up at night i need to hang around with her i need to let her know her cause is mine i'm but a slave i look into her wondrous gate and taste the strangest call and make the purest noise [Music] she will appear [Music] and take her to my favorite place music rushes in [Music] should go the other way [Music] beauty crumbles with [Music] music is for us [Music] you", "JTvwlEJ1Xu4": "- Hey everyone, you're\nwatching Preppy Kitchen! Where I, John Kanell,\nteach you how to make delicious home cooked dishes to share with your friends and family. Today we're making an\namazing peanut butter pie. Flaky butter crust, creamy\npeanut butter filing, mounds of whipped cream,\ndrizzled with chocolate and then chocolate-covered\nroasted peanuts. This is the best thing ever, so let's get started. For this pie, I'm using my super delicious, crispy pie crust recipe. You can click up here for\nthe full how-to video, but basically it's 300 grams of flour, 1/4 cup of sugar, 1 cup of butter, cubed. Whiz it all up, and then you're gonna drizzle in about a 1/4 cup of ice water with two tablespoons of vodka. Super fast. And, let me just show\nyou, this thing is... It just smells heavenly,\nand it's so crispy, I love it with the creamy fillings. However, if that's a\nlittle bit of work for you, you could totally do an Oreo cookie crust. Click up here for that recipe, it's in my 'Mud Pie' on the blog. This is ready to fill,\nit's all chilled up, I made it a few hours ago, and now let's make this filling. It is so fast, it's gonna\ncome together in a snap. The filling is just a few ingredients and it starts with, of course, one generous cup of creamy peanut butter. Right in the bowl, it does\nget a little bit messy. That's not so bad, thanks rubber spatula! Eight ounces of room\ntemperature cream cheese. If you only have cold cream cheese, take this foil wrapper off and pop it into the microwave for\nlike 30 seconds on medium. Just like you're heating up butter. We're gonna cream these\ntwo ingredients up. (mixer whirs) And this, by the way, is delicious as is. I would eat this by the\nspoonful, and have done so. Okay, pretty quick. Scrape that bowl down, one more whip. Okay, now we can add in one cup of powdered sugar. Not leveling any of\nthe cups in the recipe. Just telling you, it's a\nmore-is-more situation. On low. Then increase the speed. I would scrape down once more. Now I'm adding in a\nnice splash of vanilla, about a teaspoon. Mix it up. This right here is delicious and I've been told that if you love a really, really rich peanut butter pie then this is for you. I, however, like my pies to be silkier, and just a little bit lighter, so we're gonna whip up some\nwhipped cream right now. I actually had my whisk\nin the freezer for this, so that my whipped cream\nwould whip up extra fast. If you're using a metal bowl you can pop that into the freezer\nfor a few minutes too, and it'll whip up in a moment. This glass bowl is a hassle though, so, I don't know. I only use this for you so you can see the inside. All right, one cup of heavy whipping cream that we will give a whip to. Little bit extra. Every last drop. Okay, we're just gonna whip this up now. No need to add any sugar, whatever. Increase the speed. (mixer whirs) Give it a minute. Keep an eye on it. (mixer whirs) Let's take a look. I wanna have soft peaks for this. See, nice soft peak. I like to hit the sides a bit just because they get less of the whipping. See? Very nice. Okay, we're gonna fold this in, and by fold I mean just\nstraight up whip it in. It's not gonna be delicate. Back to you. I wanna keep this bowl clean because this whole pie is gonna get a mound of whipped cream topping, and I want it to be pristine and white, no streaks of peanut butter\nthat are unintentional. Get all that whipped cream out there. Now, let's just whip it in! On low. Then medium. Definitely scrape that\nbowl down one last time. And if you love peanut butter pie, but it's a bit too rich for you sometimes, go ahead and use like,\ntwo cups of whipped cream, or a cup and a half, and it'll lighten the whole thing up. If you have extra you could put it into a little cupcake paper,\nor whatever you want. Freeze it for later, or just enjoy a snack at some point. Okay, that's good. All right, let's transfer that filling into our cooled pie crust. Smooth out the top. And then I just wanna\ngo crazy for a minute, put it on a turntable, and give it a really nice smooth. So, if you wanted just\nthe peanut butter pie I would do something like this, then you have like a pretty\nswirl at the very end. Which I think is a nice presentation, you could just drizzle some chocolate, maybe crush up some Reese's pieces or Justin's peanut butter cups, and this would be totally presentable. Everyone would love it. You could serve that with ice cream. This goes into the fridge\nto set up and chill. You could make this the\nnight before, and then put the whipped cream\non right before serving. You could do the whole thing right now, but I just think that fresh whipped cream is better than whipped cream that's been in the fridge for a\nfew days, or overnight. Let me know in the comments\nif you agree with me, or if you're all about that\naged whipped cream life. Many recipes will call for Cool Whip, I like whipped cream better. If you love Cool Whip pile it on though, it's totally up to you. All right, into the fridge we go. And, I of course have my pie that I made yesterday, which\nis already all set up. So, lets move this process along and get to the whipped cream. Into that same whipped cream bowl, we're gonna add in another cup. And, you know, it's totally up to you if you wanna add in a bit more, like I do. Maybe a cup and a half. Splash of vanilla. And this is totally up to you, you could add in no sugar, or, you know, up to maybe three tablespoons. I'm adding in like two and\na half tablespoons of sugar, we'll see how that looks. Right back on there, and we're gonna whip this up again. (mixer whirs) Don't over-whip it. If you over-whip your whipped cream it'll curdle and kind of turn into cheese. Like delicious cream cheese. Giving about 1/3 of a\ncup of chocolate a chop. You can decorate your pie with either some chopped chocolate, shaved chocolate, nothing,\nor melted chocolate. I haven't decided yet so I'm going to try it with melted chocolate\nand see how it looks. And when you melt chocolate, it's always easier to easier to melt it if it's in small pieces, so. Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop. Into a small bowl, and\nthen into the microwave for some, you know, short 30 second, half-power bursts. My microwave's here. All right, my chocolate's all melted up, so now it's time to assemble that pie! Look at this. Delicious. Transfer to a piping tip, drizzle that on top of your whipped cream in a zig-zaggy pattern. And then, take a handful\nof roasted peanuts, toss them in what's left\nof the melted chocolate, and then just sprinkle\nthem on top of your pie. It's delicious and it adds so much extra flavor and texture. You have the flaky butter crust, the crunchy roasted peanuts\ntossed in chocolate, and it is just heaven. Like the amount of whipped cream on top really balances it out, and makes it feel light, and healthy. I'm having a me day. Okay, it is time for a bite and I am beyond ready (laughs).

this work that asked if you scared of this place you'll need to bother just lay down your weapons and pick up another hi Joyce how's it going welcome to my virgin kitchen duel a horse you a horse Phoebe yeah Oh apples today I'm gonna show you how to get an apple like this this is an apple bingo what we're gonna make an apple pie inside an apple with a bit of toffee sauce and a cheeky raisin kick you're gonna love it so uh let's get on with it how to like their map was right right yeah they're gonna bet okay amazing so if you want to make these these are all the ingredients I hit pause on the video when I click my fingers now write them all down and these are what we've got here for granny smith apples nice no crunchy bite into it oh oh yeah gonna taste good and two apples from a tree if you can I haven't got an apple tree but mom a neighbor does so I just nipped over and pinch too but she was okay with that so they're good we're actually gonna skin them and actually just get a bit of backup apple in there to help fill it more gonna make up for the cork so we can eat the core bit so it's a bit of a delicate stage first of all then we'll chuck in some other bits so here comes the art and crafty bit okay so you've got a lot of apples going on here so the Big Apple the chunky ones from the tree we don't need to worry about that oh my goodness what is that I don't know I don't know think about all I'm gonna do is peel them and cut them up you do not need me to show you that stage and put them to one side and then the fruit down the four apples one two three four yes that is four not three we'll take three lone away and I'll show you how to do it with just this so Apple Granny Smith four one three nine if you're interested yeah let's do this bit okay so I guess the first stage should be just take off the sticker and I think I'll put that on my nose which you'll see in a bit okay now grab yourself a really super sharp knife and what you want to do is cut in a nice flush straight line through that Apple to sort of twist it keep it level yeah cool as you cut it through like this you want to get it nice and flat wow that's cool and that knife is so sharp Wow my finger could have come off this bit here can go away Plus okay so we have got our flat heads like and what I've done importing see I've gone around the Apple with my knife flow so it could be a little bit tighter up there but I'm a very untidy person and what I've also done is gone across around the core like that form a square round it with my knife only half way down and then what I'm going to do now is just get a little teaspoon just start to dig out before we work it with a ice-cream scoop right right yeah yep see if I'm got an ice cream scoop Dori about it just use a spoon for the whole time I'm just gonna like pour out little pieces like this boom it's gonna be quite slow its point faster ways of doing it but this is the way I want to do it little squares at a time like that into a glass bowl like this so do that to all four of your apples remember that your core bit you don't want that my friend okay so keep going yeah okay so my first Apple has been called like that as I say I've been scratching it away like this just working it with my spoon around the sides and the Apple falls off into the bowl like that is what you're after and the grass Smith is quite like a butch Apple it's full of flavor but this it's strong my friends come out a story with a free pigs their Hale and the bricks and all that this would be the brick version okay other apples maybe of Gordon delicious with crumble under such pressure but this one stands strong some of you might other apples I'll see you in a bit put your Apple bits in there okay so I've got all four apples all nice and caught up like so and I got my Apple chunks plus the poetry apples bottom straight in that bowl there I found some more stickers as well what I've got here is some brown sugar white sugar put my finger in it and some cinnamon but chuck that in with it you can actually add as much or as little as a cinnamon as you like there's a little thing called the cinnamon challenge that I did before Ashley day if you're watching me I can't believe you did that today and in honor of him doing that I'm gonna do it after this bit of this section of the video what we want to do is grab myself a spoon or this and that stir this all through get the sugary nurse all coated on there in a minute we'll get the raisins in with it as well it's gonna be amazing stir okay that's all stirred in the apples are gone with funky and tinted with that whole cinnamon and brown sugar boom straight on and like that oh I am loving that so I've got here tablespoon of raisins I'm just gonna put them in his well he didn't have to do that but I loved that whole combination of apple and raisins in my love's so unless they're all through as well mix it all in you notice that the Apple is at different sized chunks okay doesn't you have a nice and fine you could even just do the Apple if you want to get it's like that's what mushy or you can just leave the apples in massive chunks you can put an apple inside of an apple that wouldn't work don't be that yeah keep staring proof it's all mingled in they get on the floor like I just did and I'm gonna put in apples now yeah yeah okay so we make a really funky toffee sauce it into this pan we're gonna get the brown sugar just pour that straight in butter and this my friends is a plate of treacle and golden syrup conestoga sauce sunrise it's two tablespoons of treacle and 1 tablespoon of golden syrup so it's going to tell you a while but I'm gonna push this in like so it's gonna slide it in oh yeah you see that okay so that treacle golden syrup combination is in there and last but not least 100 mils with double cream pour that all in there all my goodness what we're gonna do now is bring that over that low heat up to a boil and that will form a beautiful toffee sauce yes so we're just doing this together the butters melted it will not take very long at all to boil the minute it gets there get ready to pour it on your apples baby okay I'm not sure we can see that but my toffee sauce has just literally finished boiling so it'd be very very very very very careful at this step be warned you do not want to have bare foot like I did so I do it carefully slowly pour it over your apples and raisins oh my goodness okay so that sauce is all in there give it a darn good stir through carefully get it all nice and coated and then let it cool just for a couple minutes we've got some pastry cutting stuff to do background and then we nearly there I promise okay so we know we wanted to paste you know I'm kind of lazy when it comes to pastry I've bought the pre-roll stuff the shortcrust pastry roll sheet that you can get into you buy that you know you can make your own if you want am i salute you but I don't want to do that you get puff pastry rolls tube this is short crust okay so what I've got is got it out like this and done it in tobacco centimeter wide strip just over and then half there Kay and we're going to wrap those like battens of pastry over at the Apple I saw this idea on Pinterest and I was like yeah I want to try that but with a toffee kick so uh let's get all these strips ready and we can start to fill our apples strip them cook them eat them I get stickers off my face okay let's grab an apple and cram it with I'll fill it oh what's that let's kill that bit off okay sorry about that well cram it with a feeling now okay so what I've got here is a spoonful of the mixture I'm getting everywhere I'm just gonna plot that straight in and that Apple there you didn't see that there that's gonna plug that into tray like that fill it up as much as I can the toffee sauce is all over those apples push it down as much as you can my friends have loads of apple left and the rest you can probably make a massive apple pie off but just cram it in it all the way okay before that is crammed in there we're gonna get our pastry layer on top right now this is looking alright so far I'm excited I'm excited okay so it's completely up to you how you do your pastry just put a massive sheet over it if you want but I'm gonna get these bands put one just press it a little bit lightly against the skin there put it straight over like that and what I'll do is some the other way to make a basket weave so let's try and do this yeah alright that's my first one done I'm gonna get the others done right around about here let's go okay so I got one more left to do and I've realized that I haven't actually shown you how to do this so that's this is quite important actually let me show you okay so first of all put your strips or in one long line come at all facing the same way yeah okay so here's how you do it it looks a little scruffy at the minute it's all one strip but don't worry we can trim this I'm gonna turn mine on my side is complete up to you so you've got one two three four five what I do is miss one then hit one so pull back your second strip miss one then hit one pull back your fourth strip put them back as much as you can and then get another strip that one's falling off there but it we can just stop that on the top like this and I can actually just droop this one straight back over at you think about it and then this one goes straight back over the top so the two that you hit miss them and hit the other three pull them back and then you just add another strip along there okay there's another strip like that's that sits in there put them back over one two three and then you two that you originally hit pull them back one to another strip in there keep alternating it all the way through let me trim it up that's how you do it yeah so a final strip and then that goes over like that just for I'll show you that and all I do now is trim around the excess bits and that's the we've all done or make sense cool okay so my aquas have done at my prompt them into this nice little tin with some water just to bar this so it's not going to destroy the bottom of it when it in the oven what I going to put is some tin foil over the top okay it's gonna steam it in there as well it's gonna be good I've got a little guest down here are you ready hello mate hello you're supposed to be asleep Oh Jo poochy poochy poochy mmm you spoiling I'll say anything no just in each area right get your foil on your tray thing and then it's going um okay so I'm putting that in the other mouth for the first 20 minutes that is gonna steam it if you're a little bit rushed you should studios and then just put it there for 20 minutes without the foil it's in the paste you will just cook because that is going to cook all that inside are the Apple just make it nice and soft then we'll take that foil off and cook up the gun so what some time to kill Chloe's gone now it's coming back to sleep already can you believe that so what I've got here is a teaspoon of cinnamon teaspoon of cinnamon challenge let's go okay I will not be doing this teaspoon of cinnamon challenge ever again but I have done it before and it did succeed so that surprised me and they put me off cinnamon for life so hopefully I'll still like this apple pies so let's say I've seen 20 minutes when we rip off that foil and then start a work on our pastry oh yeah see then okay that has been 20 minutes I've got a sieve my oven is preheated to gas mark 5 by the way or equivalent which I will put down the bottom now I've just got it out and I do not really want to touch this well yeah that is warm so we're gonna peel off this foil now to reveal that pastry muss and then now put it back in the oven to crisp it all up little bit of brown sugar on that paste you should give it a nice kick okay there we go you can see the steam rising up and that I've dusted some brown sugar on there already just a little bit not too much just on the top there and it's gonna go straight back in the oven now good times okay I've taken out the oven it took a little longer just the piece sheet was being annoying it didn't want to Brown for me but here we are we are done boom check that out oh my goodness it smells in here like apple pie I'm gonna stir this up with some custard I'll see what it tastes like right yeah okay folks let's try and plate this up I put this boat dish kind of thing here I'm gonna get some pre-made custard and just dribble that in there you don't have to have custard it's up to you so well let's just boil that in okay so got my apple here it's red-hot ideally you want to cool it down holy I was sitting that in there Wow okay I took a big slice out of it I just got to show you this check this out boom you're going in you're going in oh yeah my shoulders in the way but look you're right in there with the Apple can you smell that that smells good that is the desire of cooking my friends let's see what it tastes like well then you can have a go for yourself yeah okay then folks I'm digging right into this now I am so excited about that I know it's kind of sad but it smells so good and I just love baked apples which is basically what this is a little twist so what it's still hot mmm oh my god spike my bomb and call me Barry that is good I didn't get any of the pastry just a little bit that as long mmm damn perfect your favor is not too intense it's not too much top you know but you can tell us there the cinnamon again so much that as well which I'm happy about after doing that little TSP thing but you can mix it up and change it how you want let me just with nothing in there and I chart with a parent's debt some crazy stuff like that have a go send me pictures and all that stuff so if I can make it absolutely anyone in the world can have a give yourself no matter how you get on stickers on your face optional I'll see you again next time cheers for watching I love you
