{"cYKLWo_G95A": "hey everybody how you doing welcome back to sweet freaks candy thanks for checking out our youtube channel i'm here today doing a little video on a hard candy i'm making for a halloween mix and we are starting with a grape so this has already been um the flavor is already in the pot as well as the color and this one is grape i'm going to add some citric acid to it to give it a nice little sour taste so we'll have a sour grape music in the background i hope that doesn't [Music] so what i do first is now that i've poured it onto the candy cooling table i'm going to let it sit for just a minute to cool off just a bit because if i add the citric acid now there's a good chance that it could burn and give it a little bit of a funky flavor so i like to wait a little bit and then um can go from there so uh once the edges start getting a little bit um harder see how i'm able to kind of pull that off the cooling table so it's starting to cool down a little bit and like i said i'm using a grate today this is from uh lorann oils so we're using a grape flavoring and corn syrup pretty much the main ingredients there sugar obviously so we boil it to 310 degrees drop it on here it's probably cooling off enough now that i'm gonna add some citric acid and this is what gives it that nice little sour flavor and it kind of looks like a lot you're thinking oh man but uh actually kind of dissolves into the candy a little bit as well and and uh isn't too bad so once i do that i like to fold it in so i kind of make this little pocket here i'm going to trap all that citric acid into there and then this is the part where you actually let the candy do the work i fold it in and as you can tell it's starting to harden up a little bit already this is probably make about a two and a half pound batch but as i fold it in and do this and it starts to uh the citric acid will dissolve into the candy and once i get it to a consistency that i like we'll take it over to the heating table where we can um pull and cut it so this will be for a handout that i'm doing for a farmer's market um on halloween so i'm actually gonna be hanging out my own candy so let's be a little mix for all the kids to come and get it back for me and this is the part where i just kind of let the candy do the work [Music] you still see some of that citric acid in there we're also going to pull it a little bit to give it that uh what it does is it traps air bubbles inside of it and gives the candy a little bit more uh volume to it and also it won't be as hard even though it's a hard candy um we're gonna pull it enough to where it's got some air into it so it's not going to just uh be completely solid and break a tooth if you bite into it so it'll kind of crumble it also distributes the flavor and the acid evenly so as you can tell now i'm starting to get kind of a little bit more consistency to it almost like a play-doh and at this point it's still very hot um but i can kind of manipulate it this is where i'll pull it a little bit and i don't want to pull it too much because trapping the air bubbles inside of this candy what it does is it also reflects light so the more that you pull it the lighter and more pastel the candy's going to get and for a halloween candy i want this purple to be pretty dark i have done some other ones where i've pulled the candy and made it very light and added black um coloring to it and like a stripe to kind of do that but this just being a small little free handout i'm just going to kind of make it i want to pull it a little bit you can kind of see here as i pulled a little bit it's gonna trap those air bubbles and it's gonna reflect some light and as you can already tell it's a little bit lighter than it was see that there so once i get it to about exactly where i want it which this is probably pretty good we're going to take it over to our cooling table or to our heating table i'm sorry so let's head on over there this is our little setup here for our heating table let me set this up for you guys so i've already got two pans set up for when i cut there we go for when i'm cutting it to get it just right for you guys there so you can get a good idea of what i'm doing let me see if i add some light there if that helps let me know if that helps this being my first video i'm kind of testing some of the uh lighting and different things that i'm using so um what i have here is just a oversized griddle with some silpats on it to get it nice and i don't need it hot because the candy will melt so what i'm doing is just keeping it from completely cooling down and getting too hard so that i can still manipulate it pull it and cut it i like to use ten and a half inch scissors so i like to make kind of this little design like this and what that does is it kind of keeps it hotter up here because it is um a little bit thicker but as i pull it i pull it from this end and i get the consistency that i want coming out of that so as you can see it's still a little bit too soft because if i tried to pull this right now it would just kind of really thin out [Music] and i'll show you what it does when that happens i'll pull from the other side and this is just kind of a test run on the consistency so i'm not too worried about it you could actually put this back into the candy if you wanted to and what this does is the way that i cut them it makes these nice little pillows nice little bite-sized pillows and just from doing it for for as long as i have and as many times as i have i kind of have an idea of the consistency that i want as far as the size and thickness of the candy and the reason i have two pans is that i still pull it when it's a little bit hot and so if you do them all together they can stick together um obviously once they cool down you just drop them in there but for me it's just easier and like i said you'll get these nice little pillows when you're done i call them little candy pillows um it's just from pinching each side with the scissors and it's kind of uh really gives it that homemade look and feel to it um you know that people really know that i've done all this by hand people are kind of surprised sometimes when i say that i've cut and make each each piece by hand instead of at a machine and i'm not worried about having every piece exactly the same size i mean i like to have a good consistency and i think you know those look great um sometimes i do get a bigger piece or a smaller piece but i do it by weight when i when i do them so that uh uh you're gonna get the same amount of candy every time there might be a couple bigger or smaller pieces but um that's you know you'll get the same amount every time then i just keep flipping it making sure i get the same amount same consistency pulled off every time make nice little so just starting out this channel you guys let me know comment down below let me know what colors you'd like to see what flavors um any questions you might have i can also make i will be doing some videos that are multi-colored to kind of show you how to uh put more than one one color together and how i build them and and get it a nice looking piece of candy so i will be doing a couple videos on that and obviously if you guys would like to try any of this candy um you can go to my website at sweetfreakscandy.com and check out any of our i think right now i've got about 36 flavors in stock you can check them out have them shipped to you and if you see any flavors that you like on any of these videos let me know and we'll be doing a discount code the discount code will be uh youtube and if you put that in it will give you 20 off of your order so that's another reason to uh watch it so on these um on this heating unit this griddle i never really go past warmth because then that will get it too hot to where the candy will start to melt but as i go and it gets smaller and smaller it gets a little bit harder so i turn it up just a bit to keep it going i'm going to start doing a little bit longer pieces [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and that's all there is to it guys so like i said if you'd like to check out any of this candy go to sweetfreakscandy.com comment down below let me know what uh you guys want to see if you guys like the video it is my first one doing it this way so

now differently slow down and just slow steady pace [Music]", "7sbBD0UQ7BQ": "was weird how your life changed but it's all right man started smoking weed so i thought about my life man [Music] hi guys welcome back to my channel if you're new welcome to my [ __ ] channel if you guys are new this is a great video for you guys to start with we are making as you guys seen from the title thc infused firecracker grapes i think they came out pretty good if you guys want to see them you have to stay tuned before we get this video started stop what you're doing make sure you subscribe make sure you turn on your post notifications so you're notified every single time another video like this uploads also just let me know down below if you guys want another video like this because i do have one other in mind and i think that i might just start doing cannabis infused foods and videos like that so let me know down below if that's something that you guys would like to see again without further ado let's get straight into the video but first it wouldn't be a video of mine if we weren't smoking all right all right all right welcome to my [ __ ] show and tell y'all okay so we're just gonna get the voiceover started bear with me i've never done a voiceover before but we're just going to hop straight into this so basically this part is optional we just wanted to take all the jolly ranchers out in one session so we could just throw them in the baggies that i'm about to put them in so that's what we're doing here damn okay so once you're done unwrapping all the jolly ranchers you want to throw them in a baggie if you don't have a food processor i'm just ratchet as [ __ ] and i didn't have a food processor so i decided to throw them in a baggie um double bag it triple back it and then use a hammer to basically hammer the hard candies down into a fine powder you really want the powder to be as fine as possible and have less bigger chunks of the jolly ranchers because it's a hard candy and it's not going to be really enjoyable to eat if there's really big hard crystals on the grapes yeah i'm saying it just doesn't make sense so crush those [ __ ] down make a little powder out of it or whatever now the powder is what it should look like those hard crystals i actually went back in and actually crushed them up finer here's the pot i'm gonna put half a cup of water half a cup of this cornstarch right here also sorry for the mess you know and just ignore that anyways so yeah so equal parts water and equal parts corn syrup and then you want to do two cups yes [ __ ] i know that's a lot of [ __ ] sugar two cups of sugar you want to mix that around i didn't turn the heat on until after so i can get all the ingredients in the pot and it won't start boiling i do recommend starting on like a medium heat and don't get into the hot heat yet here i am putting a lemon in the pot just because the recipe that i said the recipe that i listened to needs it said to put in some kind of citrus so i added this lemon here is the wax that i'm gonna put in each of these containers is 620 milligrams i believe and i basically put a little bit more than one and a half so it should be a pretty potent this is my regular ass broke ass thermometer your girl didn't buy no candy thermometer because [ __ ] it i was just gonna eye it so i was done with the thermometer it was not working now you see it start to boil it starts coming together you're gonna leave it boiling for a while i'm just mixing it up so it doesn't settle at the bottom and to make sure that all the sugar that's in the mixture is getting dissolved now you want to add some food coloring you want to add some food coloring when it hits about 250 to 260 degrees if you guys have a candy thermometer you don't need to stir the food coloring in because the bubbling itself is actually going to make the red color go throughout the pot you should see a red orange kind of color like this if you're doing it right [ __ ] if you're doing it right also you can use any food color you want damn [ __ ] come on what the [ __ ] is taking so long my mom wanted to try a grape without the thc so that's just me digging my little fingers up in the syrup so i can get her grape before i add the wax into it god damn i'm taking another hit so here i'm scooping the wax out of the container and just throwing it straight into the pot you can use waxy i think you can use shatter i think you can use distillate honestly the mixture that is boiling is going to be so hot that is going to melt the wax just remember to use a dab tool to get all the wax out of there put it in the pot stir it around so it's mixed in there nice and good and it gets evenly distributed oh guess i have to cross it oh a little bit more oh oh that was a big chunk yep we're just stirring stirring stirring so because i don't have a candy thermometer you're supposed to be done at about 300 degrees you're supposed to let it start to cool a trick is if you don't have a candy thermometer get ice cold water and take some of the mixture and put it in the cold water and if it hardens then your candy is done this was difficult for me i think i ended up messing up on this part so don't listen to your girlfriend go get yourself a candy thermometer i swear but it didn't turn out too bad so i actually turned the heat off which is why you're seeing the bubbles start to go down we are almost done with our [ __ ] firecracker grapes y'all so i just took a um a skewer you can find these like where you barbecue or anything like that um i poked the grape put it in the syrup and now i'm just dipping it all in the jolly ranchers you do like such the jolly rancher mixture might get hard just continuously mix it with like a fork um and you maybe want to do like two different bowls or something when you do the jolly ranchers because it does get really hard especially once the candy syrup gets within the jolly ranchers it was quite difficult but you manage you manage you'll get there so just get a lot of syrup on there and start throwing all the powder all over your grapes and it should stick they should taste very very yummy oh yeah also you guys see the napkin because when you take the grapes and you wash the grapes you want to pat them dry before you take them you put them into the sugar mixture so that the sugar mixture sticks to the grapes that is very very important they will stick to the grapes without you doing it but it's gonna stick a whole lot better if you just dry them off first damn look how [ __ ] bomb these look i've been watching this like damn these look real good i better go in the house and have me some and that is it you guys thank you so much for watching this i can't wait to try these grapes and let you guys know how they tasted and if i got high or not i guess that's the question of the night since we did almost put i think we put about a thousand milligrams so we'll see how high they get us i will definitely let you guys know in the next video so make sure you subscribe make sure you hit the bell until you post notifications and i'll talk to you guys in the next one thank you for watching my video bye guys", "jtlJqBuXuzk": "alright hey y'all get ready to make some candy grapes alright the first thing you'll need is a bag of Jolly Ranchers I got the bag that was I think 248 at Walmart and first thing you gonna toss up I wrapped with the Jolly Ranchers and I'm using my blender to chop them up and I end up pressing post and it chopped it up to fine some people that have this like what kind of bigger pieces in my I was like powder kinda alright and right here you can see that how fine I made it the only thing with a jolly wrench day it's gonna get back you get hard so I end up putting it back in a blender later on alright next you're gonna need 2 cups of sugar I can get another cup of sugar [Music] there's a second cup of shirt alright next is a half a cup of water and then a half a cup of the Cairo sir when you put all of it into your partner and I just use a small pot because it's not gonna make them rich all right and this thing make sure you mix it up pretty good before you get ready to put it on the stove so you don't try to mix it up while it's cooking and with the heat on the stove this temperature saying I put it between four or five or so [Music] alright next one get ready to cook it alright you have to let the temperature reach between two hundred and eighty degrees and two hundred and ninety degrees under cooking thermometer so make sure you watching it cuz you don't want to burn it and be careful you don't want to burn yourself all right this is parchment paper not wax paper make sure you use parchment paper alright then I have my bowl of grits I've washed and dried those all right and then I have two pieces if you have any longer sticks you want to use you can use those because to me it's the kind of dangerous because you can burn yourself with it so small do not put the soup in the hole that's our baton the great with the grapes tin came from you make your own hole on the opposite cuz it'll stick better the hole on the other side is kind of big already I'll have my line that already [Music] all right it's cooking here makes you glad to get it two hundred and eighty degrees all right here's I just took it off the stove this is outlook right with it also all right next thing is you gonna need some flavor and the flavoring I use is the Lawrence flavor I use cheering and it's the bottle synthesizes a dream I only use half a bottle since I didn't make that much and it's gonna turn it red that's in the brain in it all right Mitchell see me add in another drop of the flavor just get a little flavor but after that you weigh if you have the liquid white food coloring in the jail that's when you add that you don't see me use it because I went to last minute trying to find some but using the liquid white learn it would give your stuff a brighter color so I want to be see through my stuff you'll see it's let me see - have a seat - color eye whatever but I didn't care cuz kids I know they was still eating but so give it that deep coloring you need the white liquid gel color and then we use your color that you wanted to be but now you're gonna see me and then I have just regular gel food cuz I'm using the colored seal and again it's gonna be basically almost air clear when I put it on the grades because I didn't have the whitener so again make sure if you want the bright colors that you see everybody else using use the white liquid gel color the whitener and then you're gonna use like a few drops to everything I didn't you see me just scooping some till your food coloring my Chi mix it up that my sister she started dipping already and you gotta make sure you working fastest and starting heart and hard and fast and I still ting to pot to the side so I can make sure lit all around to the side all right you start dipping it but then you see my candy and hey got heart the Jolly Rancher candy and I end up later on putting it back inside the blender to chop it up again good say the thing with the Jolly Rancher is it says for some reason because it's so sticky I know hardest but you go ahead and just make sure you working fast cuz the candy that you made will get hard fast and the Jolly Rancher soon so just dip it and I don't want to do have I didn't some people that I dip the whole thing I only did half of it great and we end up doing strawberry so we didn't record record ourselves on the strawberries and when you dip it just hurry up and sprinkle a pot on before it gets hard and they're just laid on a parchment paper all right here you can kind of see it better what a good grapes doesn't see just really missing again you see my stuff is fired it's pretty fine like a little powder some people have bigger chunks with Jolly Ranchers than theirs but it all stays the same all right this is finished product it came out pretty good for the first time if you want to see my kids do the taste test check out her Channel say whatcha Larry thanks for watching", "JUHxpsohsrI": "[Music] welcome to my channel I thank you for watching now let's make some candy grapes so let's go over the ingredients for the candy grades now I am gonna give you three recipes they're gonna be in the description box so just check that out one recipe is for a small really tiny badge and that's the one I'm gonna be doing now and then I'll give you two other recipes that are for like a little bit more grapes and one for a lot of grapes so the first thing you are going to need of course grapes I like to use the green grapes you don't have to use green you can use the red grace if you want but me personally I go with green grapes so I just picked these off in the grocery store I have some water back here and this bowl some light corn syrup I have some granulated sugar vanilla and here is a bottle of watermelon flavoring you can use a flavoring if you want to but you do not have to you can just use a vanilla only I have some blue Wilton full coloring this is a gel colors there is some white food coloring any kind of white food coloring that you have if you don't want your candy to be a certain color then you can just go ahead and dip them in clear candy meaning you will not use the white you will not use the blue but if you absolutely want a certain color you want your colors to pop you are gonna have to make sure you use the white and make sure you use the colored food coloring the next thing that I have is I'm gonna be making Jolly Rancher flavored candy grapes I'm also gonna be making some a warhead flavored if you do not want the warhead you can use whatever you want like the fun dip you don't have to use any candy at all so if you want to make your own sour flavoring and then that way you can control how sour it is you can always just purchase some citric acid from Amazon and then you will just mix that citric acid with a little sanding sugar this is just a red Betty Crocker sugar it's just colored red and then you will just take pour some of this in a cup or a bowl and then you will add a little bit of the citric acid to that that's another option you can put nerds on here just do whatever you want so that's it for the ingredients right here as far as food now we're gonna go over the supplies you are gonna need a blender and that's my ninja blender if you are going to be using like the hard candy you need to use a blender and just make sure that your blender is dry your blender is not completely dry your Candy's gonna stick and then that will just cause another problem so just let your blender dry out completely before you chop up this candy the next thing you're gonna need are the sticks now for me I like to use these long sticks I got these sticks from the Dollar Tree you don't have to use those long sticks you can purchase you some regular old toothpicks toothpicks are fine I would suggest if this is like your first time you should get two picks that are at least six inches long that way that would give you some room to stay away from that heat and the reason why I use these long sticks is I was in the fire so I really don't like to get too close to that heat so even though I do make candy apples and stuff and I know everything is hot I still try my best to stay away from getting burned again so the next thing besides the sticks you are going to need a spatula that's my spatula their candy thermometer you can purchase this candy thermometer at Walmart they have different kinds or you can purchase this on Amazon this one in particular I ordered from Amazon but I have actually seen it at Walmart so this is the candy thermometer the same one you're using for your candy apples and then you are gonna need just any kind of pot to cook it and it doesn't have to be any special products and then you are going to need something to place the grapes on when you dip them so here I have a silicone baking mat if you don't have one that's fine you can just use some parchment paper I would suggest spray your parchment paper down with a little bit of cooking spray but you do not have to do that either okay do whatever you feel comfortable doing this is what I always tell you guys so the first thing you are gonna do is you're gonna take your grapes and just take each one off of the vine put it into your bowl and just don't use the ones that are broken like the ones that might have a slit in them just check your grapes and make sure you don't get any of those and you slimy ones and you are gonna clean your grapes the same way you've been cleaning your grapes for years he's just gonna run them under some water if you have some Veggie wash you can just use that veggie wash whatever way you've been cleaning your grapes just keep doing it like that so once you rinse these great all you are gonna use either like a colander or a strainer to just flush out all of that dirt that are on the grates and then leave your grapes sitting you're gonna pour your grapes onto a pay a plate lined with paper towels you're gonna need something that will help you drain all of that water out because the object is to get all the water off as much water as possible so at least let your grapes sit for two hours before you start and I know you might think that's a lot of time so maybe you can go one hour even just don't start dipping your grapes immediately please don't you don't want to have cold grapes don't dip your grapes straight out the fridge don't dip your grapes straight from being washed let them dry and let them become room temperature so that the candy will stick and also you will have less juices drooping out after you make them if it's not so cold and so wet okay so let's say these have been sitting out for two hours so now we are gonna put the sticks onto the grapes so of course it's pretty simple just take your stick place your stick into the side that's smooth you'll see that little tiny dot now you are gonna chop up your candy I am gonna chop up the Jolly Ranchers first so I just got a couple mixed flavors go right into the blender and just chop them up whatever way you like to chop them up there is no wrong or right way some people like I'm very fine almost like a powder and some people like them to be have little bits showing so just do it whichever way you prefer it to be and again like I said make sure your blender is not wet at all you're gonna give it a couple pulses and then I'm gonna check it so right now it's looking like that I'm gonna put them back in a couple more I don't like my finely diced up I like my - order like this it looks so pretty to me so I'm gonna be leaving mine like that and then of course at the bottom you are gonna have a lot of more finer shredded Jolly Ranchers done let's get these warheads so here is the warheads are done I got some green blue and yellow in here I'm just gonna dump this right into so the candy is all finished and I also have two packs of some colossal sour warheads that so I'm gonna be whatever leftover grapes I'll use this for but I only had two packs so I just went ahead and crushed it up using my mallet inside the package now let's get started making this candy this recipe right here is only gonna give you about 35 grapes so if you want to make way more than 35 you're gonna use the second recipe that I posted in the description box if you want to make about 80 or 90 you are gonna want to use like 90 to 100 you're gonna use the third recipe in the description box so first thing you are gonna put in is 1/2 cup of sugar just dump that right in there this just pot didn't have anything in it so just the sugar and then 1/4 cup of corn syrup and 1/4 cup of water then you're gonna start that um I normally like to start mine on medium and I have an electric stove so medium for me is about seven B twenty seven and eight I'll go eight just to speed it up a little more so once you add those three ingredients you just wanna mix it really fast it doesn't have to be fully mixed together just give it a couple of stir it'll mix itself not the bubble start going now for me I normally don't add my thermometer right now I add my thermometer once I hear the bubbles slowing down a little but if this is your first time I do suggest you add the thermometer right away just so that you'll be able to keep a better eye on it and make sure you don't go over the temperature which is 285 degrees Fahrenheit so that's what you're going for so here those bubbles that's the fast bubbles that's not what you're listening for you're listening for the slower about this when they're popping so quick like that that means it definitely is not ready yet you know you hear the bubbles they are slowing down and right now we are at about 200 won seats 110 degrees Fahrenheit and like I say we're going for it to 85 you notice how slow those bubbles are and that's how you know we are at 280 almost to 85 and it's time to take the candy off of the ice so you're gonna turn it off and take it completely off the ice once you take that off of the eye you are gonna add at your full coloring and I like to add just a few drops of white like I said if you aren't gonna be making this special color you can just go ahead and dip this clear do not have to add the white if you want your candy to be clear but if you don't want it to have that translucent candy you absolutely are going to need the white so that's my wife food coloring and now I'm going to add some of this blue here and I use popsicle sticks to get the food coloring out just dip it in there and then you're gonna put that right into our candy mixture and just make everything turn boo now we're gonna add the flavoring and normally I just add vanilla but you can add whatever flavor you want so if you have some flavoring oil you can use the pineapple watermelon they have pina colada they got tutti frutti strawberry whichever they have cotton candy to whatever flavor you would like your grapes to be I am NOT going to be using this today but if you are I suggest you use just a few drops of this are you gonna take and I drop her a brand new eyedropper and you're gonna put in or you can even use a medicine dropper put in about five or six drops of flavoring oil but I'm just gonna be using the vanilla now for the flavoring I'm just adding a few drops of vanilla just right on into my gut and just mix it up and be careful because those vanilla does make it pop a little so just watch your hands and just stir that up now if you are gonna be using vanilla you want a certain specific color you are gonna have to use clear vanilla extract like certain colors you can't use that brown vanilla extract because it will alter the color that you are going for candy is already too dupe so let's get started with this dipping yeah you're gonna take your grape on the stick and just drop it in pull it out and just let it drip for a couple of seconds let that extra candy drip off and then you want to twirl it a little that way you will get rid of that extra ring yeah then you're just gonna take your candy mixture I got my Jolly Ranchers right here and just drop it in there now you can have way coded how some people do it or you can fully code it I like to fully coat mine and as much candy as possible so we got one great here we're gonna keep on going so again I'm gonna take another grape and I am going to cover this one with Jolly Ranchers again like I said let that excess candy drip off and then you're just gonna turn it you'll get it off we're gonna take our Jolly Rancher mix here and just dip and place it on your silicon mat so we're just gonna move right along here nothing just keep it going you move this spatula out the way and get to different if it falls off of your stick because every once in a while you will get a great that falls off the stick just hurry up and grab it out of there it's okay it's no big deal just grab it out of there and I'm just alternating and then I will real quick do some in the powdered water head mixture like I said sometimes that's gonna happen but it's no big deal make sure you fully culture grape all the way to the end of the stick get that extra candy off and then this is going to be the powdered warhead mixture it's gonna be that yeah if for any reason your candy starts to get a little thick on you and starts hardening just pop it right back onto the stove and let it warm up for about 30 seconds however long it takes for your oven or your stove to get it back to this runny liquid farm just be careful and keep an eye on it because you do not want it to start burning if you leave it on too long just keep an eye on it and you might have to rerun your candy a bunch of times but there's no problem with that you can even save this candy and use it a few weeks later you don't have to use it all at once you can pour it onto your parchment paper or you can pour it onto your silicone baking mat and then break it up into pieces once it becomes hard put it in a ziplock baggie and just store it in your cabin until it's time to when you're ready to use it again see like now starting to get a little thick and that's what I'm gonna pop this back onto the stove you see that thickness I put it right back on to the eye just for a few seconds my daughters are gonna eat these grapes for sure by tomorrow afternoon they'll be all gone so on that we all warmed up and ready to start dipping again comes off the stick get it right back on there so that's pretty much it you guys if you have any questions you can always just let me know and I will for sure get back to you guys so that's it y'all and once they are done you're gonna let them try for a few minutes and then they should just fall right off the stick they should pop right off the stick just like that but that that candy match my nails I just know this thing yeah but they'll pop right off the stick and then you can just put these in a container and put them in the refrigerator until you're ready to eat them like I said they're gonna last that long but they should last 24 hours going into two days at the most and these are the grapes now and if you guys have any questions just leave them right in the comment section and I will get back to you thank you guys so much for watching and I'll see you next time", "VFr6RUbdQjE": "good morning guys so I have been up this morning they see something and

come in different colors different shapes and sizes in flavors ranging from fruity to minty from tart to tangy pretty well everyone enjoys sucking on a hard candy from time to time for children and adults alike these sweet treats are just irresistible our love of sweets goes back to the caveman who delighted in eating honey from beehives in ancient times people indulged in treats made of honey covered fruit and nuts in the Middle Ages Europeans made candy from boiled sugar but the high cost of imported cane sugar restricted this delicacy to the wealthy candy finally became affordable for the masses in the 1800s with the discovery of a new and domestic source of sugar the sugar beet these hard candies aren't mass-produced confections they are gourmet candies custom made and crafted by hand the candy maker starts by bringing a pot of sugar and water to a boil then he adds glucose a thick syrup made from starch he heats the mixture to a specific temperature depending on what type of candy he's making and lets it cook for about a half hour then he stirs in liquid flavoring once the mixture is evenly blended he pours it on to a cooling table the candy maker has several flavorings at his disposal from eucalyptus oil to fruit flavors he also chooses from a wide range of food colorings this candy will have a strawberry design in the middle so he and his assistants are working with three colors green for the leaves red for the berry and yellow for the background [Music] to enhance the flavor they add citric acid then they keep blending until the candy has cooled down and hardened enough to be malleable they separate the pieces by color and put each piece on a heated table to slow the hardening process so that the candy will remain pliable now they create the design they form various shapes and sizes and like a puzzle put the pieces together to make a jumbo version of the candy design [Music] once they've assembled the red berry and green leaves and yellow background they roll on more yellow background then a layer of red for the outside trim all that's left is to reduce this giant wad of candy into a bite-sized version to do that the candy maker pinches one end and stretches it out to form a long uniform strand called a rod he cuts the rod into pieces 60 centimetres long but he has to keep rolling them until they cool and Harden or else they'll go flat when the rod is just the right diameter the design is in perfect proportion all they have to do now is cut candy sized pieces they use the same technique to make kiwi candy pink grapefruit candy and banana candy to name just a few varieties want to order up some candy with a personalized message here's an L an o avi and II a y/o and you again they create a yellow background and red trim then it's more pinching pulling rolling and cutting until the rods are down to just the right size if you look at the back end of each rod you'll see the lettering in Reverse that'll be the underside of the candy when the raw candy comes off the cooling table it's transparent to make it opaque or to lighten the color they pull it on a hook here they intertwine two colors and feed the rod through a special machine that forms bands of pillow shaped candies after cooling they simply break them apart by hand if you're no sucker for hard candies no problem they can also twist rods into lollipops [Music] you", "cImW8Oagqag": "[Music] the must everyone welcome back to Jules today when I talk about irritable bowel syndrome and its treatment in Ayurveda since the last one month we've

Mike Hansen and in\u00a0\nthis video we're talking about CBD what is CBD\u00a0\u00a0 the story behind cannabidiol the cannabis product\u00a0\nthat gets you well not high you've heard of CBD\u00a0\u00a0 the cannabis product whose popularity has reached\u00a0\nalmost crazed lake proportions CBD has come from\u00a0\u00a0 nowhere to everywhere in just the last few years\u00a0\nit is perhaps best known for its ability to\u00a0\u00a0 reduce anxiety and promote happiness but CBDs\u00a0\napplications are seemingly endless it's been\u00a0\u00a0 successfully used to help with pain insomnia and\u00a0\ndepression there are some reports that it helps\u00a0\u00a0 with other medical conditions as well because\u00a0\nof its wide range of uses CBD infused products\u00a0\u00a0 are the fastest growing segment of the health\u00a0\nindustry even some pets are getting in on the\u00a0\u00a0 action for example CBD troubles are used to calm\u00a0\ndogs Carl's jr. the fast food chain has created a\u00a0\u00a0 burger served with a CBD infused sauce not that\u00a0\nI endorse calls jr. or any fast food for that\u00a0\u00a0 matter and New York City CBD infused coffee was\u00a0\nall the rage and sell at the camp and then there\u00a0\u00a0 is medical celebrities dr. oz and dr. Sanjay\u00a0\nGupta who actually advocate for CBD as well as\u00a0\u00a0 non-medical celebrities such as Joe Rogan Morgan\u00a0\nFreeman Quentin Paltrow then you got athletes such\u00a0\u00a0 as David Wells who argue on behalf of CBD use\u00a0\nin sports medicine where it's anti-inflammatory\u00a0\u00a0 power would allow players to recover more quickly\u00a0\nand not risk opioid addiction there are plenty of\u00a0\u00a0 MMA fighters who swear by it as well in Bubba\u00a0\nWatson a professional golfer said that his\u00a0\u00a0 decisions UCB was quote-unquote a no brainer the\u00a0\nFDA even joined the bandwagon last year at least\u00a0\u00a0 partially approving the CBD medication at the\u00a0\ndialects this is despite the fact that cannabis\u00a0\u00a0 remains illegal in eyes of the federal government\u00a0\nso CBD use is growing by leaps and bounds with a\u00a0\u00a0 projected twenty two billion dollar market by the\u00a0\nyear 2022 CBD is cannabidiol which is derived from\u00a0\u00a0 the flower of cannabis the only plant genus that\u00a0\ncontains YOUnique class of molecular compounds\u00a0\u00a0 called phytochemicals so there's more than 8500\u00a0\ncannabinoids that have been identified but the\u00a0\u00a0 two most prevalent are tetrahydrocannabinol\u00a0\naka THC and cannabidiol which is CBD THC is\u00a0\u00a0 the psychoactive ingredient of cannabis meaning\u00a0\nTHC is the component that gets you high while\u00a0\u00a0 CBD is the quote/unquote anti psychoactive\u00a0\ningredient meaning it doesn't get you high\u00a0\u00a0 there are actually two types of cannabis plants\u00a0\nmeaning there are two subspecies one is marijuana\u00a0\u00a0 which is rich in THC and thus has been cultivated\u00a0\nfor the high associated with its recreational use\u00a0\u00a0 and then there is hemp which is low in THC hemp\u00a0\nwas historically cultivated for the industrial\u00a0\u00a0 uses or its tough fibers in December of 2018\u00a0\nin part because a growing body of scientific\u00a0\u00a0 evidence showing CBDs therapeutic attributes\u00a0\nthe federal government legalized him although\u00a0\u00a0 33 states have legalized medical marijuana\u00a0\nincluding 10 states with legal recreational\u00a0\u00a0 use marijuana remains prohibited at the federal\u00a0\nlevel so both hemp and marijuana contains CBD\u00a0\u00a0 the recent full legalization of hemp is part\u00a0\nof the reason why some experts believe the CBD\u00a0\u00a0 market will have a societal impact as monumentous\u00a0\nas the tech revolution two decades ago but to\u00a0\u00a0 really understand what CBD is and why it is only\u00a0\nso recently burst into such almost revolutionary\u00a0\u00a0 prominence it helps to know a little bit about\u00a0\nthe history of cannabis and the biology of its use\u00a0\u00a0 cannabis is believed to have been used medicinally\u00a0\nrecreationally and for spiritual reasons\u00a0\u00a0 throughout much of humankind's history it's been\u00a0\nused in some form by societies throughout the\u00a0\u00a0 world the oldest known written record regarding\u00a0\nits use comes from almost 5000 years ago in\u00a0\u00a0 China ancient Greeks used it to dress wounds at\u00a0\nhorses and to apply to human nosebleeds it was\u00a0\u00a0 medicinally popular among Vikings and medieval\u00a0\nGermans for relieving pain during childbirth and\u00a0\u00a0 for toothaches while Queen Elizabeth used cannabis\u00a0\nto relieve her menstrual cramps but only in recent\u00a0\u00a0 decades it's have we come to understand how\u00a0\nand why cannabis affects humans the plant\u00a0\u00a0 was largely excluded from scientific study due to\u00a0\nits widespread illegality until the 1960s when an\u00a0\u00a0 Israeli chemist named Rafael McCollum McCullum was\u00a0\nable to obtain confiscated hashish from police and\u00a0\u00a0 study it he elucidated the structure of THC and\u00a0\nCBD and then in 1992 made an even more fundamental\u00a0\u00a0 discovery the existence of the endocannabinoid\u00a0\nsystem meaning the EC s in the human body so the\u00a0\u00a0 EC s is the body's largest system of receptors and\u00a0\nit's found throughout the brain nervous system and\u00a0\u00a0 organs it's been described as the molecular bridge\u00a0\nbetween the body and the mind scientists have come\u00a0\u00a0 to believe the EC s is among the most important\u00a0\nphysiological systems involved in human health\u00a0\u00a0 because it regulates both mood and homeostasis\u00a0\nkeeping internal systems balanced in the face of\u00a0\u00a0 external stress and inflammation he said that by\u00a0\nusing a plant that has been around for thousands\u00a0\u00a0 of years we discovered a new physiological system\u00a0\nof immense importance we wouldn't have been able\u00a0\u00a0 to get there if we had not looked at the plant\u00a0\nso the implications of this discovery including\u00a0\u00a0 the burgeoning applications of CBD are only\u00a0\nbeginning to take shape and looking at the\u00a0\u00a0 ec s McCullum uncovered naturally occurring\u00a0\nneurotransmitters called endocannabinoids that\u00a0\u00a0 are structurally nearly identical to the phyto\u00a0\ncannabinoids found in cannabis THC mimics these\u00a0\u00a0 endocannabinoids endocannabinoids and binds to\u00a0\nthe two main kinds of receptors in the body cb1\u00a0\u00a0 and cb2 CBD doesn't directly bind the cb1 or cb2\u00a0\nreceptors but instead serves as a real take and\u00a0\u00a0 break down inhibitor preventing the breakdown of\u00a0\nnaturally-occurring endocannabinoids in the body\u00a0\u00a0 this is essentially the same way that selective\u00a0\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs work which\u00a0\u00a0 prevent the reuptake and breakdown of serotonin\u00a0\nin the brain and if you're not familiar with\u00a0\u00a0 SSRIs these are the medications that are mainly\u00a0\nused to treat anxiety and depression think paxil\u00a0\u00a0 zoloft cetera so CBDs health impacts span the\u00a0\nentire endocannabinoid system in particular\u00a0\u00a0 researchers have found a CBD increases the levels\u00a0\nof an and amide and cannabinoid known as the Bliss\u00a0\u00a0 molecule derived from the Sanskrit word Ananda\u00a0\nwhich means extreme happiness or one of the\u00a0\u00a0 highest states of being CBD has shown to generally\u00a0\nserve as a boon for brain health serving as both\u00a0\u00a0 a protectant and enhancing neuroplasticity it's\u00a0\nbeen shown to be effective applied topically in\u00a0\u00a0 reducing inflammation and overall body pain some\u00a0\nearly studies suggest that CBD might help fight\u00a0\u00a0 cancer and has already earned a place in overall\u00a0\ncancer treatment force ability to reduce nausea\u00a0\u00a0 and help with pain and the benefits of CBD appear\u00a0\nto come with little to no side effects according\u00a0\u00a0 to the World Health Organization they said CBD\u00a0\nexhibits no effects indicative of any abuse or\u00a0\u00a0 dependence potential and today there's no evidence\u00a0\nof public health related problems associated with\u00a0\u00a0 the use of pure CBD because this is all relatively\u00a0\nnew science studies of CBDs efficacy in a number\u00a0\u00a0 of treatments are still preliminary and its actual\u00a0\nmarketing is often suspect many products are being\u00a0\u00a0 released without much regulatory oversight and\u00a0\nthe CBD levels and overall quality of CBD products\u00a0\u00a0 are not always as advertised mostly they don't\u00a0\ncome as advertised so some CBD products contain\u00a0\u00a0 unwanted THC which means some people might test\u00a0\npositive for marijuana so you really have to do\u00a0\u00a0 your research to learn what CBD brands you can\u00a0\ntrust besides determining the safety and efficacy\u00a0\u00a0 of CBD for various medical conditions there are\u00a0\nlots of other questions that scientists need to\u00a0\u00a0 answer for example what form of CBD should be\u00a0\ntaken what is the recommended dosage and much\u00a0\u00a0 more so there's a lot coming down the pike and\u00a0\nif you want to know more about CBD or if you\u00a0\u00a0 have questions about it put it in the comments\u00a0\nbelow and make sure to give this video like

are going to be making candied grapes so as you see we have the jolly ranchers the grapes the pot rocks and we have the repetitive also we have food coloring so we are going to be and we are going to be using the ingredients to make it so be right back when we have we're back and see you as we have the job yeah and we're going to what we're going to be doing doing we're going to take this i know i look a little blender we're going to take this blender take the jogging wrenches and pour it in here we're not going to put the pop rocks in the blender though but we just want to do this okay we're done my shirt is the red one and the green one my favorite is the um really i like all junior wrenches but my favorite is the blue one and green and i like the grape one too i don't like the purple because it's just like grapefruit and i don't really like perfect so yeah you guys we are i guess you could say we are back now back then we are better you know oh this looks pretty yeah let me show you guys if y'all how you guys been since quarantine for us has been it's been okay it's just you know it's different it took us out of school we got to do home school gotta do home school got new stuff on the computer i don't i can't say that i don't really like home school i like real school way better this whole school is like right i just wish they hurry up everybody get better this whole thing go away so we can go back to school go back to our normal life i mean it's getting kind of bad regular but you know you still gotta walk around with a mess and whatnot okay yeah um i mean like real school like we've got schools in real life it don't like take that long but at home school would take so long at home it is so i don't know about you guys like comment down below if you guys have to do home school or you guys are back to school where you guys stay but down here where we live we are in we got to do home school and like for me home school is very it's difficult it's a lot of different things i'm not used to yeah i would prefer you know the regular way the wet school but it looks like that's what it's going to be like hopefully it's not for the rest of the year just for this quarter right especially when we get a parent okay okay mix it up cause it's like stuck in the world or whatever i like this i like the smell of the jelly brush it smells so good so yeah guys we will be back after we're finished for all of this yeah it's a lot all right guys we are back we got most of the candy out we got enough what we think is enough see we have it in the blender now and now we're gonna warn it this is gonna be very loud so yes not cool [Music] did i see that oh yeah okay guys she's gonna take the top off so we can show you guys the inside [Music] whoa like i said i'm just eyeballing it okay i think that's enough and now we're going to add a little bit of water okay guys i added a little bit of water now i'm stirring it um i like i like the one how i look in person let me see if i can try to show it because i think it's the light that's way too dark yeah but it's really like pinkish type of violating person you know now we're going to come back after we let this cook for a minute all right you guys i can hear the pop rocks here y'all hear it it's actually you see if you see like that no food one that's not orange it's red because you probably don't care myself it's the color red it's not orange it's red all right so i'm coming to you guys later okay but guys we are back okay so we had a little mess up you guys i don't know what happened but we blended the the johnny manchester see this is how it turned out i don't know what happened but we can still make this out of something because at the end of the day still um it's still jolly ranchers so we can still dip it in there we're going to use our grapes let's see right here once i got grapes i'm going to take some toothpicks put them on this toothpick and dip it in the corn syrup did a jolly rancher and then we're going to see our pop rocks right here we're going to dip it in there really really low it didn't take that long she probably just [Music] so this is what we're going to do we're going to take this stick it in castle do it yeah [Music] actually dropped in it and we're gonna stick it in the hot rocks i didn't really get the whole whatever i'm gonna take it and put it in this pan over here with the rest of the grapes there is it guys look how pretty that look if i want to make it if you gotta move just come watch this video yeah just gonna watch this video you know learn from miles and snakes you don't have to know we made a few mistakes but we still could make it let's just show you guys what and what not to do and still have fun with it oh this didn't feel high i could really feel it [Music] oh what is it dip then what is that it's corn syrup and jolly ranching pop rocks [Music] go ahead let me see honest opinion [Music] i miss opinion what it's good it's not nice it's good that'd be creative for like birthday parties it's just coming over yeah it's like a good juice to it like gum i love fruit love sugar have fun on both sides they're healthy versus the sugar sweet too which i give it from 1 to 10 which i give it give it eight see they had big m in here the mama for mmt you know i could have been here decorating and showing off but next time probably be in the video and show y'all how to really decorate and do your thing you know what i'm saying well y'all did good i'm very proud of y'all round of applause everybody really likes at

welcome to nkf kidney talks for this edition I will be talking about dietary management of hyperkalemia in patients with chronic kidney disease there are many ideologies for acute and chronic hyperkalemia but they basically fall into two categories one is an excess of potassium released from cells and the second is acute intake of potassium this program will focus on dietary intake of potassium let's begin with a study that looked at dietary potassium intake and mortality in hemodialysis patients in this study food frequency questionnaire used to determine the potassium intake of 224 patients on hemodialysis after adjustments for serum potassium and intakes of energy protein and phosphorus dietary potassium intake was associated with greater mortality risk this means that the higher the dietary potassium content the higher the mortality the quartile with the highest mortality an average dietary intake of three thousand four hundred and forty milligrams of potassium per day this study looked at serum and dialysate potassium concentrations and survival in hemodialysis patients it was a three year study of over eighty one thousand patients on hemodialysis the study also looked at protein intake as you can see on this graph patients with estimated higher protein intake at higher serum potassium levels a pre dialysis serum potassium a four point six to five point three millions per liter was associated with the greatest survival the recommended dietary protein intake for dialysis patients is 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram per day which in this study was associated with a serum potassium of five point one millions per liter this can be achieved with a dietary intake of about 2,000 to 3,000 milligrams of potassium per day a thorough nutrition assessment includes evaluation of potassium status the assessment should include a review of serum potassium and glucose the reference range for serum potassium is three point five to five millions per liter elevated serum glucose may cause potassium to move out of the cells and into the blood circulation this potassium shift causes hyperkalemia a review of prescribed and over-the-counter medications is also important when assessing potassium status since many medications such as ACE inhibitors and ARBs can cause hyperkalemia for patients on dialysis the dialysate potassium concentration should be evaluated for example a new dialysis patient on a higher potassium dialysate who starts feeling better and is eating more protein may exhibit higher levels of serum potassium the dialysate potassium concentration should be adjusted accordingly a quantitative assessment of dietary potassium intake is also essential this should include a three-day diet record and a food frequency questionnaire these methods will reveal intake of high potassium content foods and or supplements Dietary analysis software can also be used to further quantify dietary potassium intake potassium is a mineral found in most foods so limiting dietary potassium can be a challenge for patients patients with chronic kidney disease often have multiple dietary restrictions such as potassium sodium and phosphorus so they're left with very limited food choices the typical American diet which is rich in animal protein and dairy products provides approximately 3,500 to 4,500 milligrams of potassium per day whereas a potassium restricted diet is approximately 2,000 to 3,000 milligrams of potassium per day clinicians should base the dietary potassium prescription on the serum potassium level so which foods are high in potassium the foods with more than 200 milligrams of potassium per serving or considered high potassium several fruits and vegetables such as orange banana and potato have a high potassium content dairy products nuts beans and chocolate are also potassium rich foods oftentimes patients on a potassium restricted diet are also trying to restrict sodium they may start using a salt substitute or low sodium spice mix that contains potassium chloride which causes a spike in their serum potassium herbal preparations such as noni juice and others may be another problematic source of potassium in my clinical experience two of the most common dietary causes of hyperkalemia are related to seasonal foods and cultural or ethnic food preferences in the summer for example there are more potassium rich fruits and vegetables available such as garden tomatoes or cantaloupe and honeydew melons patients are tempted to indulge in seasonal foods that have a high potassium content since their availability is limited year-round culturally diverse food preferences are also important considerations the dietary potassium intake some cultures eat more fruits and vegetables and Dietary staples such as legumes tubers plantains and tomatoes are high in potassium patients need intensive education on how to reduce dietary potassium portion size is important in reducing dietary potassium since a large serving of a low potassium food can result in a high potassium intake this is a difficult concept for some patients to understand since they may be eating the right foods but they're just having too much food lists can also help patients choose lower potassium content fruits and vegetables this information can be found on the National Kidney Foundation website at www.investmentpitch.com food which is called sensible cheating this allows patients to have a favourite food without overdoing it it's also possible to reduce the potassium content of many fruits and vegetables for example peeling fruits such as peaches lowers potassium content since a high concentration of potassium is in the fruit skin the juice that canned fruits are packed in is also high in potassium since the fruit is cooked in this juice and the potassium reaches out into the liquid therefore patients should drain and rinse canned fruits to reduce potassium content leaching is another way to reduce potassium leaching is a process of soaking sliced raw vegetables in water for at least 2 hours before cooking to leach some of the potassium out of the food and into the water patients on a sodium restriction should use seasonings that do not contain potassium chloride patients should also limit the use of milk and milk products for example using milk for cereal or coffee only or using milk substitute to reduce dietary potassium and finally dining out takes careful planning to maintain low to moderate potassium intake for example patients can order a half portion of an entree and choose rice instead of potato so what does treating hypoglycemia have to do with dietary management of hyperkalemia one of the most common treatments for hypoglycemia is orange juice but since orange juice is high in potassium this is contraindicated when restricting dietary potassium instead patients should choose low potassium content beverages and foods that contain 15 grams of carbohydrate some examples listed here are lower potassium content juices such as apple grape or cranberry regular lemonade and clear sodas regular hard candy glucose tablets or glucose gel these low potassium choices can prevent unwanted spikes in serum potassium while treating hypoglycemia in conclusion many potassium rich foods such as fruits and vegetables are also heart-healthy the for a low potassium diet has the potential to fall short of a heart-healthy diet and according to several studies may contribute to the burden of cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease it's important to educate patients regarding the different sources of potassium and empower them to make the best choices a balanced and realistic approach would mean choosing the most beneficial sources of potassium which is only possible through intensive education by a registered dietician nutritionist thank you for participating in this program", "FW3Pi3C-32I": "hey y'all welcome to my youtube channel so today we are going to be making crack grape or candy grapes or whatnot and we have our breaks leave our watch I was setting the boat up anytime dish or whatever for like an hour carrots are abundant sugar food coloring a little screwing things how you said it and our Jolly Ranchers which is the main thing damn for making the mess it is what it is anyways y'all stay tuned to see what we do know guess what I'm making take a guess what am I making okay y'all so in this pot I have a 1/2 cup of sugar 1/4 cup of water and 1/4 cup of the light corn syrup sometimes we'll let this boil so to get to the hard crack stage so if you use it a candy thermometer that would be like 295 but I'm not so I'm gonna do the cold water bit see and I'll show you how I do that later maybe I just wanna take a little while shouldn't take some elevation you keep trying to keep an eye on it for sometimes things kind of go fast to be thanked and you go buy your sugar so yeah okay so you see me did you see how to bow bow so I start to slow down or whatever this is right the process so the slowly bubbles the boy is doing so I'm gonna keep letting it bubble up or whatever the hey you gonna call it boy um he ready sugar cook it's not quite where I wanted to be and I could tell they just looking at it Oh also if you didn't get any crystals like on the side of your own like on the side of your pain to use a brush to brush that down or some water but I'm not doing all that do a stain angle third not gonna do nothin cuz that kind of causes book that causes little action so I'm just gonna let it cook yep [Music] and I'm gonna do what it says I'm gonna show y'all how I did my water taste so I got my pie I had my cup of water right so let me show you you take your spatula this is the cold water this is how I can tell when my  is ready if I could get that in there anyways so you see that noise see how he's breaking dance what you would cover crops [Music] okay so I put a little food coloring your new Charlie ready to pieces I believe this one pink okay so hopefully there's a very repetitive the obvious or something like it looks like keep pushing all right I think I want to do one okay yeah so I got that friend get right on into charter I never tried this before so I got the swim didn't like this right see my background what is today okay guys thanks for watching make sure you like comment share and subscribe and tell your friends to come by", "WB1L4ZQ7Qss": "[Music] what else we gain it's your girl Rochelle in the building and today I'm coming to bring you another great video in this video I'm going to show you how to create infuse crack grapes if you are new to my channel hit that subscribe button that notification bail and leave a comment in the comment section below letting me know how you enjoyed this video here I have my grapes you're gonna need a half cup of water a half cup of light corn serve 2 cups a granulated sugar full coloring of your choice some flavoring to go into your mixture this is a lime flavor to go along with the Absolut lime liqueur right into your mixture you're gonna need some sticks for your grapes and you can't forget the Jolly Ranchers you're gonna need some paper towel along with a candy thermometer a food processor or blender to blend your Jolly Ranchers now let's get into the video here I have my grapes into a bowl you want to soak your grapes and too with the liquor you can use a shot or two shots long as you soak your grapes and once you do that make sure you cover them up and taking some gloves and you just want to swivel and swish around your grapes into that liquor so that it can be completely coated and then put away to sit for two to three hours alright now you're going to take our grapes and make sure you dry them completely they need to be completely dry and you can insert your sticks right into your grapes and let them sit out until your mixture is complete [Music] you want to make sure you use long sticks so that you'll be able to dip them into your mixture and not have your fingers burnt off so make sure your sticks are long you guys so you don't have any burns on your fingertips that's important so here we have our Jolly Ranchers you want to unwrap them and make sure that your Jolly Ranchers stay dry and not wet it will be difficult to blend your Jolly Ranchers into your blender if they are wet so I'm using between 30 to 36 of these Jolly Ranchers and they're going to go right into my little food processor that I have here which you can find on Amazon a great fine and great for these Jolly Ranchers so we're going to go ahead and take our top off and put our Jolly Ranchers right into the blender here now we're going to put our top on and you want to do a few pulsating spins with these Jolly Ranchers and get to mixing them up so they can break down evenly [Music] now we got to remove our top and check out our mix here now see here you have your Jolly Ranchers they're a little bit thick and a little bit large in size but you don't want that you want to break them down to a much finer crumble so that they'll be able to coach your golly rant of crack grapes your grapes evenly all right so here we have the crumble of your candy mixture or Jolly Ranchers not mixture and this is the end result of how you want your Jolly Ranchers to turn out to be now let's make our mixture let's add our 1/2 cup of water our 1/2 cup a light corn syrup [Music] now we're going to add our two cups of granulated sugar and we got a mix and combine this well this particular recipe will it cover at least fifty to sixty grapes so we're going to insert our candy thermometer make sure you clip it on the side don't let it touch the bottom of the pot or it will give off a false reading you guys so make sure that you just insert your candy thermometer right into the mixture so that you can get and receive a good reading as your mixture cook you want to then add in your liqueur and add in your flavor you want to let this cook to 280 to 80 degrees and you want to add in about two tablespoons of your liquor being that you're adding in this liquid you want to let your mixture cook and remove at 300 degrees now I'm adding in the flavor and you want to add in the full dram to this recipe okay once that has cooked to 300 degrees remove your thermometer and you want to place it in a cup so that you can get that candy mixture off of there and now we're going to add our color add in four drops of white gel food coloring and you want to mix that in adding in the white will help give you a lighter tone color so the color I'm trying to achieve is a teal color with using this sky blue I want to add in three to four drops of the blue to create the light teal color that I'm looking for and you want to mix that very well until all of the gel food colour is equally combined [Music] now here we have our teal color the color I was looking for taking your grape and dipping it right in scraping off a little bit and add it right into your jolly mix your Jolly Rancher mix and dip and add it right to your jolly mixture dip I like to cover my grape I like to coat it fully or you can cover halfway it's totally up to you whatever you prefer but make sure that is coated well and then you can dip right into your Jolly Rancher mix now once your mix is in the bowl if it sits a little while and it gets hard just break it up either with a spoon or run your hand through it or you can put it back into your mixer and break it up just a little bit so that it can break up that hard hardness as it sits and there you have you guys are infused crack or candied grapes if you have enjoyed this video give this video a

these classes we'll be discussing about the clinical nutrition and medical nutrition management for CHT and heart failure we'll be discussing about the coronary heart disease and heart failure what would be the nutritional intervention or dietary management for the patients who have CHD or heart failure problem not only that we'll be discussing about hypertension myocardial infarction dyslipidemia ischemia and also angina so let's start let's the ball rolling so eating for a whole heart whole delights child do we have to understand a basic nutrition though so that we always try to refer the American Heart Association's read they say try to maintain our healthy weight healthy body weight because we know not only diabetes but also obesity is a risk factor for the car do patients maintain healthy cholesterol level maintain normal blood pressure what we can say normal tension on normotensive maintain normal blood sugar levels that means normal i semuc physical inactivity used and exposure to tobacco products so we shouldn't do physical inactivity we should be physical active and also so this is a heart-healthy food pyramid where we can see the many portions is a very larger size where we can see people can run the you know having lot of vegetables like orange color yellow color white color green color where you can see our vegetables like Indian flag color be physically active enjoy meals with others and also exercises and so the next M Baba above there the greens all the greens like green leafy vegetables other vegetables with a very good content of chlorophyll so is a very good antioxidant very good amount of phytochemicals so these are there above that we have we can see there are lot of fruits different color fruits seasonal fruits whole grains so what are the recommendation fruits and veggies whole-grain high fiber oily fish lean meats fat-free skim low-fat 1% Erie reduce added sugars because is an empty calorie we you know very well that if we take hundred gram of sugar we can grade only hundred grams of carbohydrate which is very empty calorie kind of thing so there is no suger at all and little or no salt solid part we'll be covering later on what is the amount of salt and what if the exact amount of salt we can take for a cardiovascular patient you now we are talking about the fat so if we talk about the fat so definitely we are talking about the visible fat basically so if in case of the visible visible fat part that that is in incorporated is dyed should be reaching unsaturated fatty acid and should not provide more than 20% of the total energy so basically if we talk about the fat so we are talking about the good friend okay so dietary fat is a consistent support for the hypothesis of the buddha quantity and quality of the fat directly associated with the elevation of most blood lipids particularly LDL low density lipoprotein cholesterol it has love now we are coming the sodium restriction sodium restriction in theory specifically we if we highlighted the sodium restriction for the hypertension patients hypertensive patient high blood pressure hypertension patients so now you have to understand that one teaspoon of salt one teaspoon 1 teaspoon mil 5 gram one teaspoon salt basically 2000 mg of sodium 2,000 mg or two gram of sodium 2 gram of sodium so if the 5 gram salt is there then out of Vibram to grab ox or a because we know sodium chlorite is the chemical name of salt table salt so 2 gram of sodium or 2,000 mg of sodium is present now we will talk about the sodium restriction how do you do that studies have shown that sodium restriction along strict sodium restriction 0.5 gram sodium 500 mg apart from the restriction stated above meat milk and eggs are allowed in small portion and vegetables we highest sodium content are avoided in Sevilla sodium restriction that is 0.25 gram sodium 250 mg this level is too restrictive and nutritionally in adequate and realistic to be used practically in these restricted quantities of meat and eggs are used in occasionally I have talked about the heart failure patient in the heart failure patient basically the 1 point 5 gram 1 point 5 gram sodium is recommended for the heart failure patient basically so what is low sodium diet basically there are foods are bread chapati sweet rice maize chewy so this is a food packaging level that is something some things outside from your book also will be this light is very critical that you how to understand the food packaging level because this is a packaging level where the all the neutral fact is written so once someone is shopping from the outside market there has to be checked about this reading food levels where the sodium is mentioned put a shame is mentioned Cola stall is mentioned everything else so packaging of food is very important how do the perfect package so accordingly people can purchase folks from the outside market so this is something is very practical very practical scenario that students can understand you now here is our slide the salty foods less often and the three colors are there green means smiley moderate means less smiley food high in salt is strictly known as an angry kind of sign because people can allowed of this thing for force so he will smiley thy food prepares at home basically in fresh ingredient fruits and vegetables unsalted nuts and seeds beans lentils LPS pasta plain popcorn or pasta it was very challenge I see soca our is it were perfectly all right with us oats fresh fish fresh chicken meat eggs yogurt because we know the very good I'm the probiotics this yogurt and curd like lactobacillus Bifidobacterium present ok and also lemon juice in case of moderate type there salted nuts pastries cakes okay soft tough margin is a very moderate kind of thing but this is not allowed ok and ha - that this is very important students because this is also for your learning your MSE theories practicals and your digital life while counseling the patient that is very important so what is - diet all about the full form of - tide is Dietary Approaches to stop hypertension has been shown to help lower blood pressure and prevent heart disease stroke diabetes and even some forms of cancer it focuses on eating more fresh fruits and vegetable this is a guide to how much of each food group you should eat every day based on eating some certain amount of calories per tape so in case of weight reduction in your ABC book is written as MF n 0 0 5 maintain normal body weight BMI eighteen point five to twenty four point nine so now we are talking about the hyperkalemia okay sometimes there are certain medications they have lot of you know job nutrient interaction if we talk about Arnie okay and it ends in receptor omnipresent inhibitors they're the adversely winces hyper carry if we talk about mineralocorticoids antagonist receptor emerets Vistaprint agonist emerets like spironolactone all the action this kind of thing so in that cases we should although ways studies are low potassium touch okay so here is the chart you can find which are the potassium low potassium in low petition basically zero 200 mg medium potassium 101 2 mm mg and also hyper high potassium that is 2,000 mg and here it will also example low potassium foods high potassium foods for your references you can see as a pictorial presentation you now we are discussing about the fluid so fluid restriction is necessary fluid restriction students try to understand is necessary only if edema is present only his edema is present I already talked and spoke about edema in the previous lecture slides that what is reading all about so if edema is present but in that case is also theory you should understand but practically you always try to follow our cardiologist or a physician's prescription what kind of drugs he or she has written me if diuretics is there during the summer and where you know we are losses our isotonic salt they're invisible perspiration this happens so in that cases the so this is the basically measurements of fluid where I try to weigh the focus in this presentation of any peanut kind of things so you can have a nutshell you can just see also document you yes some people has a question get if what they can do if they go thirsty so being cursed is very common this does not mean that body means the more fluid you have to be more careful use ice chips just rinse your mouth freeze juice and ice cube tray lemon wedge chewing gum definitely sugar-free chewing gum strawberries this is the way they can you know can some kind of lubricant of your mouth for the psychological front so this is something they need to so in cases they're the practical present patient if you see them in words in cardio patients in our during internship this will be a very helpful you captain high-salt drinks should be a perfect you you you now there are certain jobs near a subtle drug there are certain drugs like you know any antique Oberlin job like warfarin comma Dean as it ROM this kind of drug they're always being a dietitian you try to restrict vitamin K rich food not vitamin K resource so in that cases I have been listed high moderate and though in case of high broccoli brussel sprout cabbage can loyal net use parsley swabbing all spinach this is the way high moderate is asparagus cheese margarine olive oil peas red cabbage and Louise alfalfa beans since", "DxVx5My-Zkc": "hey guys welcome to taste of love i'm marine and today we are making jolly rancher candy grapes so before we get started go ahead and give this video a thumbs up click on the subscribe button and turn on your post notifications so you'll be notified every single time a new video drops so let's go ahead and get started okay so here we have our supplies we have our cairo syrup white food coloring blue food coloring toothpicks jolly rancher grapes and a one cup measuring cup so before we get started we're going to prep our grapes our grapes have already been washed and dried they would drive using a paper towel and now we're going to insert the toothpicks into our grapes so that we can dip them in the candy now when it comes to dipping the toothpicks when it comes to putting the toothpicks into the grapes you can't put it where you remove the grape from the stem on this side you put it on the opposite side on the bottom so you run the toothpick through the bottom of the grate so that when you shake it and you dip it it won't fall off so we're going to insert our toothpicks into all of our grapes make sure you go through your bag of grapes really carefully because a lot of the time some of the grapes are rotten and they're deforming so you don't want to dip those grapes into candy so we're going to stick them all and then you want to put the toothpick not just a little bit in so that when you go like that it'll fall off but more all the way in so when you shake it because you would have to shake off that excess candy it wouldn't fall off [Music] and then you put it all the way in so that it's sturdy so that it really holds onto the grate you can use any other food color that you want also i'm using blue because i wanted mine to be blue and i'm going to flavor it with the blue jolly rancher candies also [Applause] but i'm going to show you guys that in one second so you also need your thermometer and a deep size pot because sometimes your candy batter does bubble up for this recipe we're doing the four one one method so we're using four cups of sugar 1 cup of carrot syrup and 1 cup of water now if you do put your toothpick all the way through and it comes through the top it doesn't matter because when you slip it out after you dip it in candy it'll still come easily out [Music] [Applause] okay so right now we're going to add our ingredients to the pot to make our candy batter so we're gonna add four cups of sugar [Music] one cup of water [Music] and our cairo syrup [Music] now i'm going to add a few drops of white food coloring [Music] and i'm also going to add the blue and just two drops of the blue now i'm going to start my stove and turn it up to 7.5 so that my candy batter can cook and we're going to leave our candy batter to cook until it gets to 300 degrees okay you see the the colors is getting all mixed up on its own this is why i don't mix it because i like when it gets mixed from cooking it gets a more even mixture then if you try to mix it up but that's just what i like so this is why i didn't mix it when i put the colors in [Music] [Music] all right our candy has finished cooking it's gotten to 300 degrees look at how pretty that blue is so we're gonna take our pot off of the hot stove and then we're gonna get ready to dip our grapes okay so i have my pot angled to the side it's leaning on the stove just so that the angle would be i guess kind of able to tilt all my batter down so that i can get it and what i have here is my food processor which i'm going to crush up my jolly ranchers with so i'm just going to drop some of the jolly ranchers into my food processor and crush them up real quick and the reason i wait for my candy to be done cooking while i do this is because i don't want my um my candy to my well not my candy not my candy batter but the jolly rancher candies to get sticky and stick together and then it's hard to use so i'm just going to drop them in here really quick and blend it up so i'm opening my blue candy first because what i'm going to do is take this blue candy and drop it into my candy batter so that it'll flavor it i'm just putting two of them in here the candy is hot [Music] so it will melt it [Music] so now i'm going to drop my jolly ranchers in here really quickly so we could just crush them up if you don't have a food processor you can put them in three ziploc bags i will triple bag it and then use a rolling pin and crush it [Music] that method has worked for me personally for a little while before i started putting it in the fruit processor the food processor just makes it more fine and more dusted than really chunky and i like it finer than more chunkier because if you ever ate candy grapes you know that when you put it in your matcha bite into it if it's really chunky it can like scratch the top of your mouth and it's really painful so i'm just putting all my candy in here [Music] and i don't really need a lot because we only did a little bit of grapes [Music] okay so i have all the jolly ranchers that i want in here now i am going to turn it on so we can crush these up [Music] there we go nice and fine now i'm going to take them and pour them out into a little bowl so that we can go ahead and dip our grapes into our candy mixture and add jolly ranchers to move this inside nice and crushed so now we're going to go ahead and dip our grapes into our candy okay so here's my grape i'm going to dip it into my candy shake it off and roll it into my genre and there we go that's how it's going to look here now let's dip all of them shake it off you don't want to exist and also i use a spoon to keep the jolly rancher constantly mixed you can use a fork so it doesn't really matter because if you let your jolly rancher sit still it will start pumping up and get hard [Music] and i would suggest putting them in the refrigerator immediately after dipping [Music] i do suggest putting your candy grapes in the refrigerator immediately after dipping because it does get sticky and it starts melting almost immediately candy grapes is one of the fruits that will melt really really fast like really really fast from the minute you dip the grapes into the candy it starts to melt because grapes are a water-based fruit so they don't last very long you can put your grapes in the freezer after you dip them to try to lengthen how long they last but it does not lengthen it by much maybe by just a couple hours and putting it in the freezer would not change the taste it would still have the same great taste so we're going to go ahead and keep dipping and then add the jolly ranchers too [Music] look at how pretty that color is now the reason we add white food coloring is so that the color does not become transparent if you don't add white food coloring to your candy your candy will be transparent meaning that you can see right through and you can see your fruit like if you guys remember in the candy tangerine video we didn't use any color so the candy was clear your candy will be clear with like a light color if you don't put the white food coloring in the white food coloring is what gives it the background basically so that your grapes can turn into a different color so they won't be like you know green with a light blue look and i've tried dipping red grapes however red grapes are really really really sweet so they're not as tasty as using green grapes i think it's more delicious with the green grapes because the sweetness weighs out with the sour to give it a nice taste but with the red grapes it's just overly sour and i mean overly sweet i apologize it's just overly sweet so it's not really [Music] that good because to me too much sweet just takes all the flavor away from it [Music] i was about to dip it in the jolly rancher without putting it in the candy bag [Music] and you see how good our toothpick comes in handy um you can use skewers if you want to um i think the skewers are too long personally i don't like using screwers that's why i choose the toothpick method but there's like a different way for everything and i tell you guys this all the time i teach you guys what works for me i like showing you guys what i like to do there's always a different way for everything i just show you my way and what works for me because you can do it and say oh i don't like her way of doing this i like this way better and that is perfectly fine because there's always a million different ways to do stuff [Music] so my jolly ranchers are almost finished i'm just going to [Music] start using my spoon so i can pick up if you wanted to add a flavor to your candy also you can use the lorraine's flavor oil and you can add that instead of adding the jolly rancher like i did i wanted my jolly rancher flavor since we're using jolly ranchers and their decorations [Music] i'm running out of space [Music] let's just give them a flat bottom instead of a flat back and then you have to dip these real fast also because depending on the temperature of your house the candy batter will start to harden really fast because these are hard crack candy that's why we get it to 300 degrees 300 degrees is the point of hard crack [Music] it's how a lollipop would be you can use the same batter to make lollipops also and of course if you guys try this and i would love to see what you guys did so take a picture and tag me on instagram my instagram is in the description if you guys make these you had problems with them it was easy um whatever happened just let me know leave me a comment let me know if you liked it if it was delicious just let me know how it turned out i would love to hear from you guys [Music] and you see that the jolly rancher candy is already [Music] [Music] the whole time [Music] okay so we're almost done [Music] then i'm going to show you guys how to easily slip your toothpicks off and get ready to serve them eat them enjoy them put them in the refrigerator um if you're saving them for later later like you don't want to eat them right right now put them in the freezer so that they don't start breaking down as fast because they do break down very very quickly very very quickly like i believe candy grapes only last i think a maximum of about two to three hours depending on how you make them depending on the time of the year um to me i find that they last longer in the time because it's colder depending on how hot you keep your house also um in the summertime if you have them outside they will almost melt immediately and the same thing goes for your candy apples also they melt really quickly i'm gonna sprinkle it some of my candy is still on wet most of it has already dry and hardened it gets hard almost immediately after dipping them they dry really really quickly okay we're down to our last three grapes so now we're going to get ready to start pulling off our toothpicks from our grapes and separating it last two roll it in my jolly rancher last one i'm gonna cover it in our jolly rancher there we go [Music] all right so there we go now we're going to slide them off of our [Music] toothpicks and i'm going to put them [Music] and you can tell that the candy is hard when you squeeze it it doesn't get soft or squishy [Music] and that's how it looks when you like into it [Music] it's really crunchy and there we go jolly rancher candy grapes if you enjoyed today's video go ahead and give this video a thumbs up subscribe and make sure you turn on your post notifications so you'll be notified every single time we upload a video and of course if you have questions leave it in the comments and i'll be happy to answer you guys see you guys later", "NiaPli8UDB0": "welcome to episode 4 of mmm medical edibles I'm chef Tynan Nicole chef and culinary nutritionist and today we're gonna make flavored candy also known as Jolly Ranchers this episode is sponsored by fat bull and the new ill-mannered film series custom agents check it out on our channel in our playlist section the following are the ingredients you'll need to make the candies okay today's ingredients are sugar light corn syrup flavored oil food coloring water vegetable oil Keith and confectioner sugar for this recipe will be using Keith if you'd like to learn how to deke are pure Keith you can go ahead and watch episode 3 this Keith is from this tangerine dream are you high for today's recipe what you'll need is a candy thermometer a pastry brush and several spatulas I prefer silicon some candy mullets metal measuring spoons and a large saucepan start with your large saucepan our first ingredient is 2 cups of sugar and I like to sift the sugar in case there are any large lumps that's annoying next we'll add 3/4 cups of water which I've already pre-measured here for this next part I recommend you pre grease your container with a little bit of vegetable oil spray that way the corn syrup won't stick to it and you'll get the correct measurement oh yeah got any grease yes I also recommend you do this with your spatula as well and your measuring tool I'm just gonna use this to make sure it's all coated okie dokie for this we're using a 1/3 measuring cup all of the tools have been sprayed with vegetable oil now we're going to measure out the light corn syrup we need 2/3 of a cup so we'll measure 1/3 of a cup twice you can see that the syrup is not sticking normally you have to fight for it to come out we're gonna do this again now that we've measured out our corn syrup we'll just add it to the rest of the ingredients and you can see how easily it comes out of the bowl now we're going to take this over to the stove this next part of the recipe is going to take some time so you want to make sure that you can really pay attention to the saucepan on the stove you want to watch what you're doing make sure you're not on the phone or distracted you don't necessarily have to attend to it in terms of storing or mixing it but you were going to be watching the temperature because we want to make sure that we get the right consistency for our Jolly wrenches it can go from soft candy to hard candy to burn candy the mixture can easily burn and then the taste is going to be really off you'll still be able to eat it but probably will not be enjoyable so make sure you have time to pay attention that way you won't have to start over from scratch and waste your batch you want to turn the stove on to a medium heat you're gonna stir your mixture until the sugar dissolves you can see that it's sticking a little bit so just put some elbow grease in it oh that's greasy that's really [ __ ] I said yeah it's greasy get in the corners because sometimes the sugar tends to clump up together on the bottom and then once you see the sugars pretty much dissolve you can just leave that alone we're gonna use our candy thermometer and you want to make sure that you don't put the bottom of the thermometer to the bottom of the saucepan because then they'll give you an inaccurate reading I put a little bit of water in here what you're gonna do is you're going to take your pastry brush and just dip it a little bit in the water and then I'm gonna wash down the stuck sugar crystals onto the mixture you don't want that to interfere with how the candy comes together you can see that the mixture is coming to a boil and that's perfectly fine we're waiting for it to reach 260 degrees so once the temperature of the candy reaches 260 degrees you're going to add your food coloring okay you can get this at any grocery store and we're actually gonna do the mint green color for the green apple flavor that we're doing today and that's just following the instructions on the box start with nine green drops and 3 yellow drops and then we'll see what that looks like and then adjust the color accordingly if we need you we just need about one or two more degrees some more and then we can add the food coloring one two three nine well once you've added the food coloring you're not going to mix it at all you're going to just let the boiling action mix it itself it looks like it's a nice bright green I added a little bit more yellow because it was just a little bit too much of a grass green than a green apple green I passed on grass all the time the minty green gives more of a green apple tone to it we've pulled the pan off the stove at 300 degrees we're gonna add green apple flavoring to this I'm adding a full tablespoon you want to keep all of the essential oil with in the saucepan and now we're gonna add our Keef as well now remember this has already been decart so we don't have to worry about that and we just need to get it off the paper there we go star very quickly you don't want the essential oils to evaporate completely this may smoke so I have my lid ready and because we're using Keith versus BHO you may not have the same uniformity but this came out really really good all right we're gonna lift the lid on and now you're gonna take your candy moles and spray them with vegetable so the color looks really good I try not to over pour it if you have someone that can help you they can kind of shimmy the candy tray so that all of the portions are pretty equal I've done this several times so I have a pretty good grasp on it the colors of these Jolly Ranchers look really really good they're really bright and green they have a uniform texture to it you can't see the keep at all I can't even see it in these when you pour these you want to have a very steady stream and a steady hand the higher you go the smaller the stream will be but just remember that the candy cools very quickly you just want to make sure that each one has about two-thirds full these green Apple Jolly Ranchers are for Bernadette price we'll be seeing her later in New York what would be filming a video for the new Sean price out and they have compressed show senator so they don't we'll put a link to it in the description I hope you like them you want a lot of these two completely cool for this recipe we made 200 pieces using five grams key so I use all silicone tools because as you can see the candy is all on it all up on it so I usually just run it under hot water along with the saucepan and any other tools and I find that it cleans very easily some of the mixture fell onto this silicone pad that I have here and that's actually completely cooled it cooled we're gonna stack the candy rolled trays just the silicone mat with confectioner sugar and then we can pop them out of the candy molds that will prevent them from sticking to each other I also have a container with the lid that also has confectioner sugar on the inside and then we can store them into the freezer [Music] by spraying the moles with vegetable spray it allows that the candies come out very easily you can see that there are really nice bright green the Keef is evenly distributed throughout the candy you really don't see very many speckles at all if any I like to sprinkle in between now let's go grab a sandwich bag and use it as a glue here we are green Apple Jolly Ranchers if you want to make these sour candies you can just add some citric acid to the bowl and shake it you want to make sure that all the powdered sugar is coated on each and every one of these so what I like to do at the end is put a bunch of powdered sugar on the top put the lid on and just shake it vigorously before I put it in to ensure that they're all individually coated this is episode 4 of mmm medical edibles please subscribe comment and give us a green thumbs up that was awesome [Music] I'm rolling up all your good and all your gun [Music] this is not for you no chocolate for your dog you", "4Bj6JmRUhHo": "hello and welcome to lofty pursuits in public displays the confection in Tallahassee Florida I'm Greg and me and Marky are gonna make hard candy today we're gonna make it on this drop roller that's dated from 1871 this is sort of a second part video our first part was video number 44 about black currant I discovered black currant as a flavor from you viewers mentioning it in comments it's a common flavor in Europe but it's an uncommon flavor in the United States so I wasn't familiar with it and it's the purple of Europe and the purple of the United States is great but if you ask somebody from Europe about our grape candy they're not gonna say it tastes like grape they're not gonna be quite sure what it tastes like and I wanted to figure out why I went down many dead ends trying to find this out and I did not have any grape expectations about having success but I ended up finding a wonderful story about the temperance movement in the United States about early 20th century flavor technology and about how a serendipitous moment in a mass transit like a bus or a train can change the world and I love that it took a train for me to get to Manhattan to meet dr. Nadia Bernstein she did her doctoral thesis on the history of artificial grape flavoring and she was nice enough to sit down with me for a few moments and tell me about it so far with this batch of candy we got the sugar up to 310 degrees we poured it on our candy cooling table and once it got down to a reasonable temperature we added citric acid and the citric acid will make the candy tastes more like a fruit as all fruits including grapes have some citric acid and for those of you who don't like us adding citric acid well I think that's just a case of sour grapes so I met up with dr. Bernstein and she talked to me about the history of grapes themselves it didn't occur to me that the need for a grape flavor is driven by the desire for grape flavoring or things that taste like grapes and I'm really glad she talked to me about this because this would have been a missing part of the story and it really would have left me in a jam to understand the history of grape flavor I think the first thing we have to do is is figure out why people were drinking grape juice in particular in the 19th century it was uncommon for Americans probably people in most places in the world to be drinking fruit juice if people were making juices they were usually in the 19th century especially the beginning of the 19th century they were usually making juice as a first step to making hooch Thomas Welch develops a method for making essentially what he calls unfermented wine which is which ends up being the drink that we all know now as Welch's grape juice this grape juice which is a kind of mass-produced product kind of rides into popularity on the coattails of the temperance movement and you start kind of seeing it as advertised as a wholesome and sound beverage people start drinking this on fermented wine and grape juice so Thomas Welch a name that we all know because it adorns grape juice and jams here in the United States was a temperance movement member in other words he was part of the movement that later led to the American prohibition on alcohol and he created something to compete with wine that was non-alcoholic grape juice this juice was associated with health and healthy and fresh things and he created a popular movement that created a demand for grape juice and in turn and grape flavoring if you want to try this candy for yourself please go to our website www.theatrefolk.com patreon we now have a patreon page if this grape drink is grape juice why doesn't it taste like grapes to people outside the United States Venice Larissa grapes which are the kind of grapes that are native to the United States so some of these varieties are concord grapes in the South Scuppernong Delaware Catawba essentially they they differ from what we think of as European grieved European wine grapes or the kind of California red and green seedless that are most common now in that they have this particular flavor which the technical term for it is boxiness so next time you try a Concord grape or a grape Jolly Rancher the technical way of describing its flavor is foxiness so that's a boxy Jolly Rancher you got there or other kind of grape flavor candy so the reason why this doesn't seem like a familiar grape flavoring to people in Europe is the grape that it's based on does not grow in Europe it's an American original and concord grapes which you grow up in upstate New York are not available across the United States but a couple of weeks a year and they're not just used for jellies and juices but here in the United States because back then they couldn't get any other grapes they've used these grapes for wines so now that we understand why the demand exists and why the flavor is different the next question is how did they get around to developing an artificial version of this flavor so how did this foxie flavor make its way from legitimate grape juice legitimate legitimate grapes to artificially flavored grape soda and grape candies what I found in my research was a kind of incredible story of a young man with a degree in chemistry he lived in the Annapolis his name was Gilbert hurty and he had founded a carbonated water company that also made flavorings of various sorts so he's writing the Indianapolis streetcar sometime between 1909 and 1912 and there's a woman standing next to him on this crowded streetcar and she smells exactly like grape the compound that's being used in this perfume would be the perfect chemical compound to to use in in a new grape flavoring which is which he'll produce right at this moment when grape juice is starting to have its heyday and he finds what the chemical is it's called methyl and framily and he uses it as the basis of a grape flavouring mecklen translate what's that why is it in this catalog well it turns out that in the late 19th century in the 1890s in europe and germany wears perfume companies are trying to do research to to figure out how to make artificial versions or synthetic versions of some of the most popular floral perfumes of the day their chemical analysis reveals that methyl and Thranduil it is the key component of neroli oil neroli scent they market it as artificial neroli and that is how the hurdy comes across it in a catalog and makes the connection and realizes this is the thing that smells like grape it didn't smell like grape to people in germany why because they didn't have the Venice lovers degrade it kind of took this material that entered the marketplace as a precious synthetic floral perfume in the United States kind of finds its new identity as a great flavoring and now we have our sheets of grape candy out here and we have to break them up into individual drops and I may not surprise you that the reason they're called drops is because we drop them [Music] so the artificial grape flavoring that we all know came about because the gentleman was on a trolley and he saw to hurt it to the grapevine from this lady that neroli oil or synthetic neroli oil smelled and eventually he discovered tasted like grapes in Rowley oil if it wasn't clear is the oil that comes out of orange blossoms and since I like grapes a bunch I thought I'd make some that we're actually a bunch of grapes kids sometimes playing with your food can be fun I want to thank Nadia Bernstein for her help with this video and thank you for watching us if you

on this before I've just never done uh it's root beer so there are 30 milligrams each and I still have this really bad cold like it's it's horrible I don't have the the muscle pains or anything but everything's just kind of here and you just feel like [ __ ] so I'm hoping that this will this will feel better this will feel better this will make me feel better okay so let's let's see I'll do okay all of it why not it's Saturday I have nothing to do I've been like this since Thursday maybe you know oops make me feel better I'll put these two in at first um they taste like the root beer surprisingly because I haven't been able to taste [ __ ] and then you could taste like it tastes a bit of that that we'd taste or whatever it is but I will say the the root beer ones here you can taste the root beer I've done a big fan of root beer but at least least I'm not tasting like the weed because it wasn't usually when I do it really sticks in your mouth so what I'll do is let these dissolve and when I come back I'll let you know how long it took for them to kick in and also what I'm feeling and all kinds of stuff like that so it'll be doctor probably usually takes about an hour yeah it's like around 12:30 now so probably it'll be a little bit it doesn't work if art used to work really quick and notes that's real roughly about an hour you know what sometimes I wake to I've been waiting I'll go a little bit over when I first start feeling it because usually it what I'm done telling you guys it's you know if I would have waited the extra 15 minutes or whatever to do it or even half an hour sometimes cuz it just keeps getting stronger for me anyways and anyways we'll be back I'll be back to tell you what I'm feeling and everything else ok so it's been like um like an hour and a half I would say and at first like I started like when I first started to filling in feeling feeling this it was like roughly about it like an hour in ten minutes and then hang on I'm gonna I'm gonna light a joint so that one's looking around in an hour and ten minutes and then um I was like well like I started to feel better right I was like oh my sickness it's finally going away so I you know I went out and [Music] it's nice but it's like really windy here you know and then I put some like I had like these little um glass pumpkins you know whatever so those are going inside and [ __ ] this [ __ ] joint so then you know then a I had some other things I had to do like ahead of this list Lola this list that um but I you know whenever I thought of something that like had to be it has to be done before the snow comes and then I went back in the house cuz I was in and out doing stuff and it was like so nice and cozy in there but i was like no we can't feel okay like I feel better than I did yesterday way better there's the bus we better than the first day I'd say smoke this when when you're gonna cold still feel like that congestion and [ __ ] but you if you need to get some stuff done let's stand in here in the cubby [Music] somebody's mowing the grass and I don't know why anyways I'm dumb so the medicated hard candies you get them at Canada smell the root beer is actually pretty not like it's it's not that bad like you can taste a lot of the root beer taste some I find that you don't taste like you know I don't know I say strawberry Kiwi I think that was one of them but you taste like a lot of the THC the root beer I tasted the root beer I'll stay stay on stuff but the root beer was I need to just keep puffing on this [Music] thank you Charlie likes this kind of weather I know what I want to give this [Music] I'm gonna give it a 9 in the oh my [ __ ] category just because like this this feels better than when you take like cold pills you know like cool pills gets rid of like say this stuff you know is for a couple hours and but sometimes this kind of cute nut cures but it makes it better than the cold pills not too sure how it would work on the COFF maybe because I reek like if it's a indica and it was a really one of the things and it was feeling relaxed maybe you would kind of slow down your cough ever think anyways that's my gig at night because you know you're sick but it feels so much better like it's the only thing to is okay so this is we're still spoken the new Caen before I got sick I like the munchies like crazy since I've been sick I have like and cuz that's part of the cold they think that you have no one no appetite you can just you eat but it's like it's not a big deal and maybe it's because like you can't taste either I don't did you hear the bang fire a Charlie wait Charlie's right there he didn't even alert me what's wrong with you there's mr. Berg [ __ ] I was okay and now like I'm really maybe they don't like the smell but it's really windy oh maybe not just slam the door what the [ __ ] this review went from like being grade and it's still great but there's just a little paranoia anyways I was gonna say maybe gonna rake the yard but I'm not really sure I want to do that anymore this [ __ ] joint that's not even me that's rolling it's like a little machine so dr. everywhere there's one year that's one over there just keep smoking it and they won't know if maybe I'm having us like it just that cigarette cigarette come on this I'm just a little nervous I was all talkative Oh forgotten I'm coffee I [Music] don't think you all forget it's a little close I don't think you want to watch me rake the yard like that's a little bit boring so I'll just keep talking um yeah this stuff is pretty good I could move or they'd probably be so much better if you weren't second did it but and and you'd probably you know like when you're sick and you don't sleep as well this stuff here would probably you would probably get a good night's sleep yeah I would have thought a like if you [Music] stop charlie you take like cold medicine and whatever for how many years and like you don't even there is stuff that is and it lasts longer too like cold medicine is it doesn't last that long like four hours like maybe two hours this stuff lasts way longer than two hours and you feel way better there yeah there's Charlie he wants to play hey Charlie want to play um okay so um my hands are starting to get a little bit cold and I think maybe I should go inside so um I'll meet you guys back inside in like a minute or two okay so um it's been like it's just about been like two hours and then still I'm feeling uh still pretty good I'm a little bit hungry not like um not like you just you just need to like chew on something like a couple chips or I don't know whatever it is right and bettan you're good like you just um the only thing that I noticed that's different is my nose is really stopped right now but tomorrow I still feel good and get it at can abysmal and I was also just thinking like maybe it's not mad for everybody but I should take this before you know taking the cold medication and you're still like um you feel like when you do when you're high except if you have a cold then you feel the cold part too but it's like you know it's there but like the symptoms aren't really bugging you overclock the the type of day it is today like gum it's I don't know it's ten or eleven or out and sunny and there's like a wind and there's like there's not much there's not like a lot of leave while the trees most of them are pretty bare just the type of day it is it's like a you know it reminds me when I was a kid just like though you know like you can smell Thal it's like one of those days these hard candies you know pretty good and if you want to maybe experience um [Music] now that he said that okay so yesterday there was like a little bit of snowflakes here not like a lot but there was so many like there was not like enough and I remembered when I was a kid that we had a deck and there was me and my brother and my my friend and her brother so I was friends with her and my brother was friends with her brother I don't remember we're outside playing and and we were on the deck and for whatever reason I don't know what worden I remember when it started to snow and it was like around like 4:30 ish so it was it was um like night I think it wasn't a sunny day so it was my not dark but you know it was like kind of like dark anyways remember we started jumping up and down saying they was snowing and like how we were gonna go sliding from this little bit of snow and I was like I forgot all about bad yeah I find like other than like the the the being sick part it's good like I just I wish I wasn't feeling like this so it would feel better but it still feels good um and I think that's everything said nine get them from I can't abismo the medicated hard candies there thirty milligrams each and and oh my god no this is just getting really bad Hey oh yeah there's like a lots of different flavors they have on there I enjoy them [Music] and I think that's that's everything so that's it that's all bye", "X4iquNQgpJg": "[Music] so here I have the grapes I have them soaking in some cold water and vinegar and then I'm going to let them soak for a few and rinse them off and boom Gill has some cream so I never seen anybody do these grapes before with like sprees or nerds so I want to try something different so I have those candies as well as Charlie Ranchers and warheads and then we have sugar and corn syrup and you're going to also need water so you're gonna need 1/2 a cup of sugar 1/4 a cup of corn syrup and 1/4 a cup of water so you want your mister to get to a good boiling point like a rolling boil when it starts to slow down that's when you want to pay attention well you want to be paying attention majority of time but when you hear it slowing down that's definitely when you need to pay attention you want sure mister to get to about two hundred and ninety degrees so at this point I'm going to chop down my candy basically granulate my candy I'm gonna do that with three other sets of candies I'm gonna leave the nurse alone because they're pretty much smaller and that's where we're gonna continue to do and we're almost done so definitely look at it to make sure it's the consistency that you wanted here I had to end up grinding it some more it's to get it to consistency than I want it and there you go so I am not washing it in between uses because if I was to wet this it would be a complete waste and all the candy would be stuck now at this point we are adding in the goods the flavor so I use tropical punch they see me adding in my white gel color and then I am going to add in my blue out of my white first this so it can make my secondary color very vibrant all right so now we're ready to dip so I have all that candy to the side up right I'm gonna take that skewer with the grape on it put it in roll it and roll it in the candy and it's just that simple ladies [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so at this point I needed Siri Mount Mike and email me not candy melt but my candy concoction and Here I am at a better angle so you guys can see me a lot clearer so here I am I'm pushing down they came to solution down so that edged up the pot so I'm going to take this great as I said I already had them prepared on the skewers it's going to take to secure dip it in the candy and roll it sometimes the great soil falls all you have to do is take your skewer or your toothpick press the bank don't press it all the way through irelia my god previously said I like to cover half of the great if you would like to cover your full grade you can all right now I'm just gonna take it and roll it and a candy I don't wanna Simon gonna take the off the squirt that's a little problem came here but you can pull up and we do have those no problem Oh drier very quickly miss pulled off so I'm going to pull this off the skewer and then I'm just gonna cover that all in it candy look at that [Music] [Music] so here I was getting a little paper towel off my grade and I'm gonna dip it it don't do what I'm doing here I don't want you guys to bring yourself I've been doing this for years and I know I can get a better better handle of the grain by doing it like that but please don't do this if it's your first time LT KB or making candy give yourself a raise [Music] that I uses we're an oil strap of much flavor she also has other flavors in make sure you guys click that like button subscribe comment and keep on following I got work [Music]", "OnmUvQFoJWE": "hi everyone so I'm going to be doing a review of the green apple medicated hard candies from cannabis no I'll just take the whole it's a hundred milligrams of THC it's just a different flavor than the other ones but I have to try it out there it is a whole bunch of little squares all stuck together Wow for for not a whole bunch each 25 milligrams of THC I'm tasting THC um I'm not tasting green apple at all there a little bit of sweetness but not not green apple I would say just like taste like maybe like a corn syrup or Oh like little sugary you may have some people I would say just ignore it so well this has been here because it takes usually like an hourish you start to feel it but I have another right and I'm gonna smoke now wait for this to kick it by the time this takes in this will be all do you like doing its job I should have maybe broke these up because it's like cuz they're in the way like a look right there anyways let's get this lit [Music] still under under the tree where nobody could see so I'm gonna smoke this but time I'm done this those will be dissolved go jump in the shower because I probably won't want to feel like taking one later and come back and let you guys know what how I'm feeling now so with a package again you get them at can abysmal what we back up this kicks in probably not out here but I'll be back okay so it's been an hour and a half and as you can tell these have kicked in my eyes feel so heavy and like I just feel really relaxed and you don't feel like doing too much like you know thank God I did everything earlier cuz I would not do anything like that on this I your whole body like it just makes you feel relaxed I like this is like an oh my [ __ ] like that's my rating of it it's it's very good um yeah you get like a little bit thirsty but you also get like hungry so I got try them these are my favorite um like for a licorice I like I like this one I don't like the one that it's all twisty it's like a little bit tough and it has like a weird taste to it I don't really like that one I like the nibs or the you know how you can get the licorice that's all Brown you could probably watch a movie on this um more like hmm more like like those action suspense drama ones my son is bright um yeah it's uh just like the Owens is good I didn't taste the green apple though but it doesn't matter because it feels good like you feel good you don't feel like doing much but you feel good like read watching TV movie not cleaning or laundry or anything like that this is the stuff that makes you feel like you know after you shower and like you know everything's done so and you're you feel like like sleep is gonna be really good but it even feels better when you have like wash sheets and stuff on the bed well I checked that this is what that makes you feel like like we wanted to get into a nice clean bed and just ah watch TV here just lay there and think I wouldn't recommend reading a book because I don't think you would get very far well that Sun is bright yes good eye you know what Lola's hard candies from campus know they're really good like they like I've tried other ones from a different dispensary and they weren't good at all the ones I can abysmal there uh mm-hmm you just go there and get them like it's it's good stuff [Music] and by like can I do that Sun is really bothering it's really bothering me down d'arnot all okay there I don't know that'll have to do um was I talking about them mmm I don't remember well with the can of the Canada's no like they never let me down they just a face cell is it was very good so you should go there I don't understand why like people are so against feeling like this you don't there's nothing wrong with what you're feeling you don't you know what's going on and stuff I mean I don't understand that so like what you know think it's Saturday why I like smoke a joint and do edibles like what's wrong with that it gives you like you know time just to relax that's what I think it just you know that's what it does for me and if you didn't want to do the animals and you know there's the other there's other ways of doing it but I feel really well like I feel like you want to get comfy I'm in the chair with the I watched all the the what do they called the throw blankets today and like we have quite a bit so but those are like there's always soft and stuffed you know and you hang them outside and they have that outside smell and I just I think that's what I will be doing after is getting one in or two of those blankets and just watching something TV or something and covering up with the pie cake I'm just just chilling I should have brought something else other than these nibs I can't get the munchies do I feel paranoid yes yes as in I wouldn't answer the door at all continue doing whatever it was I was doing stuff feels really good good like [Music] I don't know how to describe it I really don't I feel like um I'm just really good like um not like good like yeah I'm not be but good like as in relaxed and I guess at peace like just really like you're enjoying stuff like you have time to enjoy stuff that's how I felt also any aches and pains and it helps with that it helps Brooke like everything I can can't think of a thing that it wouldn't help with subjects we were sad you'd be happy after if you were when I was a kid okay so the way I'm sitting on the bed I'm one legs just dangling down and I'm ever like when I was a kid I used to always think there was something something under the bed that hurt you know I grabbed my knees my feet probably for my ankle I remember him I remember like I go I got so bad that at my parents house the hallway and off to the right there was the bathroom and then there was my room at the very end of the hallway was a closet and on the left side was my parents room and my brother's room and everybody it you know had to go get a drink of water or something and my bed was never close to the light switch so I don't have to shop the light go like at the beginning of the hallway run as fast as I can and just get like step into my room and you'll leap across onto my bed because I thought there was something under that was gonna grab my feet and then I get that I you know it's probably like I know it's nothing but I still get that feeling sometimes and it happened while I was doing that so that's why I told you I don't remember I was talking about before this and it's probably not gonna come back to me either but hate when that happens [Music] that's good I would like I highly recommend it it was like I took it I 530 so he's hired at 5:30 I kicked in like seven ish maybe a little bit after not much and it's oh I can't hang on okay and it's going on 7:30 right now so like you're gonna feel like this for a while so which is good that's what you want you don't want to like this just to go away cuz I would kind of sock right now it just uh makes you enjoy stuff like TV I'm getting comfy and you can get come because you're not a lot you're not even like pain if you have pain my eyelids feel so bad over my eyelids feel so heavy like they just you just feel my eyelids feel tired and even when they look tired right I think that they look happy you're loving they're loving it my eyes are loving this if they're tired and they're just I think people did this like if you really look at yourself I think you can maybe like and some people see what kind of person they are when they were work to be on this maybe not though I don't know I'm just I'm just thinking of stuff and say you know to you guys [Music] I'm not very comfortable sitting the way I am but I don't want to put my foot down there yet so the marinated hard candies cannabis bomb well worth it highly recommend it I didn't taste green apple but um you taste like I tasted the THC and like something a little bit sweet here and there really just makes you feel relaxed and a little bit thirsty and like a little bit hungry but not bad like you don't know you're not gonna like eat meat eat just like something here and there my rating of this is an oh my [ __ ] um you just feel like relax and you don't feel like um doing anything like like physically you don't feel like doing anything watching a movie yeah things like that yep that's what you feel like doing um and your eyelids may feel okay I can't sit like that any longer your eyelids may feel heavy but it does not matter cuz you still feel happy and I think that's everything I don't I don't know what else to talk about so that's it that's all bye", "IlAA7xJ3sq4": "hello everyone we are making honey cannabis infused gummies please turn your oven on medium we have regular jello and we have lime jell-o in your pot make sure that you put one cup of water in there and turn on media now we can't really get started okay so the measuring spoons I will explain to you what we're gonna use them for but you need measuring spoons okay I just showed cannabis oil and also cannabis infused honey which is right here okay I'm showing you the measurements that we're gonna need for the cannabis and the cannabis oil I have a cup here full of water in case we need it in case of burn anything it's always good to have one on hand have also a mixer or fork at your side of fun first we're gonna pour in three packs of unflavored gelatin we are gonna whisk and stir this until we get out all the lumps you gotta work pretty fast hour or they won't lump up even more at our temperature of medium height we continue to whisk the three packs of gelatin unflavored gelatin that is try your best with the fork or the whisk to kind of press on it and while you're stirring to get that lump kind of melted in that hot water this is the only longest part of the video guys I'm sorry but we have to get it whizzed up and that's what we have to do and you'll find out once you start doing it yourself okay now we've got a mostly whisk and the water is coming to a roiling boil we're gonna add one pack of lime gelatin I chose line because it tastes the best with the cannabis flavor there are three that are in the best with cannabis flavor and I say lemon lime blue raspberry and green so you have one of those pour one into the pot right now and whisk it all together you know let this come to a boil keep stirring it shouldn't be any lumps now with the flavored gelatin added in it should not be any lumps now that we have let this come up to a boil again let's stir a little bit more into it everything is completely dissolved keep stirring for another probably 20 minutes I was saying then we're going to turn off Dean and let it sit for five minutes after we whisk it one more time this is fun guys and the house smells so good it smells like serious lemon line at this point make sure you have your moles ready and a dropper make sure you also spray your mouth with cooking spray or use a dab of cooking oil I have a gummy one a mini gum you want a bear one I have a star one in a shell 100 mixtures came to the boil this is when we turn it off I'm sorry this is when we turn it off now before you use a dropper this is when you add in the honey and also the oil use two tablespoons of the infused honey and 1/4 teaspoon of the oil stir it and then get your dropper and start putting the mixture into the mugs because the cooler that the mixture is the more jellified and gummy it becomes so we have to move kind of fast so I got the gummi bears right here and I got my seashell mold right here and be careful guys when doing this because this mixture is not only hot but it's sticky and I forgot to mention that I threw in two drops of green food coloring to make it a little darker green you can do that depending on what flavor gelatin that you're gonna use use the same color food coloring I have so much left over guys I had to take it bring out the heart mold as well so yes I got it made all that then we're gonna put it in the freezer for 20 minutes [Music] Twala look at this yum-yum in your tummy Wow Jonesy look delicious I had to cover them with sweet tarts that I had to smash up because we did not have any powdered sugar so if you have sweet tart type candy or something like that that you can crush up and make it into a powder all I did was pour it over the top and shaked it up real good so they won't stick together okay guys that's the finished product and now I'm gonna actually eat one like I said if you don't have powdered sugar on hand if you have any sweet tart type candy candy you can crushed into powder use that all I have with sweet tarts from Valentine's Day I'll have been buying them from the nine cent store because they have big humongous bags also from Walgreens sent me for five percent off Valentine candy that they had and so I just wanna I love sweet tarts so I'm gonna try any heart it is the back of it here is the front hmm nice home in the lime flavor the sweet tart kind of makes a little bit tardy also if you up citric acid use that instead as well and keep them from sticking to each other and it gives them that i'm tartness like a Sour Patch Kid or a sour gummy I'm impressed guys it took me like four tries to get it right but this is my own recipe it's no one else's I just had to figure out like do like science and math like what would what make this work with infused cannabis oil and cannabis infused honey to make it sweeter because in the past my made the gummies the blue ones they was really sweet because of the jello that I picked and it was the blue raspberry but like I said those three flavors lemon-lime blue raspberry and grape or the best to make cannabis gummies because they don't have that nasty aftertaste and also not all flavors work with cannabis so and I've just learned that by doing it three or four different times it's the fourth time so I'm doing I just showed you guys already so I just leave it in the container put the lid on now you keep them nice and sealed in and drying from keep them from drying out and getting hard and disgusting so thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoy this recipe of mine and yeah I'm really happy so now have some animals for pain and now maybe you can have edibles for pain as well okay until next time god bless thank you for watching please hit that like button please hit the subscribe button and

again high five chocalate this is their dark chocolate bar 200 milligrams of THC I've already reviewed one of their products liked it quite a bit I reviewed their milk chocolate this time we're looking at the dark and I gotta say I'm pretty I got good expectations high expectations for this one because the first one was such a success so we're out here at the beautiful dog beach you can look behind you and see all these wonderful ships maybe maybe not long the beach I believe the second largest port in the United States may be the first largest by dollar amount it's even a little larger spy dollar amount or byte the total tonnage I care I have smashed my finger making this very difficult to open guys oh wait wait I see something here ah I got it but I'm dealing a thumb so here we go we've got our high five bar here you can see it with its little logo embossed on it let's give a bite of the dark chocolate again this is 200 milligrams oh and it cost me I believe 15 dollars at my dispensary so a pretty good deal for a 200 milligram chocalate bar oh no tastes pretty good good dark chocolate nice quality almost zero cannabis taste - uh - speak up almost none whatsoever just a good quality chocolate alright guys whoop I'm gonna finish this off and I will come back to you in two hours or through the magic of editing just in a couple of seconds and we'll let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review thanks for watching guys and I'll see you in just a bit peace [Music] two two hours later alright guys we are two hours in the future um and I am talking about high by dark chocolate 200 milligrams of THC and curiously at least curiously to me I am less high than I was for the milk chocolate I definitely am less high than I was that the less high five bar not dramatically so not the golf isn't extreme but I am noticeably less high I'd say I'm maybe four right now which is not as high as I was hoping to be I was hoping I was gonna be as high as the last one but that's just not the case so maybe their chocolate isn't super consistent I don't know yet we will experiment some more with high five but I I would say for sure I definitely feel less high than I did the first time just look at my eyeballs why does snow not that's a perfect metric by any measure but you know in a pinch it'll work so this time it was a little bit of a disappointment for hi-fi uh yeah I was I was expecting more so they got pinged a little bit for that I'm sure just four diminished or four reduced expectations but I'm human so I'm fallible I still don't hate it I still like the way it tasted and it's still and I'm still kind of high so you know it's not a complete loss and it was it was 15 bucks so it's not the most expensive chocolate bar edible it's just this is no longer in the same ballpark as like a Akiva bar this is this is out of that contention out of that conversation now well guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching as always and we will check you out on a later of you piece spec pack through our why is my tongue blue Oh brisk that's why bye guys", "yQlPMFGdOHw": "[Music] hello everyone well via weights the net one edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are talking about carrot candies I know in the past I have warned you about taking the candy version of gummies instead of the confectionery version I myself have found them to be laughing but I have a lot of people asking me to review candies a lot so here we are with can of candies 240 milligrams of THC spread out over for candy so I assume that means 60 what's the math sixty THC per candy right that's correct yeah it's gotta be okay they've got four different flavors we've got great we've got watermelon we've got lemon we've got cherry they are hard candy so I'm gonna have to suck on these bad boys these are from SC labs I believe is the company that makes them and without further ado let's open them up and give them a taste so if this is your first time tuning in two weeks the way I reviews work guys is I'm going to take these candies because they are all individually wrapped oh here we are they are all individually wrapped four different little candies you can actually see maybe little bits of fruit I don't know something on the inside of those gummies four different gummies because I don't want to break my teeth I'm going to suck on one finish it off camera and finish the rest off camera and then I will be back in two hours to let you know how these things are feeling because that's the most important part of any edible review okay so let's see we've got four to choose from any meaning not a watermelon is up first so canna candies on the back actually has its nutrition information which I like to see 27 calories / gummy has the ingredients as well as you know the distribute the sort of standard don't take this while driving blah blah blah blah blah yadda yadda yadda I am going to have to gear up some scissors I should have had these with me already or maybe I can just do it with my teeth let's find out Oh God um so that's something good to know I don't just take these into a movie theater or something with you expecting this good opened cuz there is no easy way to do so almost got it here there we go in the mouth this is the watermelon flavor huh taste okay you can definitely taste some marijuana the we taste it um not overpowering you can also taste the watermelon it's like a less intense it's like a less intense Jolly Rancher with a little bit of weed taste to it that's about the best way I can describe it it's not good it's not terrible I'm not dreading having to eat all four of these not looking forward to it you know come seeking side so with that guys I'm gonna finish these here for guddi's not coming sorry hard candies I'll finish them and I'll come back to you guys in about two hours to let you know how they are feeling and with that guys I will thank you for watching whitson on we will see you into a horse piece two hours welcome back two weeks we are talking canna candies today and I guess a so I want it right them very highly but this is my favorite candy I've had so far in terms of like non convection airy non like baked good so like gummies hard candies straws all those kind of things sour straws these are my favorite I'm not incredibly baked I've certainly had more potent 240 myelogram edibles before but for a candy something that you know you pop in your mouth and suck on for a while I'm pretty high so I'm pleasantly surprised with the potency on these I still want to did still want to be my first choice I really in most or any context to go with the candies because they don't taste that good and they don't get you that high although this was pretty cheap I think this cost me $8 so it wasn't outrageously expensive so you know I liked it for for a non confectionary edible but again not going to be my first choice at the dispensary but if you're looking for a candy and if you see can of candies these are not a bad one to go with and with that guys that's going to do it for this review here on weeds thank you so much for watching and we will check you out on the next episode peace hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video

this is a partnership with anheuser-busch to create the rtd beverages for the ghost brand uh this won't be the only one that will be joining the lineup i do know they are working on protein rtds to replicate some of their delicious protein flavors let's talk a little bit about ghost energy and why it separates itself from the pack and other energy drinks on the market so we have sour watermelon warhead we have sour patch kid um again the collaborations with the companies love how ghost does that i think this is what orange mango tropical mango sorry and then we have citrus feedback has been phenomenal on these and another thing you really have to appreciate with ghost is the transparency they put on the formulas so if that is hard to see i will also put it in the comment box and i'll give you a quick rundown on what we are getting in ghost energy right now so per can you get 200 milligrams of natural caffeine you get one gram of taurine which is an endurance booster one gram of all car which is right here acetyl l-carnitine so that's basically a cognitive enhancer and you're also going to see that with the other aspects that are in the formula with you get the 150 milligrams of alpha gpc again that and the neuro factor at 100 milligrams are all there for your brain health brain function and focus so it's not only just giving you clean natural caffeine there's also those enhancers in there to really smooth out the caffeine half-life and make it a really really long lasting you know amount of energy not something that's just going to spike your energy and make you crash totally different here the kicker here which i really like is the 25 milligrams of estrogen at the bottom that basically enhances everything that's in the beverage as far as uptake of the ingredients truly appreciate ghost putting that in an energy drink to make those ingredients a little bit more effective so now that we know a little bit more about ghost energy uh if you haven't really followed ghost youtube at all they have hinted at maybe 10 to 12 more flavors in the future and based off what we're seeing here with the sour patch kids warheads i'm going to guess that whatever's coming to their gamer line is going to carry over to the energy line because i know they are working on a collaboration with uh i think it's like expel or whatever that uh gaming corporation is for a limited edition flavor so we're going to go right down the line here and i'm going to start with citrus i'm going to guess this is going to be something similar to sprite i'm uncertain but let's give it a go cheers legends yeah i wasn't too far off with that one i think this is a really safe flavor um that people will really enjoy kind of get a little bit of lemon in the back end there a little bit of zest from the citrus pretty standard flavor to me it's not something that's going to knock your socks off and make me want to go out and you know just buy a 12 pack of you know citrus but good change of pace yeah i would say so but definitely not something that's uh you know off the top of my head that's a must get flavor just trying it so let's move here tropical mango chocolate mango right yep tropical mango that orange can throws me off thinking it's something orange so i love mango flavored things uh this one probably is definitely peaking my interest let's give it a whirl oh yeah that mango hits you hard in the back end in the aftertaste so the tropical is kind of like your initial fruit punch you know that array of flavors that really hits your taste buds that mangoes the density of the mango really kicks in in the back end you have to let this one kind of sit on your taste buds for a little bit but you will pick up that mango and it does hit hard so this is another good one um let's see how these other two are before i kind of make my consensus here so i have not had the sour patch red berry in legend or any of the other flavors this is my first experience with it i've heard nothing but great things so going into this one with an open mind hopefully it's a home run cheers damn wow i'll tell you what you guys that love your sour patch kids love that sweetness love that red berry home run this is wow this is up there when it comes to all-time energy drink flavors just off that initial taste dan ghost ryan adam rest of the team this right here phenomenal i can kind of see why for ghost gamer it's such a very popular flavor so let's get to the last one here sour watermelon warheads i have had this in pump really really like this flavor so super pumped to try it in the energy as well cheers yeah that's ooh wow the density of that watermelon oh so unique it's like the og extend like in the black labels that jolly rancher flavor but enhanced with the sweetness of the warhead now this one is definitely for those that got a nice sweet tooth and the carbonation really kicks up the amount of flavor in it between these two i could buy a 12 pack of those in a heartbeat and i would have no problem drinking them day in and day out these two flavors lights out now citrus i would say maybe a six out of ten seven out of ten i mean it's a good change of pace definitely not something top tier that i think is a must go get but if you want to try it out i would highly suggest it and i would say the tropical mango would be around like a seven seven and a half it's good i think it needs a little bit more on the initial taste the mango's really good in the back end but the tropical flavor is a little lackluster but overall i would kind of rank them very similar to this you know one and two right here very hard between that and then i would say three and four but overall really excited about these guys when you can get your hands on them right away i would go with these two um you can roll the dice with these but again they're not my preference they may be yours but whenever i buy ghost products i'm not associated with the brand all my pennies go to price plow i always support ben mike and heather you can always use their coupon code price plow at ghostlifestyle.com save 20 off your order they should be coming out really soon in multiple locations so keep your eyes out if you give them a try let me know what you think", "aKwdz_9qfdY": "what is up everybody welcome back to the 2x4 flower tent we're here on day 45 and today our topics are flushing phenotype hunting and terpene profiles but before we get started if you like learning about cannabis the science of cannabis or you just like watching quality cannabis content make sure to hit that subscribe button and turn on the notifications so you don't miss out on any future videos and as always welcome to cannabinology [Music] so here on day 45 everything is coming along beautifully we've just entered our flushing cycle and we'll talk a little bit more about what that means in just a few minutes the first thing i want to do is sort of just give a rundown of the tent we're going to start over here with our breeding plants and we'll just go through these quickly and we'll talk about our phenohunts and some of the turkey profiles in a few minutes so the first thing i want to talk about is this bewitched bx2 right here this is our number one phenotype what we call the lavender cupcakes phenotype has some really delicious uh sort of a linoleum heavy kind of lavender grapey uh terpene profile with some sort of earthy cupcake notes and it's really really delicious very excited uh this is of course for our preservation run so this is a bewitched uh bx2 cross to our keeper males of the bush bx2 right next to her we have our sfv and these next couple of plants are pollinated with our sex reversed blueberry cookies um if you are interested in that check out some of the earlier videos um the pre i think they were called pre-season six um we did a number of sex reversals and did some sts experimentation so definitely check those out and if you're interested in doing your own sex reversals making your own feminized seats visit our website www.cbgyca.com stskit and we have a lot more information there you can pick up those kits as well in case you missed that link i will also drop those in the comments along with all the other links for the equipment and all the things we talked about as well down in the description so make sure to check that out so this is this here is a super classic strain sfv og crossed to our feminized or sex reversed blueberry cookies and we're making cannabinology really really amazing line very popular for it's high vigor super frost great really interesting sort of exotic terpene profiles extremely high yield it really really stacks so you get these massive colas actually kind of similar in stacking to this although the flower structure on this one's a little messed up this is the blueberry cookies but it really stacks very similar to that but much bigger plants than the blueberry cookies the next plant here this is our purple punch uh sort of a hype strain pretty well known super frosty very purple sort of a light uh grape punch grape soda type of flavor of course this is crossed with the sex reverse blueberry cookies as well we're making purpleberry punch really nice sort of a candy grape lots of deep purples plenty of color in this lime so very excited to have more seeds of this and then here we have our little short blueberry cookies i was hoping this was going to be bigger that we would get more seeds out of it but this is a pretty small very short stretching plant so a little bit short here but this is our blueberry cookies and this is for the blueberry cookies s1 feminized just sort of a preservation of this clone all right so the next two things i want to talk about here are some of the clones that we're running and then we'll hop into our blueberry cookies phenohunt we'll start over here this is the cushman sort of a hype cut here uh really starting to look good very commercial flower look sort of that round dense super frosty flower really looking good really smelling good has a nice sort of sweet fresh cushy taste hence the name cushman's so that's very cool we're probably going to do some crosses with this maybe in our next run with our blueberry muffin do some muffin mints or cush muffin i'm not really sure what i'm going to call it yet if you guys have ideas of what to call the blueberry muffin by cushman's let me know down in the comments i would love some great idea names next up we have our blueberry mac and i guess i misspoke this one is actually a clone this is from seed so this is the mac one capped cut crossed with the blueberry bakery zero which is sort of our our a cut of our blueberry bakery males we have two males that we decided to keep um and this is what i feel like is the better male over the two um so this cross to the mac one uh the blueberry bakery across the back one absolutely beautiful not quite the flower size i was looking for but it did get quite shaded out it really doesn't stretch kind of like the mac one really doesn't stretch pretty slow to grow but beautiful color super frosty looks like it's going to be real real dense i did raise it up on a little sort of riser here this is just uh i think mushrooms came in this or something like that we cleaned it out flipped it over um brought it up a couple of inches to get some more light so beautiful color on this all right moving on we have our kuiper belt another uh variety that's somewhat similar to the mac one actually very slow to grow this one is pretty weak stems but as you can see beautiful frosty flowers already starting to get that that purple in there it's got a really uh really really delicious sort of a sweet uh gravy cushy [Music] terpene profile just absolutely amazing this one probably is going to go into the 65 or 70 days so this has quite a few weeks to go actually same with this blueberry mac i'm expecting this one to go out quite a bit [Music] all right moving over we're going to talk about our phenol hunt here and i will say everybody i'm super stoked about this vino hunt these plants look amazing i'm really really happy with how these are turning out beautiful beautiful flowers really great structure amazing terpene profile there's a little bit of diversity which is honestly kind of nice that way you have you know some sativa leaner some indica leaner but all sort of with that uh common blueberry flavor um so this is four plants of the blueberry cookies bx1 and so one thing that i really like about this is i'm actually finding two phenotypes that are pretty close to identical there's a little bit of difference in terms of flower structure and that's the blueberry cookies number five and the blueberry cookies number three they both have a pretty conical sort of cone-shaped flower both have a really nice sort of round open sweet blueberry terpene profile which is really really excellent i really love this terpene profile very greasy resin which really means there's probably a lot of terps in it which is really something that i'm breeding this for so the blueberry cookies the things that i'm looking for are good flower structure the blueberry terpene profile that the number three and the number five have i'm looking for a little bit higher yield than the blueberry cookies because as i mentioned blueberry cookies is really small a very very short plant doesn't stretch much it's a little bit higher yield and some color so those are the things i'm looking for and i'm honestly seeing that in in all of these plants nice chunky buds pretty frosty delicious terpene profile so very happy so as i mentioned these two the number three and the number five both have the sort of sweet round blueberry terpene profile so these are probably what i'm waiting for is keepers the number five may not be a true keeper but i am seeing this uh fasciation mutation which i believe is caused by an upregulation of a plant hormone called cytokinin which does a number of things um including affecting lateral branching and cell division all sorts of stuff so i'm planning on keeping this because i think i think this uh this type of mutation could be used to significantly boost your crop yield just because the flowers grow really funky and just kind of grow bigger so if you look at a flower like this and you look at the flower right next to it obviously this fascinated one much bigger so i'm hoping we can sort of play around with this stabilize this trait and get some really interesting looking flowers and boost yields much more quickly than with sort of your standard breeding methods of selecting looking for the highest yield breeding that selecting again i think we could use this and i think it would be really cool to have a whole plant with these very interesting cool looking flowers on them all right but we are talking about terpene profiles here so the number three and the number five both have that blueberry terpene profile and then we go over to and then we go over to some of these other phenotypes so for example here is the number two phenotype and we'll get a little smell of this one thing i did notice about this one it has really big trichome heads which is pretty cool potentially really good for extraction as far as terpene profile we went ahead and just sort of rubbed our fingers on there that's a great way to test those terpene profiles it still has that delicious blueberry flavor um but the undertones those so it has some sort of deeper a little bit gassier earthier sort of undertones in there really really amazing though very excited for this one i'm potentially going to make some rosin out of this because of the larger trichome size i think it'll press really well and i also think this one's going to be a bigger healer than the other ones unfortunately this one did get a little bit close to the light so we did get some of those flat tops on there as you can see but i think if i uh had monocrop this we could have brought that light up just a little bit we would have gotten some really beautiful flower structure on there as well so i think this is probably a yielder decent purping profile i would definitely consider this a keeper and i'm in my f3 or my bx1f2 which is basically an f3 i am gonna probably run this one and the number three uh just because this one has amazing trichomes beautiful beautiful trichomes and probably higher yielder so i do want to hold an f3 of this number two phenotype and an f3 of the number three phenotype the number three is definitely the one i'm leaning for it has the flower structure it has the exact flavor that i'm looking for it's got perfect height beautiful beautiful beautiful flowers i already said that i just love how these flowers look i'll give you a little close up there absolutely gorgeous dense frosty looks like they're gonna have some great color really really stoked sorry i know i've spent a lot of time on on this number three phenotype and i'm super super excited about it all right so then we'll go over to the number six phenotype so this one is actually very different from the other ones obviously uh it's a little bit taller a little bit more sativa leaning i mean i actually really like the structure of this at first this one kind of like the number three got a little bit close to the light so we've got some funky growth here a little bit of fox tailing but that's okay one thing i noticed about this phenotype is as it was growing it was actually one of the shorter ones in the beginning but it stretched for a longer amount of time and actually met the canopy of the taller one and i say shorter and taller it's only a difference about an inch or an inch and a half between all these plants but some minor minor height differences really the unique thing here is the flower structure being much more sort of stick like a nice big stick of stacked up flowers much thinner leaflets probably leaning more towards the sativa-like effects just based on how this looks it looks more like a sativa plant so we're gonna get a little smell some terps here so i really just like to sort of grab one of these outer leaves rub a couple of trichomes off just to get some [Music] flavor yeah so this one's very different it's got um what i consider sort of a haze type of flavor it's got a little bit more citrus a little bit more earthy in it definitely sort of a unique phenotype here so this one probably would be a keeper for some people if you're looking for that sativa with a little bit of your sort of citrus and berry notes um this could definitely be for you it's not too tall it looks like it's not going to take too too long to finish probably in the 60 to 65 day range and of course had this not gotten so close to the light we probably would have gotten some better flower structure on here that said i probably will not be keeping this i am keeping it for now but i'm probably not going to move this into the f3 round um just because it's not really the turkey profile that i'm looking for with the blueberry cookies it's also not really the flower structure i love the sort of conical or not the conical the sort of pole like stacked flower but it's not the structure i'm looking for for blueberry cookies specifically one line that i may use this in is in the cabinology in the the thai stack line or the thai exotic which of course is an offspring of this sfv and blueberry cookies here one of those the number two phenotype has this same structure really really uh stacked these really long colas so i may cross that uh do a femme cross between this blueberry cookies and that can have an og since they have a similar structure maybe stabilize that structure get some some more terps in there and things like that but that's all to say that this is a keyboard just not for this line and i am very excited to try out the number six all right from here i do want to jump into a little bit about our flushing cycle we are here on day 45 and day 45 uh usually it's a little bit early for flushing and i'll explain why i sort of consider my flush period starting now but for those of you who are just tuning in who don't really understand what flushing is and why you do it i'll give a really sort of brief overview overview so flushing is basically where you take plain water and you dump it through your media and what that's going to do is pull out any nutrients that are left over from your flowering cycle especially when you use mineralized or salt nutrients you get a lot of buildup in your soil so you might be going and pouring in your nuts at you know 1.5 1.9 2.0 ec um but over time that's going to build up and i've seen build up even in my grows up to three four five thousand if you're not flushing and doing maintenance flushes throughout your cycle which is okay you don't have to maintenance flush it is a good idea though so towards the end of your flowering cycle you do want to flush out any extra nutrients this is really going to help the senescence or the death cycle of these plants is going to help them flush out bring out more color a lot of people will say it also helps with the color of your ash and the smoothness of your smoke there is some debate there's not a lot of evidence to say one way way or the other scientifically but my personal belief is that flushing does help with the color of your ash and it helps make your smoke smoother and more enjoyable so here on day 45 what i consider the beginning of my flush cycle is when i switch my res to plane water so i'm on drippers here i have a reservoir that these come out of and generally for the most for the majority of the cycle were somewhere around the 2.0 1.9 to 2.0 ec on day 45 which is about three weeks before i plan to harvest most of these plants i switched it to plain water no nutrients i used the water from my dehu so it is distilled or sort of close to ro water but you can do this with tap water it's totally fine and i just let that plain water water my plants for the first week and that's going to help bring down those nutrients i happen to have done a number of maintenance flushes in this run so i do know that my soil is somewhere around that 2.0 to 2.5 ec and so i think about a week of plain water should bring that down below that 2.0 mark so that's your first week or what i consider the first week of the flush period after that uh once we get to two weeks prior to our harvest we are actually going to flush do a physical flush pouring lots of water through the medium to get that soil ec down to about a thousand or below and that's really going to help those plants flush out if you have any questions about flushing about this sort of pre-flush period anything like that definitely drop those down in the comments and i'll make sure to answer those there or in a future video uh so that's uh pretty much our update for day 45 but before we sign off today i do want to remind everybody that we are still doing our 1000

okay beautiful people the lighting in here is terrible but as you can see i got my hair done and i'm a little more blonde a little more fun for summer and a little more excited and now i am going to violin shop and D&C to pass out some BPI samples this is something any to every month I get sent a fun bags like this full of BPI samples of all the new products and it's like what I do is I just go and I give out you know a couple samples reach sometimes I will wet sample them which is all that means is like I actually mix them up like I will take the free workout or bcas or whatever and mix it up so that you guys can try it in the store and then if you like it you can just turn around and buy it right at the store and most of the time the BPI stuff is on sale so it's just convenient that you get to try it and then buy it right there so that's what I'm going to do and then meal prep it has been a crazy day it was early morning wake up I woke up an hour to have late and so that I was running late to me wearing out so went to my workout and I'd a triple sets on a lot of stuff so that I can get through my work out and get everything in and i am still super sore from two days ago so that was fun and then ran home ate a yogurt and then went to my hair and hair appointment and got a facial went to jason's deli have salad and then now i'm doing some epi sample giveaways and that

working at this pretty lady tomorrow I licensee venom ate breakfast some days huh while you workout enjoy good hey everybody I promised you homemade healthy boy labels so now I'm gonna show you how I mean I'm speaking okay everyone so grab one small yellow onion 1 red bell pepper and one green bell pepper slice those bad boys up and put on some homemade fajita seasoning that will be shown below that's how it looks I don't add a ton of seasoning on there keep the salt down and then spray on some zero-calorie butter flavored spray and pop it in the oven at 400 degrees for about 20 to 25 minutes keep in mind every oven varies in temperature so check on them so that you don't burn your peppers and onions that looks so good to me like I can just eat that alone spray your skillet with some zero calories butter flavored spray again and pop in your frozen grilled chicken we've IRS at kroger pre grilled and then slice it up throw it in the freezer and it's ready to go add your spinach or lettuce mix into your bowls and then I add white cannellini beans be white beans help lower stress which I am a huge fan of that because all of that going on come to stress add your chicken in there I've heard about 3 ounces and then I put about 60 grams of that bell pepper and onion mix as you can see this makes enough for about four days then I add my tomatoes about 30 grams of that and then I just kind of eyeball the jalapenos I am a huge spice fanatic so anything with spices or heat I'm all about it tell me that doesn't look good then add my cheese you can do any kind of cheese you want I like to do about an eighth of a cup serve that with some guac and you're ready to go check out these other recipes on my health toast com blog okay right baskin be it for me from this video

degrees hotter than we cook our sugar and he's already added the food coloring in the flavor to the pot and he's pouring it on our candy cooling table to bring the temperature down just like what we do as sugar we have to do with isomalt I'm regularly asked how you make sugar free hard candy if you're not using sugar what's it made out of and the answer is at least in our case isomalt to understand what isomalt is you should also understand what sugar is table sugar is sucrose and sucrose is a chemical bond of the fructose and glucose and we can break this down we can add more glucose so we could do a lot of chemical reactions to this but what they've done an ice malt is the glucose they've left alone but the fructose they've broken down into two materials sorbitol and mannitol these are both sugar alcohols and this conglomeration together produces a material which is about 50 to 60% as sweet as sugar but has some nice side effects it doesn't get a sticky and humidity it is very very clear it has only two calories per gram and it acts to the body like a dietary fiber in other words it doesn't raise blood sugar dramatically and it's great for people who are trying to avoid that be them diabetic searches people who are watching their diet and as jake sets up the machine on the table our fruit drop roller let me ask you for a favor if you have a moment take a look at our description we have a link to go to the beste tallahassee awards we're up for an online voting popularity contest and we'd like you to vote for us in the following categories best ice cream frozen yogurt best food truck and best business social media to follow thank you we'd really appreciate it if you could take a moment and do this now all isomalt has a lot of benefits for certain people it also has a few problems one for the customer you really shouldn't eat more than about half a bag of it at a time or our bag about sixty grams it can upset your stomach if you have too much friend - it costs about ten times with sugar costs and so unfortunately the price of the candy is a little higher because of us artificial sweeteners are not a new thing they date back to the 1800s 1878 to be exact roughly the time this machine was made with the invention of saccharin although it was invented the 1800s artificial sweeteners didn't hit wide acceptance until World War one in World War two when sugar rationing cut the amount of sugar on the market and the home market needed an alternate sweetener and that's when these artificial sweeteners came in but they had a problem they didn't behave like sugar so they couldn't replace sugar and important things like royal icing and in this case hard candy and that took until the 1960s when isomalt was invented and isomalt being a derivative of table sugar behaves like table sugar and lets us make these candies that are almost identical in texture to the traditional hard candies that we made if you've ever wondered why lemon drops are called lemon drops or cough drops are called cough drops it's because it's how we separate these pieces from the sheet and how we separate off the flash [Music] thank you for watching this

you're new or if you're not I'm\nAlyssia and I'm stoked you're here either way. I have surprisingly\nhad a lot of people say can you do a video that\nshows healthy convenience store snacks, like gas stations snacks. I don't know why I'm surprised by this but I kind of thought gas stations and convenience stores\nhave a lot of options. So, I was confused about why\npeople really wanted this video and I started to think about it. I have some thoughts I'm gonna share. But my first thing I would\nadvise when asking yourself this question or asking anyone\nthis question, because you're on the hunt for healthy,\nconvenience source snacks is, why? So really knowing what is your goal and why are you gonna\nthe convenience store, is it because you're on the road? Are you just, you know, driving\nhome from school or what? So if you're on the road,\nwhich is usually when I go to a convenience store or gas station, that was kind of my\napproach to this video, is it because you're on Whole30\nand paleo that it's hard? Is it that you're trying to be healthy? Is it because you're\nafraid of eating bad foods? Are you experiencing some guilt or or are you judging yourself? You know, all of these kinds\nof change the intention behind why you want healthy\nconvenience store snacks and that intention will\nimpact your experience. So if this is a matter of you wanting healthy convenience store snacks\nbecause you're on the road, and any of those other things\nI just listed are true. My next question would be how frequently are you really on the road? Because if this is something\nlike for me, I don't, especially in coronavirus\ntimes, I don't travel a lot. There's not that many\nopportunities that I have to go into a convenience store and find a snack. So when I do, I kind of\nknow it's not forever. And do I really need to get\nso worked up over what it is. Again if I was doing Whole30\nor something, then yeah it would make sense, but you\nsee how this intention matters. So the truth is, it's\nactually not hard at all to find something healthy\nat a convenience store. And if you start with the fridge, that's gonna be your best bet for fresh, you know, regarding healthy. So whole fruit bananas, oranges, apples, you're almost always gonna find those. And in the actual refrigerator section they usually have like\nchopped, fresh fruit. I went to a 7-Eleven for this video and all the snacks I'm\ngonna show you today are from a 7-Eleven, but they\nhad, you know, chopped fruit that was mixed like the box I got here but they also had melons and grapes. They had some chopped salads and you know, a lot of times you can\nalso find like celery with peanut butter or boiled eggs. My store didn't have those but those are things\nyou can typically find in the refrigerator at a gas station. Uh cheese, I also found cheese and you know, prosciutto sticks and baby bells and that kind of stuff. That could be a great source of protein especially if you're\non the road and looking for something that will keep\nyou satisfied for longer. Now, here's what I realized\nas I started to contemplate why do people really want this video? So what's hard walking\ninto a convenience store is not finding something\nhealthy, it's deciding not to get something\nunhealthy, because we walk in and we're exposed to like a\nheaven of processed foods. It's just like so much stimulus. And I just want to eat\nall of these things. And why would I want to\npick up an apple when they have Doritos, you know,\nand all the good stuff. So I think the challenge\nis really mental, right? This is mind over munch. It keeps showing up every day. The challenge is walking\ninto the gas station and choosing something healthy. This is a valid concern and\nshould still be addressed. So if you feel like\nyou're forcing yourself to choose something that you don't want, it might be worth it to\njust pick the thing you want and give yourself permission to eat it. I did an entire video about the power of permission\nwith food last year and I'll link that below\nif that calls to you. If I go to a gas station and I need and I want or need to get a snack I'll first check in with my inner wisdom. If you don't know what\ninner wisdom is check out that video first so you\nknow what I'm talking about but essentially asking in,\ntuning in how hungry am I? Am I hungry? Am I just bored? You know, a lot of times\non road trips, I am bored. It's actually okay to\neat when you're bored and it's okay to eat junk\nfood because you feel like it. The question is what\nresonates with your body and heart and mind in\nthis moment considering the big picture of any health efforts you may be making or setting\nintentions around, right? So if you're like, well right now I'm doing Whole30 specifically to learn about what resonates with my body. Then yeah, it serves you\nto get really intentional. But if you're just like, ah I feel so guilty if I eat that food and it's coming from that\nplace of judgment, I would say take a step back and think\nabout why this matters to you. So after I check in with my inner wisdom then I can work out to the outer wisdom which is like the nutrition knowledge. So when it comes to outer\nwisdom, I personally will look more at ingredients\nof a snack these days in my life than I will\nthe macro nutrients. So the main thing I'll look\nat on the label is added sugar because added sugar provides\nno nutrition at all. Again, that doesn't mean that\nyou shouldn't or can't eat it. It's just, if I'm trying to\nmake a very intentional choice considering outer wisdom,\nI would personally look at added sugar, for instance,\nover calories or even fat. So throughout this video I'm gonna go through these snacks. The intention was choosing cleaner items. And by clean, I am defining\nclean as less processed, not good. This is not about, you\nknow, morality in food. I like the word clean because\nit just is a quick way to nod to being less processed. If you don't like the word you can replace it with whatever you like. I'm not saying, you know these foods are good in\nthese foods are bad, okay? So what else is there to eat\nat a convenience store besides fruit and cheese if you're\ntrying to make a healthy choice. Also from the fridge section,\nthese Sabra Snackers, okay? I love this. They're crunchy salty, satisfying. You get the protein from the hummus and you kind of get the\nprocessed food from the pretzel. So it's kind of like\nthe best of both worlds but you get a little bit\nof nutrition out of it. Oka, these kind of refrigerated smoothies, this is Mighty Mango Naked. This one, I just pretty much\nlooked in the refrigerator and this was the one\nthat had no added sugar. It does have, you know,\n68 grams of carbohydrates, 57 grams of sugar, but\nit's not added sugar. That being said it is a lot of fruit. I've joked about this\non the channel before when I did a video about\njuices and this has one and a quarter mangoes,\none and three quarters apples a half an orange, a\nthird of a banana, right? Like, would you eat\nthat much fruit at once? Probably not. That being said, it's\nstill a cleaner choice. So you do you. Okay, Pickled Bites. Yum, I've never seen these before. I was actually surprised how\nmuch healthy stuff they had at this 7-Eleven, but it's\nliterally just pickles. I think they're deal flavored\npickles in a bag, like that's awesome. Alright, so these were some\nlike fruit snacks that did not have added sugar into them. They were just the fruit. So these crispy apple chips, the only ingredient is apples, right? I might not want an apple on the road but if I want a crunchy, you\nknow, processed-like snack then here you go. Maybe that will satisfy you, maybe not. These Orchard Blend, Sweet Persimmon, Tart Apple and Tangy Peach dried chews. The only ingredients are\npeaches, apples, and persimmons. You can't get any\ncleaner than that really. So, and then this is apples fruit squeeze. It's not called apple sauce because actually it's\nnot just apples pureed, this is apple juice concentrate. So that is gonna have\na little bit more sugar but it's not added. So another great gas\nstation food is popcorn. So this is just, you know,\nregular sea salt popcorn. The only ingredient, popcorn,\nsunflower oil and sea salt. I don't know if this\none is air fried or not but you could always look for air fried if you're looking for lower and fat this one's probably not because\nthere's nine grams of fat. And then these Popcorner chips, only ingredients are yellow,\ncorn, sunflower oil and salt. And the White Cheddar Smartfood. I love this stuff so much. It's actually not as bad\nfor you as you might think. And I talked about this in\nmy healthy processed foods video or low, you know,\nI did a video last year about processed foods that\nhave minimal ingredients. So if that's what you're looking for, when you're looking at,\nyou know, gas station foods watch that video because\nI go through a lot of surprising processed\nfoods that have just a couple of ingredients. And this one I compare\nspecifically to, they have like, what is it a Smartfood 100 where it's like a hundred calorie Smartfood\npop compared to this one. And that one has way more ingredients. And it's actually not that\nmuch lower in calories. It's like nominal when you weigh it out. And I actually show you this side by side. While talking, you know, super processed, these are other ones that\nI've mentioned in the healthy processed or low\ningredient processed foods video. Pork rinds, okay? Pork rinds are almost always just gonna be fried pork skins and salt, right? Or, you know oil if they're fried. I don't personally love\nthe taste of pork rinds, but a lot of people do and\nit's actually a cleaner food. Chips, now Baked Lays\ndo have more ingredients but they have less fat\nbecause they're baked. These Lays only have\npotatoes, oil and salt. That's three ingredients. It could be worse, right? So like you have to decide\nwhat's worth it to you. And again, why are you, why\nare you getting this snack? Are you really just like wanting a crunchy delicious thing on the\nroad then why are you gonna force yourself\nto get the apple chips, when are these really\ndoing that much damage? I don't know. I would argue no. I would argue personally now\nmy feeling is the stress. I used to get so stressed\nout about this stuff. The stress that I would\nput my body and mind under, choosing something I didn't want because I was trying to be healthy, actually physiologically that\nstress did my body more damage than just eating the chips. That's me personally, okay? And then pretzels, pretzels are always. I love pretzels so much, you\nknow, it's a could be worse it's could be worse kind of food. Like they don't have too many ingredients. Yeah, it's white flour. It's enriched, but it could be worse. Nuts and seeds are another\ngreat choice that you can find at almost any convenience store. And if you are trying to be\npaleo or Whole30 or whatever, this is probably where you\nshould head to be safe. Watch out though,\nespecially if you're doing a strict elimination\ndiet like the Whole30. You can't eat peanuts for\ninstance, there are legumes, but most nuts are, a lot of\nnuts are fried in or roasted in peanut oil, so you have to check. And sometimes it'll say\nlike canola or peanut oil and you don't know which so\nit's not technically compliance. That gets really tricky. But for the most part,\nyou know, nuts are nuts. What I will say about the\nnut situation is if you go in shell or raw, it's\ngonna be your cleanest bet. Same goes for sunflower\nseeds in the shell. You can't get any cleaner than that. When it starts to come to flavoring, okay? So like these peanuts are salt and lime. The ingredients list gets longer. There's sugar and corn syrup,\nsolids and dextrose, right? And maltodextrin, whatever. There's more stuff in it\nis it the end of the world? If there is some stuff in your\npeanuts and you like them, lime flavored, that's up to you. Like me, I hate raw almonds. I will never eat a raw almond. It just tastes disgusting to me. These Wasabi Bold Almonds, I love these. They're so freaking good. They're not clean. They're not clean at\nall, but they're tasty. And really, you know, it's, I mean, they're not clean but they've\ngot one gram of added sugar. To have sugar is the main\nthing you're looking out for. You can still have a\ndelicious, crunchy snack where you know you're getting some nutrition. Uuhm these Love Corn. I don't know this brand,\nI've never had it before but any kind of like roasted\ncorn snack like this, the only ingredients are\nusually corn and oil and salt. This one also has habanero chili. One other thing I wanted\nto bring attention to was trail mixes, because\nthis is something else you can find at a gas station. And usually this is what trail, I guess trail mixes are technically\nlike for the trail, right? Like you go on a hike, you go on a trail and you've got this like mix\nthat'll keep you satisfied. Well, you know, on a car trip\nis sort of the same thing. If you don't have access\nto a food for a while, then a trail mix should\nkeep you satisfied. Here's the thing, you\nprobably already know this if you're watching this\nchannel, most trail mixes especially if they have\ndried fruit in them they have a lot of added sugar. This is so sneaky. Look at these two packages, which one looks healthier to you? Right, yeah, I mean, you\ndecide for yourself, but yeah this one looks like the branding\nmakes it look healthier. Like look at all these\nhealth claims, protein no artificial colors or\nflavors, no preservatives low sodium, blah, blah, blah. But then you look at the\nadded sugar of each of these. So this one just looks like\na regular old thing of, you know, nut and fruit mix. This one has one gram of added sugar and this one has eight. It's from the cranberries. Usually cranberries are\ngonna have added sugar. This one only has one gram\nof added sugar though. So I would actually pick this one and the ingredients are\njust as clean, right? So you have to read the label and don't go based on\nthe sneaky marketing. That being said maybe you\nwant really sweet cranberries in your trail mix, you know. Eating at a gas station is not forever. At least if you're going\non a road trip, I mean you're not gonna die from\neating some added sugar on your cranberries,\nor even from, you know picking the honey bun or the powdered sugar\ndonuts that I like to eat at a gas station, right? Like maybe when you're on a road trip this is the one time you get\nto indulge in eating some of those, you know, nostalgic\ngas station favorites, that you don't let\nyourself have very often or that you don't have the\nopportunity to have very often. So for me, giving myself permission in those contexts to say, no this is when I really want to\nhave the powdered sugar donuts and enjoy them fully. That's what works for me. The next go-to at a gas station or convenience store would be\nlike protein or meat snacks. So Jerkys is what a lot of people go for for a healthy snack. To be honest, the 7-Eleven I was at had no clean Jerkys at all. There are clean Jerkys now. Like it used to be you couldn't find a jerky without added sugar. You can find it now,\nbut not at my 7-Eleven. So these, are both, you know,\none has seven grams of sugar. The second ingredient is sugar. The Turkey Jerky has\nonly four grams of sugar but the second ingredient or maybe it's third\ningredient is still sugar. The Turkey Jerky has a really long a much longer ingredients list. So by the kind of arbitrary\nrule I gave you at the beginning of the video where I said, I\ngo by ingredients, you know and I look at sugar, whatever, I'm kind of breaking that rule because I would actually\npick this one over this. Why would I pick it? I like the way it tastes. I actually prefer the taste and texture of Turkey jerky, right? So this is the point you guys, there are no rules and any rule,\nhard and fast rules you set around food are only\ngonna make you miserable. They only made me miserable. I should speak from my\nexperience, huh, okay. These rules made me miserable and letting go of the rules\nthat like, I can only eat it if there's this much sugar\nor not, and this can't exist on the label or it has to\nbe this many, whatever. All that stuff drove me nuts. At the end of the day,\nit's one snack, okay? It's one snack on one car\ntrip, pick the one you want. This beef steak thing,\nthis looks so disgusting. I've never eaten one of these, but I had to get it\nbecause it was an option. So it's pretty much just\nas bad as the jerky. I mean, not as bad, it\nhas two grams of sugar but has a bunch of, Oh, it has MSG in it. Ooh, it's probably good. This Ahi Tuna Jerky Strip. I've never seen this or tried it before but I was impressed. It doesn't have any added sugar. The ingredients are\npretty clean and you know, it's a good option for a\nlow, moderately low calorie. It's a hundred calories,\nhigh protein, clean snack. You can also buy tuna at the gas station. Who knew 7-Eleven sold\nlike regular chunk tuna. Now this is not, I would\nsay this is probably not ideal to like get in\nyour car and eat this. Unless you have a, a can\nopener in the middle console, then it's not gonna be\nfeasible or easy to eat. But this little Wild Tuna\nMeal Kit, 7-Select brand which I think that's\n7-Eleven brand, right? It's, you know, pretty clean. I mean, it's got crackers. So, you know, if there's\nenriched flour in there, but this could be a good way to\nget a satisfying protein snack. They also of course have a whole\nlike aisle of protein bars. I haven't eaten protein\nbars in a couple of years but I was like, oh my gosh, there are so many protein\nbars now, most of them, I wouldn't, I just wouldn't eat them because I don't like the way they taste. Protein bars don't fill me up. But I wanted to at least\npick one up for the sake of the video, because of\ncourse it's an option, right? And depending on your health\ngoals and your food freedom it might be the right choice for you. I grabbed this. I don't actually like the way these tastes but they had the best,\nthe best ingredients. You know, it's like six\ningredients and it's pretty clean. Personally, I would\nprobably eat the baby bell or the cheese stick which\nhe gives me, two of these would give me as much protein in this. And it tastes way better. The other thing about protein bars, I said that they don't fill me up. They don't fill me up\nphysically, but also mentally. So a lot of times I eat them and I still feel like\nI haven't eaten food. So if I'm really hungry I wanna\neat something where my mind and body both know, okay, I ate. And if I'm wanting to eat a processed food and I'm just like, oh,\nthe protein bar kind of like satisfies the process, you\nknow, food itch or whatever. It doesn't for me anymore. It used to, now I want the real deal. I want, you know, the donuts\nor the chips or whatever. So I couldn't go into a gas station without buying a candy bar, right? So I have a Twix bar here and\nI also have this healthier Hu, Hu, Hu Get Back To Human Chocolate. So it's dark chocolate. I don't like dark chocolate. It's also organic, 70%\ncacao, vegan, paleo. I'm the wrong person to ask. I'm not a chocolate person. I like Twix bars, I like snicker bars, but not because I like chocolates 'cause of all the other good stuff in it. So, this would bring me no joy. Would it bring you joy? Maybe if you're someone\nwho likes dark chocolate, I would rather have the Twix bar. So again, intention here matters. If your intention is\ntrying to satisfy a deep desire to have a Snickers bar, right? This is probably not gonna do it. And this is why a lot of times\nwe can eat these substitutes and then still feel hungry or unsatisfied mentally and physically. But if you're just like, no,\nI really like dark chocolate and I really want a square\nof it to just, you know, have a little sweet after\nmy lunch or whatever then maybe it satisfies you. The only way to know is to\ntune into your inner wisdom. No one outside can tell you. Okay and the last snack is\nnot one I would recommend for if you want to eat\nhealthy at a convenience store but I saw them and I\ncouldn't not buy them. So I figured I'd buy it and taste it. These are pop tart bites. I couldn't resist. So there's 40 grams of sugar\nand 41 grams of added sugar. Oh my gosh, look so cute. Smell your food before you\neat it it'll taste better. There's your mindfulness tip. Oh my God, hmm. It tastes exactly like\nyou think it would taste. It's perfect, oh my gosh, that's so good. It's like a miniature\nPop-Tart that's almost better because there's a better\nratio of like icing, icing to cookie or pastry\nor whatever mixture than on a regular side Pop-Tart. Oh, these are so good. Not recommended if you're\ntrying to eat healthy at a convenience store, but\nI went to a convenience. I went to 7-Eleven and I saw them and I could not get them, so. So, that is the spread. I literally walked into a 7-Eleven. I was like, how many\nhealthy items can I get? This is what I found. I hope that it, you know,\nsupports your journey in some way. The goal was not for me to tell you these are the snacks to\nget, it was to help you really start to investigate\nwithin yourself. What are my intentions here, right? Like why does this matter to me? Just my own experience. I spent so much time, so many\nyears causing myself stress and distress around food and health and trying to make the right choice and then choosing what\nI didn't actually want because I thought I\nwas doing my body right and I was actually causing\nnot just like mental stress, but physiological stress\nin my body, dysregulation. I couldn't lose weight no\nmatter how many calories I ate because of that stress. So this is my mission here is\nto help you not stress so much about food and health, because so much of what we thought mattered\nreally doesn't matter that much, if our stress isn't under control.

kuwait hello so we have your partner berlinda orrano hello okay the training specialists were in we are discussing different topics but for this afternoon my topic for you would be product training but of course it is so hard to do that for you if you don't know much so as you can see here nature's way is a billion dollar company dsm is also a multi-billion euro company the js the ams is also a multi-billion yen company and of course the reader company is also a multi-billion dollar company so as you can see here these are international pharmaceutical companies they tied up with empowered consumerism which is fueled by alliance and motion global just imagine they tied up we got with us because of the credibility that we have here in our company and they trusted us so much that those products will be distributed exclusively by empower consumerism worldwide so just imagine a product but of course we before we discuss our products so we just like to discuss first to you nothing free radicals causing diseases in our body yes this causes the diseases in our body but the fact is okay our own body is producing this free radicals once our cells are producing energy by products radical spoon at all okay but aside from that our body is so what are the sources of this free radicals outside our body so like this we have processed food estres water and chemical pollution as well and the unhealthy lifestyle that we are doing okay so what are those unhealthy lives are one of which is drinking alcohol yes this is just also good for our body but just imagine guys if you drink too much of it it will not also good for your body so it said in the commercials drink moderately and for those who are smokers out there i have a goodness for you why if you do smoke just go just uh think of this guys so just imagine a puff of cigarette just a puff would can contribute to your body one million free radicals just imagine there are millions and millions of free radicals that you can get from a single stick of that a cigarette so just imagine uh it would also mean other people can also get sick by you why because of the smoke that you're throwing them they can also smell it so just imagine guys other people are also getting sick because of the smoke that you are throwing to them so if you guys are smokers out there that is good for you but it's also good for the other people who surrounds you singapore they can also get sick because of you because of this what we call pathogens okay what are these pathogens actually these pathogens are bacterias viruses and other microorganisms that can cause diseases in our body and of course the very famous virus back causing the covid19 okay so what else okay so now let's talk about our bodies so it's very important that we uh analyze this one okay so our body is actually composed of different body systems uh what are they so uh circulatory muscular digestive skeletal muscle okay so all these systems actually is composed of different organs and different tissues as well and different cells just imagine guys if our cells are being exposed to what we call free radicals and these pathogens causing diseases in our body so what will be happening to our cells so just imagine guys what will happen to our cells so of course our cells will be damaged and once our cells are being damaged of course there will be a continuous or chain reaction what would that be so there will also be damages to our tissue there will also be damages of our organs that will be our systems okay so what would happen to our body of course hindi put you healthy so what should we have to do with that of course we have to have a strong immune system and this is immune system is the more responsible um making you healthy each and every day to be protected from these microorganisms around us and also from within okay so how can we do have this a strong immune system how can we have a strong immune system of course first and foremost we have to take this antioxidants more antioxidants okay by the way bio antioxidants actually this antioxidants are okay can be um we can get this antioxidants actually from the the nutrients we can get from the food that we are eating each and every day so what are the benefits that we can get from this antioxidants okay first and foremost it can prevent or slow down the oxidative damage to our cells what else it can also delay the aging process may anti-aging and and repair the free radical damages that have been done in our body and where can we get this antioxidants actually in phytonutrients okay as you can see here in the right side of our slide uh this are actually human cells they are exposed to different uh digestive products coming from fast food meal as you can see here there are so many cells that have been damaged due to the exposure of these cells of ours to fast food male but just imagine on the third uh a part of the uh of the picture as you can see here when our cells are being exposed to what we call antioxidants okay so as you can see here they're just a few of our cells that have been damaged so that is the importance of antioxidants in our body it maintains the health it also prevents sickness in our body as well and according to wh of world health organizations the national cancer institute is about the american dietetic association that our body requires at least five kinds of fruits and five kinds of vegetables every day but i would just like to ask each and every one of you would you able to eat these five kinds of fruits and five kinds of vegetables every day most of us would be saying no yes and i agree to that okay the best solution for that is for us to take food supplements why because if we do take this food supplements it is a sieve that we are already eating this fruits and vegetables why because most of food supplements actually comes from fruits and vegetables okay it is also said your prevention is better than cure why because if you do god sick foreign and i do have a goodness for you because here and in power consumerism we do have great products here that can make your immune system really that strong for you to maintain your health every day and of course and of course the first one that we will be discussing is the flagship product that we have right now we call this ac supreme okay so what is this is supreme actually this is supreme is an ascorbic acid yes this is a vitamin c well known in the market for so many years now that could have really good benefits in our body but there is a big difference with rc supreme with the other vitamin c in the market right now from the name itself c supreme it has a supreme absorption superior attention and supreme performance as well okay so i would just like to remind each and every one of you about the benefits that we can get from vitamin c so just imagine guys antioxidant it has an antioxidant capabilities that can make our strong immune system okay what else it can also reduces the risk of heart diseases for your information guys 30 of causing mortality or death in the whole world is due to heart diseases that's why it's nice for us also to take vitamin c each and every day because it can promote cardiovascular health as well and it also slows down the cancer growth and of course here reduces also the risk of alzheimer's disease so this is a neurological problem although most of this alzheimer's patients but there are also some cases the youngest that was able to encounter having alzheimer's is 12 years old okay what else it can also boost our immune function because again this is an antioxidant it also supports the optimal eye and skin health as well improves also the absorption of iron vitamin c for growth development and repair repair these body tissues in our body is this vitamin c and of course it can also prevent quick aging stroke cholesterol circulatory diseases rheumatism streptococcal infection so when we say streptococcal infection actually upper lower respiratory infection cancer as well asthma allergies amoebic dysentery so when we say um gallbladder diseases gallbladder stone cataracts viral and bacterial infection and varicose veins as well so if you do have a deficiency in vitamin c so animal probability you feel fatigue okay so said earlier vitamin c is needed for this iron to be absorbed in your body and since you are deficient in vitamin c of course you're going to be having also deficiency in iron as well extra vitamin c in your body unlike most of the other animals okay are unable to synthesize vitamin c endogenously indeed vitamin c what else a vitamin c for your information also is a water soluble vitamin so we have to supplement our body with vitamin c because we cannot produce this and i have a good news for you why because the scissor cream okay has the difference i have different uh formulation with other vitamin c that you can see in the market right now why because our caesar beef is actually made with pure waste you were in this purity has an antioxidant superb nutrient okay we're in this includes a natural herbal formulation yes herbal formulation why because the other vitamin c that you can buy in the market right now are actually synthetically made and some of them are processed insane and chemicals that's why it is not good for our body but just imagine guys it will happen see supreme again nero exclusive herbal natural herbal formulation including the vitamin c citrus by flowers complex lipid metabolites were in italian lipid encapsulation technology parama optimize long-term stability therapeutic efficacy and this is the structural representation of our supreme so just imagine absorption retention rate and performance also of the sea supreme in our body first and foremost at the bomb vitamin c nasal ob young is also an antioxidant which can protect the vitamin c from oxidizers of the body vitamin c it also supports the ability to protect chronic inflammatory disease also improves the immune system function while casing a poito also is an antioxidant helps heal wounds and the vitamin c okay the spermic acid acid carrier your vitamin c is to increase excuse me the intestinal absorption of this vitamin c i think bloodstream so metabolites okay encapsulation in a safe and effective enhance vitamin c vitamin c of and this is the mechanism of action we're in the first and the second barrier and this is really a breakthrough product because we have so many clinical tests that have been done research that have been done to prove that rc supreme have difference with other vitamin c in the market right now as i said there are so many clinical studies that have been done one of which is this oh as you can see the title itself unlovable no vitamin c preparation enhances napapaganda a new right formation when we say new right these are actually a neuronal processes where in supreme okay so just imagine with pure basic treatment 12 percent of the cells extend the neurites within one arc of treatment and 45 percent of the cells extend the new rights by our neighbor and absolutely projection stimulus messages so outside to inside of the cell of our nerve cells while the axons send signals from the cells outside the nerve cells formation formation of dendrites aside from that a novel vitamin c preparation enhances your right formation and fibroblast adhesion as well but nothing have an important role in wood healing once there are t-shirt damages guys when they are exposed to sea supreme okay so what else a normal vitamin c preparation enhances your right formation fibroblast addition and also reduces the reduces synobiotic industrial hyper activation okay xenobiotic actually chemical substance now foreign drugs pesticides cosmetics flavorings fragrances food additives industrial chemicals and environmental pollutants as well when the cells are being exposed to pesticides and also treated with purebc so just imagine there's our other t-cell homotypic aggregation by 83 percent within foreign absorption rate and free radical scavenging values of vitamin c lipid metabolites in human lymphoblastic cells okay uh when they are exposed to pure way see okay more rapidly absorbed by human t lymphocytes so when they are exposed because of the lipid metabolized composition here i would just like to get i've seen what one one of our busier owners of uh uh tanawa of of balayage we have her coach hello okay so what else so as you can see here uh see supreme comparing with other vitamin c in the market has 12 percent more antioxidant delivery why can't we say that question is as you can see here 233 higher retention compared with other vitamin c in the human body for singapore because of this comparing again with the other vitamin c in the market it has 300 percent more efficient in promoting fibroblasts and collagen healing as well so experiment in when they are exposed to rc supreme compared with other vitamin c and also it has 250 percent more efficient in promoting the immune system from toxins some pesticides so just imagine ambition because of also the exposure from rc supreme what else so as you can see here also comparing with other vitamins in the market it has 83 percent more reduction of oxidized ldl or what we call the low density lipoprotein cholesterol okay low density lipoprotein is a bad cholesterol once it's oxidized in our body blood vessels what else according also uh with the other experiment that have been done rc supreme comparing again with other vitamins in the market has 11 percent more free radical scavenging activities okay so experiment you neutralize free radical spoke and of course now i think you supreme with the other vitamin c in the market right now so 1 200 percent more stimulation of healthy neurons and nerve regeneration so the band is on an experiment enhance a neurotic formation of our nerve cells or what we call the neurons is the most the value for money is smart vitamin c in the market right now in power question okay so what else 500 milligrams compared with the other vitamin c to your

Liz and oh I just hit nine thousand subscribers thank you guys so much that is so exciting next stop 1 million let's go anyway so I've had a few requests for doing a hard candy I did have one video there that kind of I did as a quick music video but I'm actually going to do one of my tutorials more in depth to give you more information and I'm also going to show you two different recipes so I'm going to show you one that if oh you only have can of butter to do with can of butter and the other one is if you've got texture how you can now make a really good tasting hard candy alright so as always I'm gonna jump right into our ingredients what we need and then get everything together to make some awesome candy ok so one of the most important things when you're doing candy making a hard candy making is humidity humidity is a huge factor if it is too humid in your home don't bother trying it it is summer in it is too humid don't bother trying unless you have a dehumidifier or air conditioner so I made these the other day and it was a little too humid and that's what's gonna happen is they're gonna come out sticky and tacky and they're just gonna melt together so optimal humidity is 35% however about 45 to 50 absolute maximum 50 is but 45-year okay at sugar alright so for our cannabutter hard candies you are going to need 1 cup of white sugar half a cup of corn syrup 1/2 a cup of water and a quarter cup of peanut butter and a half a teaspoon of soy or the other one sunflower lecithin yes you can use the powder if it is granular you may need to strain it but I believe the powder will work as well so that's what you're gonna need for your can of butter ones now if you are a tincture person you can make candy sugar & Canas syrup from your tincture if you don't already have those made up I do have the videos that show you how to make those so you can make up your your can of sugar and your can of syrup so for your tincture for takes your candy sorry gap there and this is the way the reason why I did this is so that you don't have the taste of alcohol this way the the alcohol has been evaporated off and it gives you a really nice tasting candy versus probably most you just use tinctures straightforward always have a contend with that taste of alcohol this is going to help eliminate that problem altogether so what you are going to need is a half a cup of white sugar regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar yes you can use one kind one cup of can of sugar I just prefer again for taste to do the half and half you're going to use a quarter cup of kanna syrup and a quarter cup of light corn syrup and a half a cup of water and again whatever flavors that you would like to use and colors to make it again this is gonna come out very green so you may not want that color you may want some other color and again the white for the solid background again more I'll go into detail now the nice thing about using this recipe is that you don't have to use an emulsifier like gore gum we're not trying to stick butter in places that has no business being and trying to make it stick so these are all natural ingredients and that's why I find this recipe works so much better all right so the equipment that you are going to need is first a pot a cold pot of water with ice this is for us to stop the cooking process when our candy reaches temperature you're going to need a small or medium heat transfer it pot non heat transfer and sorry heavy bottom is preferred and non heat transfer is there is no dark spots in the bottom of your pot so that means that there is no spots that get hotter than any other spots you have proper proper heat distribution and your candy isn't going to burn in it's not gonna be hotter in one spot but another you will need a spatula your candy thermometer your candy mold yes I know they're red and my dummies I say don't use red molds for hard candies are perfectly fine but not for gummies or if you're making lollipops there's this type of lollipop mold which is a 3d mold or you've got the flat mold that you can get as well so you're gonna have get those prepared and have those standby on hand and I'm gonna use these that's probably another one you're making hard candies you also want to make sure that your molds are small remember you want it to be in your mouth you don't want to be like you want it to to feel good in your mouth not be oversized and that's about all the recommendation I have for your candy molds we will get started first on the can of butter recipe alright so for our can of butter candies you are going to add your one cup of sugar your a half a cup of corn syrup and your half a cup of water you're gonna stir that until it is combined and your sugar started to dissolve and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high oops sorry I always forget so you're also going to need a cup of hot water with a pastry brush or a paintbrush to clean these sides of the pot down up for many sugar crust that wants our sugar and water there of kamae gonna turn your heat on to medium high and you're just going to continue to stir it until your syrup begins to boil the moment that it begins to boil we're gonna stop stirring and we're going to attach our candy thermometer and cook our syrup to 300 degrees Fahrenheit and again you always just want to make sure that you wash down any sugar crystals that you see for it on the side of the pot the reason for that is so say your candy doesn't crystallize if you leave sugar crystals there it can cause your candy to crystallize now when you're stirring you always want to make sure to go around the edges of your pot the sugar likes to sit in there so you just want to make sure that none of the sugar is sitting or forming on the sitting and crystallizing they're on the bottom of the pot so you can see our or I hope you can see bubbles just starting to form there around the edge so it's starting to boil at this point I am going to stop stirring and I'm just gonna clean off any sugar off the edges then I'm going to attach my candy thermometer and as I said we are gonna cook this to 300 degrees Fahrenheit the moment we hit 300 degrees we're going to dunk it we're gonna dunk the bottom of the pot into our ice water and at first when it starts to boil its gonna be cooking off any impurities in your water and your sugar so it will bubble up like this for a moment but then in a few moments as soon as those cook off it will settle down and the other thing is the ones that starts with the boiling and you've tossed your thermometer just turn your temperature down to about medium now while your syrup is cooking you just want to get your molds all ready and prepared because once our syrup is ready we need to work fairly quickly and then just to let you know so when you attach your candy thermometer it'll go up pretty quickly and then you'll notice that it's gonna sit in around 220 220 - probably for about 10-12 minutes that's while it's mainly cooking the water off after that the temperature will start to increase and it will start to increase fairly rapidly so you don't want to go too far away from the kitchen right after that point so if you do need to take a quick little break and don't forget you've got about probably 10 minutes of safely way right now all right so I am 300 degrees remove your candy thermometer dunk it in your ice cold water to stop the cooking so we just want to wait for it to stop bubbling there a little bit turn off your heat and there we go you don't want to leave it too long cuz your can't it'll start to solidify on the bottom now I'm going to add in the butter now be very very careful because you are working with molten lava you're going to just start to gently just kind of get that there now if it does if your syrup does start to solidify too much on the bottom just put it back on the burner it's still warm enough to melt that and now we are going to get our lecithin and we are going to add in a half a teaspoon a generous 1/2 teaspoon of our lecithin and you're going to drizzle it all over the top of your syrup and butter and then I'm just gonna move this hold on and now you're gonna gently stir until your syrup and butter starts to combine be very very careful as it starts to combine you want to stir it from the center like this so you're pulling your butter and your syrups from the side and this is going to help to emulsify them and emulsifying is bringing them together bringing your water and your oil together as one one solution is one syrup so my syrup seems to be crystallizing it a little bit here so I'm gonna add in a quarter teaspoon of citric acid all right so once your syrup is all mixed its gonna lighten up like this and it's gonna go solid now you can add in your coloring and your flavoring so I'm gonna do this one tutti-frutti first oops I added a little too much sorry normally I'd in a capful I don't know why I just went all freestyle there and I'm going to add in the white and the white is going to help to give a solid background to him for our color and I'm going to do this one pink all right so I was having a little trouble there for a little bit there I thought this was actually gonna be a flop because my emulsifier might lecithin wasn't coming together fully with my syrup but I persevered and kept stirring and and it did come together that graininess is now gone that I was having there and now getting a nice smooth candy syrup so sometimes you might think it's a fail but keep going that's usually what's the failure probably close to way it will be failing is that it's just not am also fine correctly just not coming together so you just gotta beat it a little bit better I have just added a little more color here and now my syrups getting a little bit thick here as you can see it a little bit thick to work with so I'm just gonna turn my heat on to low just to help melt to keep it melted so I'm just gonna get this color mixed in and just get that melted I said just gonna heat it up a little bit so it's a little more melty melted and I will get this poured into our molds all right so with the butter and the lecithin your syrup is a little is a little thicker then if you were using the other when using the other method so now I'm just gonna pour it into my mold as best as I can it's a little hard off that happens just scoop it off you can clean that up later okay so this syrup I'm sorry is a little too thick to try and put into the sucker mold so I'll actually show you the sucker molds with the other one I'm just gonna fill the regular candy mold with these don't worry too much about it the Mesolithic drips on the side you can easily break those off and clean up your candy afterwards so yeah it's a bit messy sometimes the other syrup you'll see works so much nicer now if you do overflow on those just get a straight edge so straight an offset spatula or a straight edge knife and you can just scrape it off the top like so I just scrape it on my table and clean it up afterwards so that's it for our butter candies now we're gonna let this B's sit I'm gonna finish filling up the molds I'm gonna let them sit until they are completely cooled which it takes about an hour or so ready so for our texture version you're gonna have already have had pre-made up your canna sugar in your can of syrup and so for this recipe or rework what we are going to use the half a cup of Canada sugar 1/2 a cup of regular sugar the quarter cup of can up syrup and our quarter cup of light corn syrup and our half a cup of water our citric acid does not go in until we are done cooking if you put your citric acid in now beforehand you will actually make your syrup too hot and it will burn so just going to combine all our ingredients and then once they're combined I'm going to turn our heat on to medium high until our syrup begins to boil and also make sure to go all the way around the edges of your pot to make sure to get all that hiding sugar now you're gonna find the difference if you tried between the two recipes this one is so much easier to work with so I turn my heat onto there medium-high I'm going to continue stirring until our syrup begins to boil and I am going to wash down the any of the sugar crystals here that a-port got onto the side of the pot now that your syrup has started boiling you're gonna stop stirring you're gonna touch your candy thermometer and I also recommend to get the fan going just because you are cooking even though you're using the dehydrated sugar in the hut there could still be some alcohol left over and that can cause you just want to have it ventilated now if your syrup starts to bubble up this too high and you're getting a little worried there just pick it up off the heat turn your heat down to medium and place it back down and you are going to let this cook now until your syrup hits 300 degrees the only thing that you're gonna do here like I said you're not going to stir anymore only thing you'll do is if you see any sugar crystals or anything formed on the sides just clean that up and as your syrup gets close to temperature don't forget to grab your pot of ice water all right so I'm almost a temperature I've got my pot of ice water ready let's stop hitting the camera and 300 remove your candy thermometer carefully put it in your sink and then drop your pot bottom into the ice water until it the bubbles start coming down and also turn off your heat okay so I'm starting fires here all right so we've got our syrup here and now I'm going to add in our flavoring so I'm gonna do a peach mango tropical punch thingy here so I'm going to do a half a cup a half a capful of each flavor sorry a capful I lied sorry the jiggling of the camera it's a little hard to work off now in some candy hard candy recipes they'll tell you to put that the your flavoring in right away you don't want to do that I can see how that's vaping up there that's your flavor actually burning off so when you see that huge vape of smoke that's all your flavor burning off okay so those are my flavors it's gonna get them stirred in there a little bit now for the color now if I just have if I'm just gonna add in yellow I'm gonna show you what that will look like rocks I'm gonna use peach and you can use the liquid gel or the gel these gels the Wilton gels either one doesn't matter okay not quite that much so I don't use the white and I just use the peach on its own you have a translucent color but it's not very pretty you don't put some on the paper here so you can see it's not the prettiest of colors horrible but if you add the white in it gives you a solid background and it makes your the color the primary color that you want standout is the actual color and so you can see also this syrup was a lot easier to work with stays much thinner and the same thing though if it starts to solidify a little bit on the bottom there just put it onto your burner it's still warm enough it's still warming up and it'll just get that all melted in so I'm just going to finish stirring that up there and I'm going to get the get this ready to pour into the molds so once your syrup is all nicely one color one uniform texture we can get ready to pour it into the mold see that works a lot better and if you're doing these lollipop molds you want to bring them up right to the right to their edges if you don't then when you put them together you'll find that you'll end up with gaps oops not that much then to put small together just flip her over make sure that you do it on the right side put it together and squish her down and then you're just gonna make sure that it's all well pushed down and some firm I'm gonna fill up our little our little molds here and that's it you're just gonna get these filled up and let them harden up and then we'll get them out of the molds yes he's so much easier to work with alright now that our candies are cooled we can take them out of the malls so our first one with our butter the ones that were kind of messy and yucky and trying to get them into the mold just work them out and then with a pair of kitchen scissors you can always just cut around the excess and it'll just come off and then you can just save that you can also put it all any excess you could also put it back into a pot melt it down if do it in a double boiler and or just put it over low heat but be very careful and you can remount it and then recast him again now what I would probably recommend is with the butter one as I said you saw kind of how difficult it was getting in the molds is to just lay it out onto a pan and score it make score lines in it so they can break it easily you can kind of see have a look at that I did it in the cough drop video and then and then here were my the cans syrup and the can of sugar ones the same think there's any extra edges and these two edges you can just easily just snip them off they come off really easily now let's have a look at our suckers so far so good there's still a little bit warm same thing though just cut off any excess around the edges like so and also top them off there you have it two different versions of hard candies and lollipops so odds obvious if you have it as always not as obvious I apologize as always if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to put them in the comments then I will be back to say goodbye in just a moment oh sorry one thing I forgot to tell you if your place is your good through the humidity's good oops you can just store your candies and just put them into a glass jar or into a candy dish good to go if there is any humidity or you find that they're sticky at all you can toss them in powdered sugar or icing sugar and again store them in a glass jar or airtight container the icing sugar will help them from sticking together so I hope that helps you out so guys that was my tutorial on lollipops and hard candies I hope you enjoyed that and as I said before if you do have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and thank you guys so much to help for helping me get to the nine thousand mark well it's Riley a little bit over now yay and and again to lots more recipes to come I do keep a list of these suggestions that you make and I will try to get through them as we go so as I said lots to look forward to in the future if you're new to my channel I do hope you subscribe and if you enjoy this I really do hope you share with your friends so thanks again for joining and you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "zLbZIv_cumE": "- Welcome to Bless Your Rank. My name is Matt and today we are ranking grandma's hard candies. We got them from a real grandma. She wasn't looking and\nwe raided her pantry and stole all of her hard candies. We did not do that. If there's a grandma out\nthere that's missing candy right now I'm sorry it wasn't us. I was just joking. (upbeat country music) Matt's gonna wrap. Not in a R-A-P way a W-R-A-P way. This is gonna get noisy in here. (wood taps) Here's how it works. So things we're looking for. Obviously taste cause it's candy. Appearance that's kind of important. You don't wanna put anything\ngross in your mouth. Also like how long does it last? It's hard candy. It should last a long time. So this Bless Your Rank is all about of course grandma's candy, but really more specifically\nthis is the kind of stuff that grandma might sneak you a piece of while you were in church. Or if you had a grandma like I did she probably would just quietly unwrap it and hand it you cause she\nknew you would manage to make that wrapper louder than the pastor. I wasn't trusted with a\nlot things as a child. But now I can just be as loud as I want to with these wrappers. How about that? Number one. The I don't know what you call these. These are just the little\nstrawberry candies. I don't think they have an official name. The get a bad rep. People like to trash\nthese strawberry things and say they're not really\ngood and they're cheap candy, but they have this like soft gush strawberry gel on the inside. It's like a bonus candy. It's like candy inception. Candy within a candy. This isn't as sweet as I\nremember it being as a kid. Also double wrapper for some reason. They just really out\nto get the environment. Taste right now like\nsome weird piece of candy that barely has any sugar in it and absolutely no\nstrawberry favor whatsoever. This is a huge let down. I remember these as a kid just like killing it with some strawberry flavor. I'm not getting any of that. I'm gone bite into it now. There's the strawberry flavor. It was hiding inside of it the whole time. Now we're finishing off pretty well. It was a really good ride. Exiting to the gift shop now. I like it. Grandma hand me one of these at church I'd probably be like\ngrandma what else you got? I think you can probably\ndo better than that. Do you have like a tootsie\npop in there somewhere. Even a dum dum that you got from the bank. They're OK. They're good once you bite into them, outside not that great. Grandma maybe keep these in your purse just in case you're craving mediocrity. Gonna put in on the doily here currently in first place. Our next competitor. Peppermints. The original hard candy. It's stuck. (wood taps) Alright there we go. These are the hard peppermints. These are not soft peppermints. Grandma wouldn't have those. You never know when she's\ngonna have her teeth in or not. These are good peppermints. Strong on the pepper mint. I mean I know what a peppermint was like, but see there's a lot of different types of peppermint out there. You don't really know what\nyou're getting sometimes. Maybe that's something that\npresidential candidates should look at becoming\npart of their platform is that you correctly label peppermints. Is it soft or hard peppermints\nto avoid confusion. If you agree with me, then you use the hashtag\nregulate peppermint industry now. This is a traditional peppermint. This is what you think of\ngetting is a hard peppermint. It's really good. It tastes like a candy\ncane which is exactly what a peppermint should be. This is more like a paw paw\nwould have these in his pocket though I think. Beware though. They may come from his last trip he took to Sonic Drive In in 1997. Alright so I'm looking at taste. Peppermint was good all the way through. Appearance? I mean what do you not love\nabout the strawberry thing? I'm a take a gamble and I'm\ngonna go for the strawberry cause I know what the potential is then. The potential is very high. Peppermint's a good\nstandby, it's a classic, it will never let you down,\nyou know what you're getting. But I know that we can do better. Contestant number three is oh no. This is black liquorice. What are y'all trying to do to me? Don't make me do this. (groans) I've got news for you. If this is your grandma's hard candy, you're grandma is the devil. I'm sorry. This isn't even candy. Isn't like, legit liquorice, like a root that you found in the dirt? Candy is not from the dirt. Candy comes from heaven\nor the Wonka factory. Aw man. Can we just fake it? Like mmm but not very good. Blah blah blah last place. Ew. This is what I imagine like taking a bite out of a dog turd is like. So many flavors and none of them are good. It's like it's punching me in the throat. Like karate kicking me to death. It's like it's effecting\nthe way I breathe. Like I can taste it in my breath now. (groans) I have absolutely nothing\ngood to say about this. This is a waste of space. I'm sure it came in a wrapper\nand it's a waste of that. This is terrible. If you are in church you're\nlike grandma what do you got, you got any candy, and she hands you a\nhandful of black liquorice go to the alter immediately\nand pray for grandma's soul cause it's gone. Where do I wanna rate this? This is without a doubt the worst thing that I'll have today. Not just today but ever,\never, on Bless Your Rank. Dead last. Contestant number four\nis cinnamon hard candies. Of course obviously cause you can read it right here on the wrapper. So to our three fans in Japan, and I'm probably off by\nthree meaning we have none, there you go. This is a little tribute to you with the cinnamon hard candies. My least favorite chewing gum is Big Red and this is I imagine is\ngonna be right up that alley. That's not candy. That's not fun. I like spicy things. Hot food, spicy food, I love cajun food when\nit's like super spicy, but I don't want my candy like that. There's a line. For the love of me I can't\neven open this wrapper! Alright so much for that. It's like a peppermint that's\njust gone just all red. This is a communist peppermint. That's not overwhelmingly cinnamony. It's not bad. I'm kind of a fan. Lot's of flavors. It's getting a little\nspicy, coming back down, getting a little spicy, coming back down. (upbeat music) Not as much cinnamon as like Big Red Gum. This is not bad. Whoa! Can't talk a lot with it in your mouth. You got a grandma that\nhands you these in church you got a spicy grandma. That was grandma that had\na little bit too much fun at the bingo hall on Saturday night and she's in church Sunday morning kinda nursing a hangover\nand is also like here and she will hand you one of these after she accidentally\nhanded you one of her pills. Where do they rank? They're still not better\nthan strawberry candies and I don't think that\nthey're really better than peppermints either so I'm\ngonna go ahead and just say third place cause as I've said before nothing is worse than black liquorice. Contestant number five. Werther's Originals. I love these. Maybe I'm a grandma. I don't know. They are delicious and\nthis is something that I definitely had at my\ngreat grandparents house. I feel like there was an old man at church when I was at church that had these too. I may have just been imagining things. Mr. Werther, can I have\none of your originals? And then he's like yes you can son and he pulls out like a handful of them. Take as many as you want. Thanks Mr. Werther. Here we go. (laughs) A little difficult to get\nout the wrapper there. This taste like grandma\nand grandpa's house. Like distant banjo going\non, you hear birds chirping, and you're just kinda\nrocking back and forth. That's what this tastes like right now. It's like a caramely cream. These are so good. This is gold standard. Pun intended. I mean this is like if you ask\ngrandma for a piece of candy and she pulls out one of these originals, your grandma has a good\ntaste in candy number one, number two grandma just got\nher social security check so she's affording the good candy, and three just grandma loves you. That's what that means. This is as good as grandma\nhard candy gets maybe. I don't know. There's more to rank so we'll see. This is so much better\nthan strawberry candy. It's not even close. Contestant number six. Oh Tootsie Rolls! Cotton candy, sweeties, go. Let me see the Tootsie Rolls. Fun fact about Tootsie Rolls. They haven't made any sine 1978, but I believe there might be\nsomething to the fact that grandmas are given a certain\namount of Tootsie Rolls and they can't go on to heaven until they've handed out all the Tootsie Rolls. Here we go. Now that looks like chocolate. That looks like a hunk\nof chocolate right there. This is good candy and\nthis is candy's evil twin. Grandma hands you one of these at church grandma's playing a prank on you. You're definitely gone get\nthis stuck all in your teeth. This is my teeth isn't it? I feel like it's in my teeth. I'm quite the butter finger. (laughs) Holy crap! Do you ever finish chewing this? I love Tootsie Roll but this\nis not good for my teeth. In conclusion, Tootsie Rolls are delicious but they are really going\nto mess up your smile in a heartbeat. Also why are there so many of them? We as humans are outnumbered\non Earth right now three to one by Tootsie Rolls. Contestant number one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. It is unmarked yellow candy. What are these? - [Producer] Butterscotch. - Butterscotch candies. I don't know what to expect with these. I don't even know what they look like. If I saw a bowl of these sitting out, I would think that's like\na medicine for a dog. They spend all their money\non protective packaging for this candy and not the candy at all. Yeah this is like a\nyellow peppermint kind of. I like this. And there goes the flavor. Didn't last long. Short little visit. Yeah this was like at first I\nthought this was pretty good, but I could do with\nnever having one again. This is like showing a red pill blue pill. Like you don't know if you want the red candy or yellow candy. Both will be very mediocre. At first little bit I was\nlike it's not terrible. I kinda like it. And then it's like it's\ndoing nothing for me anymore. It's like a terrible relationship. It was really fun at the start and now it's just like it's a chore. I don't see these definitely not better that Werther's Originals, not\nbetter than the strawberries, I am gonna say that they're\nbetter than the Tootsie Rolls. I'm gonna say that currently\nthese are in fourth place. Let's move the devil's candy down and then make some room here for unnamed butterscotch candies. Our final competitor\ncontestant number eight is Andes Mints. This is the chocolate and the mint. This is like a mint sandwich\nwith chocolate and then mint and more chocolate. I love the smell, I love\neverything about these. These are so good. Here we go. Aw man. These are a treat. I don't ever have these. Can you buy these? Granny stole some of the Andes Mints from the Olive Garden again. That's exactly what she did. Man these are good and these are all mine. I got a whole bowl of them now. I've never had this happen in my life. I don't know where these come from. Can you get these at Wal Mart? I'm a have another. I'm a do it. I'm a do it. It's the last one of the day. I'm a do it. Shout out to the Andes wherever that is. If you are a place, if you\nwere just a guy named Andy, I don't know, but keep\nup the good work Andy. And if you're grandma hands out these, congratulations you've got the greatest grandma in the world. (sighs) This is one of the\nclosest Bless Your Ranks I think that we've ever\nhad and I'm trying to think of all of them right now. And this could almost be a tie, but we don't do ties on Bless Your Rank because ties are for little\nleague sports and communists. This is America. This is Bless Your Rank\nand Werther's Originals is the best of grandma's hard candies. It's the best of grandma's hard candies and it's one of the best\nhard candies period. Like name a better hard candy. I'm to just go ahead and take\nall of these with me here. \u266a Werther's Originals is a taste of home \u266a \u266a Grandma and grandpa's house \u266a \u266a Something that rhymes with home \u266a Don't tell grandma.

Actually they're grandma's. She might share if you ask nicely.", "LlJQdRFfucQ": "my name is Erica and I'm one of the dietitians at the Stanford Cancer Center I do definitely want to explain just a little bit about our cancer supportive care program in case you know that's just a new new terms for everybody and it's it's just nice to know about free resources that we have in the community because that word free doesn't come around very often but this cancer supportive care program is basically it's for anybody who's been diagnosed with cancer so honestly if you even you have a history of it you can utilize our program it's for patients and caregivers and we have everything from nutrition consult which are consultations and follow-ups are free I'd be happy to look at your insurance card but that's all I do and we also have a number of other programs with or you know as far as classes within our program everything from yoga to writing with cancer some writing classes that people really really benefit from so it's just a really it's it's just a fantastic program that has grown through the years we even have massage so when people actually come to their clinic appointments you can sign up for a massage while you're waiting or after your appointment or all that kind of thing so it is definitely something that I you know suggest that people utilize if you've never done yoga this is a good time to try because you can walk in walk out there's no money out of your pocket you can decide I liked it or I didn't so it's really just a fantastic program that's constantly growing just to get an idea how many is anybody in here undergoing cancer treatment right now and if you don't want to raise your hand that's fine as far as caregivers and what about like cancer survivors okay a lot of them good good okay so there's definitely a lot out there with regard to nutrition and cancer that can absolutely be very very very confusing what I've done tonight and all there's a list of all the things I'm gonna cover but I'm going to basically give you the black and white of it there there's a little there's always gray areas because there's always more studies that we need we're constantly learning in my opinion not really learning fast enough but we're doing our best and so you know basically I'm going to tell you what we know now about a lot of different things so as I basically mentioned it you know it can be very challenges as far as a lot of things that you read or a lot of things that people will tell you that's one thing that we get a lot from patients as far as people coming and said so and so that you know for family members and friends come out and say oh you shouldn't eat this oh drink this oh eat this oh don't do that and so not only is your head spinning from being slapped with the diagnosis and your treatment course but you know then all these do's and don'ts and oh my goodness so and there is a lot of misunderstanding the internet can be our friend or our foe so you really have to be careful with what sites you go to and who is authoring the sites because there's a lot of theories out there and all that it is estimated that about 70 to 80 percent of cancer patients use some sort of complementary treatment therapy during during cancer treatment which basically means like it can be something like massage it could be something like yoga is actually considered complementary or it could be something as far as like supplements which is again where we come in if somebody comes to me and says you know here's my bag of pills and powders and that I take first of all my question is always is your doctor whether they agree or not is your doctor aware that you're taking these things because everybody has to be on board as far as the team effort the second thing is I will look through everything and I won't take anything away unless I know it's going to hurt you or the treatment course so that's the other thing as far as people having this is where nutrition is still where people feel like I have some control I know I can I can decide what I'm going to put in my mouth rather than you know to a certain degree rather than you know a doctor nurse saying here take this take that this is your medication schedule this is when your this is your chemotherapy schedule and that kind of thing so you know we all want to have some sense of control with our treatment plan or just with our life so that's that's it so that's basically work when it comes to supplements that's where we come into play when people think I get a lot of people come oh yeah I'm gonna go through the dietician she's probably gonna take all my things away and that's not the case so we we like to look at the big picture however there are a lot of you know myths about things meaning a lot of things that people will read that you know say oh this is going to cure the cancer or this is really going to help you and this and that and sometimes that's not really the case again it may not harm you through treatment but if you know there's not really it's not necessarily going to guarantee you a clean bill of health at the end and let me tell you I have seen pretty much everything so you know but anyway we'll go over so sugar big one and I know the question everybody's going to ask alcohol we're gonna cover dairy we're gonna cover meat coffee and caffeine antioxidants specifically we're going to kind of carve out a little bit of vitamin C soy isoflavones and and I'm thrown and cleanses that they'll as a last one because that's just something that we get a lot we'll go over it so I'm gonna watch the clock because this is actually a lot to cover in an hour so but I didn't want to leave anything out because these are kind of big ticket items so anyway we'll just get started how's that for sugar so kind the most common question is does sugar feed cancer and will sugar cause my cancer to grow some important things to remember first you have to think of just and if you don't you know you know nothing about nutrition nothing like that we have to start at square one knowing that all cells including healthy cells including cancer cells they all use glucose sugar as an energy source they our bodies will make it it will find it if we don't give it to it so if we aren't eating some sort of a carbohydrate or anything like that we will make glucose out of proteins and fats so that's just one thing to remember the there are now the other thing too that you know like to kind of explain is I don't want people to get too confused when we talk about the word sugar versus carbohydrates - carbohydrates yes they break down to sugar and blah blah blah but and I'll explain a little bit more about what we mean professionally as you know with the word sugar because sugars occur naturally in as you know fruit vegetables beans nuts I mean really the whole thing obviously grains so it's you know there's a lot to think about when you you know when somebody comes up with this whole sugar concept I've seen some very scary scary things I had one lady a couple now I guess it's a couple ago um where the nurse came to get me and said you really need to talk to this lady because I'm really concerned about her not only was she losing weight really rapidly partly because of some of the side effects but also because she was anxious because again so many people show so many things she had read so many things people heads the head told her and so she really took the sugar concept all the way to the extreme she cut out all her grains she stopped eating fruit she's not so one of the things to remember is glucose is the number one fuel source for the brain so by the time I started to talk to her she was slow to respond just with her comments back to me everything and we ended up coming up with you know as far as I spent quite a bit of time with her just explaining some things and we came up with you know kind of a plan for her to add in some whole grains some whole fruits back to her diet slowly gradually and sure enough she did that and she actually ended up feeling a lot better we ended up stabilizing her weight she was responding to treatment so it was all it was all good but what we did do is focused on you know hidden sugars and you know talked about you know are you really gonna go have a mocha and a Danish or you know those types of things no no no I mean that wasn't even part of it but we what we did is we added back some of the necessary healthy carbohydrates to her diet and that was definitely important so here are some things with regards to the American Cancer Society and it's a long statement but basically they're saying that sugar what sugar does sugar and they're talking about sugar like table sugar anything front well and I'm going to go through a list of the different kinds of sugar too but as far as sugar increases your calorie intake which essentially increases your insulin use which essentially increases a lot of times weight and all the the things between insulin and weight have such an incredible impact on cancer risk that that is actually more of the issue as you're adding all those extra calories by having the extra sugar in your coffee or tea or cereal or mochas or you know that type of thing so that's what we want to focus on is limiting baked goods high sugar beverages and that type of thing focusing on those first and then we can look at other hidden sugars which again I'll go over the American Heart Association has this recommendation of no more than six teaspoons which is a hundred calories or 20 grams of added sugar for women and then nine teaspoons or 150 calories or equates to thirty seven and a half grams of added sugar for men so and I'll explain that so it really makes sense in just a second here are some comparisons which are really interesting too as far as between white table sugar honey good old stevia agave high fructose corn syrup so as you'll see there's you know I mean they're roughly summer sixty calories you know as far as per tablespoon some are 45 some are 53 they're all relatively the same amount of carbohydrates so between 12 17 14 there a couple couple grams off of each other but one of these things to remember is I actually even if you're using stevia or a sugar substitute I want you to look at all of these as the same just because it's a sugar substitute I don't want you loading five tables you know five two spoons of of it in your coffee or tea thinking well it's not sugar because again what you're doing is you're actually sending the wrong message to this you can actually train yourself to crave sugar you can which one of these are better I'm not going to say any of them they all have a little different properties why everybody knows table sugars table sugar the other ways that these breakdown between honey agave even maple syrup which actually I should have probably put on here but like honey you'll get at least you'll get sugar which your body will look at these with the exception of stevia but look at these other sugar components the same way if process is the same the difference is is like with honey you'll get actually some antioxidants as you wouldn't get with table sugar things like agave nectar you'll get a little bit of calcium a little bit of magnesium a little bit of potassium maple syrup it the same way a little bit of manganese a little bit of zinc and then but again not with high fructose corn syrup no nutrients whatsoever so that's where people will say oh well I use agave or I use maple okay great but when it comes down to it when we're looking at added sugar we always want to look at how much are we using and I see this a lot in even our cafe when people go to get coffee or tea whatever and they go to the condiment area and they automatically pick up like let's just say three packets of sugar rip the tops open pour it in their coffee out the door they may or may not stir it if that sounds familiar my challenge to you is when was the last time you tasted it first of all with nothing which I know some people go oh well when I can't drink it but then maybe try one teaspoon or maybe a little bit stir it taste it when was the last time you checked in with yourself to see do I need three packets this probably does because again you've created this sort of craving so that's I think anywhere that we can reduce the amount of added sugar that's what we want to do I want your bodies to work at the energy it has to get I want it to work through the fiber and the nutrients from whole grains and fruit and things like that that rather than just give it a straight energy source okay does that make sense here's a little bit about what I mean but as far as what it means with this added sugar about you know women should do no more than 20 men should do no more than thirty seven and a half grams so here's some sneaky sources of sugar 6 ounces of playing fat free the Shibani Greek yogurt has 100 calories 7 grams of carbohydrates from naturally occurring milk sugar so that's one thing to remember is when you're looking at a plain yogurt and it says sugars and you go oh that's lactose that's the natural naturally occurring sugar in that yogurt then I want you to pick up the same brand in a flavour which here 6 ounces of blueberry fat-free same brand the Shibani Greek yogurt 140 calories 20 grams of carbohydrates 20 versus 7 so that difference is that extra sugar that they've added in there now the thing is is then you have to look at the ingredients say are there really blueberries in here or is it blueberry concentrate or fruit syrup or that type of thing in the perfect world I would want people to eat plain yogurt with real fruit that would be ideal now again some people go I don't like plain yogurt it's so turn so anyway but that's an example of what we mean by these hidden sugars and and a way to compare the two so again some takeaways with the sugar is as far as just aim for fresh Whole Foods I also suggest people look at how much fruit a fruit juice they drink and I would actually welcome in more of the whole fruit you get less calories and you get the fiber you're gonna feel full more so than you would with the juice and again it's a calorie thing unless you're looking for extra calories then that's okay but trying to limit just processed foods altogether the sugary drinks and again that's where anything that's really flavored a lot of times read the label it's the only way you're gonna know and then the the concept of adapting your palate to less sweetened foods is that whole concept of checking in with yourself you can train this to not want so much sugar I know a lot of people who drink a lot of Crystal Light all day long and that's actually one of the things if they don't drink Crystal Light they're like I need something sweet after lunch maybe some M&Ms because it's constantly going in so that's where adapting kind of your palate to less wheat I'm try adding fresh fruit here you know again you can drizzle some honey on plain yogurt and stuff like that instead of commercially sweetened or fruited or using fruited yogurts again you're going to get a little bit of antioxidants from the honey as opposed to whatever they put in there in that yogurt so it's always a balancing act it's a very very tricky concept but it's also a concept that's been a lot been around for I think it was 1930 is when the there was a doctor who came up or who actually a medical doctor who went over you know how the body processes sugar and somebody actually kind of misconstrued that and then it took off to sugar feeds cancer and so we've been in kind of a battle of all of that for quite a long time but um anyway so that's kind of the the gist of the sugar so basically it's you know it's use your common sense look for hidden sugars obviously you know avoiding or limiting the cookies and the cakes you know I mean I've seen people you know say oh no it's my birthday and I can't have birthday cake I'm the one who usually says the birthday cake it's once a year you know enjoy yourself and move on but because I really want people look at the bit they'll hope the big picture okay moving on to alcohol and the interesting thing is that obviously many cancers are linked to alcohol including head and neck esophageal breast colorectal and then they throw and possibly liver again that just goes to show that some studies say yes some study says no the interesting thing about alcohol is even with the recommendations for cancer prevention there is a one of the statements on there that limit alcohol consumption women get one drink men get to drink two drinks per day and a lot of people ask why is that even on there the reason is is that the recommendations for cancer prevention that came out in 2007 was an international piece of work and there and also the the wreaths so you know you think of the people in France and Italy and they're like oh don't get rid of my alcohol but also that the reason is is that not all studies are pointing towards all cancers the American Heart Association as we all know set keeps telling us how good red wine is for us as well as now you know as far as all the great qualities of beer from a heart perspective so from a cancer perspective unfortunately it's not looking so good you know but there there are the benefits of red wine as you know here with antioxidants there is free our all you know those have you know definitely been studied some some studies come out impressive in fact there was you know as far as a study with regard to the breast cancer and that's one that definitely keeps flip-flopping back and forth one study I think that was done in France showed actually a reduction in risk and everybody's like woohoo okay but really what it comes down to is more and more studies are showing that actually every drink increases your risk of breast cancer so that group specifically now I have to say that there's no safe level of alcohol intake because with especially the group as far as the head and necks esophageal colorectal everything that basically it travels through there is more and more of a connection so rather than drinking red wine now we get to say how about grape juice because it doesn't have you still get the benefits from the antioxidants but alcohol is not in there not as much fun but that is basically again one of those things that I told you before here's the black and the white this is what we know now it's alcohol is not linked to all cancers but these ones that are listed here it is and it it's not I doubt that's going to change as far as sway us in the other direction as far as preventing any of these so you know some pee we'll say oh I'm gonna just stop drinking okay fine I'm not gonna not gonna talk you into keep going but it's again like sugar where are your drinks coming from actually to be honest a lot of our doctors even I wouldn't say that they're gonna push you to stop one reason being is because in fact a lot of my patients will say well I had this conversation with my doctor and he didn't really seem to push either way and I'll tell you really one reason why is because first if you're going through treatment most of the time you'll pull the glass up here and it won't go any further because it either smells terrible or if you take that first step because of the side effect of any meds that you're taking even if you're finished with treatment and you're months down the line those taste buds still aren't they haven't come back yet I'm gonna take it and then you'll you'll take that sip and again it's oh okay forget it but on the other note if you do take that sip usually what comes along with sipping something is that that body language of you're actually relaxing so I've actually been in clinic rooms a lot of times with doctors saying just have that little drink relax you know do something but I usually will say to people I guarantee you won't even get through the whole thing because it's just ends up being a lot different yeah question his doctor says it's safe to drink up to eight ounces of whiskey a day and here you said there's no safe level of alcohol known you provide right this has to do everything with cancer I'm sure it's not gonna affect his it may not affect his diabetes because actually alcohol is processed a little differently the most important thing from for a diabetic that they that he has to remember is when you drink alcohol you need to actually eat a little something or it will bring her blood Sugar's plummeting for cancer there is we we we don't have a safe level of alcohol intake we wouldn't recommend anything specific yeah yeah specifically and specifically for these the the cancer diagnosis listed above especially if somebody has like breast cancer things like that studies are just not supporting us you know as far as to say oh yeah you can have you know a few drinks you know again I just say you know choose wisely you're gonna be in social situations so just pick and choose wisely you know is a drink gonna send you over the edge probably not but you know again it's that whole picture we got to look at okay moving on dairy oh goodness um so there there is a lot of even websites devoted to dairy as a whole what I wanted to do here though is really be fair to kind of everything out there there there's a lot of a lot of very interesting studies a lot of studies that actually have no connections actually most of them but there are some groups that actually there there is a little bit of a little bit or you know sometimes more and more connection and so I did pluck out the ovarian group and then you'll see on the next slide the prostate the interesting thing so like I don't hopefully everybody can read what's on there some studies are suggesting that there's an increased risk of ovarian cancer only from high fat whole whole fat milk as far as our dairy women this interest there this is a very very interesting study this next one is they actually found and this study I think was done in Sweden or something anyway they're a lot of these have been done in Europe there is actually a study showing that if women have a inadequate enzyme to break down galactose which is in dairy their their risk is higher there you can actually get that test it's a blood test and so and that's very interesting and that group particularly they actually ended up testing these women who had these lower enzyme levels and so they actually had a harder time digesting which usually when you have a hard time digesting thinks it's just a little stressor on your body which creates you know again since those cancer cells in the action and I thought I thought that that that was very interesting it's not a common test it's not a common test your doctors not going to say hey let's check let's check that Gault let's check that Gault enzyme but you can certainly have that conversation with them yeah yeah well that wasn't part of the study so I mean if that would help that that would help with specifically the lactose part I don't know what it would have done if it would have you know made a difference interested that's an interesting concept to think about you know as far as if we have if we have a little bit of a help like an enzyme supplement if that you know helps us know unfortunately we don't that's that's another thing let's do a study and then again there's a 32% and increased risk of ovarian cancer even from one or more low-fat or skim skim dairy intake serving sizes for the Nurses Health Study which was a big big study what to be honest that now this the ovarian group is very that's what a lot of these studies have come out as far as that where that connection is breast cancer to be honest not so much there they're not finding a lot of links in fact there even with the ovarian they're really they're still not sure what it is more and more studies have linked the fat content and the amount so I remember about five or so years ago I read through the study that was done in Europe and these women had a very high increased risk but they were drinking seven servings of high-fat dairy or you know eating drinking seven service that's not even recommended the recommendation is two to three so that already kind of set us like okay wait that's too much and then we wouldn't recommend high fat anyway so again we're still learning and the other thing that had nothing to do with this is what this as conventional dairy was it organic would that have made it made a difference so a lot of really you know we don't we don't have a lot of answers but in this group prostate same thing very interesting as far as increased risk with regard to dairy intake but also looking at their again kind of teasing out what cut what part what component of the dairy is it that gets us in trouble there you know is that the fat is it the calcium because again calcium is good for our bones but again we don't want to go crazy with it especially with men so and the other thing too is if you have a high calcium intake that tends to affect your vitamin D and vitamin D is you know it's not in this talk because it's the latest and greatest but vitamin D is we have sufficient levels we have really good blood levels we're finding that that actually protects us and reduces our risk for well a lotta a lot of different cancers and specifically actually even prostate so you know we're finding out these studies and so again dairies getting hit with regard to ovarian and prostate and so you know with these two groups we would recommend you know how how much dairy do you take in and we would just take a look at that and then possibly even you know bring that down a little bit depending on how much but again we as dietitians would look at not only the serving size is that you're having the fat content that you're having but also how many milligrams of calcium you're getting so here's a good list too as far as knowing your calcium intake and as far as and again very very interesting you know as far as dairy typically is is the big one but even orange juice with calcium now you can you know is almost equivalent to a glass of milk and then also just other supplements obviously sardines with bones and then even figs 135 milligrams so you know again it's a big picture and trying to kind of stay middle-of-the-road obviously women or you know trying to get 12 you know 100 to 1500 milligrams this recommendation I should have put on that's specifically for men so that's you know again one of those things too is you know take a look at you know how much stuff am I getting one of the things that I will usually suggest is yes we want to look at food but especially if you're taking a supplement even if it's like your Centrum silver know that there's 200 milligrams of calcium in there and if you're taking any other supplements read the label first and add up everything and then what we also will look look at food so again the big picture but overall you know I'm not cutting dairy out of everybody's diet it's those groups specifically but then other than that it is recommended to to only two to three servings of dairy whether it's milk or yogurt and I actually push more towards yogurt because of the great benefits that you get from the probiotics and you know as far as from you know bone building the protein it can be a fantastic snack you know as far as yogurt just done deal a great protein calorie mix so you know but that's it's not dairy is not known to cause cancer so that's what I'm saying to to be careful for only it's showing up in these two groups it's not coming out otherwise we would be on it and we'd be telling everybody you know stop don't drink it but you know again it's just being smart about your choices so again all the you know the benefits of the calcium the vitamin D probiotics protein the protein looking at the calcium intake also is a big one with colon cancer more and more and more and more studies are coming out showing that calcium plays a really important piece so then the men come to me and say well I'm worried about colon cancer and I heard about prostate cancer or what do I do what I would suggest is again middle-of-the-road I would go back as far as and not you know how old are you and not go above and beyond the thousand to twelve hundred milligrams and because I again most importantly is we're learning with everything we have learned and we continue to learn that more is not better it's it's really getting us in trouble that again is fine most people are on vitamin D supplements not know not necessarily mm-hmm what we would do is again you I'd want to look at how much calcium you're getting first and if you would even need to increase that so you know it also depends some people they're vitamin D sometimes it's a straight vitamin D sometimes it's a calcium and vitamin D sometimes people are taking other things as well so it's lining up all the bottles and trying really trying to figure out where all those things fall okay process to me and red meat um red meat is beef pork pork is not the other white meat and lamb processed meats do include the deli meats your bacon your ham your hot dogs basically processed meats or anything that's preserved with whether it's smoked whether it's salted whether it's used with any other preservatives that's considered a process meat here is what we have from the American Institute for cancer research and the World Cancer Research Foundation that eating more than 18 ounces of red meat per week increases colorectal cancer risk and again your with meats red meats and processing meat specifically that you're going to hear colorectal cancer all the time because that is definitely something that's linked again very spotty connections with other cancer diagnosis specifically so that's why again I had to be fair and I just want to make sure I'm educating them in the right way is let you know what's out there and that is one thing that when you hear about the red meats it is absolutely linked with the colorectal cancer so an eating three and a half ounces of red meat every day increases colorectal cancer risk by 17 percent compared to somebody who doesn't eat red meat at all when it comes to red meat I will say quality makes a difference and as you can see as far as cooking at high temperatures also produces the cancer-causing compounds so the quality of the meat and the cooking method our big-ticket items there the colorectal is all bunched into one but yeah if you have colon cancer you're in that group rectal cancer you're in that group yeah and then eating any amount of processed meat Elza is linked to an increased risk of Carle rectal cancer so again consuming three and a half ounces now three and a half ounces every day is twenty four and a half ounces per week so with the red meat there at least trying to pull us down to 18 now when I'm in my office with somebody and I throw out the 18 they go wow that's a lot yeah for here in California a lot of times it is a lot but I know people who live in the Midwest that's not a lot the average American an average from coast-to-coast be fair eats thirty five ounces of red meat a week is your risk go down yes and it also goes down if you eat more vegetables as far as process yes isn't that funny yeah so there we have it there's the red meat thing and they process meat so again we're not a hundred percent sure about what component of the meat gets us in trouble is it the fat because it is a saturated fat is it the carcinogens that are created when it's cooked at high temperature barbecuing yeah all that stuff so you know again we're learning more not fast enough but we're doing it the American Institute for cancer research has estimated that 45% of colorectal case cancer cases could be prevented also a lot if we ate more fiber rich food plant-based foods less meat drink less alcohol moved more and stayed Li isn't that what everybody's grandma used to tell them I mean it's honestly it comes down like full circle we kind of know what we should be doing but the 45 percent is about sixty four thousand cases in the u.s. so again it's not that I'm up here saying toss this toss that get rid of the red meat again what I want you to do is the same challenge as I'm going to throw out that I did with the sugar go home and figure out what your typical consumption is how many ounces cooked of red meat beef pork and lamb do you eat in a week roughly what's your what about your processed meat and yes people say oh gosh she's gonna get rid of my turkey sandwich again there's there's options to that again not they're not sure is that the the fat is it the preservatives we're kind of you know we pretty much know that nitrites nitrates and nitrites aren't good for us it's something that we used a long time ago that helped us reduce food borne illnesses and now we don't really need them we did we know that but again that preservation that extra salt what exactly is the problem we're trying to get a grasp on so taking a look at the overall thing is you know how much are we eating and how are we preparing it yeah thank you yes so um a couple things on grilling because again we get that question a lot throw stuff fruits and vegetables on there I know don't roll your eyes at me but really it's one of those things that also can increase your intake of fruits and vegetables adds a great flavor to whatever else you're grilling and does not create that carcinogen that the meats do marinating the meat even for 30 minutes before you put it on the grill what it does is it it's protecting it they again are trying to figure out if it's if there's an acid in there if it's like vinegar or something like that is it is it creating some sort of a barrier you know obviously other things like you know trimming visible fat which we know if it drips into the fire the fire you know flares up partially pre-cooking again people roll their eyes at me but you can partially you can pre cook it a little bit in the oven and finish it off on the grill which is actually one of the most common recommendations with regard to that and then as far as low and slow so usually people throw stuff on the barbecue the flames go up you char it a little bit you get you want those lines on there and and and that's actually not we don't actually want it necessarily right over the flame because again once that flank once that charred but that charring happens that's when where those carcinogens are so all those types of things going low and slow is going to be better that's okay it doesn't create the same thing yeah yeah I know you'd say it's still black to me but you know but no it's those carcinogens are not created with fruits and vegetables it has a lot more to do with the protein and the fat in the meat so and it is it's not only red meat it's chicken and fish so be careful as far as grilling those too so okay good moving on sorry I apologize if I'm going fast but we still have kind of what and I wanted to make sure I covered all the important things um coffee and caffeine here's a funny thing and it is actually kind of funny they keep picking on coffee they keep trying to study coffee trying to find something wrong with it and then every time they study it now it helps prevent Alzheimer's it helps prevent Parkinson's as far as just looking at you know the the antioxidants in it it used to be risk with a possible you know pancreatic kidney cancer not anymore as far as that's not you know it's really unlikely that that's that's the problem one of the things though as far as coffee and I'll throw T's in there too they have you know just a lot of antioxidant kind of phytochemical positive properties to them I think one of the things that's interesting that again we need to keep in mind is what the coffees and teas are tied with and that's caffeine caffeine is one of those things like table sugar or alcohol our bodies do not need it this needs it more than anything else I think but our systems can function perfectly fine without caffeine so again more and more say there's actually several studies going on right now having to do with caffeine specifically and cancer but the interesting thing as far as specifically with coffee is they're actually thinking that it may even lower the risk of you know certain cancers liver colorectal there you go again it's like why does coffee get a positive note and alcohol doesn't but you know again looking at these components pancreatic bladder you know a lot of these very interesting another study came out having to do with prostate and look at this the study for those who consumed more than 6 cups of coffee a day and that was decaf or caffeinated had a 50% lower risk of developing advanced prostate cancer that I I was like I want to read through that study because that again very like you're kidding me again even with breast cancer they looked at 66 thousand women showing a fifty fifty seven percent reduction with five cups of coffee so there are you know again some health benefits to coffee but I am going to also put in and and and having to do with as far as some of these things may even reduce the risk of stage two type type 2 diabetes it can also increase your transit time as far as your GI tract one thing that I see a lot is when people are diagnosed with cancer they again people are telling them they're reading that and then they come to me and say well I ice and I stop drinking coffee and did it uh and then we talk a little bit more and then the trouble comes out of they're constipated and that's usually where I chime in and say can we add the coffee back and at what I said just one cup let's just try it and boom fixed and it's just one cup look at these studies so again I'm not I still I'm not comfortable with saying join the five cup coffee club I'm will still a little weary about that but one to two cups a day the studies have also shown is actually where you reap the benefits of the antioxidants in the coffee if if you're sensitive to caffeine if you you know the whole caffeine thing go decaf go regular whatever with the process now of decaffeinated they've actually it's really superb meaning that they've fine-tuned it so that they take the caffeine out but they retain the nutrients the antioxidant whereas before we used to lose all that stuff with decaffeination um so again one to two cups a day perfectly fine we'll see about the five cup thing but obviously some negative side effects you know again it and and there are some negative side effects heart studies have shown obviously if you're drinking ten cups a day a lot of caffeine for the little pumper it obviously anxiety insomnia headaches all that kind of stuff nervousness if we haven't done it to ourselves I'm sure we know somebody who you know drinks a lot of it of caffeine in general so again anywhere from two to four cups even most people tolerate well here's a very interesting thing as far as the caffeine content that's also a little tricky even with drip coffee because it totally depends on exactly you know the process it can be from you know 100 to 200 milligrams but I usually like to keep people around that 300 milligram which you know again even that's where the two cup kind of comes into play here but everything even from now Mountain Dew usually is very interesting to people because they're like oh I only get 55 milligrams with that so yeah and a lot of sugar so again take a step back and think where's my caffeine coming from yes please include your dark chocolate or chocolate in general because whether it's 10 or 30 milligrams it counts so keep adding it up yeah Oh green tea there those studies are coming out a little bit well kind of like the coffee the latest coffee one is some green teas studies are coming out as you can drink the six cups a day but again be careful green tea is naturally caffeinated so that's when people but really so when you're going and you're shopping for green tea depending again look at how often you drink it if you're drinking it all throughout the day okay I'm not gonna I'm not you know at a point where I can pull people back our recommendation right now isn't you know up to four cups but again the caffeine if you're drinking it after noon and you're wondering why you're only sleeping so many hours go for decaf you're still going to get the benefits but nothing absolutely absolutely a lot great antioxidants fantastic nutrients in it yeah absolutely yes yes definitely yeah all decaf teas and coffees have a little bit and again it's hard to know exactly how much but sometimes it can be anywhere it's kind of like chocolate it can range anywhere from as low as 10 milligrams to sometimes thirty in a decaf yeah they can't take it all out but but they're there get they get close for antioxidants again here's a here's an interesting one we all you know as far as protecting us with the use of antioxidants it is very controversial a lot of different studies sometimes swaying us in one direction and sometimes not this is again where we will look at the big picture you know I've had people who come in with 20 different things and I'll keep a lot of them but to say no no no and no and this is why specifically the radiation gets us as far as a little tricky because basically the antioxidants are working against the radiation what we mean by using antioxidants during radiation and actually chemotherapy is we don't want people mega dosing so if you're going a little bit higher like say with vitamin C if you're taking 500 milligrams I'm not going to touch that for taking 2,000 I am going to touch that and I'm going to highly suggest that you don't do that yeah as far as what it does is it you know kind of goes antioxidants work in the ways it goes in and it takes kind of what we all sure have read as far as free radicals you know kind of the garbage it cleans up garbage and that's where some things have gotten into us into trouble as far as then people thinking oh well the antioxidants are going to go and notice the cancer cells and go swipe those and leave the healthy cells and everything's going to be fine what a lot of these studies though have shown is it may give the cancer cells especially in these high doses it may give them more power it may be protecting them as well as the healthy cells so it's a protector it's a protector for for cells it's kind of a cleaner so to speak and as far as you know again been touted to help our immune systems and and things like that so that essentially is basically what antioxidants do but again that's why with regard even with chemotherapy here are some agents that actually as far as the work you know high doses are interfering with a lot of these meds so like be sulfa NBC and you carboplatin cytoxan cisplatin I mean these are really these are popular these are popular chemotherapy drugs so again it's be cautious be cautious for sure because studies have definitely been showing us otherwise antioxidants particularly big one big one with beta-carotene increasing lung cancer is specifically with smokers well if I if if you're smart enough to tell me that you're a smoker I will my one of my first questions will be are you taking bit of carotene because I don't want to see it it's that was a very interesting study as well as vitamin E again some studies show a protective effect of chemo related side effects while others show a tumor protective effect review concludes that antioxidant supplement should not be used during cancer treatment and there that's where our controversy is is it helping side effects is it helping the tumor and sometimes these studies come out and that's where I don't want to play I am NOT going to be playing that game if any study has come out with you know any supplement as far as being a possible tumor protector and you come to me with anything like that I'm going to say let's move on I say yes it has antioxidant properties yeah because it's a berry not necessarily if you're taking an extract my question is is what does that extract what's the power of it how many you know what is how is it a double strength triple you know like the extracts get a little fuzzy because the other thing about because the other thing about supplements is they're not regulated so I'm going to cross my fingers that you're getting what it says you're getting not necessarily and that's the thing too is if you're drinking you know these juices if you're eating blueberries don't don't worry about that it's when we're talking about antioxidants and supplementing and we're talking about popping pills and and extracts and powders and things like that not not food-related vitamin C's another one everybody knows good ol Linus Pauling and he's actually you know done studies years ago with regard to you know 10 grams a day from an IV Mayo Clinic went ahead and basically shot that down I have actually had people who have gone to local clinics and have that had that IV therapy unfortunately the three people who I know have done that didn't make it so that is one thing that kind of histone me well that didn't really cure them they tried and again that was one of the things that their doctors knew they were on board the doc said okay I said well yeah I mean it is what it is you're gonna do it or you're not whether we tell you to and so both the doc and I were on board and so basically you know the doctor said you do you know if that's what you want to do we'll just watch you know and go through treatment and we'll just continue to see how how you respond to treatment so he was very very you know just it is what it is you're going to do what you're going to do and and actually pretty supportive with regard to that unfortunately it just didn't work for them so and again currently the IV vitamin C treatment is being continued to be investigated if I knew a quick trick out there I would certainly share it here's one as far as high vitamin C I know we're a fast almost high vitamin C intake from food whoo there we are has been correlated with decreased incidence of cancer of the mouth the throat vocal cords esophagus stomach colorectal and lung there we have it the power of food full circle very interesting as you can see here in some of these other studies 205 milligrams of vitamin C from food it's not a big deal you know it's not a thousand or you know as far as supplement even here this vitamin C supplementation 500 milligrams a day for an average of eight years had no significant effect on total cancer or site-specific cancers seafood is like what's in an orange that's okay that's all right that just led me in there so it can't so here's the thing about vitamin C that I really really like to hit home with when you even take your your 500 milligrams of vitamin C you're not absorbing at all sorry our bodies can actually only absorb anywhere between 100 and 200 they think that 200 is by far our max and after than that it goes through and we end up urinating it out so because it's a water-soluble vitamin one of the best things to do is you can see here from this list like an orange a 70 so is a Kiwi orange juice strawberries cooked broccoli see people and there's another thing about there's a funny thing here cooked cook Brock not raw cooked broccoli has actually I think robbed broccoli is a little less yeah believe it or not no no it's like a couple of milligrams but nonetheless it's at least I think so I'm pretty sure oh one of the things that I thought of right and I should have added it is even guava for those people who like guava a half a cup of guava 188 milligrams boom right there so one of the best ways to get in your vitamin C and if you take 500 okay fine whatever there it's going to be in your multi it's going to be in whatever but it's to eat it all throughout the day which most people do anyway so if you have a fruit in the morning most likely it's going to have some sort of vitamin C in there if you have even red bell pepper as part of your salad or whatever at lunch and then if you have say spaghetti sauce with tomatoes for dinner there's a great vitamin C all those little pit stops that you get that's the greatest way for our bodies to absorb the vitamin C a little bit a little bit a little bit a little bit okay the big thing about supplementing this 2,000 milligrams is our safe upper limit after that it's not uncommon for people to get diarrhea upset stomach that kind of thing to nausea that's really the big one that people end up dealing with soy put it in a nutshell so used to get such a bad rap has for years and years and years and more and more studies are coming out saying yes we can eat soy yes breast cancer patients can eat soy however we want you to eat soy food whole soy food not taking soy protein powder not eating those meatless chicken nuggets not eating tofurkey you know eating some hole considered whole soy foods like things like tofu tempeh miso soy milk soy nuts those are considered the least processed soy milk yes it is processed because you got to get it from the bean to the milk but again those have those don't have these you know huge amount of this natural estrogen these are very basic it's this this estrogen like effect so to speak that the the soy has is to be honest not not even on the radar when you're sticking to foods so that's the big-ticket item if you are a breast cancer survivor like estrogen receptor-positive it's not something i would say oh yeah yeah yeah well hey start you know digging in there no no no I'm not going to say necessarily to add it in if you don't eat it or you don't like it but again if you're out to a Chinese restaurant and somebody gets tofu stir-fry and it comes around on the little dolly that you know the little lazy susan and you want to have some have some and don't worry about it but again stay away from the soy that processed soy foods again they're processed anyway so they shouldn't be on our list I mean highly processed meaning the the fake meat products out there soy milk is considered a whole soy food yeah one of the things and some people say well how do you exactly know the difference the ingredient list when the first ingredient says concentrated soy protein which is exactly what it says on the fake chicken nuggets that's where you want to pass you want to stick to the real food cleanses my okay I'll keep this brief again one of the things is that cleanses can rid my body of toxins and can you know help me you know recover from chemotherapy and get the chemicals out completely unfounded by research again I've seen I've hurt you know people who oh yeah I feel so much better and that kind of thing it all comes down to first of all I I won't recommend it I don't think any of our doctors will recommend it our bodies will naturally remove waste if you are and you feel like you're not most likely you're constipated and so you need to probably eat more fiber fruits and vegetables whole grains and look at your fluid intake I have actually seen some very very serious detriment done by cleanses with people and it's very very scary so some of the things definitely I mean just to look for especially if it's several days or weeks yowsa it's very dehydrating it can actually completely throw off your electrolytes dizziness nausea vomiting diarrhea all of those a couple things also about actually cleanses this has enough it's not like an enema cleanses actually can send up to 60 up to so anywhere not uncommon to have a couple liters of fluid being pushed through you but some extreme cases are up to 60 liters of fluid getting pumped through you cleansing you very debilitating that will completely that could do some serious harm so I mean serious harm it can obviously as you can see here Benny even if they use certain herbs and even with the the amount of fluid that's used in certain cleanses can cause organ damage so be that's my real big one that I like to throw in there because I'm not a fan so look at your diet get those fresh Whole Foods in decrease processed foods look at your fluid intake and here are some great websites for complementary and alternative things legitimate websites I will tell you like ConsumerLab you actually have to be a member and it's 19 dollars a year or something I don't know I forget I just charged it to the card um but a great website though in fact that's one of the things they ConsumerLab pulls things off the shelf and here's an interesting thing about multivitamins is they don't need to be expensive and a lot of the multis the basic that's a key word basic multivitamin that's sold at Costco for the Kirkland brand CVS Walgreens centrum those are all really good products meaning they are not contaminated and they say what they they have what they say they have in them and then a couple other things like office of dietary supplements is free so you can look up in there and they do a really good job of updating things like that - so that's it oh I'm sorry yeah yeah various can help prevent cancer like broccoli bluebirds yeah no it's actually oh sure sorry repeat the question um if the cruciferous vegetables and blueberries actually do have anti-cancer properties yes the in fact they just well not just I guess it was over a year ago did a study on broccolini and that actually broccolini you know the little the little broccoli there it's like a long stem and it has the sprouts are kind of smaller it's like a miniature version of broccoli those actually have there was a study with regard to gastric cancer so stomach cancer specifically and they showed an incredible risk reduction with broccolini specifically my question was what about broccoli but anyway they again a lot of different effects blueberries yes now that's the other thing is what I want people to do is blueberries get a lot of press pomegranate gets a lot of press what I want people to do again is just think colors it's even though blueberries are great it doesn't mean that you need to eat like a pound of them or tenth you know vary your diet keep your diet varied what's happening with some of these other things like the acai berry or a acai acai everybody calls it something different but the acai berry is it's it's it's a berry it's the fruit it's just not from our region and so it's you know it's like some of these other like the mangosteen there are these it's just a fruit with these great properties so you can certainly work them into your diet but you know again I'm not a huge fan of going crazy or buying these expensive juices and things like that think of colors that's the thing to bring home is if you don't like broccoli or if broccoli doesn't like you you don't need to suffer through that either again find you no other cruciferous find other things in that family find other green things keep that varied diet absolutely good question yeah you know that's another good question so that question was what about additives to food like msg and things like that yes again we're learning more and more about those types of things there are some links to some additives it just you know again you know kind of depends on what the you know one of the things again that I like to encourage people is when you're dealing with a whole food you're not going to be getting an ingredient list that's forever long or things that you can't pronounce so that is one way of avoiding those things those additives and things like that but the American Cancer Society their website actually has a really good list of kind of all things like the alcohol the sugar the food additives again their take is you know I mean studies still need to be done on certain things but you know a lot of it is why do we need the food additives and gearing people more towards the whole food right the back part of the barbecue meat it's not good for you right coffee is also charged very much charge and if you take French roast it is very very much is it yes is in connection absolutely yes that is the fact yeah so that so you know the difference between the the blackness and the the roasting of coffee versus the charring of me it absolutely it's the connection that happened with the carcinogens are created when the flame hits the protein the animal protein so is between it the the protein fat it could be both again not exactly sure you know which component of it but that's the main thing yeah it well the vegetables if you char vegetables it doesn't that the carcinogens aren't there I mean I just prefer I don't want to eat charred vegetables but you know but again they're not going to be it's not gonna be the cancer-causing component that you get from the meats yeah yeah okay what did you chop fish same thing you don't want to do it I know so you just you know again being careful with and a lot of it is depending on your grill and if you can vary the flame I know it gets complicated yeah and it a lot of it depends well yeah like oh thank you um as far as if you buy I like commercially packaged or orange juice that you you're not getting in the nutrients a lot of it has to do with when it was packaged and also like the transit time if it ever dropped in temperature that kind of absolutely you can easily lose nutrients with that how old it is that type of thing I mean you can't go fresh is best if you couldn't squeeze your own but you're still going to get great benefits from some you know from the juice that's made again watch the calories yeah thank you thank you", "vHpBhRFGO60": "good afternoon everyone thank you for joining us today this webinar series was made possible in part to the generosity of 10 tech

Louis I've been in the Washington DC area since 2011 and ever since I learned about kidney disease and their diet restrictions I've just been really interested in helping people with that especially with my um with my nephew only having one kidney since he's been born but enough about that let's just jump right in so what is protein I mean like you hear your dietician talking about all the time you hear your nephrologist talking about as it's protein protein protein but really what is protein I mean protein comes from the food that we eat it's one of the three essential building blocks necessary for our life the other two are fats and carbohydrates and these are all macronutrients and these are like fancy words but basically a macronutrient is what's going to give us our energy we measure our energy in the form of calories and so protein gives us calories fat gives us calories and carbohydrates give us calories together these all build together to make up our like our food supplies so you're eating like a steak or some pasta these are all going to have these different macronutrients in there so protein is most commonly known for building and repairing our muscles when we think about our muscles we really mainly just kind of think about like our skeletal muscles the muscles like our biceps or our triceps or our quads or our calves and these muscles that are moving our bodies but those other muscles are going to be our organs so your heart your meet your liver these are all these are all muscles in linear music and your body needs to be repairing itself it's going to be repairing it with protein protein also plays an important role in all of our body functions not only does it help build and repair muscles it also like aids in our digestion in metabolism so like how much energy our body is using and it also helps produce antibodies that helps fight infection so when you're sick your mom's chicken noodle soup really was medicine you know because you really do need that um that protein to help with just okay so what is protein protein is actually a long chain of amino acids and amino acids are just some fancy you know molecules that get linked together in different formations and become protein when you break when you digest protein it gets broken back down into these amino acids our body or there's 20 amino acids out in all of our food supply and our body is able to make all of these but 9 these nine amino acids are called our essential amino acids and you have to get these essential amino acids the missing nine that our body can't make from food amino acids so protein is helping us build and repair our muscles amino acids are also used in forming hormones or enzymes and neurotransmitters which are basically the signals that our brain tells our body and like how our brain communicates with our body and you can find protein in both animal and plant sources so complete proteins what is a complete protein basically a complete protein is going to be a food source that's going to contain all nine amino acids all those nine essential amino acids that our body is not able to make is going to be contained in those complete proteins your the list of the different meats 9 essential amino acids the only time you're ever going to need to know this is when you're taking a test to become a dietitian the where can you find amino acid are complete proteins you're going to be found in your red meats your whole which is like chicken or which is like your beef your pork your lamb goat you're going to find it in your poultry which is your chicken your turkey your duck fish eggs dairy so most mainly you're going to find your easy protein and meat sources but also soy and that grain quinoa that everybody's been talking about are also considered complete proteins research you hear your dietitian talking about well we want to eat animal protein animal protein all the you know because it's a complete protein it's also shown that people on dialysis actually have an increased benefit from eating protein that comes from animals it's just an animal protein is better absorbed and better used by our body the same thing with iron the iron that you get from animals is actually better used and better absorbed by our body so your dietitian is going to be right even here I use this term like eat more high biological value protein such as means protein coming from an animal and when you're on dialysis your proteins are actually higher than the average American or the average person and it's because of two main reasons number one when you're on dialysis it's wonderful it removes all the waste build-up but it's also going to remove some of your protein in your blood so you will need to eat a little bit more protein because of that but the main reason is because your body dialysis is putting stress on your body's putting stress on all on your heart on your blood vessels on everything because it's an active actively removing these wastes those Abused waste products so your body is under stress when your body is under stress your body needs more protein and so thus your protein needs are higher the recommended amount of protein for people on dialysis is a little bit higher it's higher than the average American like I said on average people should be eating about 0.8 grams of protein per kilo but when you're on dialysis we want you to eat more so that's 1.2 to 1.4 grams of protein per kilo and most people on dialysis actually know what they're keeping with their weight is in kilos because that's your dry weight so think about it this right here to spine hmm saying that somebody who is about 70 kilos or that's about 154 pounds needs to have about 85 to 100 grams of protein per day and 60 to 70 percent of that or nine ounces need to be an animal source protein so that's about six or seven ounces of meat about two eggs and a half a cup of milk and I know that milk is one of those on that list of foods that you're not really supposed to be eating but I do believe that the recommendations are still that you can have about a half a cup of dairy a day but use also getting protein from other sources so from plants you can get your your protein from plant sources as well and [Applause] the chance like we were talking about don't have all nine essential amino acids besides the soy and the quinoa so that means you're going to have to eat them in combination you're gonna need to eat plant a with plant B because that's going to provide you with all different with all nine essential amino acids and when they're paired together that's called a complementary protein a lot of people who are vegetarian or vegan need to make sure that they're really they're meeting their protein needs because they are eating and then making sure that they're eating these different types of proteins together really what we're looking at you should be eating legumes or being with grains so beans have a certain type of amino acid and grains have different amino acids and paired together they're going to give you all nine amino acids so if you want to eat beans with grains or beans with nuts or beans with seeds that's going to make sure that you're getting all nine essential amino acids for the net meal so they just need to be in in combination throughout the day they don't have to be at the exact same meal but throughout the day if you're going to eat means we need to eat some rice or some pasta or some bread to make sure that you're getting all nine essential amino acids I know you're probably thinking to me like oh my goodness what is this lady talking about she is talking about beans and beans are all too big there's no list you should not be eating beans but actually I like to think about but you can eat a more vegetarian lifestyle but you should be doing it like a per meal or maybe once a once a like once a day or maybe even just choosing a day to not eat any meat but what you're going to do is the way that you can do this is by choosing like let's say you want to go and have like some a burrito and you want to have like a black bean burrito as long as you're doing beans and rice without the chicken that's okay but what we want to do is make sure that you're not doing being rice and chicken because that's going to give you too much potassium and too much phosphorus in that meal but eating a more vegetarian myself that will help you with you know cholesterol levels and energy levels and weight by adding and also with constipation I mean like be into a lot of nice good soluble and insoluble fiber and that can help with your bowel movements but I think a good rule of thumb is if you're going to eat some beans don't eat any meat and that's a meal and I mean I can't stress this enough always talk to your dietitian about doing something like this because let's say your potassium levels are a little bit too high or your phosphorus levels are a little bit too high I don't know what your levels are but your your dietitian does and you can sit down and say hey you know I really want to make sure that I'm getting enough protein but I also want to you know start eating a little bit more on a vegetarian style lifestyle how can we do this together and your dietitian I'm sure has a whole bunch of wonderful great ideas to make that happen but when in doubt ask your dietitians this is a nice little Alma spy just kinda shows you about the potassium in different foods right so we always talk about like you know eat all this meat meat meat meat fun you need to limit your beans or your lentils or your nuts because it has so much potassium in it that's kind of where I got that rule of thumb you know eating beans beans don't need any meat a student if you look at this you can have a half a cup of beans like black beans is about 300 milligrams of potassium where is you know three ounces of like a beef roast is even higher again to tastin is 320 milligrams three ounces of chicken like a chicken breast is about 220 which is a great amount of potassium that's that's like the perfect the second you know the golden is standard and you can always like figure out how much 3 ounces is if you look at your palm the palm of your hand is about 3 ounces so when in doubt look at your hand and say ok well that's about 3 ounces so I'm okay with there and 3 ounces of chicken is about 21 grams of protein so there's a lot of protein to be had out there the next you always you know when you're a dietitian comes around every month to give you your lab she's talking to you about your protein levels but she's showing you a number and it's called albumin and albumin is the number that we we renal dietitians really like to talk about it's but what is albumin it's a protein that we get that our liver makes from the food that we eat I like to think about our the albumin as like our body's mailman it's out there delivering all the necessary nutrients like vitamins and minerals and energy and hormones and different like drugs that your doctor has prescribed to you throughout your body so it's out there doing all these important functions but also not only is it delivering all these things it's also helping keep the fluid in your blood so that way it's able to be removed during dialysis it's also helping you fight infection so there's a reason why your your dietitian is you know talking about humans so much it's also hard to keep your albumin at that you know magic number that she's wanting me to keep it at which is a level of four and how human is kind of sickle I always like to say if you look at it the wrong way it's going to go down but it can be affected negatively so it can go down if you have an active infection if you have inflammation I'm not talking about like swelling when I'm talking about inflammation when I'm talking about like inflammation is when your body is under stress which dialysis makes your body under stress so your body is always inflamed when you're on dialysis so inflammation make sure albumin lower swelling or edema when you have too much fluid on and your feet and ankles start to like puff up that can lower your albumin when you have too much fluid and it sits on your lung that's going to lower your element or anytime you take a trip into that hospital number one your body is under stress you might have an infection you might have too much fluid there's a whole lot of reasons your recent hospitalization is going to make your protein low your albumin low and not also the food maybe not be the greatest when you're in the hospital or you're feeling sick and you don't want to eat enough you know there's all these holes all these reasons why your protein might be lower doing for these reasons and these may not be what sound alike they are like a food issue like I mean infection well how can you do anything about that with food but when you're not feeling well a lot of times you don't eat as much and when you're not eating as much that will also lower your I'll demon level too so again back um you know grandma's chicken soup lets you know when you're in down when you're on dialysis you get that wonderful little report card that your dietitian comes around with you and every month they're checking your labs or reminding you to do you know to take your binders and to avoid tomatoes and potatoes and they always are probably saying oh we will need you to eat some more protein eat some more protein because your ailment is a little bit low we want you to be at a goal of four or higher there is a reason for that there's one lot of research out there showing that people on dialysis who have an albumin level under four have higher risk of death and have more hospitalizations so if your albumin is 4 or higher there is a lower risk of death and fewer hospitalizations which I mean that's always a really good thing um we talked a little bit and a few slides ago about what can make your protein go down or that albumin number go down and one of them looks like the edema or the swelling or the fluid on your lungs fluid really your albumin can be diluted dilutional and if you have too much fluid that's going to make your protein level or your albumin level lower so it's important so important especially in these hot summer months it's already getting hot here in DC I mean like I think the humidity is super hot and I know that the folks here are really wanting to drink more because they're feeling really dehydrated but it's really important to follow your fluid restrictions so that way the fluid doesn't leak out of your of your blood vessels I was talking about how like albumin helps keep the fluid in your blood vessels and when the fluid is in your blood vessels or then it's easier for the dialysis machine to remove that fluid because your blood is going into the dialysis machine and then they're using a mechanism called ultra filtration that's removing the fluid from from your blood and then it goes back in to your body and your body will repopulate the blood with more fluid and then throughout that three to four hour time circle circuit you're able to remove you know 2 to 5 liters of fluid per treatment the more fluid you remove the heart of that machine has to work and the harder it pulls on your heart and it puts an extra strain on your heart so having less fluid on following that fluid restriction is really important for multiple reasons not only lowering your keeping your protein level nice and high we don't want what we don't want to happen is that fluid to go into your third space in third space I mean you probably have heard your doctor or your dietitian talking about it it just means that space that's in between the blood vessels and your cells and that's when you notice like when you look at your feet and they're all swollen and if you can even push down on it and kind of leave that divot that's the fluid in your third space and your the dialysis machine is not able to remove that but if your albumin is nice and high and your protein that's nice and high you're able to it's going to keep that fluid in your blood vessels and you'll be able to remove it easier again I'm talking a lot about fluid the fluid is so very important when it comes to protein and so very important when it comes to your health too much fluid can cause a lot of problems some of these problems are flying around your feet and ankles it can also cause fluid to go into your lungs or sit on your lungs and could possibly end up leading it you know hard for you to breathe making air or you could even get pneumonia also it can start too much fluid can stretch out your heart you have this extra volume of blood and so now your heart has to work harder to move it through your blood vessels and it's not like it's working harder and getting stronger it's actually getting stretched out like a stretched out balloon and it becomes weak and floppy and so this makes it harder for your heart to work makes it harder for you to get rid of the fluid and also continues to make her or your protein or your albumin look you can also put extra stress on your body because now the Machine the dialysis machine is having to pull the more fluid off harder and it's making more strain on your heart which is also going to lead to could lead to all sorts of different things not only like hospitalization so and then too much fluid makes your protein low and then this whole little cycle if your protein is low the fluids going to leak out of your blood vessels and it's going to go into your third space and it's just this is little cycles so cutting back on that fluid and making sure you recognize trying to only hit that 32 ounces of fluid per day is a really important goal really but you your dietician is sitting there telling you eat more protein eat more protein eat more protein how do you do that how can you make your your albumin levels higher you're like I'm eating protein at every meal I you know I'm not hungry I can't eat any more protein how many eggs do you want me to eat a day oh my goodness you know what what can I do the next few slides and actually the rest of this presentation is going to really be about tips for boosting your albumin levels because I think it's really important to understand what it is but really let's talk about real life let's do you know how can we make this happen first and foremost back to this fluid drink 32 ounces of fluid or less a day and a fluid is not just water it's soda its juice it is tea its coffee its soup it's ice its jello if it's ice cream and popsicles and ice um anything that is liquid at room temperature it's going to be considered a fluid summertime is the hardest time because it is hot and humid and people want to drink more you really got to figure out what works best for you some people like to drink a just fill up a 32 ounce glass and they know that that's what they get to drink all day long some people like to have 4 8 ounce glasses and no and so they feel like they get to go back but that's whatever is your personal preference also eating a protein source at every meal it doesn't have to be an animal protein source we just learned that like beans and rice together make a complete protein so like I said if you want to eat beans go ahead and eat those beans don't eat a piece of like meat at the same time though but make sure you're always having a protein source at every meal and this sounds kind of crazy eat a bedtime snack you know a lot of times we keep on hearing about like oh my goodness you shouldn't eat when you go to bed you know all these things and if you have acid reflux eating a bedtime snack is maybe not the best choice but I'm not trying to say like you a big meal I'm talking about an apple or a half of a sandwich it doesn't have to be a protein you know heavy meal it's like an apple an apple has very little as any protein in it but it's still going to give us energy and the reason having a snack right before bedtime is a really good thing is it's been shown that when you're on dialysis your liver which is actually storing your energy only stores about half the amount of energy then some than an average person so you think about it you go to you're using energy all of the time when you are eating and you have food in your stomach like right after lunch which is kind of basically now your body has an instant source of food it's the food that you're eating is the food that you're digesting but your body's not going to use all of that food and it's going to store the rest of that in our liver in a form of energy called glycogen but what happens is when you are on dialysis your body's only able to store about half the amount of glycogen so you go to bed and you're not eating when you're asleep obviously so your body has to use your energy stores halfway through the night you have used up all the stored energy or that glycogen and now your body needs to have more energy to breathe to function to roll over to do any for your heart to keep on breathing or beating all of these things take energy takes calories takes you know you know sugar or glucose if you eat a bedtime snack then your body will use that energy at the first half of the night the second half of the night so you're going to use your energy stores in your liver and then you wake up and you eat you know a bowl of oatmeal or something and then BAM now you've saved all your energy and what happens is because like I said you know like protein is a macronutrient way back in the first slide it's giving us calories well your body is going to use those calories it's going to say oh I don't have anymore the stored energy I'm going to use something that's quick and easy when it'd be great if it was using our fats but it's not that takes a long time for it to break down takes a lot of energy it's going to take your protein in the form of albumin and it's going to use that to sustain you overnight so eating a bedtime snack I can't talk about it enough it's so great another thing who knew but Brazil nut Brazil nuts are really really really super high in an antioxidant called selenium selenium actually helps to fight the type of inflammation that lowers your albumin levels so one Brazil nut a day not two not three one Brazil nut a day as shown that you can't that will raise your albumin levels from a 3.5 to a four within like six months so you can go and find just the Brazil nuts I'm not talking about walnuts or peanuts or cashews or anything like that because they don't have the selenium content that these Brazil nuts do it's the selenium in these growers mill nuts that are going to help raise your elbow and cause it's going to lower that inflammation you don't want to eat too many just one a day because you don't want to mess with your potassium and phosphorus because those are always very important to make sure that they are within range for one Brazil not a day that's an easy quick fix also let's say you just got out of a hospital and you don't have much of an appetite or you just you know you've got these taste changes going on you just don't really want to eat anything and it's just you don't feel like eating and so you're not getting enough calories you're not getting enough protein all of this well if you don't have much of an appetite I always think a nice good little trick is to have like some chicken salad or tuna salad or egg salad in your refrigerator and every time you walk by that refrigerator you get like a a wheat thin or a little cracker that doesn't have any added phosphorus and you dip it in there and you take you eat a little bit if you walk back and forth in front of your in front of your refrigerator like 10 times a day that's like a half a cup and that's going to give you at least 20 grams of protein right there and some calories that will help boost up that level it's just a trick for everybody who you know is able to eat three meals a day and you know eat snacks no this is for somebody who really just doesn't have an appetite and just doesn't know what to do and you know your dietician is saying oh my goodness I need to eat more I need you to eat more well this is a great way of making that happen and then there's the protein powders and protein bars protein supplements we are all very very fortunate right now that we live in this world of everybody thinking that they need more protein members than they do that means we've got a whole bunch of different protein powders and bars to choose from some taste better some don't you know but now you get to make those choice also now with the new food label laws they're trying to you have to have potassium listed so some protein bars have already started doing that I think potassium doesn't have to be listed until 2020 on the food label I could be wrong but it's not it's not 100% yet so what you want to do is make sure that you're finding a protein bar or protein powder that has substance' listed so that way you know that you're not getting too much potassium also talking with your dietitian you know saying hey I found this in the grocery store you know what do you think but of course we are going to talk about these different protein supplements now so when choosing your protein supplement what you want to do is make sure you read the label first I can't as you know enough and talk about reading those labels you're looking for a protein supplement that has a least 10 grams of protein in it and also is lower in potassium your goals should be a protein supplement that's under 200 milligrams of potassium so certainly stay away from anything that has over 350 milligrams of potassium and again some some protein supplements do list the amount of potassium on there some don't on their labels right here these protein supplements these do list potassium on the label I've starred the different drinks and bars that have over 300 milligrams of potassium so the muscle milk protein powder has over 300 milligrams of potassium but the muscle milk low calorie protein powder is actually under 300 milligrams don't barge Larabars all these different types of bars but again when in doubt go to your grocery store take a picture of it and show it to your dietitian that I think is the best way to do it you and your dietitian working together can find the best fit for you again here are some just some snacks that aren't like protein bars Special K high-protein cereal you know like you can when you're on dialysis I know some dialysis units actually allow people to eat in there because these would be a great thing to bring with you if you know just as a little snack or something that you can just carry in your purse of the Special K proteins cereal 14 grams that's and a half a cup and it only has 125 milligrams of potassium that's that's fantastic Takashi go lean with 9 grams what you really want to do is making sure that you're getting the most protein for your bang with the least amount of potassium and again staying away from anything that has this over 350 really anything over 300 you kind of want to avoid if it's going to be something you're in to be eating a lot of again be aware of any protein supplement but does not lift the potassium content a good rule of thumb if the protein supplement is not listing the potassium on the label and it's made with peanuts or any type of nut or seed as a first or second or third ingredient it could very well be high in potassium because nuts as you've seen on previous slides are actually pretty high in potassium so that's a good to avoid any of those protein supplements if they don't list the amount of potassium on their also the reason we worry so much about potassium is because potassium controls muscle function and muscle contraction and remembering that your heart is a muscle so if your potassium is too high and or too low it can cause your heart to miss beat and not to be the way that it's supposed to and you can end up having a heart attack so here are a few supplements I feel like more supplements than not actually list the amount of potassium on there but here's a few supplements that are the don't list the amount of potassium so again if it's made with peanuts or it has peanuts in the first couple of ingredients you want to avoid those because most likely they have too much potassium also sometimes you think oh I'm going to you know eat a granola bar because that's going to be you know high in fat and protein but actually a lot of these don't have very much protein in them at all like I use like granola bars chewy granola bars crunchy granola bars any of those milk substitutes you think oh it's going to have plenty of protein and it's made from nuts but it doesn't so please be wary of that also um sometimes your protein is under 3.5 that your albumin when it's under 3.5 a lot of times dialysis facilities will give you a nutritional supplement either in the form of a bar or in a form of a drink and that will give you and that'll help boost your protein levels your albumin levels but also let's say your protein levels are under 3/5 for a long period of time maybe like three months or longer talk to your dietitian there is a form of protein that you can get during your dialysis it will go right into your dialysis you don't have to get stuck again for another another kind it'll just go right into the dialysis machine and we'll fill in this extra protein during your treatment and talk to your dietitian she knows about this type of treatment talk to your nephrologist they might even be able to find a company that can help you with your insurance and maybe you won't even have to pay for this but really in conclusion protein is a really important part of our diet you have higher protein needs if you're on dialysis albumin is that type of protein that your dietitian is talking about and the reason she is is because it holds the fluid into your blood vessels it helps you fight infection research has shown that it is it keeps you out of the hospital and taking making sure you take your phosphorus binders I didn't really talk a lot about this but I'm sure your dietitian is talked to you plenty about your binders but even with your snack or with you know protein supplements you need to make sure you take those binders because where there's protein there's going to be phosphorus and anytime you're looking to change your diet habits you need to talk to your dietician and your nephrologist first and it's just best to have everybody who's on your team knowing what's going on and I do believe so now it's a question time so I think people have been writing in questions and mike is going to do a rapid-fire questions and then I'll do the answers yeah thank you very much Carolyn we definitely have more questions that we've gotten in and that folks would like to ask more we do have time feel free to enter that in the questions box which is on your your dashboard there so first question from one of yours is why does having an albumin level of 400 or higher mean less hospitalizations in depth they understand kind of what Sannikov edit is happening oh goodness um yes they do now the question is do I know is all about again the inflammation because when your albumin level is under is a four or higher it shows how it really means that you maybe you don't have any infection or your inflammation that causes stress on the body is lower and if you have less inflammation but that is a really really really great question to ask you're enough for ologist your kidney doctor about okay on the inflammation piece also what are some other good sources of selenium besides Brazil not Wow um so is Brazil not is the the highest it's selenium is called a trace element and so they are found in very small amounts in lots of foods but really Brazil nuts is has the highest amount and that's what's going to make it you that's really going to be what affects your albumin level is the Brazil nut okay if you do have acid reflux what type of food would you recommend before bed and how soon should it be before bed okay certainly we want to not a more carbohydrate food so an apple or like some crackers we don't want anything that's going to be sitting in your stomach for a long time so things that are going to be like that have fat in them or that have a lot of protein in it because fat and protein sit in your stomach longer which is great because when you're trying to lose weight and it makes you feel full longer but when you have acid reflux that is going to make the acid to go back up a little bit longer if it's sitting in your stomach longer I would say recommend you could and two hours to an hour beforehand oh that would be just fine you would still get the benefit of the snack you know I mean I'm not saying that you need to lay in bed right before you fall asleep and like you know eat an apple but like hours before bedtime that could be a great rule of thumb for everybody because when you lay down the acid reflux it makes it a little bit easier for it to come back up so two hours okay we have someone that's asking about information regarding protein for patients with chronic kidney disease stages three and four and are there major differences in where could they get more information there are two schools of thought out there there are some new research coming out and it actually is saying that in the beginning these two talked about you we want to restrict protein and that's still the rule of thumb out there but now they're kind of looking and saying that they don't really need to do that some good good resources would be the American kidney fund the National Kidney Foundation divita calm person is calm they all have a really good peer-reviewed journal articles but I think the most important thing is not about restricting protein but restricting different types of protein so eating the more vegetarian style proteins the beans and the whole grains and things like that if their potassium levels are okay it would be in the fish in the poultry and avoiding red meat red meat actually is a vaso constrictor that means it's taking your blood vessels and making them smaller and so that means your heart has to work harder to move that blood and then your heart has to work harder to get your to move the blood your blood pressure goes up so your kidneys work harder to lower your blood pressure your kidneys do so much who knew but so avoiding red meat or limiting red meats to like maybe once a month when you have stage 3 or stage 4 kidney disease I think is the most important takeaway for protein and early CKD okay someone says why am I always hungry now that I started dialysis oh that's a great question um dialysis you have higher energy needs when you're on dialysis I mean like people who don't know anything about dialysis they think oh you're just sitting in that chair for you know three hours no big deal well your body is hard at work when you're on dialysis you may just be sitting there but man oh man that machine when I keep on saying it's pulling it's actually doing that it's putting your body under stress and it's working your body your body is using all this energy and so your your calorie needs are actually higher so I think having some lean protein snacks having some low calorie snacks you know just kind of throughout like in your purse or in your dashboard or by your chair you know it's a good way to get in some calories but not you know not the Doritos next I mean I would love to be able to eat Doritos all day long but that's no good for anybody so like having some lean low calorie snacks is important thank you very much so someone doesn't like apples as a snack are grapes as good as apples and snack and a so red versus green any difference um really no difference between what red versus green some people might say oh there's more antioxidants and red grapes versus green grapes that I think you would have to be like a bushel of grapes to make that be any type of difference grapes are low in potassium they have like zero phosphorous but they are high in calorie and they're high in sugar so that's what's giving you above the calories now it's natural sugars less great but if you have diabetes or you're trying to watch your weight maybe choosing you know like 15 grapes which is a serving versus like 30 grades or something like that where does the excess protein that we intake go does our body get rid of it and how yes when your kidneys are working the way that they should be your body gets rid of the extra protein or the protein later through your urine protein waste is actually broken down into ammonia so when you pee a VP you and you smell that ammonia smell that's partly that's partly your the waste of the protein when your body is but really mainly your body all the protein that we eat is being used it's being turned into albumin is be turned into other types of you know blood proteins it's being turned into muscle and it's really just the waste product that our kidneys are filtering out when your kidneys aren't working the way that they should then your body's not able to filter out that ammonia and that's what it's caused the your bu in and your creatinine these are levels that your doctor and your dietitian are probably talking to you about and your nurses but that causes those to rise and they can cause toxic levels in your body and cause like funny taste in your mouth and even you know kind of dementia sign okay some of this dialysis patient is saying I've tried changing my diet to pass but I always go back to old eating habits do you have any tips for making new habits stick - ditto um yes start small don't try and change everything all at once I think that that is the biggest leading the best the biggest factor that leads to failure in the falling back into old habits also don't like do any negative self-talk I mean we're all going to eat that pizza one of these days and you know just because you ate that pizza doesn't mean that you are you know that you're bad or you're doing the wrong things and things like that say okay I had my pizza now I'm going to move on and not feel bad or guilty about it the best best best advice I can give anybody about changing diet habits or trying to lose weight is number one write down everything a single thing that you eat don't lie to yourself if you ate that Jolly Rancher write it down number two don't buy those chips don't go down that aisle in the grocery store get rid of it at your house I know I mean like things are expensive and you don't want to throw away food and stuff like that but dang it throw it away get rid of it don't have it in your house if you have family members they can plead to them say please please please please do not buy Chips Ahoy cookies because I really I can't I can't not eat those maybe you don't like almond joys and say if you really want to have a snack buy those almond joys and keep them in the house but the most important thing is write down every single thing that you eat don't shame yourself and feel bad and negative when you slip up we all do and don't have it in your house okay great it's probably tips we all can use including me you talked a little bit about a vegetarian diet and that's definitely possible to do it any is it possible to successfully follow a vegan diet while on dialysis yes um it's certainly harder and that is something that I mean I don't know if you can be vegan 100% of the time because dairy will be would be an important source of nutrients and like also be vitamins but that is something that you and your dietitian in your nephrologist should should talk together I think a great way to approach that is writing like come up with a diet plan write down like I could eat X Y & Z and meet all of my needs what do you think you know if you come in with more information than that way your dietician your nephrologist be like okay this person has really done their work they know what they're doing they're going to do it the right way and they would feel more confident okay we have a fluid question I'm a dialysis patient have difficulty controlling my fluid levels what can I do to reduce feelings of thirst and will protein help me feel less thirsty now proteins are going to help you feel less less thirsty at all but you can if you let you know you can like fries grapes and suck on those frozen grapes you can chew gum you can suck on like sour candies I know this these are all probably things that you've heard before also like any type of fruit that has a lot of water in it so frozen apples watermelon pears freeze all your fruit and suck on that don't suck on ice because that's going to melt down and be turned into into fluid a little trick that I used to do back in the day when I was you know young but I would go to soccer camp and it's hot is all get-out in st. Louis and it's humid and it's awful but you need go and you'd run all around you're super thirsty and you drink as much as you can but you're still too hot I would take cold water like the drinking fountain and run it over my wrist where my blood supply was and that would help cool my body down also getting like a frozen washcloth and when you're at your house and putting it on your head and that will help cool you down it's about being high is a lot of times where do you feel like you're thirsty or have it getting a wet towel and freezing that and putting that around your neck when you're walking in this awful heat to the metro or that's less or the what not that is another good way to keep your body cool staying cool what helps decrease your your desire for drinking oh and don't eat a lot of salt salt makes you thirsty thank you very much any difference in the way the body absorbs animal proteins which is a protein supplement yeah because those are all synthetic all the strong work a lot of those are some are synthetic and they're not commonly found in nature your body is much better at breaking down foods in its natural form animal plant when we start pulling things out and making these supplements they're very important they do a great service but your body can maybe absorb more of them or less it just depends on how how it's working out I would look for like a whey protein because whey protein is in its most natural state okay that was the last question I didn't you made it thank you very much Carolyn great job today I learned a lot as well so I really appreciate you coming in doing this tonight okay well thanks I had a great time fabulous hour now webinar will be held on Thursday July the 26th from 2:00 to 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time in partnership with satellite health care we present blaster therapy and dialysis exercise activity and wellness with dr.

"PN4Aju8QUvM": "hello I'm Greg from lofty pursuits and I made hard candy and we're gonna test it out so let's start with some orange slices because we're talking about orange I think I mentioned I used to ship yo-yos these bags of candy are exactly the same size of the standard yo-yo package because I'd already got my shipping department optimized for you know you think you're supposed to be easy to open I guess so but I'm kinda having trouble getting just kind of it's all in the fingernails yeah yeah you know I trimmed them before I came here so I look good on video and just try to get a slice cuz you're gonna end up with a lot of candy so these are our em slices and an old iron slice roller that I dug up oh sorry you can take the whole bag yeah and I love the way it puts lines it was one of those rollers that were Kippy users anything you could use it for orange slices watermelon slices it was sort of generic they try to do as much with as little as they add and you can see the good citrus flavor you're tasting and this is actually gonna be lighter because I didn't put much acid in it because I wanted to keep it clear and we did this for a video which was about things that rhyme with orange because Tom Lehrer came up with an orange roller rhyme and I've been told endlessly by everybody on our YouTube channel that so did M&M which I find ironic because there was an M&M commercial saying nothing rhymes with orange you work that out okay so you started with citrus what do you think so this is a secret flavor that we got passed down from Elaine's candy store when we got the recipes or we've got the equipment that gave us the recipe for their nectar so if you hold it out you probably have to get groups there's one of those packs we talked about okay I need two or three of them here you go we see shell motif which isn't a roller from the malanez candy company want to get the the tradition the neat little shapes and it's one roller that makes all the shapes and what I love about some of these old rollers is how traditional they are because now you go to something like that video game candy crush saga and I literally have every shape from the video game in a roller from the 1800s which shows they did their research I've seen the candy crush saga but I don't know what it is really it's a little it's a little cell phone game it's addictive and silly and it's like anything else it's a derivative from a game that was called bejeweled which was one of the early games for our Palm Pilot and I'm delving into the history of video games instead of candy mm-hmm folks don't do this at home so what do you think about the nectar it's an interesting flavor the more you sucked on it it's kind of changes it's very good it's hard to place as a flavor yeah those are tasty okay then we're gonna go just to go around the block we're gonna go to these American flag candies that I made these are the ones that Craig was talking about and but because of the colors I would expect to be popular you know I thought it was more a decision of what is the flavor of an American flag and I felt they had a choice between canvas which I thought limited Marcus this is that a pretty pot that's these it's I did strawberry blueberry shortcake because that's you know yes exactly so I thought that was interesting yeah yeah I taste this is gonna go slower than yes something like the like wines oh yeah another one ray look blueberry strawberry shortcake if I did it right which I thought was good yeah oh yeah so you get a lot of flavor control you play around sorry there's a napkin over there I won't be insulted we're gonna be doing scandi spit take focus by the way I'd like to apologize here I left my hat in the car I don't know if you recognize me I'm Greg from lofty pursuits without the Hat you know who knows who I am you know what I'm going to give you a gift while we're getting stuff out I brought this stuff I know it's a little silly we serve breakfast also so I thought I'd get you a little lofty pursuits mug another thing we have to get these mugs yeah I'll talk to me about that later I'll give you my mud contact I feel like I'm the rolodex okay so let's try and did you try the flag candy mmm-hmm what's the word it should give you a good fruity taste did you bring me back taste yeah yeah so you should get that whipped cream feeling and maybe the cake feeling with a little almond in there yeah yeah and you should be able to get if I did if I balance it right should be able to get a clear strawberry and a clear blueberry depending on what you're doing okay you know it's like you think it was a joke with the with the everlasting gobstoppers and the original Willy Wonka no you can do this stuff with flavors you know this is why hard candies are hard because it's the flavor that counts and over soft candy is a lot of people say I don't like hard candies well when you're making a roll that has to retail for $0.50 and then wholesale at 25 cents and then be go to a distributor at 20 cents there's not much room for ingredients but if you can use the best ingredients in the world you can make absolutely amazing candy so tell me when you're ready for the next one rowdy you're ready okay so this is our peach candy and if I did it right you should get a little fuzz I don't mean that as a joke you got a whole bunch of them look at the artwork on it because that's an image candy and you can see the little peach chief Jen give me a spare one I'll pass along I don't need my readers very detailed and that's uh you hold it up to the light it'll even glow a little bit if you'd if I did it right oh I didn't get that one Jessica did she's getting really good peaches one of the harder ones but you can see how we are getting the flavors to contrast and a lot of that is with the balancing of the various ingredients great did you see I'm saying they'll loosen the peach fuzz gives you a soft back to the flavor is somebody's art you're right about that but it's out of a lot right people go I didn't want to buy it because I don't want to eat it God what am i madness score make one of the things I like about this art is a large early on that artists transitory in 1976 so I would have been eight years old my mother took me we lived in New York City my mother took me to the first big retrospective eff Alexandra called it who was a modern artist he did Mobile's he did stables but he made a lot of toys he made a circus that he played with and some of the objects were meant to be interacted with they were figures a Josephine Baker that were steel that were hung for the ceiling on Springs supposed to grab the hands and dance with them and they dated back to his his time in France and I think the 50s and there was a bunch of ceramic balls of different sizes that had a sponge ball hanging from the ceiling and would bounce around and chime and while I was there waiting to go play with the sponge ball thing that I never got to play with the word came down that Alexander had called her had died in the museum right while I was standing there now you know this was 76 so I was eight and that was a major it was like first thing I realized that an artist can be a toy maker and the second thing I realized is this is gonna be no more of this and I wanted a very long young age about the transitory nature of our art and I think that's one of the reasons I like the candy so much because the art is destroyed as you do it but you have to enjoy it in the moment you can't save it forever but you can also pass it on yeah you can but it has a finite time time you're teaching ethica oh yeah no no I'm teaching the skills the art itself isn't passed on it'll be her art and she's not the only one who'd gone through about 10 or 12 people he's done this over the years you know now the next one we're gonna do is apple the Apple should be a little bit harder I haven't tried this batch so I don't know if it was done right but it usually is it's got some good artists one a little flat it was made a little too hot they won't do it but you should get a real crisp flavor out of this one with your contrast with that peach which is a softer flavor and this is the interaction game that I'm playing with with the different things if you look at the artwork they're actually pretty similar mmm but they're not exactly similar you know one is a little dimple in it but one of the nice things about most fruits is they're round with bumps I like that this part Kenya gets it's not super hard that you want to bite into it like it's hot well that's because we pulled it so much we're actually pulling it a huge amount more than most people do and that does two things one it increases the flavor more surface area because while the bubbles makes the flavor dissolve faster so you get a more immediate shot of flavor and since we're cutting it it's not a drop it has all that exposed area in the middle actually if you suck on it the white will dissolve much faster than the other stuff so with things like the citrus it could really feel like a real piece of citrus with pith in it as the bits of the middle don't do it and or don't dissolve as fast and and because of that it'll connect the dots when you Biden it but I don't recommend anyone bites and hard candy please don't sue me if you chip your I am now officially telling you don't do it but you know it also means they're eating the candy too fast and I mean don't have as much time to enjoy so uh let's see what are we gonna do next I think I want to contrast this with banana I don't think I can get you to do any of them all by the way I bought you about a bag of madness this is our candy demonstration of the Stroop effect in other words they're all the same color but I can't tell you what flavors they are oh so because you taste with your eyes before you taste with your mouth and the mole object is to confuse you I try to keep the current list on the website but it changes faster they change them they go we change this what does this taste like and I go oh God yeah you try to do durian let's not put that in and we don't I'm still the boss okay you've had durian durian is delicious it's not what it tastes like it's what it smells like it smells like feet okay it tastes like it tastes like jackfruit which also smells like I've only had jackfruit as um barbecued uh you probably can't up here I have a friend who grows it in South Florida and brings it up once a year so I guess we do it up here Oh God yeah yeah it's like forty pound this much you can even a little top of it you get like a half pound of jackfruit a huge but most of its not edible yeah is it can you just cook it with barbecue sauce like in the slow cooker and pull up so it's like pulled pork that's interesting my a my friend my friend's father it makes jackfruit jerky every year but I've never enjoyed it he the jackfruit a few other things with us they also have he bought this farm that used to be an exotic fruit farm to put his bonsai plantation on it he grows trees this big and he doesn't need much room for that so you left the other trees going and he's a cat he has like a half acre Karen bolas you know I'm talking about star fruit and I've had star fruit but I've never had star fruit that ripened on the vine you know my friend John would go down there get two giant paper bags full drive it up when we eat it the next day oh my god it's the best thing I've ever tasted but the stuff you get in the supermarket is yeah I used to buy it occasionally just because I mean what are the other ones there's uh there's a wonderful they're wonderful varieties of bananas I can get in Florida that I've never seen anywhere else ice cream bananas but trying to get some seedlings because those will grow in my climate ah you can't peel it because it'll just mush you cut in half and eat it with a spoon is the consistency of ice cream Apple bananas which are just wonderful and my favorite is called the gold finger which is a red banana that is about this long the wonderful banana but unlike our commercial bananas it's only ripe a week a year so we're gonna give you some banana candy and this should come out softer and banana it's not as high in potassium I'm sorry that's good tell you you must like bananas a bunch to eat that many folks consumption that's bananas have ribs Oh God that scares me and feelings I thought I'd end this thing we have another one a drop I can go for that but I thought we'd do a citrus which is what we're doing tomorrow and I thought I'd do a different citrus we do this in wine tastings to folks we spit out well I'm trying to balance all these things out to give you a variety I got these specifically for it would you like to try a grapefruit lemon or lime you tried another orange before and I don't want you to do that until tomorrow wanna save the rest of this bags grapefruit absolutely I mean it certainly looks like gravy fruit a line okay hey I'll give you another country he their smell looks like you just kind of grapefruit and this is the pattern we're gonna do for our a so I'm gonna teach you to okay that's great yeah I love grapefruit but then again I got a grapefruit tree in my backyard just because it's Florida and I can get away with grapefruits next to me yeah but it was grown from a seed most aren't you know most grapefruit true so like six or eight feet or ten feet tall mine's forty I can get eight hundred grapefruits off in a season Wow there are wonderful and the neat thing that people don't know about grapefruits is the things called shine is if you live in on the tree they're gonna stay ripe for months so I got about four months to pick the grapefruits but when I didn't used to get him because I used to try to pick them all because they'd fall to the ground and the grapefruit tree because of its very nature keeps anything from growing under its canopy it's just ends up being sand well a rotten grapefruit is exactly the same shade of Tayna tan Assad and it still holds liquid that's now rotten in the inside and of course it goes flat too if you hit a rotten grapefruit with a lawnmower it is an experience you'll never want to repeat so the whole object is to get all the grapefruits off the tree so for years I'd end up with laundry baskets on the grapefruits in my store with little signs that said free to good home and I've learnt more ways to eat grapefruits I mean I 10 grapefruits will fill a gallon ziplock bag with a half gallon of grapefruit juice and I'll lay it on a cookie sheet in the freezer and freeze it and then I'll stack them up like records so I can defrost them later and but what I really learned to do that I love is I cut grapefruits in half and I sprinkle them with brown sugar and I put them under a broiler okay this next one is our berry mix and it should show you what the how the texture changes with the shape with the shape well actually no this is our madness I'm sorry but it's in the very rola this is the flavor we came up with for our our candy that should not be confused with a Procter & Gamble product we stopped making that logo but we did keep the flavor going because people liked it so much now this is air I thought I'd grabbed about thing of raspberries this is our raspberry drop roller but if you put it in your mouth you'll discover it gives you the it really does feel like a raspberry does that make sense yeah and it's an interesting shape no that's a flavor combination of multiple new fruit flavors Jessica mixes that and I've never asked her what she puts in it so I kinda like it but first she's a bunch of different ones and it's a great flavor combination because people got this joke candy that looked like a laundry detergent tablet and then they were shocked to find out how good it tasted he but you know so we made it for it we make a lot of our special candies for our week or two so if you want to get it you better get it now and I guess about four days into the video being up which is still on Facebook and not on YouTube we got an interesting call for the head of consumer safety from Procter & Gamble saying could you please take this down his name was Mark and it was really nice and it was like I'm gonna take it down on Sunday anyway only plan to put it up for a week and he went okay that's fine and we talked for a while and you know it boiled down to I was making a can't up candy that looked like a poison he was making a poison look like a candy never the twain shall meet no so he stopped making that design not to mention was annoying design to make I hate where I come up with a design I'm expecting to sell you know 50 bags of and then all of a sudden I saw 800 bags of it I'm spending a month making something that happened with the hurricane candy and with the madness candy some of these things are fun to make those two weren't though I make cotton candy when a hurricane MMO came I was a little concerned because was headed straight to Tallahassee it was a class-five it he's waving at the lights trying to they are the lights of that gun it was a class-five hurricane it could be a class-3 when I hit Tallahassee if it hit Tallahassee my power could go off I could have lost all my ice cream and food inventory I would have been down who knows how long I would have been down I thought I'd make a couple of batches of candy and ship it out before the hurricane hits I'd have some extra money and there was some I was sitting there actually that wasn't one thing I was just nervous talking with some customers we need some customers in the store who had come up from South Florida to avoid the storm they referred to themselves as immigrants and they were sitting there and said you should do hurricane candy it'll be great and we decided what come flavor it should be we started thinking about salt water so the thought the Hurricanes from the overhead videos look like the satellite photos look like cotton candy being made yes I did cotton candy flavor and people are going cotton candy flavor is Kim sugar already flavored like sugar and the answer is yes cotton candy has a flavor it's a variant of raspberry believe it or not and whether it's pink or blue it's still the same flavor and I made some candy and I did two batches and I put it aside and big buckets that are watertight in case anything came through the roof and I came back three days later because we were down for a bit and fortunately the eye of the hurricane hit 50 miles to the east of Tallahassee hurricanes are much more powerful on the east side so there are entire towns that were devastated I mean it was like the finger of God you'd go down the interstate there's just a section where there were no trees there were 20 miles wide and these old oak trees just went down and Tallahassee was spared we got some water we got some out I lost power at the house for four days because tree branches went down the store never lost power which was good Oh thankfully and uh it's a swamp it's Tallahassee we don't have snow we have our became snow so it came out pretty good I'm sorry I don't have any of that but I ran out of that ages ago so I think that's everything but the madness but since the madness is like a roulette wheel I think I'm gonna leave it to you and Craig to do that on your own with some beer or something honestly I don't want to do that it's a whole lot of fun and they're delicious but you know everything else I think you're all sugared up enough great thanks by the way I'm expecting to bring home chocolate tomorrow your thing is you do some shopping tomorrow [Music]", "Lnzrq_P9vzs": "good real sticky today yeah roughly out like a sunrise in da I don't know I was checking checking earlier like 40 we've been under 45 percent all day so huh pretty toasty the past couple of days on with me that had something to do with it yeah first couple armed agents number heard you guys were scared yesterday tornado warning yeah actually I got an alert on my phone oh yeah first I thought that it was saying I was gonna be I was approaching like my data limit and I was like just for NATO warning oh I was like I don't know I was like I'm not really gonna take it very seriously just because is weird like in this we're pretty close to the city like winds have a very hard time looking up you know next to the city right and also it's Syracuse yeah and I live the Kansas yeah still you get a message it's like there's tornado heading your way but you know there is not there wasn't an actual tornado there's any potential nobody seemed that the rotation on the radar so that's why they were like oh nobody has seen it touchdown but yeah yeah it was like I was like 15 minutes the winds weren't even like super high it was mostly just raining yeah oh man that rain came down yeah that's crazy but I guess if I started hearing like the walls creaking and stuff okay I'll go downstairs but I didn't hear like any wind really I mean I I was like worried about it like that but I was like glued to the window like I wanted for a phone o clock yeah well it said that it was coming from the east so I was like [Music] we didn't go to the basement but then we went down there and we were like why do we come down the basement yeah well our basement was not as fun hopefully the Simpsons are taking yeah oh yeah I played that and wasn't really that fun we got over it pretty quick because they basically you just move and then you jump and then you attack and those are the only buttons and then like I played the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle game that Karen I grew up playing did you play - oh yeah no we didn't have you oh you didn't have you oh well basically what the want Athiya at the laundromat oh oh well when I went to Milwaukee it was a hat I played some Simpsons game and then I also played the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle game and wasn't as fun as I remember yeah I guess when when you're little and you're just used to the NES and you haven't had the Xbox one yet you're like wow this is great look at the graphics look at all eight of the pixels this is 16-bit we said this Looney tune for the NES at daycare like we never had one the blouse and I don't know why but I could think about that game so much recently I'm ready to drop like 50 bucks I wish game it was like a Looney Tunes basketball game we used to love project raisin no I remember it was like the airplane game there's like a 2d airplane game Oh oh man yeah and that was awesome and the plates of like great you could like match them up or something yeah do you remember the one the car won and like you'd be wait you're like driving down the highway I think you were trying to like get away from the police or something and there's like a certain the police would catch up to you or something and then there would be like a semi or a semi you know truck and you drive into the bed change your color and you come back out oh no that's like the only part of that game that I've ever taken oh yeah you don't member what game that was oh okay all right so is that kind of all put together then just to walk okay yeah that's candy right there so three and four three and three-quarters just uh first I never make anything one another we did it once before but dreams are hard and pillows wow look at that that looks so cool on the fruit even gonna be able to do like a green green piece like if it's all just talk well it smells so good yeah it does not really good it's got strawberry what's most on the Jolly Rancher like watermelon Jolly Rancher yes always have a work to do great we need someone videotaping me videotaping you guys [Laughter] here yeah chance possible help it maybe we'll just do a green stripe watch your hand oh maybe we did paint body because it's already things okay so it seems it pink by the green stripe can you still make it green though like with mini make green and pink stay really practicing with best bachelor just really try to scrape it yeah virtually invisible are yes spatula you got it Oh like so my glove that's right so we're gonna do green body pick strength right there dude peace that's what we did before hey I know I know I know I know Green Valley thinks it's a modern elements like remember you don't remember how you did it I know we did it that came out good yeah and I think I have I think I wrote down there I think Friday 3:00 and strike what if I put green in here what's gonna happen with this color we want to turn it well you turn this train probably turning brown brown yeah we don't wanna yeah but we still have to have two colors here yeah we'll just leave this color pull it under them take release I know we'd that'd be so controlling crazy doesn't water long before yeah he did green by who did do it and I got my notes if you add green it's gonna overpower well go ahead look at any old snaps and I will do this you know actually I think I do remember reading that flavor yeah I know we did you do that an extra hand here can I make up the next petal we're gonna go ahead make a petal in our life I'll do something here speaking as Steve I'm envisioning it and we did a green body right bones aren't good with their custom well I want thinking green however we do it okay we'll get ready what if you guys just broke off the little tiny piece and then just put in like one drop of food coloring to see what color it changes it to remember being like we only did it one time mix is destined to watermelon this is a brand-new bottle or no we only have the one all right smells good watermelon ewwww yeah no smell really good and you no matter the color it's gonna taste great listen I can turn shop yeah okay so you want to do pink body green stripe I still want to add like a little drop of red so it's a little bit more vibrant a pink because watermelon is more vibrant pink thing did you pull this it's gonna be pale pink we want to take our piece off yes we do Green yep we'll just agree of course this is the part where I wanted max to do it but uh this is this is the part the learning part that I wanted to match is just how much to add yeah and handling the small you've done that before have you sorry you have you've done have you colored small stripes yeah okay I guess back in the basement hmm can you can have that that big blob see you kept custody in a big blob I'll take a little bit more for my straight would you think that us discussing the stripes and get cheers over on your side more drama yeah he's also develop flavor it is great no keep Gary strawberry know like required yes i'm the cut-open and put it my backseat the darker color is just going yes not here won't know the whole thing deployment yeah well no I was wondering if that yeah is it just food coloring yeah this way Brenda right we flavor the whole batch I was just wondering if it's gonna go to Jersey - mind blowing flavor it like two separate dogs like partner flavor that sense they were that sided yeah you know now that you've said that I'm not saying I'll never do that favor what's your flavors would be complimentary no I mean lemon lime a big one right we're in the future now and you can see that they are packaging up peanut butter fill driven candy well I just wanted to let you guys know that we now have whole yeah shirts available because a lot of people in the last video left relieving comments saying that they wanted those shirts and what I was thinking is in the future if you guys really like a certain saying or really want a certain thing on a t-shirt just leave it in the comment section we got enough people requesting it then I can make it on t spring and I will let you guys know in the next video when it's available so what I'm thinking is would be like a limited time only and then once you guys decide you want another shirt then we'll make that and now just like replace those shirts so if you want the whole yeah shirt check out in the description before it goes away back to the rest of the video you do like yellow and green Dan then you might be on something and if we get sick of making the same old flavors over and over we'll get into the two-tone what else could we do too bad this wasn't a live stream huh we access an American classic and then the next one I am breaking bread trying hot dogs fantastic oh that actually didn't ring yeah because I did it before yeah and dad doesn't remember or believe me so I'm just let him have his way I'm surprised like I don't know cuz it was like so pink and you would think good heavens way when you've been married for 35 years which we just celebrated 35 years of bliss yesterday [Music] by number two the first year can be a little awkward like who takes out the garbage who knows of that yeah oh honey I already watched this it was you wouldn't like it was though I wasn't in either so Mac says how you do it oh very good thing well no I was wondering why yours keeps just like flattening out and hers doesn't but I think yours does too well mines getting - remix and quickly cuz it's smaller so it'll get cool off faster he's got more leeway because he's got bigger blob so pretty soon she's gonna start mixing it up pretty well because what but also what he's throwing it on the vocal it mix it a little bit but he does want to be sure not to get on his gloves that's the color on is on most puffs because tired to get out of both of us yeah SoDo with colors sweet are done with colors so next we've got raspberry and grape so we're just in the purples after this okay so where you guys come from Batavia oh did you go in there yeah we were gonna stop and we went up to our friend pallet palaces in the McKinley mouth it's a sponge candy we were we when we bought a few things from him kind of odd to stop it I love it on the way back

when we got everything in here is like I don't know how we fit it all in a little but we did it suppose this couple decides or something and then the first two weeks were robbers and we thought oh this is far bigger than we really need but that's okay we'll grow into it and then by the third or fourth week now why do you have to keep mixing it I'm just looking at and stuff because I want to see how it is flowing wise put it on the Hulk I gotta be able to handle this load slowing down a little bit each time almost ready oh that's when I graduated from yeah I was I was a super senior I

the viewers realized that online sales increased whenever there's a video but there's also a lot of people coming in to the stores from out of town from the YouTube videos oh yeah so people just forget to consider that there well I don't think that like videos necessarily have to do that but basically from the YouTube channel goodness has increased in walk you don't want to know when you get to yes I mean you don't want to squish it up and stuff because then you'll never I'll mess up the stripe so just try to keep it at this one size as if it keeps squishing that yeah I was thinking about that but I'm like well I can't have it be three feet long either how do you keep it and just keep with the same size you just can't really formula moving a lot on me the extra hot now you're getting

very quick birth sorry root beer run player new putter Scott yeah I've done photos got before that was really good you got another very hard candy first the first time I tried the blueberry and oh we had the boys yeah I think the mango one needed more laborers I think that's why I didn't like as much as the blueberry just wasn't as strong let's try that again and we made the peanut butter yeah holy cow and that is some good stuff yeah really good yeah I think it would be good to have the mango again and just like another another shot a flavour about you really good yeah this just seemed extra soft yeah maybe way I can just kind of watch you do it a little bit across the whole thing crossed all the way sliding across kind of losing it shine up here that's kind of what was happening

yeah too good to be true it smell really good 16 hey there you go you get out of here yep all right well let's get out of here [Music]", "-m4I_QriwBk": "when we think about caring for our skin we typically think of topicals lotions creams etc but our skin cells are made inside our bodies so today I want to share some ideas for having healthier hair skin and nails from the inside out I want to thank I herb comm for sponsoring this video and giving me this chance to share these tips with you so you can find links to all of these different products down in the description below and I also want to thank Abby for helping me research this video and really delving into the science of our skin so first off let's just remember that our skin is an organ it's actually our largest organ and it plays a lot of really important purposes in addition to just the aesthetic or appearance that people see from the outside most importantly our skin protects the entire body from external aggravators like bacteria pollution sun damage chemicals and this essential immune system role means that the skin has to maintain a perfect balance of permeability and protection so that it can keep the right things in and the wrong things out this delicate balance is achieved primarily by the stratum corneum or the outermost layer of our skin so this stratum corneum or outermost layer of the skin is about 15 to 20 layers of dead skin cells and it's primarily composed of a dense layer of protein primarily keratin that serves to create that perfect balance of permeability so when we think about our skin being dry are being moist this is largely due to how much water is able to be retained in that stratum corneum or top layer of the skin it's essentially serving like a waterproof seal to keep all of the moisture in our cells from just evaporating into the air and to also keep our cells from absorbing water and filling up like a balloon every time we go swimming or expose our skin to water so that brings us to hyaluronic acid which has been getting a lot of attention recently in the realm of skincare and beauty and the reason why is that it plays a really important role in helping to maintain this perfect amount of permeability and protection so our body produces hyaluronic acid and unfortunately as we age the body produces less and less hyaluronic acid this is part of the reason why we can think about a baby's skin which is so soft so supple and so healthy largely because as babies we have the highest amount of hyaluronic acid in the body hyaluronic acid is also present in our joints and our eye sockets so you can just kind of understand how it serves this lubricating role all throughout the body it helps us to retain collagen which is the protein that provides the elasticity that helps keep our skin youthful reducing the signs of wrinkles and aging and just helping to contribute to healthier more repaired skin hyaluronic acids ability to help retain moisture makes it really effective for wound healing so things like healing up scars healing up sun damage and just remember that the stratum corneum is constantly in flux as these 15 to 20 layers of dead skin cells are constantly being replaced so this means there's a lot of repair that's needed to keep that outermost layer of our skin healthy and it's one of the reasons that hyaluronic acid has become so popular in the realm of cosmetics and skincare another factor contributing to the appearance of our skin is free radical damage now we know that antioxidants can help to neutralize free radicals by giving up one of their electrons so these reactive aggressive free radicals can be neutralized but the thing about antioxidants is that there are tons of them and they all function in different specific ways so one of the things I love about this hyaluronic acid complex is that it contains two potent antioxidants French maritime pine bark extract and grapeseed extract pine bark extract has such strong antioxidant properties that it can actually be found in over 600 different supplements vitamins and other health care products so when it comes to our skin there are a couple of things that make it really beneficial number one it has been shown to have specific photo protective properties that means protecting your skin from damage from the Sun now again our skin the largest organ is constantly exposed to these different sources of free radicals and the Sun is one of the most harmful ones so these photo protective properties not only help to protect your skin cells from free radical damage before it occurs but has also been shown to even go in and repair damage that's already occurred we also have the grapeseed extract now the antioxidants in grapeseed are part of why we hear people talking about drinking red wine to get antioxidant benefits and in just a moment we'll actually look at a trans reservatrol supplement that again gives you these same benefits so grapeseed extract and French maritime pine bark extract are both high and a certain type of antioxidant known as bio flavonoids and more particularly Oleg Americ procyonids or oak pcs which have very strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties now the wonderful thing about antioxidants is that they are plentiful in a healthy diet of lots and fruits and vegetables but the thing about some of these particular ingredients is that it would be really difficult for you to eat enough of those healthy foods to get the amount to really give you benefit so for instance with grape seeds number one most people don't eat the grape seeds number two most of these polyphenols bio flavonoids and other antioxidants actually have a very bitter taste so even if you were to go and buy grape seeds or something like that you would probably find that the taste is not super favorable so I love that California gold has actually created this you know complex supplement anything that you take as a pill is just so easy so simple to add into your diet and it's just a great way to ensure that you're getting enough of these really valuable antioxidants that even in a really healthy diet may be hard to get and there's a similar situation with reservatrol so reservatrol comes from the skin of the grape and the reason that we typically think about reservatrol in association with red wine is that red wine will actually contain a pretty high concentration of that reservatrol and it's probably part of what adds to that bitter flavor but the thing to understand is that the body can only absorb so much of reservatrol in this particular instance of what you eat and they estimate that the body only absorbs about 25% of dietarily consumed reservatrol so this trans reservatrol again is just a wonderful way to ensure that you're getting enough so number one this is the trans variation of reservatrol which is the more bioavailable or easily absorbed variety and number two when you take a reservatrol supplement like this one you're not having to deal with all of the negative health effects that come with drinking red wine now I love wine just as much as the next person but it would be helpful to understand that if you're only drinking wine for the antioxidant benefits that it's really not the best source so to understand how reservatrol offers so much benefit it's helpful to understand why plants create it in the first place so reservatrol is something that a plant will create in response to injury infection or fungal attack so it has such protective properties for the plant it also has really protective properties for us now another thing I love about these California Gold supplements is that they're really clean so this one even says free of E Modan and pH PAHs essentially if you start looking at different supplements like this you'll start finding that there can be certain ingredients or byproducts with negative effects so I love that all of these products are formulated to make sure that you're only getting the good stuff and they're really careful to remove those things that can be potentially harmful so going back to that concept of the stratum corneum or very top layer of the skin and its important role of maintaining a homeostasis or balance of water retention and also water protection a big part of this whole chemical process involves fats and water so some antioxidants are water soluble and some antioxidants are fat soluble and this is just one of the things that contributes to the different actions of antioxidants so vitamin E is a fat soluble antioxidant and it plays a really important role in the stratum corneum helping to maintain that delicate homeostasis so that moisture can be retained in our skin but we're also being protected from everything we need protection from vitamin E has also been found to have very beneficial effects on the hair follicle so this means that as your hair is growing that healthier hair follicle is going to be able to create more deeply conditioned hair and just healthier hair overall it's known to accelerate healing so again when we think about repairing sun damage or any other type of damage that our skin encounters vitamin E is a very very important antioxidant that can accelerate that healing process so this is sunflower vitamin E and that's because sunflower seeds are one of the best dietary sources of this important vitamin but again the amount of sunflower seeds you would need to eat on a daily basis is not as easy as just taking it in a pill form so of course sunflower seeds are really healthy and I encourage you to eat a lot of them but I think that you know having a vitamin E supplements as photo protective properties so taking one of these sunflower vitamin e's before you go out in the Sun would be a really great way to help just protect your skin from all of that potential sun damage that could occur the Journal of clinical and experimental dermatology has also found that in people who are prone to acne there tends to be lower levels of vitamin A and vitamin E in those patients so even though it hasn't necessarily been proven that supplementing vitamin E could help with acne there's very strong evidence that people who are low in this vitamin will be more prone to acne than people who are getting plenty of it in their diet or maybe even supplementing vitamin E through a supplement like this another great way to care for our skin from the inside out is to simply help support the body's natural processes of healing and repair now the best way to do that is to try and focus on getting sleep getting more high-quality sleep and just reducing your overall stress levels so I know that there's no way to avoid stress in our lives so when we think about trying to reduce our stress levels what exactly does that mean well number one it's about trying to spend as much time as you can in a more restful and relaxed state than in that heightened fight-or-flight state so our nervous system has two different components the parasympathetic nervous system is associated with the rest and digest properties of the body so this is where our body is really able to heal and repair and do all of that little maintenance work that it can't typically do when we are distracted throughout our daily life and these stresses of daily life so that fight-or-flight part of the nervous system or sympathetic nervous system our body is kind of triaging so it's just putting all of its attention into adrenaline being ready to fight or flight and all of those things like digestion repairing damaged tissues immune system function all of those things just kind of get put on the back burner so the more time that you can spend in this rest and digest or parasympathetic nervous system the more your body is healing and repairing everything from your internal organs all the way to that stratum corneum or external layer of the skin one of the simplest ways to trigger the parasympathetic rest and digest nervous system is with slow relaxed breathing and that's because the body registers slow and relaxed breath as an environment where there are very few threats so when we're breathing really fast and we're breathing really shallow that signals to our brain that there's a potential danger and it triggers that fight-or-flight nervous system so something like taking a few slow deep breaths or doing a guided meditation where you focus on your breath or a practice like yoga which also has you really focus on taking these slow relaxed breath those are all really wonderful ways to help trigger that parasympathetic nervous system and trigger all of that healing and repair there are also a variety of different herbs that can also help to support this restful healing part of our nervous system so a couple that I want to show you in this video are lemon balm and passion flower now these are both very gentle sedatives they're not going to knock you out like a sleeping pill but they actually work with your body to support that natural inclination towards the parasympathetic healing part of our nervous system so passion flower is also known to help relax twitching muscles so when you think about laying down in bed and feeling any kind of muscular tension or twitching in the muscles a passionflower supplement like this one can be very very effective at just helping your body to both physically and mentally relax lemon balm is another wonderful herb for supporting relaxation supporting that healing part of our nervous system and these are just a couple of over a hundred and twenty different supplements and I just love I are calm because of this awesome variety you can find food supplements beauty products you name it and

with all of the different nutrients antioxidants healthy fats and other beneficial nutrients that the body needs now no matter how healthy we eat I think that it's safe to say that most of us are probably not always getting all the nutrients that we need so my last product for this video is a simple multivitamin this one is designed specifically for women and I think it's really fun cuz they actually make it in a gummy form and these gummies are so good it's like eating candy so this gummy includes vitamins A C D and E b6 folate iodine and it's just a wonderful kind of safety net to help make sure that you're getting some of those really essential nutrients that may or may not be coming from your diet every single day I also love that it's free of GMOs soy gluten and some of these other components that people may be sensitive to and that are really pretty rampant in a lot of the different supplements out there now not all of these things are necessarily harmful but just knowing that California gold has created a really pure really clean high quality multivitamin kind of gives me that comfort of knowing that each day no matter how healthy my diet is I'm making sure to get a

pretty much it so without further ado let's get started I'm gonna read the first question and then we will get underway the first question from Damian Anderson are you still on the vertical diet Dameon have you been watching any of my videos recently no I am not on the vertical diet anymore I haven't been on the vertical diet for about nine weeks now because I've been working with Jordan Peters for exactly nine weeks starting today I just checked in him him this morning Jordan doesn't do the vertical diet I don't even think he knows what the vertical diet is Jordan lives in the UK yeah he has no idea about the vertical diet so no I am definitely not on the vertical diet anymore not that's not to say that that's a bad plan to say that's a stupid idea the vertical diet does work very well it's just that's not what my coach has me doing right now and what I'm doing right now is very far from the vertical diet so no I'm not on the vertical diet watch some of my recent videos on what I am eating I have put out a couple videos on my rest day meals and my workout day meals which my workout my training day meals did just change today so those are you wondering I weighed in for Jordan at 242 this morning that is about two and a half pounds down from a week ago which is exactly perfect it's what we want we want to be losing about one percent of our body weight per week that's about how much pure fat your body can get rid of in a week's time so any of you guys that are dropping like a pound a day two pounds a day three pounds a day ten pounds a week guess what you're losing a water a ton of glycogen a ton of muscle unnecessary the muscle tissue but just flew it out of the muscles which is strength and gains like that's not what we're trying to get rid of so just keep that in mind when you're going about designing your own diet protocol if you're losing weight fast that is not a good thing because your body can really only get rid of one percent of your weight in body fat per week give or take you know some people are there's gonna be some variation there of course but for the most part that's your best bet that's your safest bet and I mean the slower that you lose it the better like I haven't lost 2.5 every week there's been some weeks so it was only half a pound some weeks where it was only one I believe this is probably the biggest drop in a week that I've had and this is week nine so yeah that's that next question oh this one's a good one Keenan bald tree Keenan I've actually met before at the gym that I go to now out in the suburbs and I see him there probably every day that I'm there which is cool it's nice too it's nice to know people that watch my videos so yeah if you if you ever seen me out and about for sure say hi I love that [ __ ] honestly it's really cool to see you know the variety of people that my videos have reached so by all means say hi I I for sure him for that but anyways Keenan asks I really want to hop on the sauce but my girlfriend says I'm big enough or I look perfect the way I am friggin worst words you can ever hear even though I always say I'm not big enough how do I ease my girlfriend into the thought of letting me hop on the sauce or convince her to let me hop on the sauce Kenan this is a really it's a really tricky difficult question and I feel like you know her response to you in that you know you look great the way you are I think I mean because it's like my fiancee says that to me all the time whether I'm fat or lean which makes her a liar mm-hm because yeah she like she doesn't care apparently whether I'm fat or thin or whatever when in reality I believe she prefers me fat because number one it's less likely that people are attracted to me and number two she wants to be in better shape than I am because she doesn't want people to think that she is punching up in this relationship so so kind of take that into account that that could be something that she's thinking about you know with regards to that the other thing though is just like you know imagine if she was saying that she wanted to lose weight or whatever like this doesn't work on me when when Laura says you know something about weight loss or whatever like I don't say I don't tell her you look fine the way you are I mean I I say I say I don't care what you look like I just want you to be happy and if you're happy with the way your body looks and if you're happy you know with where you're at then I'm happy if you want to lose weight if you want to lose fat by all means I will help you do that that doesn't mean to say that I want you to be leaner or thinner it's just that I want you to be happy with yourself I want you to be more confident about your body image I want you to just that that's what I want you know I don't I don't you know she can win me first when we first started dating she was actually when we first started dating she she was actually the biggest that she ever was but that's because she was like she went through an injury and wasn't able to work out and so I always bring that up I'm like when we first started dating it was you are at your lowest point but still like that's that's just it like of course she doesn't care what you look like how you end up looking or whatever she just wants just I think it's more about she's saying that because she doesn't want you to think that you need to change for her but that's not what it's about you want to change for you and I think that's the point that you need to get across to her is that you want to do this for your own satisfaction you know that's kind of I feel like that's where it should start now like for me when me and Laura first started dating five years ago I was already on gear she has not ever like I trained her before we started dating for a trainer for like three years I've known her for eight or nine years now she's never known me not on gear she had no idea I was using anything in the beginning and probably most people didn't because I didn't look like much but you know she had no reason to question that so she didn't really have a say of whether or not I was going to use it because I was already on it and she hadn't known me ever without it so she knew then and there that you know it wasn't affecting my mood in a negative way it wasn't affecting me well it wasn't affecting me in any of the stereotypical ways that people imagined steroids affecting people you know she had no clue that I had been on it and yeah I mean so when I finally told her about it you know she really had no idea still she was pretty shocked about it but she didn't care because that's how she's always known me I mean of course she had a lot of questions to ask like I feel like the biggest fear for a girlfriend or fiance whoever when you know you want to get into this kind of thing is is you know how's this gonna affect your health and and all this other stuff you know they're just there they don't have any knowledge on the subject and also they've heard all their life as icy roads are bad and and they don't know that there's a healthy way of going about doing things so what I would recommend is trying to find a way to educate her on how common it is and how there is there are ways to do this intelligently and you know not in a dangerous stupid way that will impact your health negatively you know long term unless of course you want to be 300 pounds and free but that aside what I did in an attempt to kind of educate her educate Laura on the subject was showing her different different like documentaries out there on on steroids on gear use and showing her how prevalent it is in sports and you know showing her different people talking about it and just helping her just get informed that it's not a super uncommon thing in sports so like I would show her I mean I would show her bigger faster stronger that's a little documentary that she what's his name not Mark Bell one of the Bell brothers made it not smelly said I can't remember any of their names now anyways yeah I would show her that documentary that one's a really big kind of eye-opener for people that don't know anything about steroids I'm going way too far over time on this question but it is it is a common question and a good question so but that's what I would do is just try to educate them on it be open about it talk to them about what you're going to try what you're going to do and why it's safe why it's going to be a smart decision and how it's going to make you be I mean just just feel better because you will like you'll feel you'll feel you know better about yourself it's the same thing as like a woman getting a boob job you know it just it builds confidence in in another way on another level and you know I feel like that's part of the reason that a lot of us get into it is is is that whole aspect of things but that's that's kind of the best info I can give you on that all right next question from Ben Munoz I said there right is doing one cycle to help speed up gains effective or efficient compared to just stayin natty well all the gains be gone even if taking proper steps BCT continue to exercise etc so the thing about this is you know if you can't get to your Nattie limit Nattie potential naturally there's a strong chance that you're not going to be able to maintain much after you come off you know I mean because if you're if you're having trouble getting to that place naturally that means there's something off with your nutrition there's something off with your training there's something off with your rest something is inhibiting you from being the best that you can be as a natural and so when you add steroids into the mix to try to reach let's say you're trying to reach your natty potential on gear thinking that if you come off of it you can maintain your natural potential I would say that that can only happen if somewhere during that cycle you picked up the habits that you were lacking as a natural like if your sleep was [ __ ] you know and you fix that during your cycle that could be you know what what you were lacking that could make up that for you and so that when you do come off you can maintain that naturally however it's highly unlikely but that happens I haven't seen it happen and you won't lose the games right away but they will most likely I would say there's probably an 80 80 to 90% chance that over time those gains that you made will trickle away until you get back to where you were before you started you know especially it's you can't predict what your natural testosterone levels are gonna do after a cycle you know you can hope for the best but you know sometimes it just doesn't come back the way that it was it's getting hot in here yeah sometimes it just doesn't work out you know the way that you plan and when it comes to altering your hormones you should count on that being the reality so I would say it just depends on what you're shooting for you know if you're trying to get to your natural limit on steroids and then thinking you can come off and maintain that natty limit it's it's not very likely but it is doable as long as you pick up the habits to maintain that along the way now if you're trying to go beyond your natural limit and then come off you're not you're not gonna keep that you know you'll lose it takes a little while for the games to go away but in the grand scheme of things it's not that long it doesn't it it happens pretty quick like I would say after about six months you know you'd probably start to see things fade after about three months and then I would say everything would be completely gone after six months so ie I don't think that it's a smart way to go about doing it what I think you should do is just figure out what you're lacking as a natural work on that get make sure everything is perfect in that sense before you try to take that on you know and see where you can get as a natural alright next question from ace AC e hey chase any advice on reducing water retention while on cycle dieted down from one set 170 to 155 and two weeks into a cycle I'm up to 160 two point eight thank you sir I'm on test prop and Anna bar and master on so I already messaged him on this but the first my first thought was like he's doing about 300 to 350 tests per week and 60 Anna bar a day and a hundred and about three 300 350 master on a week and he's up water weight I mean he specifically says its water retention in weight of seven pounds 8 pounds and water attention now if this is like visible water retention if you if you're like serious that its water retention mmm I told him that it's highly likely that your aunt of ours fake and that it's D ball and not Anna bar that's a very common thing to happen you know because if he's taking 60 milligrams d ball I can see that bloating him up and getting very watery very quickly and not understanding why because Anna bar should be a relatively dry product master on is a very dry product test prop is dry however if this is his first cycle there's a chance that he's reacting to the testosterone because when you first start gear when you first introduce exhaustion as testosterone into your system I feel like everything kind of goes a little bit out of control your estrogen freaks I just I feel like it's so common I mean it happened to me my estrogen I felt like went out of control I had tons of water weight I don't have any pictures from it but yeah so it could possibly be you know him just reacting to a first cycle he doesn't say it's his first cycle but it judging by his weight I would guess that it is but the fact that he's on such a low dose too could be something and the other thing could be the master on could be faked as well the master on could be test prop also so he could be on 700 milligrams a test problem that's why this reason is why I homebrew because I just can't stand questioning myself questioning these things when I make it myself I know for fact it's a hundred percent exactly the right dose and exactly the product that I want whereas when you're buying because this is underground lab stuff that he's got when you're doing that it's a risk it's just everything is a risk you have no idea exactly like you just have to take their word for that that's what they have oh it also says he hasn't even started with a master on yet so never mind on that but still it so what I told him was he needs to get his Anna bar tested and see if that's D ball or Anna bar and then if that is if it's all legit stuff you know that's just kind of part of it that's part of diving into it and seeing how your body reacts and that's why I recommend starting off with a very low dose you know I mean granite is only doing 350 milligrams of test a week but again like that's why I say start with a trt dose bring it in at 200 250 see how your body reacts to because even that's gonna be better than your natty output you know that's gonna freak your body out just that little amount so yeah that's that's my advice double check and make sure your anavar is actually in a bar and then you know and then the other thing would be back off your test dose you know and just dial that back until things settle down you know if it's really just a bunch of water bloat that you can physically see so that's that next question from Nick Z have been pinning TRT in the delts and ventral glue with slim pins no pit or lumps started 400 milligrams a test cycle pinning every day rotating between delts and VG injection site is tender for a couple days after developing a knot is my gear bad so I asked him on this what kind of gear were you using like what test was it on your TRT and what is it on cycle he said he had test sip on his TRT and he's using testing and fate now typically the only difference between eaching and fates or each ester typically it ends up being you know bad the pip is and that's pain pain and pain and pinning is that what it is yeah pain you're the pain that you get after you pin usually that's the only difference in between the Esther's a lot of people say test prop hurts more than test sip I've heard you man Tate hurting more than tests I've heard tests step that's probably the easiest one to handle testosterone with no Esther is very painful but yeah it's just it could be the fact that you switch testers and you're doing a play bigger dose so yeah I mean that's just kind of part of it what I told him to do was I would take your test sip and do that at 400 milligrams a week see if it does the same thing you know I mean it's just I wouldn't say that your gears bad by any means I just say you know you're not used to that volume of a shot and your body is getting used to it so yeah that's it all right next question from Steve rich could you share a couple of the most significant things you have learned about training people all right that is a very good question biggest thing I would say that I learned I've learned about training people you know in the last 10 years of training one-on-one sessions is that probably the most important thing is that you have to meet the client where they're at in terms of their fitness you can't just think that you need to obliterate them in a workout that is probably the biggest mistake that I see new trainers make all the time and I did it myself I thought I'm going to kill this person you know and that's easy to do it's so easy to wipe somebody out in a workout and make them sick make them hate themselves make them never want to come back to the gym again that's easy what's hard is giving them a good workout that will actually make them better because just just killing them is not gonna make them better you know it's like I said it's super easy to put together a hard workout and wipe somebody out it's hard to put together a smart workout that will actually make somebody better and yeah just you have to meet the individual where their fitness level is at and that's what I've learned the most through the years is how to gauge that and how to figure out where somebody is in their life of training and how hard I can actually push them you know and how easy I have to go on them how what is hard for that person and not taking them to the point that it's gonna make him throw up if a client throws up that's not that's not a win unless they're asking for it unless they want that when I first started training Laura that was the goal was to make her throw up but that's what she wanted she was like just work me as hard as you can until I throw up and that's what I tried to do every session and she loved it and she stayed with me and now we're getting married so on some level you have to give the client what they want but then you also have to give the client what they need to get better you know most people don't want to work hard you want to give them the the minimum amount of effort put them through the minimum amount of effort to get the maximum amount of results like that's kind of what you need to figure out as a trainer is how to just let them do as little as possible but it's like just enough that it's going to get them the results that they want I found that I mean because most people that you train that's that's gonna be where they're at most people that you train their goal is just gonna be fat loss weight loss they like they don't they're not looking to be an elite athlete they're not looking to train hard and kill themselves in a workout you know so yeah I mean I would say that's probably the biggest thing is just knowing your client learning how to read people learning you know to learning how to teach the client to rest teach the client how to take a break because most clients think that you just have to go go go go you know I'll tell a client what the next thing is and just be like you can go to it when you're ready you know I'm not cracking any whips here it's not about that you know it's not about go go go it's about move at a rate that you can put out the most effort Wow not you know just coming to a complete rest so I mean gosh there's so much that's that's worth talking about here but I would say the biggest thing those what I said first and that's meet the client at their level you know it's very rare to find somebody that you can just punish as much as possible like there's a point where you can get them kind of more excited about working out and more excited about pushing themselves and get to them get them to that place if they want that but you know 95% of the time they don't want that they just want to feel the muscle burn they want to break a little bit of a sweat they want to feel a little out of breath here and there and and that's it the other thing that I've learned is that nobody knows how to eat right don't don't listen to somebody that like if you ask a client you know how's your nutrition and they say oh I eat pretty good that means that you like [ __ ] no everybody everybody says that everybody says ie pretty good you know pretty good to most people is not eating fast food every day you know eating pretty good is having a salad once a week you know having a an apple once a week you know so instead of asking that ask them what did they eat today you know or what did you eat yesterday now if they can't remember that's bad you know most people you're gonna find out have absolutely no idea how to eat properly and that would be something that as a trainer you you must know you must figure that out you must learn how to do that properly because if you can guide somebody in nutrition you're going to get so much more clientele from that because you're going to be way ahead of all the other trainers like at at my gym at the gym that I workout we've got 30 trainers I honestly don't know I mean it's most because I probably don't talk to the other trainers enough but I'm fairly certain that I'm one of the few that know anything about nutrition that I'm one of the few that is confident enough in my nutrition knowledge that I can put somebody on a plan and they will get progress from it like that's that's how the front the the front office gives me clients they give me people that want the nutrition plan because they know I'll do that and that I'll do a good job at it so that would be another thing you know to really know as a trainer because that will put you miles beyond the other trainers that you work with because usually I mean you know compared the average trainer to the average client the average trainer doesn't know how to eat either you know you look around at the trainers at your local commercial gym and you know how good a shape are they of course will find there's probably 5% of them that are impressive and worth worth envying for their physique and those are probably the ones that actually have a decent idea of how to eat right but yeah it's kind of the same it's kind of the same ratio of of people that know how to eat properly so that would be that would be the other the other thing that I've learned the most is like having a good grasp on nutrition will go a very very long way in your training career turns out my client said he's gonna be 20 minutes late so instead of that being the last question let's move on and knock out some more of these lucky you guys right okay next question from Joshua Child dress how on point do you need to be with your diet and exercise to get the benefits of trt I'm 36 years old 250 ish pounds at 22 percent body fat should I continue to diet down not planning to be a bodybuilder or get the single-digit body fat just want to look decent and list lift heavy [ __ ] well Josh I hate to break it to you but at 250 pounds I mean unless you're like super tall I'm gonna guess your body fat percentage is probably higher than that because on trt doses like if that's if that's all you have experience with - I know you don't say that but I'm gonna get because I've seen you comment on my videos before I'm gonna guess that that's all that you've really done is trt and if you're 250 pounds it's not like yet like typically we grossly overestimate the amount of muscle that we have so first of all first of all I would say you're probably not twenty-two percent body fat unfortunately I'm not trying to like bring it down or anything like that I'm just saying you know be realistic about about this and I mean I would say dude like I would keep dieting for sure you know how on point do you need to be with your diet and exercise to get the benefits I mean you're gonna get you're gonna get benefits from TRT from just being TR like doing trt you're gonna get some benefits but it depends on what you think the benefits are gonna be like if your benefits that you're talking about like if you think you're gonna get fat loss No like you're not gonna get it you're not gonna get any fat loss from trt if you're not on a diet if you're not on a good training regime like like you're not going to build much muscle and lose much fat on trt if you're not if you're not damn near ninety to a hundred percent going at it going after it because I mean think about trt is not much different than being natural I mean it's a little better than being natural but it's not much better and what can you do naturally I mean if you weren't able to drop your body fat as a natural because your diet isn't that great or your exercise training isn't that great or your rest isn't that great it's highly unlikely that you're going to get into shape to a respectable body fat percentage not single digits it's gonna be hard for you to get to the like fifteen percent which I think would be a solid goal for you which is probably something like 210 or 215 pounds so you need to think of gear and gear and drugs and all this as a supplement you know nutrition and training are still the number one most important thing in this whole whole set up you know I mean think about that like look at my progress I have been on gear at a TRT level or higher for the last ten years I have had periods of being very high body fat percentage if being on steroids made a difference made that much of a difference I wouldn't have gotten fat at any point I wouldn't have my body fat percentage wouldn't have gone up you know if that if if training and diet didn't matter I mean just look at where I was in December at the end of my bulk I was 266 pounds body fat percentage was probably about 25% and and in December I was eating just very casually I was eating normal I was eating relaxed I was training relaxed for the most part that's what happened I mean yeah I did build a little bit of muscle in that time but I certainly didn't lose body fat you know I have been dieting for like I look the way that I look now because I've been on a diet for the last I mean like I've been with Jordan for nine weeks I haven't cheated on my diet once I haven't had a cheat meal once I've an ADD cake once I haven't had sushi once I haven't had a bite of anything off plan no candy no sugar no sweets baked goods no ice cream nothing I have had nothing off plan and you guys have seen the part like that's why I'm sure that's why I show you my progress so you can see how hard you really have how strict do you really have to be in what kind of progress that will get you and as you can see it's pretty good but it's like it's not that amazing I've been slowly chipping away at this stuff and I'm on a cycle right now you know my diet is as perfect as it can be my training is as optimal as it has ever been everything has been on right now and in the last nine weeks you can look at the progress that I've made by looking at my videos over the last nine weeks and it's not because of the cycle it's because of being on a diet it's because I haven't cheated once because I haven't missed a workout once so because I've drank you know a gallon of water every day I've I've taken all of my health supplements every day I've never missed a meal I've done all my cardio all my steps every single day that's how I mean if you have a goal why wouldn't you put all your effort into it like if you legitimately care about a goal why wouldn't you put everything you can into what you can control and everything that I can control is what I'm doing you know the only thing that's out of my control right now is the fact that we've got Koba 19 going on and Jen some gyms are closed but you know I can either workout at home as hard as possible or I can drive out to the burbs and get to a gym out there and if that gym shuts down for whatever reason I know I can go to Wisconsin or I can go to Indiana which is an hour drive one way or the other and find an open gym there and if those shut down then Scott I'm at home again either way I'm gonna get my training in you know that's really the only thing that's that's up in the air for me it's not easy man you know if you want if you want legitimate results you've got to put in a legitimate effort and that is essentially the bottom line you know even if you don't want to get to single digit body fat many would argue I'm still not single digit body fat I mean if you look at my legs you'd think I was 20% body fat but it still requires effort to just make progress it requires effort if you want to get into if you want to go from 25 percent body fat to 15 percent body fat it's going to require a lot of effort and that's that's it that's the bottom line there all right the dude asks got a recent test results and all was good except my prolactin results came back very high and my shbg was high this is all four months of TRT only cruising at 200 milligrams of tests if the sisters were unrelated to gear he's a type 1 diabetic apparently he's got libido issues he started taking caber for the prolactin his question is here we go since I started a week ago those bedroom issues have not improved should I up the dose to half a milligram of caber and how soon should I get retested thanks that's a good question I would go get another blood test I would keep it at because these things don't change overnight you know it's gonna gradually take that prolactin down the thing is you don't want prolactin to be too low either you know and you just take things slow man that's what I recommend like I would I would give it another week get a prolactin blood test see where you're at and then you know if it's still incredibly high you know if that only took you down to like for hundreds or three hundreds then I would I'd bump it up do half a milligram every other day and hold that for two weeks get another blood test if your numbers are within range then I'll wait another two weeks get another blood test and see if it's stable at that level or if it kept dropping because you don't want it too low either so good question all right next from Santosh Kay how to control high blood pressure and anxiety on cycle how to control high blood pressure so typically anxiety comes from high blood pressure and high blood pressure can come from numerous things okay we're gonna make this one the last question for this video we'll get the rest tomorrow there's a lot of questions here guys good job but we'll end with this one so how to control high blood pressure anxiety is typically caused by high blood pressure so you need to figure out what's causing the high blood pressure and that can be caused by many things it can be high hematocrit it could be not sleeping well if you have some sort of sleep apnea that can cause high blood pressure if your diet is [ __ ] that can cause high blood pressure if your body fat is super high that can cause high blood pressure if you're pretty sedentary if you're not doing any sort of cardio and overweight that can cause high blood pressure so what I would recommend that you do making sure that you're sleeping properly like you have you don't like if you don't have sleep apnea you know sleep is number one here make sure that you are getting you know seven to eight hours of sleep every night and it's good sleep that would be what I would start with and then I would hop on some health some of the health supplements that I listed in my video earlier this week that Jordan has me on that would be number two which would include I mean you also would want to get a blood test because you want to see where your meta critters that but so that would also help you decide what supplements to get on and if your hematocrit was high then I would say you'd want to get on ip6 and if your hematocrit is high you need to start doing cardio because cardio is gonna bring that down there's gonna bring your hematocrit down which is an intern we get you in better shape and get your blood pressure down so sleep more get a blood test see what that shows highly likely that you'll probably need to be doing cardio if your body fats pretty high that cardio will help bring your body fat down if your nutrition is [ __ ] fix your diet that'll help bring your body fat down yeah all those things back to the health supplements ip6 curcumin celery seed extract grape seed extract that's pretty much it there another option in start with all of that and just keep monitoring your blood pressure see what's going on if you've done all of that and you're not you know in the right direction yet some other things that you could do you could order some enalapril you could get some cialis cialis at 10 milligrams a day or every other day is beneficial for opening up your arteries and veins enalapril at 10 milligrams a day will has been proven to lower hematocrit I don't recommend using drugs to do this but high blood pressure is a serious thing and you know if it comes to that get on those to help bring it down but I would start with doing things naturally first better sleep better diet more cardio more steps more activity get in shape drop body fat percentage that's gonna do a shitload for your blood pressure all right and with lower blood pressure will come lower anxiety you won't have any issues with that most likely so that's it guys that's what I wanted to share with you today great questions we'll get to more questions tomorrow I hope you enjoyed this video thanks for keeping me company on my way to work and waiting on my client who's 20 minutes late for whatever reason that's it that's all I got remember nobody cares train harder and I will see you all tomorrow you", "AWEvwNj1eYY": "in today's video we're going to see just how much liquid we can get out of ten pounds of fruit gushers [Music] we have a lot of gushers we do we have about 11.6 pounds of gushers he rapidly depleting eleven point five pounds eleven point four pounds of dusters here guys we may have chosen this experiment today simply for the excuse to have 10 no maybe maybe maybe gushers it's like a fruit snack with like I think it's flavored corn syrup in the middle when you squeeze them or bite them the liquid inside bursts out it gushes fantastic and we have a lot of them we want to try a few things now that Kelly has cleared out Walmart we want to do some experiments with these gushers some things that we often do we might try melting them down and probably freezing them and vacuuming them to see if we can actually get them to burst from the inside out but mostly we want to see what happens if we juice them all I don't know if that's quite the right term I want to collect the liquid from 10 pounds of gushers and see how much that else I don't think milk is the right term here's the basic idea we have over 10 pounds of gushers and we want to try several experiments with them including seeing just how much juice is in one pack but I think the first step is actually just we need to open these I want to see what 10 pounds of gushers actually looks like we're just gonna put them in a bowl we've got a bowl here and we're just gonna fill the bowl with gushers and outside of the packaging I just gotta see what it looks like [Music] before we start juicing all of these there are some other experiments I think we should try out some of our standard stuff I for instance have some liquid nitrogen right here I wanna see what happens when you freeze a gusher solid I bet it does I'm gonna throw in one of each color here [Music] [Music] [Music] huh all those become very fragile dropped like two inches and just shattered apart wait it did well yeah I poured him out of the cup and just the fall from four inches off the table just broke into pieces so they they probably broke I'm gonna try to eat this although it's probably cold enough or this gonna freeze to my tongue so it's just like gummy kind of thought the middle is still frozen so it's kind of crunchy crunchy grocers I love them crunches crunch crunch our gesture cruncher crushers you got a torch is everybody surprised at this point yeah and I think I know exactly was gonna happen it's gonna burn sugar gonna melt first I am actually gonna surprise somebody here you do it mmm look it started burning I'm fine [Applause] oh it melted it fell from my grasp very good melted and burned and smells like burning sugar we've got our vacuum chamber set up with some gushers both in a cup and some just on the bottom of the chamber to see if there's any difference like individual ones will burst we'll see if the collective group of them will expand just generally what are they going to do one inside the cup has started leaking it may have already been leaking before I went into the cup many of them are there's a tiny bit of juice boiling right there yeah there's a few spots where it's bubbling a bit so it looks like a couple of them have ruptured but they may have already had holes in them when they went into the machine they have definitely not all ruptured we'd be able to see it more on these five that are on the floor of the vacuum chamber let's let the pressure back in see what that does there's a very very small change the in the cup they just shrunk down like Oh a few millimeters is pretty minor overall on ruptured it was like normal Nate yeah when did we start this like five hours ago we started at 11:00 it's 4:00 p.m. we started actually like juice extracting juice from these maybe not eleven but like hours ago and we did take a break for lunch in the middle of there but still this has been going on for far too long hours thousands of these gushers we've gone through is not a quick process I never want to see another gusher again my life that's probably a lie it's Friday I'll probably have a gusher before Monday [Music] wait are these our last ones I hate you little the fruit thing and it broke the wrong way so 10 pounds of gushers and what do we have we have about can I combine them just combine them at this point this is pure gusher syrup right there all right Nate we have a cup of juice and we have a pile of empty husks which one do you want to consume first neither I just I got a look at this like this is 10 pounds of gushers worth of juice I mean I'm sure there's a maybe a better process than us just squeezing them into cups but we did our best not to be like if we put him in an industrial grape press or something just squish them all like that but there you go like this is this is never as far as I know no one's ever done this before this might be the largest collection of gusher juice ever assembled heavier than I thought it was gonna be well first we should look at bi that cool color feels like there is a couple like there is like five yellow ones I think there is just a few blue ones with a dark blue juice a lot of the blue gushers have like a purple or red juice in them yeah but some were actually dark blue yeah they got some cool swirls going on in our juice so with this being possibly the largest amount of gusher juice ever collected in one spot I feel like it is our duty to try drinking some I'll do it if you don't want to and then I may puke but and I'm not gonna drink a lot of it but since I don't know that anyone's ever had the opportunity to actually like drink before this is so gross you take bubble gum juice it can't be worse than that oh but if it's as bad then I don't want to do that either all right [Music] [Laughter] how're you doing buddy yeah not great your life choices Wow so it's like sour corn syrup kind of yeah like it has a tartness to it it's also like fruit flavored in a very candy like way I'm not gonna do what you did but that consistency is so well gosh no like as soon as it hits your mouth you're just like well I'm not supposed to drink that and then you taste it and it's just overwhelmingly sickeningly sweet and like a little bit of tartness and just too thick not supposed to drink stuff with that consistency oh wow I did I did I did yeah there is the gusher juice from I just probably drank like a hundred gushers worth of juice which if you think about was probably close to 500 calories in your life this is just there you go pure sugar maybe a stick of butter is more calorie dense than this but I don't know also everything in the studio is now sticky when you didn't mop it we might just get the power washer and you actually see can you hear our shoes that's just like well there's wrappers everywhere but also just our feet are sticking to everything like for example if I just touch knees oh he'll go shower in the middle just video over all right so guys we have the gushy juice I have a suspicion that this stuff will not go bad quickly since it's basically pure in their minds I'm just saying we can hold onto this for a bit I tried drinking a little bit and that was gross but if there's anything really interesting you want to see us do with some gutter juice we now have I'd say about three-quarters of a cup of gutter juice let us know what you want to see we go oh I regret this for you guys click that link up there to see our latest video we'll see in the next one talk to you then [Music]", "1-tYudrj3Oc": "[Music] this is sandy Krakowski and welcome to a real change hey everybody I'm so excited I can't even tell you how excited I am I have a guest today with me Nadim al-haj son the CMO of bangbros we're gonna have fun and just jump into it and just have a conversation here and see where it goes but you are my cannabis expert who converted me to using more edibles and different things without even knowing it amazing good so you know I was typically using what most people would with cannabis and that is inhalation and all that so my first question for you why did you choose watermelon okay so that's my favorite candy yeah okay yeah there are absolutely my favorite candy I mean it's already a gummy in the market that people love yeah yeah let's make it better with THC we did yeah but what's so amazing is I've used other gummies and like I've been using cannabis for three years weaned off of all kinds of medication and it's just changed my life but I've had other gummies where you know like two and a half hours later somebody needed to peel me off the floor you know I was like okay I'm fine I'm waiting for it to kick in goodbye lips right I don't get that with that it's real smooth and I go to sleep one of our core values is consistency and that is that is true to its core and and and so you know it's the infusion method in which we do this is the small batch method that ensures the consistency also the vigorous testing that we do so if you're following the initiative right now testing is something that's going to be coming into the market by next year right very very important think about that testing has not been required the entire 10 years that medical cannabis has been in Arizona I hope that is very that is very concerning yeah very concerning concerning and we were testing long before there were even facilities you know there was one group that was doing it a lot of ambiguity if it was you know even accurate or not but sometimes the expression that any data is better than no data you know and so so through different trial and error methods different mixing methods different implementations you know we would test this batch test this batch and fast forward to here we are today we're testing you know hundreds of batches every single month Wow so I don't I'm not sure if you know but this little green tag right here or on the back of the package there's a white label you can skin or you can enter that batch ID on our website and they don't pull up the test results oh wow yeah so we call that on-demand testing yeah and it's you mean your fitness yeah so just like with supplements transparency is key yes you know if I want to know what I'm consuming the hello from food to supplements to anything ya know and that's something that Thomas and I share him even more so you know sometimes I might dude you're such a geek so check it out though this does this and I'm like well that makes sense you know okay let me check that out so we've wanted to apply that same motto or model and to our products and it should be transparent you should get exactly what is in it you should know that there are no microbe eels in here you should know that the potency is accurate and that leads to your original question the potency right so we have a plus or minus and it is always going to be within two to three milligrams rather - yeah and and if it's not we don't put it out there yeah we district we pour bleach over the batch and throw it away Wow you know and it's we've learned a couple lessons but by doing that because you can't do that too many times no no and we've got a very very meticulous method and that ensures our consistency and that way you can go into any of the 85 dispensaries that we're in in the state get the same product anywhere you go congrat thank you thank you that's incredible I'm not even 30 yet almost my mom\u00eds hearts just like that kind of accountability is what gave me the confidence cause like when kovat hittin that and being used to inhalation and even micro dosing with inhalation throughout the day with a pen I wanted to make sure my lungs were stronger I knew my liver is okay for you know the edibles but you know I don't think people pay attention to if you run a company I don't have time to wake up right and have a cannabis hangover right you know I mean I don't have four hours in the morning to wake up at the dose was wrong absolutely you know and you were in the medical realm of all of this even when they had like medical marijuana farmers market I just moved here three years ago I was like what [Laughter] yeah tell me about it so early on so it became legal in 2010 I had moved here from Oklahoma went to school in Missouri with school in Oklahoma yeah came out here because it it helped a new and dear friend of mine a coach and my mom lived out here and so I was like I gotta go somewhere where I can learn about this and my intention was not to come out here and start an edible company not buy anyway no it was i-i've always been in love with the plant itself ya know yeah it was definitely you know using cannabis at recreationally back in school it wasn't you know wasn't Mike I'm gonna be a you know cannabis you know animal owner some day it was my mom bless her heart I love her she's a total hippie you know so she always just cultivated this this healthy relationship you know was never like it was never very strict mom you know but it was never like there was always an explanation with why it was wrong yeah you know or how to approach the relationship with whatever it be yeah so I'm thankful for that you know it and particularly with with in particular with cannabis you know like there were some times I kind of caught on where she found out I had cannabis and she was like you're gonna have to give that to me and I was like I hit like you know seven sixteen seventeen I was like aha you know and so that opened up and we became very just communicative with each other and I always had this I don't want say hippie but just healthy relationship with cannabis it wasn't ever like seen as a drug you know in my eyes were used as a drug you know and I I grew up wrestling so cannabis is really big and martial arts it's it's it means are up a really wrestling yeah we're going there in a bit yeah but eight or nine I about eight years old I started wrestling and got into it at an early state and there's a lot of story behind that too as to why you know my parents divorced and you know was on ritalin for a long time and it just a sport like that just really kind of you know hold me down and humbled me they say you know when you get put on your ass a couple of times you get humbled let's just say that and so I came to came to Arizona in 2000 into 2008 and I started growing right away you know I had a little closet grow yeah nothing big then just getting familiar with the plant and yeah there was no information out there in the early days nothing not like today like today where you go to like bake grows a column and you're like I'm making tasty drinks yeah and and there there were only forums available online so you dig yeah yeah you know and how to make cannabis butters and how to grow cannabis what medium to use to grow in and all this information a lot of it a lot of it out there and so had an early start into growing it passed in 2010 yeah and so that's when the ball started rolling right I you know got in with some friends that you know helped me financially get into a little bit of a bigger grow and yeah here's the thing though from 2010 to 2011 2011 there were no dispensaries so you've got almost two years that this has been legal but there's no dispensaries but so where do people get their medicine exactly so do you show your card - exactly so there I had friends that were caregivers and I myself as a patient would row I could cultivate and so I would be a cultivator and I could give you your allotment you're two and a half ounces every two weeks right so you would give me your grow right so you would give a caregiver your grow rights and then they could then their grow your play okay now I got two right so you weren't just my deal or I could exit right and it was and that was how it worked right now is a donation base you know I'm donating my grow rights to you and you can cultivate for me well what do you do with the excess you know and so I wasn't a big proponent on dealing and some I didn't yeah a very great area yeah yeah so you have these farmers markets right it's exactly what it sounds like if you go to the uptown farmers market over off like 26th Street in Bethany the biggest farmers market here it's yeah beautiful and lots of food all kinds and stuff it was just like that except indoors you've got 40 vendors that are been in all kinds of cannabis products I'm talking anything you can think of from capsules the cookies to cake pops to popsicles - we made it all we made it no you know and this is still around the time when we're trying to figure out dosing yeah and and that was a that was a real propeller in in Thomas and i's journey which which is about three years later because I'd gone to Washington and come back which maybe we'll get to and so those farmers markets allowed an opportunity to really start building a network you know like the other vendors and the other people that had these the caregivers and stuff like where some of us are still friends you know a small small group there's a lot of them weeded out but some of us are so contented [Laughter] no it's good some are now managers within dispensaries and so it's it's cool to see how everybody's evolved you know and Thomas and I we had met at the end of 2008 became friends we had no idea we're gonna be doing an edible business we connected over the similar interest yeah yeah right you know he had he'd recently lost his mother was you know kind of finding his life you know he went yeah did a five-year term in the Navy um it awesome you know he was a submariner so now yeah that can you know so we stayed connected the whole time and when he had come back from the Navy I had just left for Washington and then I had returned not too long after okay and that's when we were like hey cuz he you know he just got back he was taking a break he wanted to go to school to be a doctor still does and still will actually yeah very very very again he's just that mindset so be amazing yeah he's he's fun to talk to and so that's when we really connected because I came back and and while I was in Washington the Denver High Times Cannabis Cup in 2013 that was the first year it had ever come to America it all had been in Amsterdam oh wow right I had no idea yes so that and it was in Denver Colorado mmm was a big deal because Denver had just passed Connor creational that's it so you've got this event that has 50,000 people because it's recreational right and it's the first recreational cannabis event bigger than what stock saying it is it is it is contact hi - oh my gosh the whole city of Denver was lit let's just say and so and so I went as a just as a participation I was like I'm not this is history like I'm going yeah yeah the following year is when I'd come to Thomas and I was like let's enter the High Times Cannabis Cup it was like you're high yeah let's enter the High Times campus we can do this yeah and you know he you know crack jokes on me he was like no dude you're crazy he was going to school at the time and I was like listen dude we can do this and he was like all right find out the information let's at least Leslie see what's up you know I somehow got ahold of Rick oosik which was the editor at High Times during that time yeah contacted him phone call phone call phone call and he basic said Nadeem listen cuz I'm like well how much do we bring how many edibles does it how much do we make he's like it's gonna be the biggest cannabis farmers market you've ever been apart harbor's but I was like got it so make as much as I can like anything that I can write and so then we got the booth okay yeah so now I'm like hey yeah we can do this and I was like hey we should enter our products to join win he was like dude you're just pushing the limits and I'm like yeah let's try and do this and so we were making gummies at the time we were making brownies at the time which we don't make um hey you know baked bros 2 2 2 2 different directions either we make baked goods or we're baked right right so we're making cookies brownies gummy cereal bars all that stuff the gummies were really they've always been our niche and we get to there before we leave III said hey let's let's enter the cup and hmm you know he gave me some smack for it and then he said I tell you what and I believe he was joking at the time yeah he said if we win the Cup I'll drop out of school and I'll go full-blown bake oh my god I didn't hear this story yeah he goes I'll commit full-blown bake gross oh my god definitely so I said okay deal and you're the first contest oh yeah oh yeah oh yes and this is 2014 so I'm like okay cool man like I didn't really take it that I could use the help well fast forward we won the cop so our sour kick-ass which are still on the market today they had won the cup they won People's Choice so that means the people voted for our products we didn't even enter that product we entered a medicated baklava yeah yes yes when my mom comes to town I'll have her make some I would absolutely deliver something because it's a 45 year old recipe only the women in my family habit and she just so happened to infuse it oh my word it is fantastic it is fantastic and so we wanted to enter that into the medical cup and we're like yeah let's another medicated baklava it's a unique product like yeah yeah but he's got any didn't even make that make the charts you know yeah so again sour cush kids got voted by the People's Choice so we're at the award ceremony and we're like hoping to hear you know we didn't get it and then the following award was the sour kush kids and we're like taking my surprise yeah so it's like all of a sudden something just set in to us and were like oh [ __ ] like what does this mean I think we just broke through oh so that's what that was the beginning of what really brought us married yeah you know so I came back to Arizona with that under our belt started writing proposal letters of dispensaries got picked up by a dispensary and up north we were working there fast forward a little bit and you know we've been with true med dispensary now for going on about a little over three years yeah now we're in 83 dispensaries and rocking and and to close the loop on on Thomas he did he show me that I was going off to Denver yeah and the day of the cup he had a final so he finished the final okay the final yeah and then he had come out they come out to either finish the final or he had gotten approval from the professor to do the final when he got back and he told his professor like what he was doing and she was totally supportive like which is really cool because I could have gone any way could have gone any way of that happening super cool won the award I looked at him and like you know he said he finished out the semester and now going strong it's been really cool that story's just so incredible and in since then we've now got upward of 40 employees Wow we've got a strong leadership team a strong team marketing team production team packaging team distribution team and let me take a breath because let me say it has been a challenge oh oh while it has been wild yeah building I never thought that building people along with building myself would be something that I was doing ya know leading people and leading people as a group you know like I'm I'm finally finally after five years of actually being baked grows me in a business settling into my role you know which is a CMO which let's talk about labels right yeah we talked about like see chief ma officer it's like no man yeah I don't know like I'm not I don't know it's a it's a it's weird hierarchy it's yeah it's weird goofy it really is it's like it's you have to have this title so yeah you can get certain speaking engagements right it's it's because people see that yeah and then they're like oh oh my goodness you know it's like I should take you're serious I'm just yeah right right like I'm just a person just like you you know what I mean and this is what I happen to be really good at yeah and and want and impassionate about so I want to continue to be good at it and get her and I guess this is the label that I have to take on you know so Thomas and I always joke with each other we're like we're not CEOs weirdoes you know but you know from the outside looking in from other people we are and we have to own it you know it's a part of our ego my ego at least yeah yeah well aren't you play the role something you know says says you know yeah you want that title you want that title and then the other part of me like my soul self is like I agree yeah we care about titles no but it's it's got me to where its it's a part of what's got me to where I am today and and like I said finally settling into the role of who I am and what I'm to do now you know we've if we want to talk about the organization we can and so we brought on a director of business development a year ago right we recruited him well he worked at Apple for a very long time about 10 plus years and he built sales teams that's what he did he built sales teams good fine so an apple is a culture everyone admires I'm going to say we're a lot of people it's obviously absolutes right Amazon Costco Apple you know Nordstrom's like model yeah yeah yeah right these these these cultures that they have and so he really brought that you know for us right in the right time because Thomas and I were maxing out you know it's right we can't be the smartest people at the table anymore I'm not a CMO I don't have these answers yeah yeah you know right and so we needed somebody to to come in not necessarily to teach us how to be a CEO or teach us how to be CMO or CFO or any of that it was just the competencies yes on how to level up right coachup coach up coach out you know and and those competencies are what you know Dell is his name brought to the table for us so um some of the company's been like communicating effectively right what does that mean you hear it yeah right yeah yeah skilled version of communicating effectively look like yeah it is an unskilled version yeah yeah kidding effectively look like right and so in the moment you know he would call it out if we're talking or arguing or which we don't argue anymore we just know we could you know each other's love languages and an apology languages we've got to talk about absolutely absolutely a big component yeah you know and everybody needs everybody has to anybody that comes onto our leadership team they have to do their languages because to prevent arguments yeah to allow to communicate effectively like talking to different languages yes yeah you're talking Italian and I Chinese totally I don't hear you I'm just waiting I really like you I'm just waiting to give myself that's it you know and we need to actively listen to each other you know so having somebody that came onto the team like Dell was able to bring a component of radical candor and just man it hurts when somebody calls you out on your [ __ ] [Music] that component of radical candor and being able to receive that type of me vacuum in the moment you know runs congruently with you know learning these different competencies of just how to be a better person yeah yeah it's and it's not that it levels just our communication up in the business but life yeah like my relationships are better for sure my family relationships are better my friendships are better I mean you sign me up someday someday yeah I look forward to that that's um that's really my goal with one of my goals within the company is to you know be a thought leader and a thought speaker for this information because I know how impactful it's been again for our organization myself yes you you know yeah to be able to communicate here today with you yeah like it is wouldn't it happened before cannabis no way no not not where I was huh and you said you came from from now I'm interviewing right you say no best format you said you were from Kansas City I was there for a couple years okay Kauai I grew up from Detroit area that's right okay got it so Midwest area yeah yeah I grew up in Branson Missouri right yeah Branson Missouri is where I was in Leawood oh cool yeah yeah my babies live in downtown Kansas City buzzer awesome like my family's there right now my parents were there there my stepfather does like he builds businesses we'll just say that and so he's over there building out of business right now yeah and so she's like come on we're at the casino I'm like no get out of the casino what do you do it out man I don't know what's going on right now she's like nobody's here it's great yeah first time the casino didn't have smoke [Laughter] so just having having somebody come onto our team at the right time this is a little over a year ago again call it call it divine if you will you know I will and I was like I had met del from from the cannabis industry he built a dispensary here and then let's just say we recruited him right the best people already have jobs yes most people already have jobs absolutely you know they really do go get them yeah I'm learning this the hard way so you know he was making a transition and we were able to get him onto the team right at the right time and he brought a couple other people from Apple and it was just like did we manifest this happen we're doing submit my resume yeah it is every single day every single day it is his growth yeah it is it is seriously growth and I I don't portray it a lot I don't think on my own my social you know and and it's it's because people only see what you want to be like we only show people what we want to see yeah you know yeah I guess it's figuring out how to put it into a format you know and yeah with that I guess why I'm sharing that is because again someday I hope to teach people this these things you know and and and and it started from a drug yeah yeah started all because of an illegal drug Wow a beautiful plant I know that is our mission to eliminate the negative stigma associated with this beautiful alternative that is so good right which is why I'm super excited to be with you because like you know me I'm just a radical out-of-the-box spiritual girl who loves God and and I really feel like God asked me to break shame off that plan amen you know and the cool thing is is just where we connect because I'm the same way if I got to put on my CEO hat that's where my inner [ __ ] comes out way too much you know okay I gotta be bossy you know but you really a label I'd love to put on you as you are such a prophet and you are so apostolic in activating things in the realm and those are churchy words and we don't typically hear in business but that's the realm where I live right because God didn't call me to the church realm but I see so much healing in what you did I want to backtrack to when you were like in wrestling in that because you can see going from a tough childhood into a sport having such empathy and even awareness and being exposed to this concept of cannabis for pain because of your coach yeah and look but it's but that should be the new normal right that as you chased that it opens that up so tell me like you were not just playing around with wrestling I mean you were at okay I've got notes here but Oklahoma State cuz I didn't know there's like that's when you go when you're like the Olympic level make me blush so so I I went I got a scholarship to a school called to a college in Tulsa Oklahoma called bacon college and that's where I wrestled okay for a year and then I had gone to Oklahoma not Oklahoma State but Norman Oklahoma University and I had spent about a semester there okay I didn't actually go to school there I didn't like you know spend a whole I didn't go to school I ended up dropping out I'm an I'm um call a dropout but me too I spent a semester there and then I had moved to Missouri to to Arizona because I had met my coach and the assistant coach Matt and in Oklahoma and he had Crohn's disease right nobody knew what it was however he would smoke a joint yeah and cannabis helping him is again what led me to come to Arizona and I was fortunate to have my mom living here California was course an option right it's so sad it was so saturated yeah already been legal for I think almost 20 years yeah so there's like I'm just a I'm just a pee going there yeah Arizona's pushing to go legal for the third time that led me so immediately when I came to Arizona though I I got into just the wrestling crowd you know I got a job at Applebee's some lady saw my tears and she was like oh you have cauliflower ear and I was like yeah she's like do you fight cause like no I wrestled and she's like my husband teaches jiu-jitsu and I was like I've never done jiu-jitsu she's like we'll come over he trains out of the house garage and they ended up living a mile away from me and and this man has been a mentor of mine for 10 years now Wow yeah and and his name's Bobby's I love the men you know and we talked a little bit you and I offline about your story a little bit on you know being on 140 milligrams of was an oxy cotton 140 milligrams oxycontin and 90 milligrams prednisone every day yeah and so a very similar story with him his health took a decline so I started training jiu-jitsu and got an MMA in cage fighting and his health started to take a decline and my family had a restaurant we're you know so I was working at the restaurant and that closed just a series of events and we lost connection Bob and I and that's how it just really started taking a bad decline and we reconnected about three years ago he reached out to me I had reached out to him a few times I have this I'm leaning into this more now than ever is like when you think of somebody it's not by coincidence no it's you should reach out to him okay so I would I would unknowingly I would just you know unknowingly of that thought I would just reach out to my came in Miss you hope everything's well you haven't seen you for a long long long long time right and finally I think it got to him and and and he had reached out and he said I'm done like I'm hanging in the coat like I'm done I'm done with these opiates and tell me about this yeah you know tell me about he's familiar with cannabis smoking and stuff but I think he'd just been watching and seeing what we're doing and he came over and Thomas came over and I think Nick came over to is another you know one of our buddies yeah we all talk cannabis you know in three four hours later he ate one of these watermelon slices after 3-4 hours of me explaining the processes he ate the watermelon cuz he's like this is [ __ ] delicious yeah that you should start yeah yeah and you know from there I mean he was on I think 90 milligrams of oxycontin and I think like upward of like 60 milligrams of morphine yeah yeah together yeah and he was doing those you know simultaneously hmm put together and troubles with insurance yeah travels with the doctor is trying to travel yeah he said he said I'm done yeah no yeah and he made the hard switch and this is what breaks my heart though is that the regimen that we were able to provide for him I don't want to say it's impossible to scale it's very difficult to scale yeah because everyone's gonna be a little different everyone's different and yes the amount of milligrams that he needed yes is not affordable in the dispensaries yeah no no I get it yeah I mean we're talking to 300 milligram bottle of our syrup a day yeah a day right you know and yeah you're talking like $1,000 a month absolutely yeah absolutely you know and so I was very fortunate you know in our situation to be able to it got to the point where like we can't do a 300 milligram bottle every single day like this man needs like a hundred milligrams you know periodically stretched out throughout the day right know upwards of 500 milligrams so that's one distillate came into the picture correct distillate hash oil right it's a refined process it's a distal ated process of hash oil right and a whole other conversation yeah yeah because there's so many different hash oils yeah yeah but what that did distillate is it gave us a it gave us a base for accurate dosing karere and so you're taking something that is in a flour form right which may be 10 to 15 milligrams per gram right and you are taking this bulk cannabis flower you are concentrating it you know through using certain solvents that can extract the THC correct other components of it Reds and then you can clean it up there's many different ways of cleaning it up you can filter it you can distill it so distillation again removes primarily all the lipids and strips primarily the the the the profile of cannabis but leaves behind the THC right okay so now you have something that is upward of 900 milligrams per gram yeah okay huge difference is that similar to like I used RSO quite a bit when I was winning yes yeah yeah RSO is a little different yeah that was that's a horror so changed the world changed my life changed a lot of people's worlds yeah so RSO preserves that full spectrum profile of the cannabis plant yeah so distillate you remove a lot of that except for the primary cannabinoids of THC and a couple others right there's like trace you know yeah amounts however that is what gave us the the foundation to be able to help him you know so we would make capsules right you know I would make capsules for him now he makes them himself yeah yeah you know and this is again years ago so now we can make whatever we want we make 50 milligram capsules we make 100 milligram capsules 200 milligrams yeah however I do believe and Derick our former director of education now our creative director has found some information out there that like your receptors can only take so much THC pressure for it's just it's like taking too much vitamin C for sure yeah yeah so there is an optimal yeah right and so he was using this hundred milligrams periodically throughout the day and you know it's he's completely pharmaceutical free now you know I think he's yeah he just came out of surgery so he's had to use you know some steroids and South but that's all right beyond that I mean it is it's changed his life again absolutely and people don't get to hear these stories no you know or they don't understand that this is not side of the road Cheech and Chong right okay I didn't want AXI so now I just want to be high as hell and I'm getting out my medicines and that's it's fascinating too it's fascinating that it heals yes you yes mine and body yeah and body yeah it provides the amount of alleviation that you need yes to feel yeah and you feel how to feel what feeling good feels like right people have forgot what feeling good feels like so then when you have a little taste of it again you're like this is what feels like you know same with food you know yeah let's get what it feels like to feel good eating food you know and it's something especially like right now we're living in what I will call the group single greatest love a trauma to hit globally then that I've ever experienced you have so many people now walking around who've been literally traumatized by kovat and all the other different things and my journey started because of awareness of trauma crazy thing I don't know how many stories you hear about this I had no interesting cannabis like using cannabis when I was in high school was the drug I didn't want you know what I mean I didn't enjoy the munchies I didn't enjoy the cottonmouth I couldn't stand the paranoia why do I want to sit around like a vegetable going hmm and and yet I began to study what happens with the endocannabinoid system and the plasticity of the brain by using the full plan yes to help the brain release trauma to restore plasticity how the endocannabinoid system can you speak into that because I think a lot of people who are hesitant are just like no I don't wanna be high but I was higher on opiates right do you get what I'm saying I was nor out of it well yeah the dissociation that happens in the numbing I believe that's the word right there's a disassociation that yeah and that's what I was I guess trying to say with cannabis is like you you you all of a sudden get to feel what it feels like to feel again yeah right you are not disassociated from your mind and body alright and and and that is a concern of people they're like I don't want to get high well yeah of course a lot of people don't want to get high no and and it's I find it fascinating I would love to hear your your story or experience with the to the patients that we've worked with that require high milligrams more that are winging off or transitioning right they don't often get high yeah and I'm talking they're using high milligram doses yeah I take 50 milligrams I'm speaking cursive yes now I am with which is so wild that I could use super high dose right and now it's five telegrams maybe 1020 in a day or just 120 milligram coming at night and when I have my Remicade I might use some plant or something because of the pain in that but after a day or two I'm iron and so and so that could be associated to the enou cannabinoid system yes right because is a system in place that is its its primary purpose is to help us meet homeostasis right right right so if we're on all kinds of these pharmaceuticals we are way out of whack way right we're requiring high doses and effort transitioning we're requiring high doses of cannabinoids right to fill these holes right yeah homeostasis and then as we begin to heal that lessens right yeah that lessens and so that's that's how we did it with Bob - I mean we titrated him up we titrated him down yeah staggered his dose that's a tie in and that way it wasn't just like 300 milligrams all at once so it was you know every four hours yeah a little to prolong that experience or that that relief that he would get from it and you know we've had success with it's been a roller coaster ride yeah but we've had success with it well and the other thing is people are so used to just okay my doctor said I'm supposed to take my pill at this time mmm that you're not paying attention to what's going on with your pain like first thing I did is broke the percocet that was used for breakthrough pain so instead of a full percocet I took a half a percocet and a little bit of RSO under my tongue and what's fascinating though is I remember when it began to really heal and I had been off all the opiates for about a month or so and I'm now really micro dosing way down because I'm not using as much because my big high dose was to prevent I had no side effects that's also when I wound off everything that's that that's I had to work with that but I felt like I took a limitless pill like a Baba sudden it was like 30 days in and I would be just like whoa I haven't felt that part of my brain since I was two that's not why that was actually a level of clear yeah endocannabinoid system do that like what is so I'm not scientist my body so healed I don't get that anymore I would I would encourage it's because the endo cannabinoid system is meeting homeostasis more optimally right and so that could very well be it and that that feeling or a moment of clarity is against something that you have not had an experience for the however long you know you were on the pharmaceuticals and so now your body is like whoa yeah I see color I taste I see I smell I can't cry and feel and get a relief right it's crazy how much cannabis heals and this is where you know some of my fellow Christians are like oh you're treading on dangerous land but who created it there's a there's a funny opens you there's a funny meme out there that said God created gave us cannabis and then man made it illegal yeah hello yeah and yeah I grew up I grew up with the Muslim father yeah and a Christian mother yeah how's that work yeah well they divorced yeah and I moved to Missouri they from Texas redneckville oh yeah I'd y'all smoking oh my god you bringing it out of me if you've ever seen the movie or the show Ozarks yeah I lived in Ozarks yeah pretty damn accurate you know and so careful who you choose to be friends with you know and and yeah exactly and so my father remained in Texas and he's still there today remarried lots of siblings beautiful wife all that and my mom got remarried as well and however when we moved to Missouri so I was seven we moved in with my uncle which was I don't know if this is a politically correct term but bible-thumper I'm talking I'm talking Baptist alcohol can hand on the table this is how it goes yeah you know and I spent the next three years living with him and it's I put a lot of I put a lot of thought into this and and over the years because it shaped me um it shaped me it traumatized me it scared me it also established a lot of morals mm-hmm and values I'm so grateful for yeah you know I was having this conversation not too long ago I mean it was his house that I learned the proper manners you know yeah just manners are for other people that's what it's for yeah and in structure right I I learned a lot of structure from this from this man and I mean it was church every Sunday every Wednesday sometimes even Saturday's my Bible studies and all that jazz and and I just remember you know I so vividly the the pastor just smacking the the podium like you're gonna go to hell if you do not believe Jesus as the Son of God yeah and that put that put the fear of God in just a little bit so I'm thinking I'm like doesn't lead you to a great relationship yeah just a fear and I'm like wait a minute my dad's Muslim and so I'm bawling my eyes out you know and he took the opportunity to it was my opportunity to be saved you know and right I'm glad that's the reaction I got I didn't know the difference my eyes out and he's like you know read this verse and you know you've been saved by Christ and you get baptized and all the stuff and I didn't know what it meant you know I mean like okay yeah well I mean I went back and forth I went to Texas I went to Missouri because that always was my dad I went overseas many many many times they'd always joke hey what's your religion you know do a half and a half and I'm like well you get it I'm milkshake yes and so it was always kind of a joke in when I got into college I took a world religions class yeah that's when I'd open the door was I started I learned about different religions and yeah I have a very passionate interest about the answer and and learned that Christ is arguably one of the most influential people of our time that what he did he was and there's so much to talk about right Christ Muhammad Krishna Buddha Native American wisdom there's no are all religions are they all against cannabis no whoa devil's lettuce the devil's lettuce right I remember I got my grandma to try a sour cush kid once and she tried it and and and and then the following day she was crying and she was praying to God to ask for forgiveness but but she has no problem taking or xanax every night so I was just like gosh dang it grandma are like oh you know what's something though is that like I want to open up the conversation of self-control mmm because like is it the tequila is it the cannabis is that that this is that the better is it self-control that when our spirits are not governed by all these rules but we operate with that understanding that power that we have to just moderate how do you have self-control if you've if if your surrounding doesn't really encourage it you know like yeah like growing up in Missouri right I mean this is what you did this is how it worked there was no outlier that was like no that's actually not right yeah you know that's not true about cannabis all right that's not true about medicine or religion or whatever there was none of the I think it was from hell right right right I smell a skunk that must be a demon my mom when we would because you know Missouri and she would smell a skunk I never understood yeah yeah she's like oh she likes love that smell like you're weird mom now I totally get it yeah I'll loop back to self control but you would ask is cannabis you know wrong in all religions and so that brings up an interesting interesting points because it's encouraged me to learn about this and so cannabis originated in China okay that's where that's the beginning of time that we that we know of fine they weren't using it to get high now they were using it for medicinal purposes and they would use the roots okay and they would they would boil the roots and they would make tea out of it okay not gonna get high from that but there are vital cannabinoid and you know other other components EBD know so the cannabinoid to my understanding cannabinoids will not be in the root okay of the cannabis plant and it's more vital cannabinoids components right and they would use that they would make topicals out of it they make teas out of it Wow okay so this is we're talking almost three thousand years ago a long time it transitioned into India that's when I started getting a little okay gotcha psychedelic yeah yeah they started using the flower in the plant right and so we were yeah and so we were talking about this yesterday actually so it's really fresh right now that's when cannabis was used for started began to be used for you for purposes and spiritual purposes and India has a festival called Holi festival and during this time they would sell preparation called bong or Bank DHA ng okay and this is a drink it's it's a it's a it's a drink it has different forms like a yogurt form and different forms and they would sell it during this this festival and it had you know you would get high from it right and they're still out there today like if you were to ask if you would be in India and ask them about cannabis they would kind of look at you funny right if you said bong leave it go yeah you know yeah and it's interesting it is and so that's when like the food preparation of cannabis you know came and it transitioned to Middle East which is still so crazy that there's very few plants you can actually bake and put in something and it maintains its structure totally that's just so freakin miraculous that that took yes God to create that yes can't do that with other players plant is an alien plan resistant and from there it made its way into the Middle East and that's when it that's when it started getting really strong yeah you know in a lot well a lot of people will say because of the growing conditions yeah right that influences how the plant grows rain you know altitude and soil and conditions all of that has a big role to play in it but I wanted to close the loop on on do all religion see it as as wrong but some religions or some cultures such as the Indian culture and new culture they they see it as a spiritual practice you know and it can be there there are there are people today who have cannabis ceremonies yeah you know and that is a high dose experience yeah yeah and I've been there you like like yeah unintentionally yeah no oh yeah like when I ate when I had a sucker yeah last week that you I did ask you then oh dear God that's when I was praying I can't god help me come this way what happened right and you can have a borderline out-of-body experience you know I wanted to always being your an out-of-body witnessing what is happening and it's like what is going on it's crazy lemon juice just put lemon juice in water and it was okay that's awesome for my listeners I I didn't intend to get that high I for some reason there's not thinking and I didn't know the suckers were just for licking for medicinal i literally chewed the dang thing in a minute and a half and then in about 20 minutes couldn't feel my lips and was i live by myself was laying over my counter and i got some lemon it's wild though how you can use lemon or you tell me even pepper hmm so there's I'm sure there's a terpene within the lemon juice yeah Dee limonene or or somewhere probably one of those that helps same thing with pepper so beta carry off a lien is another Fein that is a common terpene in cannabis but just smelling it you obviously don't want to you know inhale no no it's kind of smell it a little bit and that can help reduce the nausea right associated to being high right beyond that I mean buckle up so many people like like when I talk about cannabis I've been building business obviously I talk about God openly and I love all people so they thought I went off the deep end and yet I'm gonna make a radical statement if I had to have surgery I'm not against opiates mmm that was never any work well here's the deal I was never addicted I was tolerant my body was tolerant I did not you know thank God because of all different kinds of thing was not psychologically dependent but physiologically now in retrospect we're talking 2004 to 2017 I was on opiates Wow so I find it more demonic what the opiates did to my mind my inability to heal my inability to process when I say cannabis opened me you know I don't know how many stories you've heard on that that's what I wanted to ask you where it was now time to feel and I felt like as it healed and for me it's just physiology at science I didn't get high and then I felt my body was healing and my brain and my heart and my soul could operate together men and I cuts they're driven yes and I could process and some of the feelings were so much that the cannabis actually helped it not get too overwhelming right when you're healing and and that that that healing that being able to feel is really what I think the the root of it is is because these opiates or pharmaceuticals can condole you down and and I want to be clear because you had said you're not against or I'm not against opiates and the proper usage thank God if I have to have surgery you ain't touching me without a so just for the audience listening right now I'm not saying that pharmaceuticals are all bad no work for some it's just that the long-term use yeah and the side effects that can that accompany it are are detrimental to your health like your bad is what I mean like they can hurt you you could use half the dose even after surgery by using your gummies and whatever pain medicine they give you and you'll use that yeah I mean I have friends that have had surgeries and use none yeah absolutely I had all four wisdom teeth pulled out and they gave me a bottle of them and I was like I'm good I got syrup Yeah right I didn't touch it awesome no you know and and have quite a few friends that are like that and them just again being able to feel again is what is the healing come is one of the healing components of what cannabis does right cannabis Jason Silva talks about this a lot and I love it because it couldn't be more true is that canvas has this innate way of moving our mind from the past removing our mind from the future and just allowing us to focus right here and now and some people experience that and and unintentionally and they don't even understand and when you can be here and now you can feel you can process you can rationalize you can think logically you know that's why you know you use cannabis or smoked cannabis eat it whatever and you start wondering how things work ya know right right it didn't it instills one curiosity and you're wondering yes yes yeah yeah it instills wonder back into your life right I think wander is is is maybe something that a lot of people lack now you know because wander could be correlated to perspective yeah you know it's like to be to have a proper communication I have to be able to objectively commute perceive objectively you know like yeah if I disagree with something that's okay yeah yeah you fishing that absolutely right I still need to wonder where your perception is coming from yes right yeah and and try at least to see that at versus being so close-minded to it okay you know and I'm just like no that's not how this is how it works you know and so little tools like cannabis being one of those right we there are there are plant induced modalities or plant modalities there are non plant modalities right meditation right and absolutely competencies and that can again instill wander right and that wander again is what can lead to healing right because I truly truly feel of all the practices I have done I've used cannabis for 15 years okay I've done other plant medicines I've dabbled with psychedelics we're going to talk about that yeah and and and very all are very powerful tools I do not think any single one is the answer not only they are all tools toolbox right if I have a screw I can't hammer it in maybe the proper tool exactly right so good and and so of all of those what I believe they boiled down to is awareness and love so combine those you have love you know right I cannot love you if I'm not aware and I cannot be aware if I do not have love for the other person and so what all of that compiles into is integration right conversation conversation is the integration of all of this work because when we can talk about it when we can rationalize and see each other's perspective that's where a lot of healing can come and yeah yeah we're not I mean I read a statistic recently that married couples I don't know how many people was done but like they talk to their spouse on average 28 minutes a week and I'm like what no that's insane you know right yeah and so it just that one statistic just goes to show how disconnected we are yeah in a time where we are where's my phone more connected than ever yeah right yeah they're so disconnected yeah you know that that human interaction and and again being able to comprehend the communication that's happening that in itself it's it's talk therapy you know that in itself is extremely powerful which leads to cannabis use or psychedelic use because there are if I may open the door on using psychedelics yeah yeah so and we're talking micro dosing Vitamix which is something I mean well let's back up for just one quick sec because one of the things we were talking about is that the number one thing that changed my life as I started sleeping hmm so like I'm 56 today 52 and a half years old and I'm now sleeping through the night okay that's why sometimes I'm like okay was it the sleep and the cannabis healing the endocannabinoid system that actually gives you the awareness to go deeper even in your own life to go into the stuff that might have been scary because like two weeks of I felt like all I wanted to do is sleep for a month initially and then you wake up and you have the exhilaration like you used to when you were a kid when you wake up because you wake up rested yes and then you're open to different things now going in is psychedelics go ahead into that on sleep there's a book called why we sleep by Matthew Walker he's a sleep expert and K is fantastic okay it will dynamically change your priority list for sleep you can add anything you want of mine oh my don't touch my yeah and there's a large there's a large contribution to healing health healing to sleep ya know when we sleep we heal right we have to and so what what's happening when we use cannabis is and there's there's there's some articles out there on this that talk about this we skip the REM State yes okay we skip um rapid eye movement that's where that's largely associated to where we dream right okay right and we skip this rim sleep also during if you have a lot of rim your sleep isn't always the best because people who suffer from PTSD yeah it may fall in that that that ever stay deep right that stage of sleep there's four stages I believe there are awake light rim and deep right and so when when we in like you said we go in cycles those cycles repeat itself three or four times a night light REM deep light REM d you wake up feeling exhausted yes if you don't get enough sleep or if you wake up in the wrong sleep state yeah wrong stage of sleep by skipping rim a lot of people who use cannabis don't dream often and if anybody who has used cannabis for quite a while and then stops using cannabis yeah if there are listeners right now you may be shaking your heads about to know what I'm gonna say you have very vivid dreams very married yes and and they can be bad they can be good I mean I had dreams of riding a motorcycle through the Amazon with Joe Rogan once I was like wow yeah so it's a sign what's up Joe very very vivid very real make you feel exhausted when you wake up you know and so you using cannabis you skip that and you go you go into deep sleep and that's why sometimes we feel a little bit more rested yeah you know however you know Matthews Walker Matthew Walker's book really highlights the importance of all the stages and rim in deep sleep and and and I may have this wrong or backwards but rim is more of a hormonal healing sleep state right our deep sleep is a physical yeah in sleep right yeah you may have that backwards but I believe that's correct and so there's this Acadian the circadian rhythm so there's there's a there's a there's a you have to go through all the cycles right and so that's why people who use cannabis will get really deep rested state and they feel better and yeah and and but we still want to shine light on that on that REM state and so going back to the endocannabinoid system we have endo cannabinoids right and then there are exogenous cannabinoids can I have annoyed czar in many things not just cannabis right food really Whole Foods and so there are two primary endocannabinoids there's two AG and an and amide okay Amanda might Ananda in Greek means bliss so they coined it as the Bliss molecule hmm really really we're alive and so if you've ever been working out yeah I had that runner tires oh yeah yeah that's an animai yeah I'm gonna run for president so working out or like that runner's high or entering flow state Remo with Marshall larger yeah we talked riding even riding even getting into that flow State yeah that's an and amide and that'n and amide you're literally getting high on your own supply so for people listening that have ever experienced that it I've never used cannabis yeah you've experienced the euphoria that comes with cannabis yeah that is it exactly one of the billing is the out-of-body experience but your body was still doing everything listen yeah you know that that runner's high yeah that I know a lot of people can relate to that is a component of what's happening so when when we use cannabis were we're if we aren't sleeping well or there's something in our body that we're just not healing for mind or body we're lacking a certain cannabinoid that's one component of it yeah yeah we're lacking some type of cannabinoids so we either need to change our diet or we can use other modalities like cannabis right that we are now bringing in exogamous cannabinoids right and so when we bring those in or in no cannabinoid systems like yeah and so or energy that laughs yes it doesn't go up and be like oh my god I'm gonna die consistent yeah right you're giving your body what it wants know what it needs you know and and that will then contribute to better sleep as way you know and that's that's a component of it and so from there we'll we were talking about psychedelics but sleep is so so so so important well and you know what's crazy too is they talk about the health of the gut and sleep and you know I battle Crohn's and I'm grateful for Remicade but even using like the gummies and stuff like that from baked grouse I'm excited to use the syrups because you can really titrate down to small amount of milligrams but my last Remicade I didn't even use any inhalation I've had two Remicade since all this cop\u00e1n nonsense and craziness has started but what was amazing is I actually felt better two days in because my number one objective with Remicade which is a lot of people with like chemo and stuff is to sleep mm-hmm I need to sleep for the night you know the doctor says I need you to sleep as much as possible when you feel like crap you're like oh yeah thank you very much for that because I haven't been sleeping for six weeks you know but you use that and you literally can feel your body the only thing I can say pharmaceutical wise is like when you feel horrible you have pneumonia you take an antibiotic and a week or so later also do you feel like quote-unquote yourself again but what that what the cannabis does with the deep sleep and with restoring the in the endocannabinoid system restoring itself right that is self healing right there gosh there are I feel we're gonna have to do another episode to talk about self healing and self-love yeah because there's a lot of healing that comes from that self-love and and and the cannabinoids that you get from products like these right so yeah yeah let's talk about the syrups okay so the syrups I can't wait to try them it's a great product and these are indica so these are indica do they come in both yes they do okay come in indica and sativa these are so there's a green tag on them and they'll tell you so this is granddaddy purple okay this is the unflavored syrup what's unique about the the syrups is that they are they it's a very health conscious product yeah okay we're talking primarily organic brown rice syrup no flea are no colors no artificials at all Wow real fruit extracts you know how in our flavored ones diabetics safe sugar free I mean it's that we made this product for that reason for sure yeah and micro dosing it is is how I encourage people to begin with it yeah if you do not know your dose yes so also on this tag there's a couple dosing I think we do one milliliter five milligrams teaspoon is 25 milligrams per tablespoon is 75 milligrams and they act fast because the first thing I can put it under my tongue correct they act fast and and and and so because of primarily because of the oral administration right so we're not chewing this we're not ingesting it right it is a oral application we have the buccal and mucosal lining of the mouth and the arterial glands of the tongue right help get it into the system much more quicker so in short the bioavailability is superior no no is that the same reason why inhalation works because of going through the mucosal in you know obviously it goes into the lungs I believe I've heard Derek speak about this and and I think that is one of the reasons why cuz right that's why a lot of people use smoking because it's quick yeah five minutes you know and you if you if you don't have enough in your pains bad you can actually just take a little bit more and and we'll help right but then you run the risk of getting like raspy voice and coughing I'm in the gym five six days a week and I can tell when I'm inhaling totally I don't have the resistance as much totally and so that's something that the products like edibles will help mitigate right right and so when you smoke it on sets fast and only lasts about an hour and a half to two hours right you so the the the conversion is different how long does the syrup last so anywhere from four to six hours depends amazes yeah this is because of the conversion so when we eat inedible or let's say the syrup for this for this purpose it it it it the liver converts THC to something to an active metabolite called eleven hydroxy THC right and this is arguably three to four times stronger than THC right so take that into consideration and eating that so yeah and so with the syrup what we always recommend is to use a oral milliliter syringe okay right a lot of people have them you can get at Walgreens yeah yeah I'll give them to you a little baby right one milligram or one milliliter is five milligrams okay gotcha now the psychoactive threshold of THC is two point five milligrams anything below two point five milligrams that's a CBD but likelihood is you're not you're not gonna have a psychoactive effect no so for the people that are concerned about getting high right start low for sure you can take two point five milligrams of this syrup wait I would say 15 to 25 minutes right assess how you feel yeah take another two point five milligrams you know and that's the glory of the restrictions being lifted and us being able to provide products like this for sure right so yeah now we can we can get into micro dosing right not just psychedelics but micro dosing cannabis absolutely you know and yeah and that's how I use it now other than like I go to bed it's just one gummy but if I need it during the day I'm micro dosing that's awesome yeah I think that's absolutely fantastic I feel a true micro dose of THC would be 2.5 to 5 milligrams okay and and and and we're seeing 10 milligrams as the common ground for a single dose of THC across the nation right and I I would I would beckon that that should and will change as it becomes federally legal because in the recreation states were seeing restrictions like yet that edibles cannot be more than 100 milligrams and they have to be able to be dosed in 10 milligram increments right okay all recreational right exactly I've seen five milligrams put somebody over the edge period and I accidentally got a hundred milligram attaboy showed you that I was that I was at getting my order which I do have to tell you guys this bake bros converted me from mostly I mean I'm I haven't even don't use inhalation as much as I use the syrups and the gummies in that but I accidentally I thought I had because no no Kofi do you have to order it online and then you go to the curb and you throw the dude your money and he throws you your bag kidding kind of answer you gotta go up there and then they've got a pre ready and I'm looking in my bag when I got home and I thought it's 100 milligram gummies yeah and how am I supposed to slice right you don't know you're making me nervous looking at it it's still in my bathroom I felt I felt a little bit of the past I mean I'm like okay so how long does this last is it gonna go bad no look well no I mean if I have this at home let's and I thought well at least I can cut it in fours or something how long would a gummy last how long do gummies last for efficacy I guess is the word like is this gonna last for six months so they're gonna start to do rating so we have a year on our product okay products which is amazing plant turns into like totally CBD after a while and so that's one conversion yes THC particularly converts to something called CBN okay I am over time I'm talking a long time yeah I'm talking a long time a long time for it to convert unless it takes a long time for it to convert unless heat is being applied okay so let's let's use the analogy of example of smoking a joint Blount okay we're smoking this joint and we're smoking it and they you know it's getting shorter and shorter right order and then we get to the the last half right the roach right right yeah yeah yeah and let's say we put it out halfway okay we come back to it the next day and we smoke it again well we are just ripped now okay yeah it's like what on earth happened with us yeah this is this is not the same feeling I had yesterday I'm like way more sedated more hi what's happening is that THC because of the heat is converting to CBN and and that is that's acts more of a sedative and it makes you more tired and it makes you more stony and so no wonder I only needed a hit just one little I had to sleep all night there's I'm coughing in my sleep yes yes yeah yeah and to that point though there's there's so much that we're still going to be learning about this plant and there are so many restrictions that we have that prevent us from being able to do control trials right you know or double-blind trials I know like we just can't do it like they can't be done you know I think sue Sisley is doing some of them for cannabis and PTSD but the restrictions are very like it's very limited to what we can do and how we can study this and so a lot of this has been trial and error and people's testimonials and people sharing their stories of yourself that have a large reach like this what we have to do is provide this type of information and so going back to the to the syrups you know being able to microdose it that and it that that is arguably anybody that is new to cannabis is the number one way I would recommend using cannabis is if it's not the syrups if you're in a state where we're not you know I would I would highly encourage using something that is a oral base right and dry yeah it has a test result yeah you know that way you have some type of base that you're starting with yes many milliliters equals this many milligrams right and I need to start with two point five milligrams and assess how I feel yes everybody will feel different to known this when I first started I was like you know well I remember thinking okay I'm really not fond of that not a drug I even wanted in high school and blah blah blah blah and so here I am the other side I'm a grandma you know I haven't I hadn't driven in three years when they put me on the higher doses when I was on lower doses okay but out of respect for myself and everybody else I hadn't wasn't driving and as I weaned I started to drive and nobody you know I studied a lot I had a couple coaching calls with a few people who knew and my advice to people is what happened to me was I didn't realize how much a potentiated the opiates yeah so I was literally high for two weeks three yes and I remember thinking okay I'm supposed to be a social-media influencer and most of my fellows are Christians and I'm upping up my phone going no how do people do this certainly they're not high all the time and I'm wondering if this sometimes this is what people think when I say I use cannabis they just think I'm high all the time I remember saying to somebody when's the last time you met a high on who runs a company works out six days a week and hello I can't even do that when I'm tired let alone what was I totally but the body begins to adapt which is amazing mm-hmm cuz like you can hit your tolerance and I've done that in learning how to use it and weaning but then you just wait a day or so you use lemon waterway today this is not like oh my god now I got a wean for six months to get back to my dose No right how incredible that the body would readjust it like sixty it really sixty out you know hours it's like two three days you're fine totally yeah that that's and you can go back to your small dose again that is that is something that is really unique about all psychedelics yeah right is that we some have some you can build a tolerance you some you don't really build a tolerance who's gonna hit you how right it's you you know and though there's there are so many plant medicines that that we don't even know about III I mean there are so many cacao ayahuasca ibogaine yeah cannabis you know mushrooms my favorite psilocybin you know like there are and I speak of all of those psilocybin well let me start with LSD okay that's not a plant medicine it comes from a it's it's synthetically created in a lab typically as how LSD in the controlled trials but it comes from a fungus called ergot it grows in which your God grows in rye correct kay and Albert Hoffman is one who discovered this brand and it Elysee has more white paper studies than any other medicine yeah any other medicine we have today besides caffeine wait until I open that topic with you we I really want to do another episode because I never and some of my my listeners are like what the hell did you just say but my doctor my gastroenterologist said to me I think you have trauma trapped in your gut and there are proven not spiritual although it will affect you certainly there are medical studies showing hundreds of these he believes that that will be part of you getting me off yes Remicade yes so now I'm pursuing EMDR with an incredible therapist and I'm open to doing a clinical trial on now on doing that my only hesitancy is not that it's mushrooms or you know a micro dosing people understand you're talking a very [Music] naltrexone has been historically used for ms so tell trucks don't gets people off of heroin addiction different things like that is used for a variety of ways to cause people to come off of opiates or whatever eighty milligrams or something like that versus point five right for ms so we're talking a very mystical dose now the crazy thing to me my only hesitancy is Willa s mess up my SSRIs in my gut because my SSRIs are very like when they had me on antidepressants years ago no no I don't I don't like Cracker Jacks and II but the stabilizing is very different than ketamine it's very different than other things used clinically for PTSD to help the parasympathetic nervous system reset yep will you talk to me just a little bit about psychedelics and PTSD and releasing trauma yes so LSD and psilocybin particularly have been studied well a lot of these that all that I've just mentioned have been studied regarding PTSD it's one of the most fascinating topics you know sue Sisley here in Arizona is leading a study for with cannabis and veterans who have PTSD also MDMA so using MDMA treat pts yes you know and there are Institute's out there you Sona which is I think out of Wisconsin where psychologists and psychiatrists are being taught how to do psycho assisted their therapies therapeutics right yeah and this this was happening this was happening in in 1930s to 1960s almost 1970 right 1967 is when all this got shut down yeah by the government absolutely you're getting too well stopped little literally yes yes and so like Johns Hopkins was was leading this and and they're they're the psilocybin psilocybin is the active ingredient in mushrooms okay just as th yeah is the active ingredient in cannabis that's what psilocybin is to mushrooms okay no mushrooms I get violently ill from so I may have yes something different yes rooms and and and I won't get deep into it now but there is a purpose for micro dose and clinically what is labeled as a heroic dose right that is that is what Johns Hopkins will refer to yeah as a heroic dose and and stanislav grof he's a pioneer in this you know he's led over 5000 psycho assisted their therapy yeah you know where they I saw it a New Amsterdam and the TV show Oh incredible like incredible that they were doing it this is and my listeners need understand we're not talking about a bunch of unicorn no in a room pink enough had somewhere you're talking John Hopkins Duke Mayo yeah and so I'll run you through what that process looks like a little bit you using psilocybin or LSD what they will do is they will you'll get very familiar with the therapist right typically 2 8 hour sessions with the therapist right because the two most important factors one of the two most important factors in any psychedelic micro or macro will say is your set and setting yeah so your set being your mind set exactly mindset going into the experience right if you are terrified and just you know neurotic and just likelihood is it's not gonna be good for you and it's not the right time and there's other things we need to work on before this is interesting if so mindset set and then your setting alright I've been in in experiences where I'm at a festival and I've had friends I'm truly speaking friends and I'm not saying this is me because I know better but I have friends who have taken psychedelics LSD and MDMA at music festivals and they just freak out the setting is not conducive for that type oh no components not it got it all you know anxiety and fear and all these things can set in and so set in settings so John Hopkins providing these controlled settings right it's a very it's like living room here you know it's beautiful yeah you know therapy chairs music you trust you know you've built trust with this therapist yeah that you've spoken to and yeah anybody who's been through therapy knows how the process gonna talk and the answer that's it yeah I'm an unbiased point of view hopefully yeah and so you you establish this relationship you establish this trust and then the third component so set setting the third component is intention right very and this is such a fastest T important word because prayer intention they have they have am I in my heart a large correlation to each other means right in prayer prayer I've always felt is you're putting it out right you're speaking to God or speaking to the universe you're speaking to source your yeah your our words have a frequency yes we can measure this we can know that this is science aside you can see words just have in a lab you're not a hippie house exactly exactly I are and I encourage people to listen and learn about this like yeah our words have a frequency and when we put them out there whether it be through conversation like this yeah or it be through prayer and more intention exactly we can alter the energetic space our auras around us it's the it's the conversation that helps build context okay context is what you need because when we are under the influence of these altered states psychedelic and yes if we don't have the context what's happening right it can be terrifying yeah anxiety absolutely yeah but if we have the context to deal with the experience yeah then we can then make sense of what's happening right and so you you patients will relive the experience which can sound very terrifying but it can also help bridge the gap in the parts that were blacked out or missed yeah right and then you speak to the therapist about that and again integration yeah that conversation is where the healing occurs and so in and so maps maps dot-org is is leading the world in psychedelic studies and anybody listening wants to go there you can go to resources and you can there's a link for or a page for all the studies that have occurred yeah all of the stage and you can see psilocybin or al a psilocybin used for addiction right right being able to break people who have smoked for thirty years right right PTSD depression yeah you there's so much out there and so that that is the that's the king of resources right there they're leading the world and in these studies and so that's where I would want to direct anybody who is fascinated by the science of this and you can actually read the the controlled settings that occurred yeah it's and and I mean one session for some from any one session yeah what I'm gonna take their whole life right yeah and so there's a joke like I see a couple of your books over here Titan and and tribe of mentors Tim Ferriss who really is uh who really started my personal development growth today but he talks about an ayahuasca experience that he had yeah and he jokingly but seriously says that had I known that I could go do this 8-hour experience and get fifteen years of therapy dello I would have done that hell you know yeah and that's what happens yeah I heard about it so many times fifteen years of trauma and in therapy in an eight-hour session yeah like what yeah right cuz and that's where dr. Joe Dispenza mm-hmm speaks about what's happened he gets into the science I know is you are a see wiring your brain very much so you wire very much so and it is incredibly fascinating yeah I I'm I am a big proponent I love the science of it me too and me too Thomas takes to do it Thomas is being about yeah yeah yeah I'm I'm more in love and passionate about the metaphysical side of it so yeah yeah chill side of it yeah also understanding yeah there's a scientific side to this yeah so when you have someone like Joe Dispenza who bridges the gap between the metaphysical the spiritual healing yeah things which has occurred for thousands of years shamanistic approaches they were doctors shamans were technically spiritual doctors and then you bring this component of science to it you're like oh that's what's happening it's fascinating they're both happening yeah this manifold side is happening yes but neurologically in your body this is what's happened we're tripartite beings yeah so we're body so spirit you can't rest connect right the trinity yes absolutely it's incredible and and I I love Joe Dispenza because he really metaphysically and in spiritual practices it's often that breath is a big component we it's an autonomic process we just automatically do it we are either right because if you don't you're dead yeah uh-huh and we also breathe on consciously right we shallow breaths right words and when you're on opiates you cannot take deep breaths oh wow cuz it's a massive cough suppressant Wow I that was one of the first parts I had to learn is how to react so Jen ate my lungs Wow yeah and and so when we we connect mind intention mm-hmm with heart yeah yeah hate love yeah with breath life yeah something happens in cross something happens yeah right that these practitioners figured out thousands of years ago yeah and have used for thousands of years yeah however someone like Joe Dispenza has dedicated his life to figuring this out Sam Harris these these individuals yeah I have all their books they have measured it and they have the monitoring it and they are sharing it that hey when you connect mine heart and breath yeah this is what happens yeah right incredible and you have all of a sudden these miracles mmm you know people wouldn't consider them to be miracles like it's incredible yeah it's it's I am one it's really awesome and and I I really do I'm very passionate about it I can tell very an incredible human who would have thought a watermelon dummy could bring cannabis I need him to be in watermelon and then I need him this is where he's gonna grow people sometimes ask me what's your purpose you know and it shifts shifts you know that that's I think I think that's a difficult question for a lot of people and I save quite a bit of time on it yeah and right now my purpose is to be here now right Rama das be here now yeah and because if I can be here now I can serve whatever purpose it is I need to serve right here and right now yeah right and I try and apply that because trying to figure out my life's purpose yeah can get overwhelming you know it's gonna change if I'm too tired if people that were in my life and circumstances or maybe I lose a family member and that purpose is gonna change yeah if my dad is sick then my purpose is to go take care of my dad my purposes right right but my purpose is to just be here now so gonna be a blank sheet like sheet of paper yeah you know and and that's that's the that's the karmic way of looking at it right is just to allow what's happening to happen right and yeah that's always been that's that's always been something that I've battled with people with and not like I don't say battle maybe because I don't argue about it but try and get people to talk about it and understand you know because I have friends and family that are like no like you just rainbows and butterflies you know this and that no and and it's like that's a component of it yeah you know I think it's a skill oh yeah yeah very much you know it's not that what's happening if something bad this Cove is happening right mmm-hmm you could perceive it one way I can perceive it the other mhm the same stuff is happening exactly sucks it does it's my choice to deal with it the way I deal with it yeah you know and and that's that like that's my purpose right now is to be here now I think you also have a purpose of helping people be wide awake yeah thank you very much and I'm just so honored that we've been able to spend this time it feels like it was like 20 minutes and yeah I think oh my gosh and I'm excited about opening up more topics but I want to make sure that people can find you we're gonna make sure we put links by the videos in the podcast episode they can find you as Instagram your favorite yes Instagram is my personal primary platform okay you can search Nadim al-haj I guarantee I'm probably the only one on there that'll pop up but it's a latin word called unit iose you have two stands for unity yeah and that's that is my instagram handles you nati yes i'm on facebook but instigated my main platform you can always check out bay crows calm yeah vapors are calm is our baby you can actually access our podcast from there as well yes know your dose yep so we talked about just our cannabis without it without knowing you don't it's really truly truly so you can hit the menu you can access that we also have know your dose podcast calm yeah look out for us and know your dose podcast is also on Instagram yes it is Instagram as well we have KYT podcasts and know your dose podcasts though yeah a couple different pages out there it's been amazing my friend you have how I felt they came for sharing your light your wisdom and knowledge and yeah thank you for watermelon come [Music]", "FP-HpHsRLxY": "the schedule to be one hour okay and we're going to get starting and I just noticed as the volume is a little bit low so let us know it continues to be low and you can go ahead and take it away everyone come across Canada I'm delighted with the the turnout and so those of you with diabetes persons with IVs welcome and i see that i have some colleagues health care providers divers educators also online so thank you for the opportunity on invitation from CDA to discuss any well to match diabetes we have certainly long known that nutrition is a cornerstone of diabetes management and as would have it of course nutrition interventions is very helpful in helping to reduce the a1c by one to two percent which is significant in terms of healthy outcomes I'd like to start off our conversation with just that eating well with diabetes but I'd like to maybe review a few myths if I may about food so myth number one people with diabetes can eat sweets or chocolate and I hope to be slide with in advance to the next says the truth is people with diabetes can enjoy some sweets and still control blood Sugar's enjoy them once in a while but don't try to live on them and I think that that's a really important message that we need to convey that it really is about portion control and fitting it into a healthy meal plan another myth healthy foods don't rise blood sugar truth even nutritious foods like apples oatmeal can rise blood sugar to an unhealthy level this happens if you don't have enough insulin to match the carbohydrates you eat so clearly we have to have an appreciation of portion control and choosing healthy foods accordingly to achieve good blood Sugar's people with diabetes should eat sugar free foods truth you don't need sugar free foods to control blood sugar in fact many sugar free foods will raise blood sugar so what is the diabetes diet a caption reads I see you're having a bit of trouble with the new diet the diabetes diet is not really a diet it's an eating plan that's a healthy one the way that everyone should eat Canada's Food Guide is the framework of the diabetes meal plan and if we focus on the four main groups and then we'll address some some other foods that give pleasure in terms of speed salt or perhaps with you're thinking about caffeine so we'll just address those in a moment our interest with good nutrition and diabetes care is to help control blood glucose can help to control blood lipid levels and blood pressure it can help to maintain a healthy weight or help lose weight if you are overweight it can allow you to take less medication it can also prevent or delay complications from high blood sugars I've chosen to take the word diet and redefine it in a way that may be a little more encouraging and a little more positive for the most part diet tends to lend itself to all the foods you will enjoy eating you should really avoid so if we take the letter D of the word diet we want to discover the foods that rise blood sugars for those of you there are new to diabetes and hopefully will attend some diet sessions over and above this evening and obtain some handouts that I will present on here or suppose you do there are currently monitoring your blood sugar it's a journey about which foods Roger your blood Sugar's the eye part of the word diet will be increased activity and we recognize the importance of activity in both blood sugar control weight management and lipid-lowering 150 minutes of activity per week is a desirable minimum amount the e part of the diet will be the eating plan and will address the specifics of the eating plan in a few moments the other a of the word of the letter e for diet I've chosen as emotions I'd like you to give some consideration to a couple of things what is your relationship with food and I think perhaps the first answer might be love it and we want you to enjoy your food but I also like to give some thought to your sensations of when you really feel full when do you really feel hungry you know are you aware of those cues do you listen to your body cues your senses what are you drawn to you when you are stressed emotionally distraught what is your comfort food an important part of the meal plan and the t part of the word diet is st. portions I'd like to suggest with the number of participants we have signed up the sea then we could all share a little sweet amongst all of us so it's not about no sugars no sweets but it's about portion control so for all of you on your journey with diabetes i invite you to really think about the four parts of diet and i'd like you to start with small steps that you address one area that you're going to work on and just work your way through the four parts so perhaps all of you are eating well but perhaps the portions are a little too much or perhaps some of you are eating well but need to increase your activity some of you are just starting your journey with blood sugar modeling just to see how which whose blood why's your blood sugar significantly and which foods do not so I'd like you to think about the approach to die in a very positive way we know that food is made up of three parts carbohydrates protein and fat and for the purpose of the blood sugar control we're going to address carbohydrates first carbohydrates raise blood sugars and do so in a good way they are a necessary component of brain function energy etc so that we want to merit the carbohydrates for what they have to offer us some of our carbohydrate foods as outlined on the slide would include the dairy milk yogurts discussion of almond milk soya milk should also come into this carbohydrate we have our fruits fresh frozen canned dried and juices we have our grains wheat rye pumpernickel in the ancient grains we have potatoes we have corn and we have our baked goods and of course we have liquid carbohydrates as illustrated by the alcohol elected on the slide we have a variety of vegetables that we refer to as free food the peas the character beets with gosh half a cup serving will not impact let sugar significantly all of your rabbit foods are very good choice foods as well that can be well taken into your plan what about fruit we address certain a that suits our combination of carbohydrates consisting of natural sugar and fiber let's consider the following compare apple juice to apples there is a significant difference in how it rises blood sugar the apple juice is a more process we find usually fiber reduced leaving it with an immediate spike in blood sugar I would invite you to really be cautious with your intake of juice even if the label says no sugar added remember there is a natural sugar to that fruit juice on the other hand having a solid fruit such as an apple given the fiber the pectin and the cellulose the fiber now slows down the rise of the carbohydrate into sugar in the body we invite you to include two to three servings of fruit a day healthy wholesome and portion size becomes an important consideration I'll invite you to think about cupping your hand and recognizing the amount of fruit that would fit into your hand cupped would be considered a serving if we consider the various fruit that we have to choose from if we range from the Apple to the watermelon there is a considerable difference in the fiber content of different fruits they are all carbohydrate but the fiber is quite different if we look at the Apple we have a high fiber count same as pairs berries on the other hand if we go to the watermelon section or the walla metals fruit the fiber content is much lesser hence you will enter the bloodstream at a quicker rate and you will need to eat more to feel fuller the fiber consideration here it's referred to as the glycemic index or the GI it's a scale that ranks carbohydrate-rich foods by how much they rise the blood sugar levels choosing higher fiber foods equals a lower GI hence driving the blood sugar at a slower rate this particular handout is taken from the canadian dissociation hand out of which you can access on the website and we've categorized foods and these are carbohydrate-rich foods into three categories we have the low GI and this is scored on a scale of one to a hundred we have the medium GI and we have a high GI in the consideration of how we would put this into perspective I would invite you to think of this in the following the high GI diet or the high GI foods we invite you to choose less often they taste good and they certainly have some nutritional marriage but limited the medium category would be what we would encourage you to choose and of course the low GI inviting you to choose most often so cuz they're the following the high GI foods are good the medium GI foods are better and the low GI foods are best the question now asks is your meal plan good can it be better or can you make the best choice to get a better blood sugar control some of the food choices on the low GI we do a comparison you'll see how one hundred percent stone-ground whole wheat bread a heavy heavy mixed grain a pumpernickel or a rye would be an excellent choice followed by the whole wheat rye or pita and then the white breads are the ones that are categorized in the lower GI for the high GI sorry then you've got your brand cereals and again they're fairly easily identified there are grey bar early vulgar pastas and noodles parboiled are converted rice although is a white rice is a desirable rice because they just steamed the odor kernels and some of the fiber is retained hence in the lower GI section the basmati rice the brown rice and couscous are all very good choices other choices would include sweet potato and yams and all of your leg use lentils chickpeas kidney beans split peas soya beans baked beans you'll notice in the medium section we have white potato new potato Yukon Gold red skin potatoes popcorn stone wheat thins ravidas different soups with black bean or green pea are very desirable in the higher GI food so things like baking potato arrested in particular french fries pretzels rice cakes and soda crackers are for the most part quite refined processed and lack the fiber so we'll enter the bloodstream a little quicker so high fiber foods more often really as a recommendation for the eating plan because they help keep you full longer giving you a sense of satisfaction portion control slows down the release of the carbohydrate into sugar in the blood and certainly has the ability to lower cholesterol levels an all-around win-win food choice flax also fits into the fiber it is an excellent source of omega-3 flax seeds offer you roughage flax meal ground flax releases the omega-3 which is highly recommended and of course flaxseed oil is a desirable oil to use but it does lock some of the fiber if you are then using flax meal or ground flax let your imagination add the flax to a variety of your food choices so if you have a low fiber cereal you might give some consideration to adding flax to now elevate it to a better level a reminder about Fox seed use it should be refrigerated in the fridge for 30 days four months in the refrigerator or a French freezer how to choose breakfast cereals the recommendation is to work with the following guidelines less than 8 grams of sugar per serving three or more grams of fiber mixing and matching circles is one way to get the best of cereal selections adding fiber as we just address ground flax flax seed and adding protein example omens are very desirable ways of adding good nutrition to your cereals of the dairy food group oops sorry whoops let's go back there we go up dairy we know that all animal foods has natural sugar called lock dose dairy contains carbohydrates proteins and fat good sources of vitamin D and calcium of your selections we have milk yogurt cheese's alternatives so considering that if you're choosing a milk for the benefit of your heart and for your waste management consider a lower fat milk and just to clarify if you're choosing a 1-percent or a two percent or even a skim milk remember that the lactose or the carbohydrate is the same in choosing yogurt your best yogurt is a plain yogurt to which you could be adding a fruit with a little bit of nutmeg vanilla or cinnamon to sweeten it your cheese's have a lower carbohydrate count good source of protein quality cheese's cheddar edem Gouda brick Mazzarella are good choices but be cautious of portion sizings as they have a lot of hidden fat the alternative dairies would include soya milk almond milks they can be altered in terms of sugar added so if a particular item readers on sweetens that would be a preferred choice if you're choosing a flavored almond or a soya product be cautious with the amount of sugar that's been added particularly if it's a mocha strawberry or vanilla flavour clearly with diabetes management limiting the added sugars and suites are desirable we know that these particular foods rapidly increase the blood sugars and I think all are familiar with examples of simple carbohydrates such as pop candies jams desserts cake ties I've given you a little indication here of a visual a teaspoon of sugar we round off to approximately five grams of carbohydrate so as the slide presents a 10 a pop a 719 milla pop and then the two-liter bottle will give you a good visual of how much sugar is actually included in these beverages to that I'd like you to give some consideration to the newly arrived to the market vitamin and mineral waters choosing ones that say 10 calories or calorie free would be desirable because many of the other ones are quite high in sugar count approximately 40 grams of carbohydrate per bottle of vitamin mineral water the energy drinks would also fit into this category as a fair amount of simple sugars carbohydrates that would rapidly increase the blood sugars in the interest of looking at labels for identifying your food items we have created some a standard label reading and I present to you a sampler of a box that reads at four crackers and I'd like to walk you through the information that label will provide you the calories are always listed first then the fat divided with the types of fats cholesterol sodium carbohydrate protein and then a variety of vitamins listed at the bottom so if your interest is in looking at the amount of fiber of a particular food you'll find it's easily labeled under the carbohydrate count quick review carbohydrate consists of three parts starch fiber sugar it is with those three parts that we come up with the total carbohydrate so if we come back to our cereal selections you have chosen to have a cereal look for the fiber look for three grams or higher so for example things like weetabix fitted wheat bran flakes bran buds grape nuts are some examples of quality higher fiber cereals regretfully cereals like Rice Krispies corn flakes and special k are very low in fiber and I think we would expect Froot Loops to be in that category as well on the other hand i'd like you to also focus on the sugar that's been added to these cereals so in the interest of choosing more nutritious cereals look for less sugar and the guideline is presented earlier was about 8 grams or less per serving would be very desirable and the fiber being higher than 3 grams comparing labels if there are labels to be had whether it be cereals or other food items the carbohydrate is clearly identified in both counts however having just discussed our interest in increasing intake of fiber choosing a food that has more fiber comparatively and a lower sugar is really ultimately what you want to be looking for the discussion about fiber particularly in this situation really if we address cereals again for a moment at the grocery store if you are standing in the cereal aisle if you focus on the top shelf of your cereals and the bottom shelf of your cereals that's where you'll find your most desirable cereals the eye-level cereals for the most part are refined processed and very often a higher sugar count so recapping the carbohydrates carbohydrates rise blood sugar in a good way choosing whole fruit / fruit juice is very desirable fiber another very important component adding it to your variety of meals choosing high fiber options as outlined in the previous slide of the glycemic index and the recommendation for adults is a minimum of 25 grams of fiber a day clearly limiting the amount of sweets and sugary foods and beverages are desirable for blood sugar control my next food group is protein protein slows or stabilizes or studies the rise in blood sugar these include animal foods fish poultry meat and eggs cheese and the plant proteins as legumes dry peas beans lentils soya tofu nut butters peanut butter almond butter seeds hemp hearts chia seeds sunflower seeds of the examples of your plant proteins it is very desirable to include a protein at each meal protein slows down digestion combined carbohydrates with protein choose lean cuts of meat for animal and remove visible fat where possible I'd like to expect you about the use of plant proteins as they are very desirable offer good fiber low in cholesterol low in fat and quite filling and nutritionally very sound so I list for you a website called pulse canada.com it will give you more information about the use of pulses how to prepare and a variety of recipes that I hope you will find inviting and will give a try to the third part of the food group are the facts they slow down digestion the slowing down however may sound desirable which gives you a feeling of fullness but consider that if you are having a high-fat meal you may find that your blood Sugar's will be high hours after you have eaten that food because of the slowing down of the digestion excess fat intake can raise your cholesterol you can also increase your weight so I'm invite you to really be attentive to the quantity of fat that you do use in your meal preparation if I may offer you a suggestion of three to six teaspoons of fat a day 2 to 3 tablespoons is very desirable we have three types of fat we have butter as I refer to a hard fat we have margarine as a soft fat and we have oil as a liquid fat we then have our trans fats that are either nashi occurring or that which the industry has produced our spreadable cheese is cream cheese sour cream cheese with would fit into the fat category regretfully not into the protein group limiting your high fat foods is very desirable remember though that fat does not increase blood sugar but has a high caloric count I think you're all familiar with some of the food that we're referring to here and they all taste so good limiting your fat intake to 2 to 3 tablespoons a day is very desirable and aiming for more plant fats over animal fats is also very desirable what do your portions look like and I'd like you to sort of take a moment and sort of look at your hands fists palms use that as your guide so for your vegetable selections your broccoli cauliflower etc consider one handful of vegetables or two as shown in the picture a closed fist would be an equivalent of a potato perhaps so our brown rice the meat portion the palm of a hand the thickness of your small finger would be a good starting point and for the men in the audience we may need to stretch that out of the full hand size festivals again the fistful and the teaspoon of fat consider the tip of your thumb as being a serving size with your eyes I'd like you to think about your plate serving we want to include the four food groups divide your plate with your eyes or you can actually buy plates that have divisions make half of your plate the vegetables the green salad the carrots the broccoli cauliflower kale spinach or cooked mixed vegetables make one third of your plate the grains and starches the high fiber brown rice the potato with skin or the sweet potato or the yam or a brown pasta demeanor alternatives a lean meat a lean chicken skinless fish strip loin lentils beans tofu would be very desirable food items and on the outside of your plate consider a small serving of fruit and a dairy serving to complete your meal another consideration in terms of meal planning is a timing of your meals eating three times a day or three meals per day is very desirable spacing your meals four to six hours apart again is encouraged the benefits of spreading your foods over the day help to control blood sugar provide a healthier weight and helps with portion control snacks may be beneficial and perhaps the snack will be based on do you need one do you want one do you have one again I would invite you to consider the spacing of your meals and consider snacks that would be very desirable and the portion control is clearly important choosing snacks if you are hungry again listening to your body cues to identify when full and when hungry choosing high-fiber snacks as illustrated in this particular slide the use of a small apple with some peanut butter would be quite desirable a protein and a complex carbohydrate another consideration might be popcorn with a handful of nuts or a wasa bread with a low-fat cheese or Moffat pepperoni or hummus and dipped vegetables balancing your carbohydrates is critical in meal planning and blood sugar control trying to aim for the same amount of carbohydrates at each meal this will help your bless your sugar stay steady we identified earlier that a serving with approximately 15 grams of carbohydrate equivalent to three teaspoons of sugar for the adult that is looking to reduce their weight it is desirable to consider 45 to 60 grams of carbohydrate per meal steam grams 230 grams of carbohydrate for snacks for the ladies in the group the 45 grams per meal is very desirable and for the gentleman in the group the 60 grams would be desirable so somewhere in between those two recommendations is very doable another consideration is the sodium in the meal plan sodium needs to be addressed for a number of reasons it certainly can lend itself to water retention which can hold back your success from weight control it can certainly affect weight control and it can increase your blood pressure and clearly we need to ensure that blood pressure is held at a good level with diabetes processed meats we know for the most part are very salty and the industry is really where the most salt has been added rather than the pinch of salt that you may be adding to your vegetable water if you're cooking vegetables or potato water convenience food we know are loaded with salt tasty but loaded condiments and sauces have their share of salt as well the consideration here is all about serving sizes and frequency of use here are some tips to shake off salt perhaps the first step is to give her the salt shaker at the table we do see amount that you do add in your food and in the cooking we need to remind that salt is salt it is a sodium derivative and this includes your sea salt your course your salt your red Himalayan salt they're all equivalent however the use of sea salt because of its flavoring in 10 c you tend to maybe use a little bit less until you'll hear people say sea salt is a better choice but it's really about using less that really matters experiment with herv's and spices to flavour up your foods spice it up perhaps you are familiar with the mrs dash the clubhouse the mccormick brand the vinegars lime or lemon are very desirable alternates to salt pepper flakes Cayenne the industry is trying to make a little bit stride in terms of lowering sodium in the food products that we consume so things like your lower salt Bragg season is listed there we have some of our bras that are lower sodium our soups canned soups in particular are very high in sodium and so there is a small attempt to lower the sodium but we still have a little ways to go so our snack foods you may find it are now a little more available in a lower sodium and again I invite you to look for the higher fiber baked typed chips when label reading for sodium look for the sodium level and if I can have you think of it as the street color or street lights consider the sodium of a 0 to 200 milligram count is a good level to work from the 200 to 400 milligrams sodium consider it to be give it some thought to how much you might be using and anything over 400 really should be limited red yellow and green the recommendations for per day for sodium for the general population is 2300 milligrams of sodium for diabetes care it is recommended that you limit your intake of sodium to 1500 milligrams of sodium per day on your label you will have a percent daily value it tells you if a food has a little or a lot of a specific nutrient so he can use it to compare two food items if the label reads as a daily value of five percent that tells you that it has a little if the daily value suggests fifteen percent or higher it means it has a lot and that may be very desirable if you're choosing foods for fiber if you're choosing foods with four salt then you would want to choose the smaller percentage so again in the middle of five percent to fifteen percent is desirable if you choose to work with a daily percent of value again comparing to soup labels on the left hand side we have a sodium count of 660 milligrams percent milligrams and a twenty-eight percent daily value clearly higher than the fifteen percent we just talked about in the number itself over 400 on the right hand side we have a lower sodium version at 50 milligrams and only a two percent daily value so do you make your labels work for you in the interest of really reducing your intake of sugar salt and fat it is a very desirable to get back to home basics to home cooking that way you can control what has been added to the foods that you eat if we look at the processing of our foods and how it increases our salt I've give you an example here of your fresh cucumber half a dozen slices of very low in sodium about two milligrams cucumber salad with dressing it now upset to 234 milligram and once we reach it to the dill pickle stage we're looking at a whopping 928 milligrams the fresh chicken breast very desirable in sodium once it's prepared star bought into a frozen pot pie again that count Ray's is considerably and of course once we get into the fast foods without surprise the count really flares up to over the two thousand mark the use of lemon or lime is a very desirable food item being cautious with the use of soya sauce as you see indicated there a tablespoon is consumed early high in sodium and we just had addressed about the table salt a teaspoon is approximately 2300 milligrams of sodium pork versus bacon versus ham I think it's fairly self-explanatory with a very low count in pork a bit higher in the bacon and of course the ham will have a high count in the types of fats we come back to our fat for a moment we have our saturated the hard stats the butter of the coconut oil the animal fat we have the unsaturated fats the liquid fats the oils and non-hydrogenated margins and then we have the ongoing debate of butter versus margarine for the purpose of this evenings discussion I would like to give consideration to the fact that all of them contain the same amount of carbon five calories and i invite you to really be cautious with the serving size that you do because it does really add flavor to your foods this particular comparison of dietary fats is available for you if you have not already done so you can download the CD a calendar that comes out yearly and on the back page of it has this comparison of dietary fats and just for color coding purposes we've listed canola safflower flax sunflower corn all of soya peanut coconut oil lard palm and butter and coconut the red is the saturated component the blue is the polyunsaturated the mono and saturates are the yellow for simplicity I'd like you to just focus on the oils that have the least amount of red saturated choosing the oils that have the most of the model which is the yellow so looking at the comparison you'll see how safflower oil is seventy-seven percent mono which is very desirable followed by olive oil then canola and then tea oil cholesterol sources in the interest of addressing cholesterol and lipids which is a very important part of diabetes care just a reminder that cholesterol eighty percent of our cholesterol is made by the liver twenty percent from the foods that we eat that are of animal origin in the interest of updating the egg yolk fagor three egg yolks a week are desirable on a low cholesterol plan the use of shellfish should be limited to one serving a week and the organ meats again should be limited the biggest impact on blood sugar control is the fat aim for 200 milligrams of cholesterol a day example an egg yolk is 300 milligrams so again if you limit your intake of jokes that would be very desirable we have two types of fat that we'd like to address the LDL we refer to as the lousy cholesterol which deposits the fat into our arteries versus the HDL which is the happy cholesterol so in your lipid profile we encourage you to have lesser fat so that you have less LDL or the lousy cholesterol allowing for the happy cholesterol how does decrease cholesterol how do you lower the LDL and how do you rate the HDL we've just had a conversation about choosing lower fat foods limiting saturated fats limit food sources of cholesterol choosing high-fiber foods that we address very earlier in the session and clearly increasing physical activity are all desirable ways to lower cholesterol if these lifestyle changes are not sufficient than medication may be required if I take an opportunity to take this whole theory and perhaps put into practice and i've called it meal makeovers the left-hand column will give you some ideas of food choices and how you can improve that food choices and how so if we start off with raisin bran which may be a serial choice for breakfast or snack consider two things the raisins of raisins brand are sugar-coated so now you're getting a little bit more sugar if you chose to go with a brand flake and added high-fiber berries you've increased the fiber you've actually lowered these simple sugars the use of oatmeal with nuts or hemp seeds would be also very desirable improved choice for cereal so choosing again a high-fiber cereal is very desirable low in sugar cinnamon is an excellent way to add flavor without adding additional calories or carbohydrates but good flavor adding nuts egg 10 parts to the oatmeal for added protein is again very desirable if your morning breakfast consists of white toast with butter and jam consider a whole grain whole-wheat toast with PB peanut butter and banana slices use peanut butter on toast yogurt and smoothies rather than having an orange juice for breakfast just as with your toes consider the whole or a smoothie smoothie should really consist of whole fruit it's abuse adding protein is a very desirable way adding flax to the smoothies for added fiber and omega-3 is a very desirable way of improving your food choice if you currently are using egg and bacon bagel you might want to consider an open-faced breakfast sandwich with over easy egg and roasted vegetables portion control cook eggs in a variety of ways ham and veggie frittata adding more vegetables as good fiber low carbohydrate if lunch consists maybe of chicken fingers and fries consider a chicken or a tuna pita sandwich with lettuce and tomatoes veggies and hummus dip lean meats roasted chicken or fish for sandwiches vegetables with hummus dip instead on the side of fries that a fries perhaps the natural platter is what is a small snack but consider that a vegetable or beef chili a whole wheat bun or a chicken taco salad would be a very desirable choice of a makeover adding more beans and lentils to your salads with protein as a main dish if you're through choice is a chow mein noodle consider a tofu and vegetable stir-fry with a rice a quick veggie fry with brown wild or long grain rice a quinoa a barley or a noodle adding to a food place of meat would be another alternative the hamburger and fries you might want to consider a single patty rather than a double patty with a whole wheat bun or a small steak with roasted yam potato and a spinach salad lean meats a baked or roasted potato and we certainly encourage you to have at least one dark green vegetable a day another menu suggestion might be a creamy alfredo penny consider a whole wheat penne pasta with roasted veggies with tomato sauce a tomato-based sauce or a low-fat light cream sauce we give you far less fat add your favorite festivals to bulk up your pasta sauce use a whole wheat pasta giving you more fiber more nutrition more fullness takeout consider a homemade pizza or ask for a whole-wheat crust and more takeout pizza places are providing that demand homemade is always tastier healthier and load up with a variety of your vegetable toppings eating at regular times if we recap some of the recommendations that we have been addressing it's very very desirable choosing a variety of foods of all the food groups is really the goal limiting sugars and sweets we do see the amount of fat including foods high in fiber limiting salt and remember that checking your blood glucose before and two hours after a meal it's the best way to know how your body has handled that meal some of your resources your diabetes see a website offers under your recipe section click on the diabetes in you and there's about 25 recipes that have been nicely listed there that you can certainly access and download for more ideas on healthy eating download a free copy of your healthy living calendar at the same website diabetes dot CA I thank you for your time I wish you healthy eating and I'm happy to take questions from the participants great thank you so much for us so informative a whole hour there I find it there so educational late they kind of serve as a wake-up call plus a review + education kind of all in one there so a question from aisha should i want to know how people adapt when diabetic diets myths are explored oh I guess so how the driving guided is how people adapt when the diabetic diet myths are explored I guess once you kind of talk about them and educate them on it sure well I think it comes with you know and a desire to embrace on how you can change some of the food that you do take and um I think people feel very satisfied that they know that they can maybe fit in a few of me like for example the the sugars in foods or choosing higher fiber foods so i think it is desirable and I certainly encourage people to really work with their team with their educators attend sessions whether it be the one that we did here or just coming to your educator and really getting the best out of life by seeing your dives educator nurse and dietitian team and doctor I think that's so it is it's a work in progress and one needs just kind of come at it with and this is why I choose not to work with the word diet but more as a meal plan and choices that you make mm-hmm great and we have a next question which is how many protein is in sunflower seeds oh how much programs attrition after certainly if I'm walking right i actually think i have a thing of sunflower seeds right here in my cupboard i do oh so you're obviously a horse let's see what i got here in a quarter cup we're looking at seven grams of protein fair enough you beat me to it I'm sick at it on my book so seven grams of protein is the answer for the sunflower seeds mm-hmm that's the equivalent of an egg white is it yeah okay good to know yeah yeah because I never thought of it in that conversion conversion sense I guess you know certainly Nelly the quality of the protein will vary a little bit because the sunflower seeds are a plant base and the egg is a protein-based right and a base but suffice to say that it is a good quality protein all the same subject if I could just add about eggs so if they use the flax meal or ground flax if you take a couple of tablespoons of ground flax mix about three tablespoons of lukewarm water and let it sit for a couple of minutes you'll see how it starts to gelatin eyes and you can use that flock sorry I've had a bunch of traffic outside my window here ok the next one furman cherry is as olive oil recommended to consume and to cook with all of all the very desirable oil to use however it is recommended because it does not have a high heat heating point or you know just told us if heat it is recommend that you not heat olive oil do you serve it sort of as a drizzle cold would be preferred because it doesn't have a high tolerance of heat okay what are some other ones recommended I know you mentioned some in a little oil is a very desirable oil for a stir-fry because it is heat tolerant um the use of canola oil is a moderate and that not to get a very desirable one but the peanut oil would be more for the mr. fry hot really hot uses ring yeah and I'm guessing that also affects the taste right a little the tasty are there and now with the new technologies that we have in the kitchen gadgets some participants may be familiar with the active fry we just add one tablespoon of oil to fry us in that they are excellent what an excellent some just yet and sweet potato fries are excellent in that actor fry great the next one is from a Dale and iris got a lot of good questions here should you eat every meal on time even if you do not feel hungry the timing of the meal certainly should be within a four to six hour interval the hunger part is you know if there really is I am not hungry you know delaying the meal by an hour it's fine but just having a little something even a half a cup of milk or half a glass of or half a glass of milk a half a cup of year with a couple of crackers it's probably desirable but if there really is no appetite no hunger we have to explore what's really going on maybe we need to increase the activity a little bit but you need to need to appetite too and individuals have to identify that point of which what's the hunger in and what's the need to eat right mhm fullness mmhmm yeah question from John on the subject of pasta should only be holy as here but holy whole weight is a desirable choice although the question may be lending itself to alternate passes that are gluten free so the ones that are quinoa flax and maybe a corn base the problem with pasta for the most part is you need you know a lot to feel fuller so clearly choosing a whole wheat pasta is to your advantage because two things that either will happen if you're not fond of a whole wheat pasta maybe you'll eat a little less which is good portion control the whole wheat patch will give you more nutrition more fiber and will enter the bloodstream at a slower rate so that is desirable grid message from gary here question as a high-fiber cereal benefit offset by adding milk and fruits of lactose and fructose um the higher the fiber the cereal certainly for example in all brands still with 17 grams of fiber so the amount of milk that you add your Cyril if you just float your cereal it might only be you know a quarter of a cup or but if you think you're sterile you might be looking at two cups so it's really relevant to how much milk you're actually putting on and because milk has added protein you're not putting in just carbohydrate right the choice the throat should be small serving a fruit and it should be a high-fiber fruit mm-hmm a very arbol you know or sliced apples would be more desirable than an apple sauce that has a lot of a fiber removed mm-hmm great and this list and Peggy and disa comment eating oatmeal or pasta shoots up her blood sugar and then I remember in the presentation she said that you recommend them they are very desirable foods the problem though is maybe the type of oatmeal so consider steel cut oatmeal as the preferred choice compared them to the large flakes would be the next stop being very careful for the instant of type of ready to serve oatmeal's in that particular situation if oatmeal or cereals are driving the blood Sugar's perhaps you need to look at adding more fiber or clearly adding protein at that breakfast meal so be at the hemp hearts the chia seeds adding an alternate animal protein a peanut butter a flax may be desirable and so sometimes we have to problem solve a little bit with the use of certain cereals and seeing what can be added and combined if it doesn't work at a particular meal of the day than perhaps position cereals in a more active time of the day and see if that's more desirable hmm now the question from Elsa so what do you think of the very low-carb bootcamp diets in the book the diabetes miracle in which you limit your carbohydrates for about seven weeks brightened up you know anything less than 100 grams of carbohydrate a day is as low as really should go you know just just for sanity more than anything people will push the limit and there is some merit to it I think the idea is to really choose and work towards a goal that you can sustain and not just a marathon run kick starting with a lower carbohydrate he died is really what it as a starting point clearly but we need to have a clear understanding that we want to sustain well past the seven weeks and the choice of carbohydrate matters it isn't just about counting a number to come up with that low end of a hundred grand it's really about choosing complex carbohydrates and bush oh good another one from Michael I've heard that as a diabetic I should avoid bananas due to natural sugars is this a truth or is it okay in moderation moderation is it certainly the key here and just for description purposes appreciate that bananas are one hundred percent carbohydrate with very little water content a three-inch banana is ten grams of carbohydrate or two spoons of sugar a six-inch banana is four and a 8-inch banana is six teaspoons of sugar mo you need to position bananas in a in a meal plan that's going to be desirable and matched with an activity so if today's an active day bananas maybe the data use them if today is a sedentary sit at the computer day that may not be in your best interest to be using bananas but they do offer good vitamin mineral fiber count if you're trying to reduce your weight be careful with your intake of bananas mmhmm yeah I've definitely heard that before yeah you need to move more and eat a little less oh good another question here how much trans fat is desirable well we're looking in terms of on the label first off if you look anything less than seven percent on the daily value is a good starting point to suggest that you know zero trans or trans fat baby the amount of mean there are nashi occurring trans fats and meat fat so we're looking more at the what's added to the food items so thinking about the baked items the snack foods that's really so the lower the better so look for the percent daily value and look for where it says you know anything less than seven percent is desirable and I'm point were the easiest ways to answer that question otherwise it gets a little more complicated in terms of grams based on the way that versus unsaturated and all that approach mm-hmm great and next we hear from patty have you heard about the weight wise program the weight wise program well perhaps not in the context that the individual is asking but you know weight wise means two things you know losing weight appropriately or weighing your foods to lose weight or I'm not sure that I'm reading that question okay well maybe we can get a clarification in the question part there it's a it's a way wise is that what it's called or wait your eyes weight-wise way twice so I suspect that it probably has some good mirror I'm not familiar just as is if it's a book or but I yes you said yes wait was yeah it certainly has its title suggests that it has some good merit but I'm not just off the top I'm not quite familiar with all the particulars of it mm-hmm I can certainly find out okay great palma nova again the next one here from Patricia did I hear you correctly to choose heroes on the top and bottom shelves in the grocery store all the cereals that was correct just to sort of simplify the selection of steroids if you go to the top shelf or the bottom shelf of the cereal aisle you're like better choices mm-hmm it's all about advertising in the middle I all right the france-based that it's all about marketing you bet mm-hmm I'm just coming up here with a weight wise clinic program classes so like this is happening at the Royal Alec white white clinic royal Alec in Edmonton Alberta I don't know though indigent I'm not sure that that's what they're referring to yes you did say it's in Edmonton now if that is the case there is a wait why'd adult management clinic it's a surgical intervention for weight management it's a bariatric specialty clinic that may be what they're referring to that's a whole different the clinic involves behavior modification counseling for nutrition drugs treatment and/or surgical treatment for obesity and coordinating care and transitioning patient back family physician we're certainly are observing a lot of good success with bariatric surgery in diabetes management so there is some indication that this works well but it's a whole clinic and it's a whole educational component and clearly number one is about behavior modification it speaks to the whole aspect of staying dehydrated eating regularly stop eating when full know when your limits in terms of hunger or appetite satiety so it's if that's what the individual is referring to that's what that program is about and certainly has some very good merit and I mean Alberta and clear that the Royal Alec that's my alma mater so the next one and some Angus um can you please talk about the effect of a beer or glass of wine well a beer is the equivalent of 15 grams of carbohydrates three spoons of sugar so it has a carbohydrate value to it and if we do a comparison of a glass of milk eight ounces of blossom milk is three grams of carbohydrate with 15 or three teaspoons of sugar with 15 grams of carbohydrate please do not interchange carbohydrate beer for carbohydrate in milk the difference right so we're not inviting you to have beer on your cornflakes right the challenge was here or any alcohol so if it is a beer choice a lower carb may be very desirable a Canadian 67 for example is two grams of carb compared to a regular beer of 15 making it a lower calorie count of only 67 calories versus 150 for regular beer if choosing wine a four ounce glass of red or dry wine would be certainly desirable and the use of a gin vodka rum or whiskey if it says bounce what's an a half would be a very low carb the challenge with alcohol is really about moderation one to two drinks a day no saving up is really portion and eat working it into the plan and make it so you have some food to go with it and then the beer nuts with the beer but you know really making better choices is really to your advantage you'll be very cautious the one challenge with alcohol it's again volume related but it can have a delayed low blood sugar effect and so you need to really be attentive to that in terms of playing havoc with blood sugar control mm-hmm weight management and and no it's a trigger for triglycerides as well it can elevate your triglyceride levels got it okay let's see the next one here there's two questions and cook or kind of comments with coconut oil that some Peggy red coconut oil is supposed to be good for us now and then there's another question on the use of organic coconut oil the coconut oil is a really hot topic right now and a challenge is when we look at the makeup on the chart that I presented in the slide it does show it as 91% on a scale of 1 to 100 as a saturated fat the current thought is if it's a cold-pressed prepared oil then it seems to be a little more desirable because it doesn't here to the vessels of the body so that's kind of what gives it merit the fact still remains though that it is a fat source and one needs to be still attentive to the amount of food that you do take in or the quantity that you do take in so going back to the recommendation of 2 to 3 tablespoons of fat per oil if coconut is being used and if you're using whether it be the organic which by the way or again it doesn't always make it a healthier choice it's Nealon a high fat one at that mm-hmm okay and another oil how does palm oil rate yeah it's a high saturated fat not quite as high as the the carpet of the coconut oil but certainly fits into that category so again you want to be you know careful with the choice of palm oils and it's one of those trans fats right and if you used quite extensively in our baked products and items and so you want to make use of less of those items if possible and I'm just going back to our slide where I gave you that indicator your palm wall is 51 person compared to ninety-one percent for coconut oil I said the military probably increases right a little bit it's a little bit fuzzy but I you know it's just getting it captured in the right way but I think you folks can go to download that calendar they'll have a beautiful eight and a half by eleven side painting of the comparison of dietary fat any tips on remember depends went on a busy schedule okay try again I didn't hear the complete question we get any tips on remembering on a busy schedule oh this is scheduled well the technology is upon us watch with a reminder for iPad or your iPhone I think it's just missing the dietitian in the eye in the technology here that sort of says reminder beep beep would be you know there's all kinds of tricks to remind yourself but I think having the tool that your fingertips is probably a very good reminder and so that would be to suggestions right there in the interest of busy schedules don't let busyness take over your diabetes care you need to take charge it's an important so find ways to try and if monday through friday on a work day doesn't work make time to text check blood sugars on alternate times that you don't on the weekdays now this particular comment may not be applicable to those of you on insulin and adjusting and that type of thing i'm just giving us a general guide some of the tips you know how to remember to test but i think the the watch and the paper in your eyes in your iphone might be very desirable yeah there's a lot of alarms and gets we have now that we can use Oh a lot for sure you watch even absolutely that would be very if I could just come back to the way twice what comes up there's another program on here that's just called you know weight wise and that's just a website a generic website that lets you healthy eating getting physical ask dietitian options for support newsletter so you can obviously that's another almost like a website mm-hmm though depends on how the question came up at the weight wise if that was truly about the bariatric surgery or if it was on its website where you can sign up and track your your food intake your physical activity calculate looks it looks like petty she just wrote back that she did have the surgery ok industry in the comments it helps you with the life-changing things there so it really really helped dad yeah good because this particular weight wise is the british dietetic association got a gout so depending on the in title but a different reference mm-hmm and then Peggy just a comment and she wasn't able to lose weight following the CD a recommended meal plan but was able to do so when she restricted her bread pasta rice potatoes and other like carbohydrates absolutely everyone you know ability to lose weight will vary control of carbohydrates is it's really key in all of this increasing activity is also the other components equally equally important that we need to give some and you know portion control is really what matters sometimes the use of potatoes and pastures it's hard to reduce them to a smaller portions so when you're really trying to be successful in your weight management the comfort foods sometimes are the ones that you need to sort of reduce or just really kind of substitute them with alternates and you will use cesses but clearly exercise is important and setting some smart goals you know in terms of just measurable and attainable realistic goals and you know timewise in order to be successful or are very very important as well great and just doing a quick scan of the chat because I know there's some questions in here is it true that the liver releases glycogen approximately every five hours give or take and sort of that time that's very and we find that the in times when you're not eating that's when the liver will release the glycogen right so often what you'll observe is you go to bed at night and your blood Sugar's maybe in a desirable range and when you wake up in the morning because it often is a longer than a five-hour static time that's when you'll have the release of the deliver the sugar from the liver because it's a longer time okay and if anybody else are so I'm just reading to the chest but if anybody else has any questions if you want to write them in the queue a pod because they stream really nicely and then I could just take a look at them there I started doing 11 quick post I think I saw one more question in here I'll just wait another couple seconds to if there's any other questions that come in and feed through here yeah there's another one on coconut or and there's some people asking just about the presentation so this is being recorded the audio and then the presentation so when the Diabetes Association gets it up on whatever the website or the place we're going to stored they'll send out an email so everybody can access it okay yes and I see you put up your information here there's a couple people who are asking about the PowerPoint slides aha well for the right price I just might well actually they now have become property of the CDA so you know at best i'm happy i purposely put my home email for the benefit of the audience there because you know certainly addressing this from a work perspective may become a little bit problematic to we had so many attendance today I'm so delighted at the numbers Anna is great yeah you know I'm happy to send them out i mean if i get some you know requests out that's I'm okay to do that as well if not what can also be I think when it's posted onto the website can there be in attachment with the slice you have as well that's what I'm going to look into so once you guys get the link out I'm also going to just type in the diabetes by email it's info bc-ad diabetes at CA so if anything wasn't addressed to or yet any further questions you can definitely email them out over here great and to do a last scan of questions I covered the basics some but I've covered a little bit of everything didn't Lee mm-hmm eating is mentally hello everyone and we wanted to enjoy your food we want you to choose foods that are appealing that have mels texture you know digestibility it's not about dieting it's really about healthy eating and managing blood sugars and keeping well give you me into just being healthy I have another question here how many apples oranges bananas per day is recommended about two to three servings of fruit so if you choose to make them all oranges there's your answer you know if you make them a variety of one orange one apple one pair or berries so you know two to three servings of fruit are desirable start with that mm-hmm very often you like fruit and I'll give it another little if fruit is really something that you tend to over indulge in consider freezing fruit in particular grapes for example that they really can give you a nice satisfying sweetness without over indulging it's quite remarkable how you might find is you can only eat 10 frozen grapes but you might be able to out of F a bag in a sitting if they sit right beside you yeah yeah really enhance the sugar and really satisfy you with a smaller amount and what are the things for example juicing I was at a juicer last month the courage juice emits as they use in foods and that not David but I always wonder you know if I'd use very arrivals use the caution with juicing is if the extractor extracts the fiber then you really lose out on a lot of the merit that we've talked about in terms of yeah that's the first consideration that really the fiber should be retained the second iteration is what the juice items are so if it's primarily the low carb vegetables like the kale celery spinach if eighty percent of the juicing is the low carb of vegetables and that's very desirable with twenty percent of fruit then I'm that's a good combination right but if you're juicing let's say carrots for example and the fiber is being extracted and not being retained then you're getting a fair amount of concentrated our bhai jaise coming in and I'm attic for shooting up the blood sugar or spiking again yeah and I've also heard related to that they say to eat the fruit and juice the vegetables because of fiber like you're just just mentioning either way I mean certainly eaten the fruit is more like I said I still eat the fruit but I you know if you're kind of a mix of both so that's for sure you the food will give you just that much more fiber you know what exercises you're chewing and slows down hopefully the rate at which you eat but yeah that's very it's all about fiber mm-hmm assume an intestinal gut will will manage some you know they're not overextended a sincere thanks a lot and what do you think about low carbon high fat and high protein for managing diabetes think one has to be a little careful with the duration of that menu planning aspect and when I say generation I don't I don't mean a weekend sort of so the question I think relates a little bit to the app concise ended use of high proteins and high-fat can lend itself to an undesirable amount of things happening I mean certainly can raise cholesterol for some folks like the LDL cholesterol my protein diet can play havoc with kidney function and we're talking extended period of time here you know there's a number of things that can occur so really it's about balancing you're looking for a sustained plan and not just a hit miss type of meal plan and if people are struggling with food planning and in you know just with weight control then because they're increasing the activity that's a really important part of this too mm-hmm I can yet a question about the CDA calendar and maybe because I think you discuss the calendar thank you I did yeah the calendar is you can download it from the website at the diabetes dogwood CA there one of my last slide yeah when I laugh with a donor oh so you can download them in black or white or perhaps your local branch if you happen to be close to one they may still have some yep but it's a very nicely laid out calendar excellent recipes good tips and it's a really it's a review of what tonight's presentation as you know I'll follow up over and above the slides a another question here I've been told to drink I think it is key for a kafir milk to help sleep what is good oh oh you know heating milk has long been thought as a sleep enhancer does it activates the protein the tip to fan eating the kefir it's probably more to do with the protein component of it rather than you know Nelly I'm not aware that it is necessarily a sleep inducer but it certainly is desirable to consume because it is a healthy choice it's low in carbohydrate and has good quality protein so sometimes for for nighttime snacking that's very desirable mm-hmm but of 11 approach to that but ok so just that just winding down the questions here just kind of going through them to make sure I haven't missed anything so Kieffer for sleep right I think with the question mm-hmm for sleep problems so that might be this is taken from the sleep center of sleep center yeah I think it's desirable I mean there's no disadvantages to using it mm-hmm but I'm not sure that we have a clear understanding of sort of what it actually list the protein one this was a heated key for right so i think it's again to activate the protein you know contains that fat jon wolf all right and i have mary's question here sorry Mary your I see you a question here but I cut off on my screen size missing the last little bit of it if you are gluten-free and diabetic the carpet or double is compared to the lead based counterpart it's a satisfactory to cut the grains in half to stay on track with calories and carbs or my suggesting limited the number of servings that a healthy choice have developed a week sensitivity and this is on the option for me ah patient with gluten free grains is that one they lack fiber and they're low in iron okay so what has to give some consideration that their digestibility and their absorbability is quite different and so very often if you do have celiac and diabetes we need to really monitor the quantity of these alternate grades that you do use and obviously we need to find ways and flax is a very excellent way of adding some fiber to these grains or substituting them with an almond flour as an alternative for baking or using it as a grain but that isn't one consideration because they are lower in fiber yeah great thank you so much I think we've wrapped up the questions I just have some closing slides if anybody has anything else just feel free to type in the middle I address that so just again I want to thank you I would thank everybody for participating here coming to join our session and I think you reach for

some Jolly Ranchers sugar some strawberry extract Caro syrup some grapes a measuring cup and some toothpicks and I'm just starting off by pouring two cups of sugar so we're gonna add in half a cup of water and then a half a cup of the karo syrup you want to make sure everything is thoroughly combined and then you're gonna set the temperature to medium heat then I'm just washing off my grapes with cold water and the sink nothing specific I'm doing here just letting water run over all of them and you just want to make sure that they're thoroughly dry after and I just use a napkin to Pat them dry and here's how I insert the toothpick inside the grape I basically insert it on the side that doesn't have that little hole at the top because it makes it easier and more sturdy whenever we're dipping it into the syrup in here I'm just using my magic bullet to grind up two Jolly Ranchers because I wanted to have a kind of like powdery consistency [Music] [Music] and hey I'm just taking a cup of cold water and pouring a little bit of syrup in it if when you fill the liquid and it's hard that means it's ready and if it still feels like a soft ball that just means it needs to cook a little longer in here I'm just adding in the strawberry extract I didn't put a specific amount I just put like a dash of it in there and stirred it up and you can use any specific flavor you like I just want it to taste some strawberry [Music] okay I first start off by having my parchment paper on the counter I just laid it out flat just gonna grab the great fighter toothpick and dip it in the syrup I kind of hurt my pop tipsy to the side then you're gonna place it in the cup or play with your Jolly Rancher mix and just kind of scoop it on to the grape in the same steps apply if you don't want a Jolly Rancher mix on it you're just going to dip it into the syrup and then just place it gently on the parchment paper and this is how the grapes came out guys and they were so good leave a comment below if you guys decide to make these and things for watching [Music]", "QdtmCXD3BNI": "for being jolly and eating ranchers read Jolly Ranchers get ready for that sweet sugar rush I don't like sweet fruit and flower do you mind huh what does that smell like to Ducks I liked when you were younger we have to eat the whole pocket that correct when we eat them Louie oh it's really good though isn't

feel great I feel like sugar it's like a nice close cousin of sugar that would take you home after if you were drunk at a practice and just be like go home rather than like come out of dreams", "Al5UfAJOLXo": "hey there today I am bringing you a video to go over my second week of the keto slim down plan that I have made for myself based on an alley Makua Wii video I will post it in the description box below if you want to see how she did it I had watched her video a few weeks ago and was just kind of blown away by the food she was eating and then still able to lose weight so I wanted to go ahead and try my own version of it I did week one a few weeks back and then just kind of got off track and was doing other stuff and didn't do week two right after I did week two this last week and I'm gonna do week 3 next week but if you haven't seen my week 1 video I'll put it in the cards above the results were very different than it was in this video and the the foods I was eating were they were the same in that my main meal was the same but the desserts I was eating was different this last week as well so definitely check that one out but what I'll do is I'll go ahead and show you each day what I was eating and I'm not gonna do daily weigh-ins I'm just gonna show you my beginning weight and then my ending weight and i will total up the weight loss for the week so without further ado i'll go ahead and show you my first weigh-in and first day of eating day 1 so i'm having a hard time today i'm gonna go ahead and have this snack pack it's a sugar-free jell-o zero carbs i think it's like 5 or 0 calories but i'll have this to kind of hold me over until dinner I did some meal prep yesterday and I have to cut up sausages in here I'm gonna go ahead and heat that up have that for dinner with some mustard ok so this is what I will have for dinner it's two sausages and some mustard I have just this really cheap mustard that I got a grocery outlet it's zero carbs and zero calorie have that and then I'll wait a while to have dessert so I'm gonna have a couple pieces of this strawberry jell-o dessert has a mascarpone cheese in it and a pack of jell-o I believe that's it I made it a few weeks ago and it's a little bit crystallized around the edges but it still tastes really good I took a bite out of one of the pieces but I'm gonna go ahead and have two little squares of that and I think I should be good for the rest of the night so I just had my first piece and now I feel really stuff so I'm gonna go ahead and put this piece back it's really good I wouldn't say it's rich I just needed a little something sweet I might have that later okay so I'm having a hard time waiting the for dinner so I'm gonna have some of these I've had already seven I think I'm gonna call that quiz one carb for nine pieces seventy calories so I didn't have these sugar-free Jolly Ranchers anymore so I went ahead to happy they're really tasty though they have all different flavors super yummy but definitely don't eat to make these okay I have my two meal prep sausages again have some mustard and then I also added some barbecue sauce today this is the G hues Hickory that's the nutrition but I only put it very little bit and I'll use those two sauces and I'll have dessert probably in a little bit but if you haven't tried hot link sausages with barbecue sauce it is amazing so I think for dessert tonight I'm gonna have some of this kind of like strawberry fluff with it which is the mascarpone cheese I think it's half a cup of water and a jello pot I'm gonna have some of this in a bowl and top it with some whipped topping okay so I was really looking forward to dessert but you can only eat about half of this it's just it's very satisfying I don't feel like I need to eat a whole bunch so I'm gonna put this back and have it another time I went ahead and had eight of these sugar-free Finland bears had these yesterday and they didn't seem to affect my weight loss so I'm gonna head and had eight right now because I'm feeling hungry and it's not even close to dinnertime so to try to hold me over till dinner I'm having one of these strawberry lemonade ices I haven't tried this flavor before but it's actually pretty good I thought it'd be really tangy but it's very mild but it's got a good flavor to it I like it only two o'clock but I'm really hungry so I'm gonna go ahead and have one sausage and then the other one I will have a little bit later okay so I'm having my other sausage here I have some barbecue sauce and some mustard same mustard I've been using and same barbecue sauce I've been using but this combo is really good because this is this mustard super tangy and this Hickory barbecue sauce is a little sweet on a spicy it's just all the things that's so good but I'm gonna go ahead and eat this and I might have a little bit of dessert right after we'll see okay so after dinner I'm wanting something sweet but not quite my dessert yet I'm gonna have one of these diet dr. pepper cream sodas for some reason diet soda is just tasting like carbonated water to me so I can't really say how great this tastes occasionally I will get a sip that tastes kind of like vanilla but it's been just tasting like carbonated soda but I think that's just something with my taste buds right now so I'm gonna have one of these just to have something a little sweet and then I'll show you when I have dessert I went ahead the rest of this bag which had probably eight pieces left which is about one carb seventy calories but I was feeling hungry first thing in the morning so I had that feeling hungry it's about 12:00 I'm gonna go ahead and put in the freezer let's diet dr. pepper cream soda and hopefully that will hold me over until the afternoon time or dinner okay so it's still a little early for dinner but not by much just by like 30 minutes I went ahead and cut the sausages the middle just to make them a little thinner and then I'll chop them into little pieces and then got my mustard and barbecue sauce just like yesterday and that's what I'll have for dinner so I'm feeling like having something salty but I don't want to have too much of anything so I cut up this pepper jack cheese it is 110 calories for 1 ounce which is an eighth of the block so I cut it in half and then cut each of those pieces and how and I just went ahead and had one of the little squares I didn't do a perfect job cutting you could see that like some of these are a little bit thicker than other but I just can't cut straight so I really feel like having another square but I don't think I can fit it in my calories so I think I'm gonna go ahead and have dessert before I eat something I'm not supposed to I'm gonna have for dessert two of these caramel cup slim-fast keto fat bomb I don't know if I test my ketones with these yet I can't remember but each of them are 90 calories and I'm gonna have two so each is also one met carb eight grams of fat so that should fit into my calories I've been a lot of myself about 400 calories or dessert and since I had that cheese I've had a couple of these I think I will be okay and these are really satisfying so I'm gonna go ahead and have two so it's ten o'clock and I'm feeling hungry I am going to have eight pieces of these gummy bears that'll be about 70 calories it is about two o'clock I'm going to have one of my sausages with some mustard and some Chi Hughes barbecue sauce so I don't really feel like having one of my other sausages but I am gonna have one of these two good yoghurts because if you like something a little bit sweet but not quite my jello they're only 80 calories per cup and they are three total carbs so we'll see if this kind of stops me from losing weight or not but I kind of just felt like it's the last day of my slim down so I figured why not so it's five o'clock I'm gonna have my dessert I'm gonna have two of these you know slim fast fat bombs the caramel cups they're so tasty we have two of these hopefully that's gonna be enough to hold me over for the rest of the night I'm not gonna have cheese today to see if that makes a difference in my weight loss I am just feeling snacky so I am going to have two bags of these smart sweets there are only 80 calories each so I'll still be below my 1154 calories for the day okay so my beginning weight was 137 point two and then you just saw my ending weight was 132 point two I think that is crazy I think I lost a little bit more than that during the five-day egg fast but I was only eating eggs for that so I'm I'm really blown away in my first keto slim down week I was much more strict with it I only had the sausage and mustard and then I only had ghido fluff that I made which was just like cream cheese and jello but this week as you saw I did different variations for dessert and I wasn't quite sure how I was gonna work out but I actually lost almost twice as much weight so in the last keto slim down week that I did I lost 2.8 pounds so my 5 pound weight loss this time was almost twice what I lost the first time so I was pretty blown away by that I'm gonna still play with it and definitely do some things different next week but as of right now I'm really happy with my results and I haven't been feeling like I've been deprived or anything but being able to test my ketones for a couple of different dessert variations was very helpful and then also see if I got kicked out of ketosis but I still lose weight and I know I didn't show it but I had tested my ketones for keto fat bombs from [Music] slimfast and also the peach rings I'll have a product review video coming out showing you those ketone tests but even after having the keto fat bombs and two bags of the patrons which even I thought was a bit excessive but I was still able to lose a full pound from yesterday so that's kind of interesting and I'm gonna keep that in mind during this next week and kind of have those desserts as like a fallback for you know there's some variety because it can definitely it can be hard doing the same thing every day eating the same food every day so I want to have some sort of variety and I've been so scared to have any other dessert options while doing this slim down because Ali MacGraw we had such great results and she didn't like venture out at all so it's like a recipe you know all the ingredients and all the measurements are there and I'm too afraid to alter the measurements at all because I think that like just one little tweak is gonna just mess all of it up and then the outcomes not gonna be the same so I had been worried about doing that in week one but week 2 I was wanting to venture out a little bit because I was struggling a little bit more by being able to have different sweets and having that variety really helped so I'm definitely do that next week I'm going to keep my main meals the same as those hot links because I think that fat is really important in the weight loss results that I'm seeing so I'm gonna continue that but definitely keep an eye out for my week 3 video will probably come out in a couple weeks just because I have a week to do it and then I have to edit it and stuff and editing it actually takes a lot of time I know I'm not the greatest editor but even though it doesn't come out that beautifully it still takes a long time to do so anyways with that being said that is all I have for you guys today a please give this video a thumbs up if you liked it I would really appreciate your feedback drop me a comment if you have any questions about what I did this week or anything keto related I will try and help the best that I can but I really just love talking to you guys and talking anything keto related so definitely drop me a comment I'd love to get to know you guys but I will see you guys in the next one bye", "ULaV_ZP2b3Q": "[Music] hi friends welcome to weeks the marijuana

labs as I said this is my first lollipop not my first candy I've had hard candies from Canada candies before and in the grand scheme or scope of candies they're not bad I still wouldn't necessarily that wouldn't be my first choice for edibles I'd still stick with the confectionaries as always but the kind of candies are far from the worst types of candies so the lollipop I think cost me seven bucks at my dispensary which is a pretty affordable for a 100 milligram edible so let's just go ahead and open up and give it a and give it a taste here this is the first time you've ever tuned in two weeks the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat this lollipop and then I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review not necessarily so much how it tastes so here we go we've got our big gourmet lollipop purpley black give it a lick how many to get to the center one to our you know things yep it tastes like a great bali pop without a lot of flavor and just a hint of weed exactly what I thought it was gonna be not great not terrible pretty much what you think it's gonna be as well think of a mild flavored grape lollipop with a bit of an earthy aftertaste except not as bad as sounding as that and that's what it's gonna taste like but guys without how hey how's this gonna make me feel for that you're gonna have to stay tuned and I will see you guys in two hours I'll be back right here to let you know how I'm feelin thank you so much for watching see you guys soon peace hi guys my dog squid here and I are back to talk to you about panic and ease Medicaid and lollipops the hundred milligram great flavor here I and I'm I'm kind of hi about what I would expect for a hundred milligram at all not a lot of red in the old I boss but again it's only 100 milligrams and I'm feeling about what I would think for that maybe a little bit lower probably just because it's a candy and those don't tend to hit me as hard as the confectionaries um but I don't I'm not dissatisfied with it it's again right in the sort of wheelhouse of what I was expecting didn't taste terrible I'm moderately high and for a candy it's it's one that I can recommend and it's pretty cheap bet like I said I think it cost me seven bucks so it's affordable it doesn't taste terrible and it got me pretty it got me a little high so it's what I was looking for what I was about what I was expecting if you're in the mood for a lower dose edible or if you're a new smoker and you want something a little bit higher dose that you can sort of media it out over time maybe give the lollipops a chance especially these ones from can of candies I can verify I and SC labs can verify you know they'll it will it will get you high and it doesn't taste too bad so that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys I really appreciate you tuning in as always we we'll see you on the next review and thank you so much for watching

"hey everyone so I just wanted to share with you guys a really quick easy healthy yummy recipe this is almost it's so simple that I feel kind of silly even doing a video on it but I feel like you know if you guys don't know about this and you are wanting some more healthy snack ideas this is a really good one to add to your pile because these are really really delicious and so what today is just some candied frozen grapes and all you need for this is some grapes which I have mine right here you just want to rinse them good and I have them in my little colander and then I just let them dry a little bit yeah but you still want them to be slightly wet so don't try them completely and then in this bowl you can use any flavor of jell-o that you would like but I have found that I like the blue raspberry or berry jell-o is the best with these and I also really like it the best with green grapes but you can experiment and see what you like the best so then you're just gonna pour some of your grapes once you have your grapes in your jello make sure you're just going to roll them around and get them all covered in the mixture and then you're going to put them in a ziploc bag or an airtight container and put them in your freezer and then you can just munch on them and they're super good this is what they look like when they're all ready to go in the freezer they're just lightly covered with the jello powder and then like I said you just stick them in the freezer and let them freeze so you want to let them freeze for at least a few hours if not overnight and then you can just munch on them and they're really good they taste like candy and Colton wants them but they're not frozen yet so I hope you guys enjoy this if you try it", "IOBS-mWbpZo": "hello everyone this is Sarah Marie one of the registered dieticians with the villages health today we will be presenting on decoding the Nutrition Facts label so we're going to be diving into this little label that we all see on the back of most of our foods that we have so we're gonna do an overview of the components of the Nutrition Facts label talk about why the label is relevant some label updates so you might have noticed that the label was updated as of 2020 we're gonna break down the the label so going into every component of the Nutrition Facts label going into some health claims too so that is them those claims that you might see on the front of the label Delvin what those actually mean and then how to actually apply the label to your life so what to actually take away from learning more about the Nutrition Facts label the Nutrition Facts label tells us how much in of what so it tells us about the food that we're looking at the serving sizes looked serving the percent daily value per serving and the nutrients per serving as well the macro mic micronutrients are included not everything is listed on there but we'll dive more into that in just a moment here um this also includes the new the ingredient list so the ingredients was part of the Nutrition Facts label so why is the label relevant why do we have this like I just said it tells us how much and of what of the foods that we're looking at and it has been required in some form since 1994 so it was developed originally in the 90s and it was developed to may help us make more healthy and more informed food choices so we want to know what we're actually eating and this tells us and it's required on most prepared foods except with no significant nutrition value so coffee is spices things like that teas you won't see it listed on those foods because there's no significant nutritional value whereas like coffee and tea you might see caffeine listed that's a requirement but Nutrition Facts label there is standard form like I said they came up with the original form in the 1990s and then they did just update it and in 2020 so we'll go into that more in just a moment as well this is the standard Nutrition Facts label that you probably recognize that's the standard format that they came out in 1994 and it does break down the serving size in servings per container and then you'll see everything that we just mentioned briefly and we'll go more into that in just a second here you can see the difference between the old label and the new label a new label for the FDA company has had to release this by 2020 with a few exceptions but in general 2020 they have to roll out this new label you can see some huge differences that are pretty obvious here I think the calories is pretty much shouting at everyone right now the calories is much bigger and bolder another bigger bolder area is that serving size those servings per container and serving said do you want to pay attention Jill and they tried to make that a little bit more obvious for people too so to give an example here the serving size at this boot is 2/3 of a cup so that would be the volume measurement and then they have the weighted measurement right beside that as 55 grams so if you were to weigh out 2/3 of a cup of this food it would weigh 55 grams on your scale so that's just giving you another unit to look at if you don't have that measuring cup if you have a scale that's a great way to get some accurate idea of what a serving size of this food looks like and then everything has broken down in the amount per serving below this so for 8 servings per container 1/8 of this food this food product or 2/3 of a cup or 55 grams of this food you're looking at 230 calories and you can see here that the calories from fat were actually removed on the new food label so like I said in the 90s when the original food label was developed and you know the big fad and the 90s was low fact everything in ideas but we realized not that bad and we'll go into that more in just a second - so you can see you know there's really no purpose for that calories from fat there it really wasn't doing anything beneficial for our health so they went ahead and remove that and it made more room for us to put the calories a lot bigger and bolder say we can see that that's really important to some other changes just moving down on the list the fat stays the same cholesterol sodium total carbohydrates still listed there dietary fiber is still listed and then you can see sugars so this is a little bit of a typo on this it's supposed to say twelve sugars the twelve grams of sugar here on the left as it does up here on the right but that's just a little typo but you can see in the new food label you can see total sugars listed and then includes however many grams from added sugar that's a new line there so we can see for this food from the twelve grams of total sugar that's in the food ten grams of that is from added sugar ten grams of the sugar is dumped in by the manufacturer there's only two grams of natural sugar in this food product this is really helpful to tell us the quality of the food that we're actually looking at protein stayed the same and then a couple of them minerals and vitamins here on the bottom changed they took off bought a vitamin A and vitamin C and they added vitamin D and potassium so back when they came up with the food label in the 90s most Americans were actually deficient or at least many Americans were actually deficient in vitamin A and vitamin E that's actually not the case anymore that with so many rare foods are fortified that's actually not it relevant so they removed those and they added something more relevant to us vitamin A and potassium I mean vitamin D and potassium those are minerals and vitamins that most Americans are actually deficient and now so we really would like to focus on those trying to make sure people are getting added calcium and iron are still listed many people are still deficient in calcium and iron in a daily basis so those are still listed there another difference that you might see is that confusing chart on the bottom left there completely removed no one really paid attention to that part so they went ahead and removed it it was really just taking up a lot of space that we can use for other things so that's something we like to see gone you might also notice some differences in the percent daily values that are listed there those percent daily values are still based on a 2,000 calorie per day diet but they did change some of the recommended daily allowances for people so we'll go into that more in just a second too but just something to note there and that's just an overview of the differences we have here at larger bolder serving size larger and bolder calorie is updated percent daily values they added added sugars to the foods they change some of the nutrients also change that put out there as I said the serving size is different here we can see the difference here but their serving size is the primary place that we should look when we're looking at the food label and to note it is developed by the manufacturer some foods there is a standard serving size but it is just a serving size it's not the portion that you necessarily would eat at that food so you definitely want to pay attention to the serving size and servings per container initially and think about how much of it you would actually eat the serving size is not always realistic to what you would actually eat of that food so pay attention to that part first and take into account ok I would actually make 2 servings out of this 8 serving per container box or whatever it might be just be really really honest with yourself and think about how much of that food you would actually eat because like I said it's developed by the manufacturers now by consumers so think about how much of the food you would actually eat and take that into account because everything below is based on that serving size that they list right here serving sizes with the new food label as well they did change some foods that many people would eat the whole thing up or they would eat you know fewer or they would eat more servings of than listed on the food label they tried to make things a little bit more realistic which is appreciated by many consumers you know a lot of times a pint of ice cream people will make three servings out of it some people make one serving out of it but they did change they are starting to change the serving sizes to be more relevant to how people actually eat their food you may notice many foods that look like they may be a single serving bag they would say there's actually four servings in there or two servings in there so now they will mostly list for a certain that they recommend and for the whole container which is really helpful they're also doing this with many beverages so instead of if you buy a 16 ounce soda or something instead of listing two servings for the container and they'll often list that's how many people would actually consume that so it's allowing people to make more informed decisions in that way and moving down on the food label you have the calories listed here first and this is that amount per serving that's why that serving size is so important but what is calories calories is simply the energy that you would receive from that food how much energy that food would provide to you so where is that energy coming from it's coming from the facts the carbohydrates and the proteins from their foods so calories are actually calculated from the fat carbohydrates and protein that are in the food that you're looking at if you're having anything with alcohol in it alcohol also is a source of calories but that's not often the case when we're eating food that for instance has nine calories per gram carbohydrates and protein both have four calories per gram so you can actually calculate how many calories are in your food without looking at the calories of top if you have the carbohydrates protein and we'll go into that more a little bit later as well which I like to call it the calorie game I think it's fun so the 2,000 calorie per day is that it is that rents amount for everything that you'll see on the food label list so just keep that in mind there are many other things that take an account when you're calculating how many calories someone needs the typical person may or may not need 2,000 calories per day you know a teenager boy who's very active versus an older petite woman very different calorie needs you definitely want to take into and to account other things like your age your activity level your height your weight your frame and your health goals are you trying to gain weight or lose weight or what are you actually trying to do with your health so this percent daily value is based on that 2,000 calorie per day recommendation so it's like I said not not accurate for everyone to go off of this 2,000 calories per day especially about you confusing for people which is why I always encourage people to pay attention to the actual amounts listed in the food and know what their goals actually are so this percent daily value not the most accurate thing it's just kind of to give a reference for okay this is how much a 2,000 calories per day diet would be maybe maybe that is what's recommended for you maybe you're shooting for more or less but just take that again to account this percent daily value can be confusing moving down on the food label list right after your calories you'll see fat listed that is listed into total fat and then you have saturated fat and trans fat listed from those fats you also have cholesterol down there um so total fat you have 8 grams of total fat in this food for instance and you have 1 gram of saturated fat zero grams from trans fats but it doesn't quite add up to the total fat does it so you have to Grande zero grams of trans fats where the other 7 grams of fat coming from the 7 grams of fat that are not listed on this food are going to be coming from unsaturated fats so those are gonna be our poly and monounsaturated fats they are not required to be listed on the food label some manufacturers will listed on the food labels but it's not required so many do not list it at all that's just something to keep in mind there are unsaturated factor are more heart-healthy fats or more cardioprotective facts so they are definitely not something that we necessarily want to avoid so just keep in mind it's kind of the warning facts that we have listed on here we have the total fat which can include the healthy fats you have the saturated fat so one gram of saturated fat you may want to limit your saturated fat the general recommendation is 20 grams is less than 20 grams of saturated fat per day but if you do have any kind of heart disease or are at risk of having heart disease the recommendation is lower increasing your daily recommended amount of fat did increase but this latest food release food label release and that increased from 65 grams to 78 grams per day so you will see that the percentage here increased as well so they went from 12 percent of your recommended amount to 10 percent of your recommended amount and that's because of the increase in the recommended amount for a typical American the trans fats you do want to avoid trans fat so you would hope to see zero there and actually as of 2020 they are not allowed to roll out and you that has trans fats in it so largely these trans fats are going to be coming from foods in our diet that do not have the food label there or maybe you're going to a restaurant and it's being created and we can go more into that in just a minute as well cholesterol you'll see here this is dietary cholesterol most dietary cholesterol actually get in the colon before it actually hits our bloodstream so if you're trying to lower your cholesterol levels in your blood your LDL cholesterol specifically going for that dietary cholesterol is not necessarily going to be so helpful if you're eating an adequate amount of fiber in your diet you moreso want to limit the saturated fats in your diet if you're trying to manage your cholesterol those good fats like I was mentioning those unsaturated fats those are gonna be our mono and our polyunsaturated fats our polyunsaturated fats are where we get our omega-3 fatty acids there's really heart-healthy fats that we love those are gonna be coming largely from RE fatty fish like our tuna and our salmon sardines as well walnuts are actually the highest nuts in omega-3 fatty acid so a very heart healthy for us monounsaturated fats are also cardioprotective those are gonna be things like our olive oil or vegetable oils our nut butters like peanut and almond butter and avocados are also very high in mono apart healthy fats and and we don't like to pick on those very much saturated fats like I was saying the ABA the American Diabetes Association and the American Heart Association recommend no more than seven percent of your total calories per day coming from your saturated fats so if you are if you do have any kind of high blood pressure or are at risk of developing heart disease you want to avoid eating more than 57% of your your calories from saturated fats per day so if you were on a 2,000 calorie per day diet may be shooting for less than 15 grams it's not treated fat in any day the saturated fats are largely coming from our dairy products those whole milk dairy products so cheese milk whole fat yogurt and then this fatty meats our animal meats like bacon sausage pepperonis some cold cuts those are the fattier cold cuts but many going to be high in fat premiums butters margarine palm and oil and a lot of hydrogenated oils are going to be high in saturated fat so I like to think about the tropical oils as being higher in saturated fats almond and coconut oil or high in saturated fats and then if you do see hydrogenated oil on your food label those are typically going to be big sources of saturated fats as well trans fatty acids those are really coming from partially hydrogenated oil so their oils that have been heated and disfigured in some way oftentimes they're a lot more shelf stable so they're stable at room temperature so if you look at your ingredients list and you see partially hydrogenated oils that foods going to contain trans fats but it has been required to be taken out of circulation added as of January 1st of this year so it's actually should not be in circulation anymore they're linked to a bunch of negative health effects in our body it increases our body stores of fat it increases insulin resistance increases inflammation and LDL cholesterol that's that lousy cholesterol it's been linked to decreasing our good cholesterol that HDL cholesterol and it's often found in in processed foods those relationships stable foods like like things like Twinkies that don't go bad forever or things like like a stick margarine so steak margarine is stable at room temperature it doesn't melt at all and that's because of those trans fatty acids that are typically they're very shelf stable margarine on the other hand it's gonna be more heart-healthy they don't put they don't make trans fatty acids in there because it doesn't need to be stable and in a stick form at room temperature but many shortenings are going to be high in trans fatty acids like lard fast foods or anything that you might get thats fried at a restaurant it's gonna be happy just thinking about how often they actually change that fry oil trans fatty acids can occur when food when oil is overheated or heated many times so if you're buying fried food if you're getting french fries from a restaurant think about how often they might actually be changing that oil out it could have been heated a number of times between the time that they originally poured it to the point that is actually on your plate so a there could easily be trans fatty acids in that fried food and these are just more reasons to avoid those trans fatty acids especially so it like the bodies tends to store it way more often it increases insulin resistance which can affect your blood sugar control and increases inflammation which is going to damage all of the soft blood tissues of your body and it does does decrease your HDL cholesterol that good cholesterol that we like to see higher in the blood and it has been linked to raising your LDL cholesterol and your triglycerides so we do not like to want to avoid that if we can't no diem is going to be the next thing you see on your food label the recommended daily value for the typical American is 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day so this is just for a typical American without heart without a blood pressure or any kind of heart disease so many Americans actually need to be on a low-sodium diet because of those comorbidities so thinking about what might be recommended for you in your specific situation a low sodium diet is considered 1,500 to 2,000 milligrams of sodium per day so that percent daily value on the side there is not going to be applicable to you if you are to follow a low-sodium diet just to give you a comparison a typical American is eating about 3,600 milligrams of sodium a day so we're way over the recommended amount even if you don't have any kind of high blood pressure or heart disease so just something to keep in mind there and it is listed for serving so 160 milligrams per serving of this food and we do want to pay attention to this one because most of our sodium is coming from our process and pre-prepared foods it's not always coming from the salt shaker but to give you an idea one teaspoon salt does have 2300 milligrams in sodium that's the whole amount of daily value for his typical American so if a recipe calls for one teaspoon of salt thinking about you're adding your whole day's worth of salt right there into the recipe how much of that food are you actually going to eat is just a mineral and it is a major part of our table salt that we have so sodium chloride is table salt so sodium is a huge part of that obviously like I said most Americans are eating too much sodium in their diet and that's largely coming from those process in pre-prepared foods not necessarily the salt shaker but if you do need to reduce your sodium intake getting rid of that salt shaker is going to be a step in the right direction trying to use other herbs and spices in your foods even different methods of preparation can help to release those natural flavors from our grilling can help to release some natural flavors without having to add too much more sodium too much more salt to your food or a general American we all need to eat less salt so label reading oftentimes you'll see it advertised foods advertised as low sodium or very low sodium or reduce sodium what it is actually mean those are actually regulated terms that they put on the food labels so some things very low sodium those are typically going to be something that's pretty natural in form it's gonna be probably be a whole foods like a piece of vegetable like asparagus or something like that very low sodium means it has 35 milligrams of sodium or less per serving so that's a very low sodium food a low sodium food has a hundred and forty milligrams or less per serving just to give you perspective a food label that we were just looking at how to 160 milligrams of sodium per serving so not quite low sodium but pretty close reduced sodium is when you want to be wary about you do want to look at the food label for this one to see sodium it's actually in that food because reduced sodium simply means that the food is reduced by 25% of the sodium than the original food product so the original can of soup say had a thousand milligrams of sodium per serving then reduced sodium variety still has 750 milligrams of sodium so still a very high sodium food but it is less than the original product so they can advertise this being nice and it's a quick tip that some people like to use if salts listed in the first five ingredients it's probably too high in sodium I like to just look at the actual amount of sodium that you have in the food it gives you a better idea of exactly what you're looking at when you're eating out or if you if you are dining out at all it can be helpful to try to see how you can modify that food product on your own if you're going to a chain they actually have to post the nutrition information online so you can actually look up how much sodium is in the food that you are planning to eat before you actually go the chain that you're going to nutrition so say like Olive Garden nutrition just put that into your search engine and it will often come up with a PDF or some kind of interactive menu that you can click along and see how many milligrams of sodium is actually in your food product you can also see the calories and carbohydrates everything like that listed there as well so a very helpful tool to use if you have the capabilities of doing that or you go out to eat if you don't then you can always see how you can make modifications on your own to asking for sauces or dressing on the side is always going to be an improvement that's typically where a large amount of the salt is going to be lying for your foods so if there is any kind of barbecue sauce on your food maybe you can get that barbecue sauce on the side there's dressing with your salad I try to get that dressing on the side that way you can actually moderate how much of that is actually going on to your food oftentimes restaurants will really cover that food in the dressing or the sauce so can help you to be more moderate in that way also thinking about some other things that might do tongs or something that you can do without any kind of crunchy little things those are typically going to be higher in sodium if you can do without that you can easily reduce the amount of sodium that you're actually eating there you know it's not going to make low-sodium food necessarily but you can at least make an improvement carbohydrates are the next things listed on our foods here your total carbohydrates listed there so carbohydrates are made up of sugar starch and fiber so when they say total carbohydrates that's including all three of those different components there but again this really isn't adding up here so you have 37 grams total grams of total carbohydrates in this food 7 grams from fiber and 12 grams from sugar so the other 21 grams of carbs in this food is going to be coming from starch they do not have to list starch on the food label they typically do not so you just keep that in mind when you're looking at the total carbohydrates it won't add up there and that's because starch is not listed on the food label fiber that you see there the dietary fiber most Americans are not getting an adequate amount of fiber during the day the standard daily value is 28 grams per day and this does vary by country some countries are up to 40 grams of fiber per day as their recommendation so we're on the lower end and most Americans typically aren't even hitting that much so we do want to try to increase the fiber where we can we do want to increase it slowly though increasing your fiber all at once can cause GI distress so increasing your fiber slowly and then making sure you're drinking plenty of water with that as well because it can cause constipation if you're not drinking adequate amounts of water and increasing your fiber intake the sugar is listed there as I mentioned earlier on they added the added sugar so we can see that there's no recommendation for total sugar in the diet but there is a recommendation for added sugar and that doesn't mean that we want to necessarily hit all 100 gram that 100% of our added sugar that's just to give you an idea we don't want to go over that 100% of that recommended amount so for an average American this standard value is 50 grams but you look at somewhere like the American Heart Association their recommendation is somewhere between 25 and 36 grams of added sugar per day so a lot less than the standard daily value that they're listing here however the typical American consumes more than 82 grams of shadowed sugar per day so we are far exceeding even that's higher and spectrum of recommended amount of sugar so like I was saying this can tell us about the the quality of the food product that we're looking at so it is very helpful to pay attention for that part right there I do you like this addition to the food label so where are carbohydrates coming from our sugary foods like our fruit fructose is the primary carbohydrate there it's a sugar it's our fruit sugar so this is coming from frozen fruit fresh fruit fruit dried or fruit juice milk also is the source of sugar in the form of lactose so that's another carbohydrate there yogurt just like milk art um lactose is going to be the primary sugar there unless they're flavoring it in some way so trying to go for the more plain yogurt so if you can Greek yogurt it's gonna have some protein there as well so it's gonna have a little bit more protein than your standard yogurt so a nice slower absorption of those carbohydrates then if you just did a regular yogurt starchy foods are going to be things like our pasta our breads and our bagels any kind of breads foods pancakes waffles rice starchy vegetables like potatoes peas corn beans crackers are also gonna be starchy foods as well just to give you an idea where our carbohydrate we do want to go for the more quality carbohydrates so going for those whole fruits and whole vegetables if we can going for whole grains when possible as well so looking at your bread ingredient list and trying to make sure that the first ingredient there is going to be a whole grain so whole is the word that we're looking for to start out the ingredients so it's important to look at that there these foods are going to be higher in fiber and they're gonna have a slower rate of absorption which is gonna give us more sustained energy it's gonna help to keep us full longer oftentimes these food are up foods are off actually higher in water content as well so they're gonna have more volume help to keep us cool they're gonna help to keep us more hydrated these foods are gonna be a much more beneficial than empty carbohydrates here these are going to be more sugary foods more processed foods cookies ice cream cake and e-chips these are going to be more processed and they're going to be lower so when we want carbohydrates we want to get the best quality carbohydrates that we can get they want the higher fiber carbohydrates so looking at your food label list and seeing the fiber contact comparing it out with the foods that you're looking at going for the high fiber when you can like I said you don't want to increase that fiber overnight if this is where you typically get your carbohydrates from you don't want to just swap over to the other list without increasing your water intake and being prepared for any kind of GI distress being acutely aware of any kind of GI distress that you might be feeling and taking that into account so what is fiber fiber is the indigestible or hard to digest part of our plant foods some of it most of it is passed through the intestines without being digested but we do have got bacteria that actually can help just to break down that fiber as well so giving us more energy in that way these foods are higher and in a lot of micronutrients and vitamins like vitamin E and magnesium so we love these fiber rich so so we want to aim for around 25 to 35 grams of fiber per day and we can actually see these sometimes listed on the food label as an excellent source of fiber if they're if they have 5 grams of fiber or more and then a good source of fiber if they have two point five to four point nine grams of fiber so going for those excellent and good sources of fiber but you can always just flip the food around or go for those old foods and like I said fiber does contribute to our digestive help it helps us to stay regular helps to prevent any diarrhea or constipation it can help us to feel full and satisfied after eating so these are the way we want to go if possible the next thing on your food label that you'll see is protein and you'll see that there is no percent daily value listed for protein and that's because this does vary so much per person getting enough protein so it's really not too much of a concern most Americans want to get at least 50 grams of protein per day adult adult Americans want to get at least 50 grams of protein a day depending on their activity level this may increase it might decrease slightly but in general about 50 grams of protein per day is the minimum amount that you want to get where our proteins coming from of course they're coming largely from our animal products and then from some some vegetable sources as well so it they are really important to help us build muscle repair muscle tissue they're important for every cell in our body and proteins do have a much slower absorption rate than our carbohydrates so if they're absorbed for about 4 to 6 hours from our stomach our bloodstream verses carbohydrates being absorbed but in about one to two hours so if you're looking for something to keep you cool for a while try to have something balanced with a little bit of protein there it'll help to slow down the absorption give you a more steady blood sugar rise and fall and they're an important they're a standard serving of protein it's going to be a three ounce serving which is about the size of a deck of cards some people like to compare that to their palm so if you have a deck of cards here that to the sides of your palm you know our palm size varies so much so you can use that as a standard way as well our like I said our proteins are coming from a largely I'm not amount of our a large amount of our animal products so like our fish I'm meat poultry and pork our eggs we do want to go for the lean cuts if we can they're going to be lower in saturated fats so remove the skin when you can remove any of that visible fat that you may see I'd only get a more lean cut and you know egg yolks is going to be the majority it's gonna be all of the fat and the eggs but you're looking out there if you want to lean source of protein from your eggs go for the egg whites through the egg substitutes geez it's gonna be another source of protein but again it's gonna be higher in saturated fat so try to go for the reduce or the low fat cheese to give you an idea one ounce of cheese has 5 grams of saturated fat so if you're going for a reduced saturated fat diet that can be you know quite a bit of your saturated fat for the whole day if you're going for just 7 percent of your calories from saturated nuts and beans peas lentils Williams they're all going to be good sources of plant proteins they're also going to be lower in saturated fats than our animal proteins so they're a great way to get some quality protein and without a lot of saturated fat that's not butters tofu soy those are all made from soy beans so a nice team source they're trying to get a lot of proteins from there it's gonna be a great way to increase your fiber in as well so you're getting plenty of fiber from those those plant sources of protein moving down on the food label like I mentioned vitamin D and potassium are now on the food label list and they took off and they also added the gram the milligram or the microgram amounts of these though the actual amounts listed there versus just the percent daily value which is more helpful when we have specific goals that you're actually shooting for calcium and iron are still there and they removed that using chart there on the bottom so this is where we're going to play the what I call the calorie game to see how many calories were actually getting from this food just based on what we see here that the carbohydrates and the proteins if you remember that's where our calories are coming from fat carbs and protein and you should them have their own amount of calories per gram so fat has nine calories per gram carbs and proteins both have four calories per gram so if we take a look at this food we can see the fat grams in this food there's nine calories per gram and in this food we have eight grams of total fat listed so 72 calories from fat moving down to our carbohydrates we've got 37 grams and total carbs in this food our carbohydrates has four calories per gram so 7 times 37 times four we have a hundred and forty eight calories from carbohydrates in this food protein listed here is three grams of protein so four calories per gram of protein four times three we have 12 calories from protein in this food adding that all up together you have the actual calories of being 232 calories in this food versus what they're saying the calorie amount in this food is 230 so they're actually allowed to round these numbers and they do pretty much always it's very rare that you'll actually see 232 or 237 or an odd number listed there so they do often round these numbers so just something to keep in mind there there are a little bit of hidden calories listed in your food that are not listed in your food rather so something to keep in mind if you ate with two extra calories per serving actually 16 calories there that can kind of add up throughout the day if they're rounding on a major scale or if you're eating a large amount of other servings of this many different foods it can really add up little ways so just something to keep in mind there I like to play the calorie game every once in a while just to see how how far off they can go as I mentioned your ingredients list is also included here it's an important part of that that food label and the ingredients like I was saying saying you always want to look for that hole in your food looking for the whole grain the whole wheat you can see in this new label here on the right we have exactly that that whole word and it is in descending order about weight so if whole wheat flour is the first ingredient on this food that's what is contributing they're the most weight to this food water is the second post and then corn syrup is the third mode give you an idea of where your ingredients fall but it doesn't say exactly how much of each is listed in the food you just see the order and like I said you want the first ingredient to be a whole food so typically the first three ingredients in the food label it's gonna give you an overall idea of what the food actually is for this bread that we have here whole wheat flour white water and corn syrup it's probably obviously grab it is breath but you can see it probably is bread because the flour water and syrup and sugar essentially so I'll give you an idea there food we have pasteurized sweet cream and salt probably butter what you this so some people say to look for clean labels but I like to pay attention to the actual Nutrition Facts label because just because there's two ingredients in this food doesn't mean that it's an excellent food to go for it's still higher in saturated fats so just keep that in when you're looking at your food it is helpful to go for the fewer ingredients the better you know compared to this ingredients list there's a lot of things on here that you probably can't even pronounce so going for the fewer ingredients is always going to be better but not always meaning it's a free-for-all this is something else I like to attention to to what the ingredient list there are so many things that they can say in terms of sugar so if we look at this list here we have corn syrup listed and we might have you we have honey there that's another source of sugar there are so many different things names for sugar in our food this is just really for the wow factor of how many different names for sugar there really are our food and this is cutting it off somewhere to you know this isn't literally all of the sources of sugar that you can have but this is to give you an idea of how many different names for sugar can be listed that's why I love that they added that includes however many grams from added sugar on that way you can instead of knowing every single word sugar that there may be you can just look at the added ingredient and added sugar and how many graham added sugar is actually much more explicit I don't know how many of you guys have seen this facts up front here and it's listed on the front of your foods and this is something that you'll often see on on especially cereals I see it on a lot of cereals and it's something that's not federally regulated it's something that the manufacturers came up with on their own and they started rolling it out on their own so it's the industry created version of the nutrition facts panel you can see that there's only a few things listed here four things are listed here versus if you turn the food around you would get a lot more information of what you're actually looking at on the food so I always bring a skeptical eye to this because it is kind of what then your company wants to highlight from their food it's not always going to be the best thing to look at they're probably just highlighting things that that they think people might want to know about their foods so if it's gonna be a low sugar or food they're probably going to mark it up as being they're probably going to put their sugar upfront here even though you might actually be just watching the total carbs that you're eating so looking at the food label instead of being distracted by the fact that front here I always bring after or I do this some other health claims that we may want to keep in mind and we might see on our food labels so you'll probably feel ganic on your food labels so organic is a regulated term it's made that the food is made without most conventional pesticides fertilizers or without fertilizers that have any kind of synthetic ingredients or is made without sewage sludge bio engineering ionized radiation so it's out without any of those those types of fertilizers so it's avoiding conventional pesticides only using these organic pesticides that are actually allowed and those are the only ones that are used so organic actually is a health claim that is regulated and often times these foods are made in more nutrient dense soil so typically these foods are going to have more nutrients to them but that's that's pretty much the only difference here there hasn't been any negative effects really to conventional if that's what you can afford and by all means by the conventional fruits and vegetables you don't have to buy just organic but there are probably a little bit more nutrients in the organic varieties non GMO is another claim that you might see so non GMO is a regulated health claim and all organic food is non GMO non GMO is not inherently organic so they are two different terms they do mean two different things and the non GMO means that they're made with foods from non GMO ingredients and there are only certain things that are allowed to be GMO or genetically modified organisms in industry so it it can be made the foods made without GMO are genetically modified or corn soybeans NOLA alfalfa so they're foods without those ingredients have been genetically modified in some way often times they do genetically modified the foods just so that they be more resistant to drought or certain pests or other types of diseases so they're not genetically modifying it for necessarily negative reasons they're trying to increase the crop in that way and I think the biggest health concern here has been what they're actually doing to the environment versus what actually is going on in the human body when we eat GMO foods there hasn't been any negative health effects that have been linked to people eating GMO foods versus non GMO foods GMO free this is an impossible claim to test you can't grab a section of a food and test if there's GMOs in it that's not a testing so GMO free is an impossible claim if you see that definitely you know put the product down that's probably something a little out there no added hormones this one can be misleading because all poultry must be raised without hormones so if you see this on your poultry and it's marked up a whole bunch keep in mind all poultry has to be raised without hormone so that's something to just bring a skeptical eye to page three so this is you know usually our eggs or our chicken so chicken have to have one square foot of roaming space in cage free foods to be labeled as cage free so one square foot I don't know if you want to think about that hold your hands up and try to see what a 1 square foot of roaming space actually looks like it's not very big so a 1 square foot of worming space for cage free chickens you know it's really if I don't know how much of quality of life that actually is free-range one square foot of roaming space except for they do have access to the outdoors but it's not regulated how much they actually go outside so this can be one small window that they have at the top of the cube and it's not regulated how often they actually go outside this can be open or you know two hours of the day and then they close it again and every range so not really you know a regulated health claim and then pasture-raised so this one's actually more legitimate pasture aids means that the animals actually have access to the past year all year round so they can't actually go as they please grass-fed so they the grass-fed animals in addition that to they can they're fed the grass in addition to being able to roam the pastures as they please so they're fed grass they may be supplemented sometimes with with grain but the primary food intake is is that grass because they can go throughout the pastures and so grass fed animals are typically higher in omega-3 fatty acids because they're eating more grass which is higher in omega-3 fatty acids and the soy or the corn or whatever feed that they might actually be eating so so these foods are going to be higher in omega-3 fatty acids so healthier for us so those are just a few health claims back and I like to go through um you can always let me know if you have more question but you know all in all portions is the name of the game portions portions portions we like to say so people are notoriously awful at estimating how much is serving actually is when they try to serve themselves a cup we're pretty bad at doing that so get out those measuring cups actually not measure your food out if you have a food scale that's a great way to go about it to the weight of the serving is always listed on the food label there so you can actually weigh out your food and it's really important especially if you're first getting started and then check in with yourself every couple of weeks or so to make sure that your portions haven't accidentally gotten away from whatever you're actually shooting for so by all means get out those measuring have certain skills and and try to get some accuracy they're his versions is the name of the game and it can allow you to have more flexibility to you might realize that you're eating less than you initially thought or you might be eating more than your initial and now you can actually be more accurate with and there is there are some tools out there and this is one that I like it just using your hand as a reference because you bring these with you everywhere you go so there are great references to use and this is a little blurry but three to four ounces of protein is typically going to be about the size of your palm but like I said these palm sizes vary for us so maybe bring out on the side so a deck of cards and compare that to your palm size that'll be about three or four our one thumbnail is about a teaspoon so if you're looking for a teaspoon of butter just going for one thumbnail your thumb your holes on this this would be about a serving for some peanut butter or or some cheese one thumb it's gonna be the serving bear your fist is about the size of a cup for everyone's this size berries and these are all up for discretion but you know just as rules of thumb a cup is about a fist so if you're looking for a serving of casserole I mean that Thanksgiving dinner or something one cup button size of your fist it's going to be a serving in that casserole 1/2 of a cup it's going to be about the size of one cupped hand so if you're looking for a half a cup of I don't have potatoes or ice cream or something you can kind of use your hand to visualize how much you could actually fit in there and then to cupped hands is going to be about an ounce so about a serving of chips or crackers or pretzels would be about two cups hands but this is you know just to naturally cup can not necessarily piled high and imbalancing so you know be honest with yourself there we're all pretty good at lying somewhere and others though I just try to be honest there's also the my plate um so my plate I'm going to show you here this is the my plate is just to give you a general idea so in general you can use this as your as your your steps so using a dinner plate you can cut it down the middle and then cut another section into quarters see you resections on your plate you want to fill the largest section with non starchy vegetables so think your your broccoli carrots cauliflower candy and a mixed salad full of you know lettuce and tomatoes peppers onions mushrooms so that would be the largest section this smallest section when you would want to put your starchy foods or your grain so let's rice or potatoes your your winter squashes perhaps or your your pasta now make up a quarter of your plate and then the other quarter of your plate would be your protein so some kind of animal source perhaps like this sure or again or something going for those and then you would want to add a serving of fruit or you could add dairy or both as your meal plan allows so yeah so in lieu of dairy in this food in this plate we had fruit oftentimes we can get the same amount of the same vitamins and minerals that we can come right Dario we can get from our fruit so having that side of fruit or or dairy is a great way to get that in and then we have water here on the sides so staying hydrated as well this library that we're eating and then of course you see this ruler here on the bottom this is for a standard nine inch plate lights have gotten larger over the years so I encourage everyone to try to pay attention to the size of their plates if you put the same amount of food on a larger plate it's gonna look like a lot less food so be honest with yourself about the size of your plate sometimes it can be helpful to get a smaller plate if you're trying to lose weight so you know be be aware of how big your plates actually offer out to eat those plates are typically even larger about 11 inches or so so I'm trying to just keep that in mind when you aren't going out to eat this may be a very large plate so if it could just be this could be a lot of food on a large plate and it doesn't look like much to me or you know just being aware of what you're actually doing their plate sizes can make it big difference in our breeding and then a recap of nutrition but you do want to do read those food labels try to measure your food and beverages so you can be aware of how much you're actually eating we do want to eat carbohydrates but going more for those those more quality carbohydrates over the empty carbohydrates when you can try to eat your protein we're going for the lean protein as that will be less than saturated fat you know those healthy fats those unsaturated fats are going to be more heart-healthy so we want to go for those ones we want to watch our sodium content as we saw the most Americans are eating too much sodium so we do want to try to limit the sodium where we can and I do have a plan no or that way to have some kind of ballpark idea of what your what you're trying to do um try not to eyeball or guess your food especially at first and like I said humans are notoriously bad at being able to estimate volume so do try to measure avoiding those empty carbohydrates if you can I'm going for this more car behalf this more quality carbohydrates where you can and try not to eat too much saturated fat for sodium try to limit those ones and definitely don't get discouraged no one's perfect there's no one perfect eating plan so just trying to do the best with what you can and you know there's only so much you can control so just focusing on what you can actually control there are some helpful apps or websites that people like to use especially when they're first getting started a lot of them have like blogs that go along with it so you can get a good idea of how your what you're actually shooting for things like calorie King lose it there's website calorie King also comes in a print version so you can kind of carry on a pocket size of of the application and a bunch of information in there and all of these are free and making sure you're getting enough water there's so many different daily water tracker you can try to see how much water you might actually be eating in a day we are shooting for about 64 ounces the water at a minimum per day so I'm comparing yourself to that goal it's all I have for you today hopefully you guys enjoyed investigating the food label with me but by all means let us know if you have any questions everyone Stacy", "a2Fo1ClW7j4": "and we're live welcome to talking live with macy today i guess today as usual we're gonna wait for 15 people to join the stream before we officially begin i know today we are right on the dot at 3 30. i still have not seen anyone joining the stream so we'll give them maybe just like a couple more seconds to join the stream before we officially begin now we have five people already we're gonna wait for 15 people on the stream let's see there should be more coming on now we have six so if you feel that this will benefit someone or your friend your family member please share this stream with your friends and family they can join the stream at any point of time and of course this will be on my page the entire time you can we want people to know and gain awareness of nutrition diet especially for people who are have diabetes or pre-diabetic all right we have 17 people so thank you so much for joining today's stream i'm gonna officially begin hi guys welcome to talking live with macy first of all i would like to apologize for post winning this stream from last week to this week because our special guest wasn't around but i'm so glad she made it this week and this month is pink october month so the rest of october i will also talk a lot on breast cancer awareness we are going to have experts basically doctors and survivors who will come on stream in the next few weeks so please stay tuned and join us for that we're gonna have a health screening package giveaway too so that's actually pretty good that's a huge thing for all of you who are watching well let's focus on today's topic today's topic is on nutrition for diabetics and pre-diabetics why did i choose this topic i felt that this was a very important topic to cover because in malaysia itself the prevalence of diabetes is 20.8 just for type 2 diabetes for the adults above the age of 30. and this is due to poor diet adherence high consumption of carbohydrates and a sedentary lifestyle this was conducted on a research by sana riya hussein and company the statistics are very high for type 2 diabetes and it shows that malaysians in general the prevalence is one out of five i'm sure miss indra later will cover it so once a person is diagnosed with diabetes they will actually meet a diabetic nurse who will go through their medication injections if needed and then they'll ask them to keep a food diary and the third thing is they will tell them how to eat the medication and what's the reason how to control their blood sugar level but i've noticed once a person maybe half 50 of these people walk out the door they forget about the food diary they just eat the medication thinking that the medication will help them solve the problem and they continue to eat whatever they want to eat which is a which poses as a huge problem so that is the case with diabetes control here in malaysia and maybe worldwide by malaysia these are the three main things one of them is poor diet adherence and honestly my mom has diabetes and it runs very strongly in a family three out of four siblings have diabetes so i went to get my genetic report done and i'm prone to diabetes too so i've started watching my diet i'm pre-diabetic now that's why i wanted to discuss more about this topic one out of five malaysians the prevalence of diabetes that's huge and on top of that um talking about diabetes we are actually having a giveaway as well we're going to give away five cans of glue which is a milkshake type drink can you guys see it over here let's see for the nutritional needs of people with diabetes or with impaired glucose tolerance it's very tasty you can put five scoops in 200 mg of water and we're giving away five cans thank you so much abbott malaysia for sponsoring these five cans for everyone today so please stay tuned with us all the way till the end to win a can of 400 mg of the new and improved glue sana if you have diabetes particularly as well alright it's time for me to introduce my guest we have miss indra balaratnam she is a consultant dietitian founder and owner of indra balaratnam nutrition and she has 25 years of

having me i'm so glad that everyone has joined me and i know the wonderful work that you do maisie in educating people on their health so i'm really happy to join you this sunday for your talk session i'm glad that you're here today and we're going to talk a lot of about diabetes control management and the hashtag for today is hashtag be in control guys remember the hashtag and we would like to thank uh once again abbott malaysia for sponsoring the five cans of gusana for all like five lucky winners after this so remember start asking your questions now if you have any for miss indra on nutrition or nutrition related to other diseases as well so please ask them now and i will pick them up towards the end of the session okay so miss indra we're gonna uh begin with the first question a little bit more about why a diabetic needs to have different nutritional intake right actually you hit it in the nail earlier maizy when you spoke about diabetic control one of the reasons why when you do have pre-diabetes or diabetes you really need to be careful about your diet and not just con you know take the medication and think that you don't have to worry about your food intake is because your food intake has a lot to do with the overall amount of glucose that you consume because all the foods that you eat whether it's your carbohydrates your proteins your fats everything that we can consume if you remember your basic science class in school all eventually get digested and broken down into the bare basic unit called glucose right remember that and glucose is what our body digests and that is what causes your blood sugar level to rise or you know so that's the reason why when you have diabetes you really need to be aware of your food intake so it is part and parcel of the management it's not just about taking the medication and then walloping and whacking all the meals that that you want now for a diabetic the control of the blood sugar is very important reason being your body isn't utilizing the insulin insulin is a hormone that your body gives out to break down glucose and to transport glucose into the cells of your body where they are then utilized but when you have diabetes that system has gone a little bit wonky already so your body is not able to utilize insulin so then what happens is the glucose is then traveling around in your bloodstream and not being utilized so when it's uncontrolled in the long run in the long run then diabetes can lead on to other secondary health issues such as heart problems uh very you could uh how do you call that a uh susceptibility to when you get injured if you have cuts then the cut wouldn't heal and that can eventually cause the loss of limbs it can even cause the loss of eyesight so there's a lot of other secondary health issues that you can have from diabetes so that's why the intake of your of your food intake is very important so that you are eating foods that help to manage the blood sugar level but also help to prevent the other secondary health issues that you are susceptible to getting okay so that's why it's important so i have gone with my mom to visit a diabetes nurse before and they were asked to keep a food diary so why is that so why did are they asked to keep a food diary okay well the reason why they're asked to keep a food diary is is the accountability to their food intake oh yeah you've done it before right when you write things down maizy and then you're able to see it on paper it becomes very clear on the record of the what you have consumed because a lot of times people tend to forget like can you remember what you had for breakfast just now no i eat the same thing every day so i would be different but for some people if you want to ask them what did you eat for dinner last night what did you eat for breakfast this morning you'd be surprised some of them actually can't remember reason because when they made those food choices they weren't very mindful or they weren't even really aware of what they were eating and if a person who loves their makkah and just loves to eat a real foodie sometimes that doesn't register in them what they ate they just eat based on what is tempting and delicious now a food diary on the other hand helps you to be accountable to what you chose to eat and it also becomes like a record and studies show that people who actually keep a food diary are much better at adhering uh to their healthy diet or the transformation of the diet that they are trying to achieve uh they do it for people on weight loss diets and studies show that anyone who's trying to lose weight and if they actually kept the food diary they have a chance i mean they need their goal much better and they can actually lose a lot more weight as opposed to a person who doesn't keep a food diary so the same holds true for a diabetic as well when you keep that food diary you are more accountable to what you're consuming and that food diary also becomes uh like your notes so when you go back for your follow-up with your endocrinologist your diabetic specialist doctor or your diabetic nurse or even your dietitian take that diary along with you so that that can become like a running record of what you ate so then as for example like a dietitian like myself i can review that diary and then help you make better recommendations maybe you should change this you should eat more of this and the diary also becomes a realization like for example if you're a person who doesn't take much vegetables in your diet and every day you sow hardly any veggies in there then that might prompt you to tell yourself hey the next time i eat i need to start adding at least one or two servings of vegetables in my diet now uh to keep a food diary there are many ways a good old-fashioned notebook is what you can use pen and paper the old-fashioned way but you can even use your phone or your little gadget use the notes and and write it there if you're a person who likes to use your gadgets but you know now maisie they even have apps that you can use tracker apps apps where you can key in your food intake into the app so for it all depends what do you find most uh easiest to use and that fits into your record-taking uh diary keeping skills you know so yeah there's no hard and fast rules but find something that works best i see so um for those of you please remember to keep a food diary i actually did it for one year when i had colorectal cancer because my doctor advised me to do so yeah yeah it did um i actually know very certain i i certainly know what actually makes me go to the toilet now so that has helped me a lot um i believe for diabetics as well it's more important so thank you for sharing i'm going to look at the app in the future yeah if that's something that you like yeah i'm going to check that out so there is a common misperception that diabetics should not eat carbohydrates is that true no that is absolutely not true at all actually i know carbs get a lot of bad flack when we think about sugar and diabetes and things like that or for even those who are trying to lose weight people always think that carbs are bad but specifically in diabetes but we must remember carbs are not your enemy but it is the type of carbs that you choose and also the portions of the carbs that you eat so now when we talk about the carbs to choose you want to choose carbs that are the unrefined carbs for example oats rice brown rice what else you have the starchy type like beans legumes whole grains the whole grains types of carbohydrates as opposed to the refined carbohydrates like cookies or cakes or pastries yeah sounds good they're all carbohydrates but because they are refined grains they cause your blood sugar level to rise too much whereas the the whole grains because they have all the three components of the grains present their fiber content is higher and when their fiber content is higher your body digestes them in a slower way and they don't cause your blood sugar level to rise as fast but having said that your portions are also very important to the carbs that you eat so if you ate a carb meal uh that was very big a huge plate of carbs all in one go then remember because you're as a diabetic you're in your you have that inability to utilize insulin right to break down the sugar then that large meal can become hard for you to process so that's why the type of carbs that you eat and the portions are very important okay thank you so much for clarifying that um because everyone thinks that carbohydrates is bad but the the key word is refined carbohydrates your cakes your sugar anything related to sugar your cakes um your bread i'm guessing uh and think right bread is one of the cookies cookies candy you know sweet candy or even i think here in malaysia a lot of us end up with a lot of sugary types of yeah yeah you know so we tend to add that to our drinks so a lot of the things we eat are also very carb heavy like we go for a cha so it's just a giant plate of noodles so or a fried rice so yeah portions are also very very big where our carb meals are concerned okay thank you uh for those of you please continue to ask your questions we'll pick it up in just about three more questions that i have so my next question is should people with diabetes eat three meals a day or five small meals a day which is preferable actually when they look at the research of it that it really doesn't matter it's still about your total amount of food that you eat for the whole day and how you utilize it um you can have your three meals your three main meals a day like for example your breakfast lunch and your dinner or you can have your breakfast lunch and dinner and maybe some small snacks in between but remember small snacks huh here in malaysia sometimes our idea of a snack is like a meal of its own then that suddenly becomes a snack and that technically is another meal all by itself so i think sometimes people get confused like when they say uh six small meals in a day they don't know how to define small meals so all they hear is oh i can eat six meals in a day so that's where they get into a lot of trouble and this is where dietitians like myself and all my other professional colleagues when we work with our diabetic clients we help them to plan out their meals the truth is what i guess what we are trying to achieve is we're trying to help them maintain an eating pattern where they don't go hungry for too long a period of time so that the their blood sugar level can be more stable so generally most of us every four to six hours we need to eat something otherwise we tend to get a little bit hungry so depending on the clients that we work with we help them to establish an eating routine so that they can fit in uh their main meals and if they need little snacks in between to help maintain their blood sugar level then we will also help them with that so there's no i guess what i'm trying to say maizy is there's no hard and fast rules and there are no two diabetes that eat the same way and this is where i think it's really important that a diabetic does go and see a dietitian so get your doctor to refer you to your dietitian at your hospital or you can always come and see me as well i'll drop you the details later but but at least we as dietitians will be able to have that time to spend with you to really help you plan a meal and one of the other reasons why uh for a diabetic they have a proper eating routine and and that eating routine should be uh done consistently for example like if you have breakfast at 7 30 try to maintain breakfast at 7 30 every day and then lunch by you know whatever 12 30 uh dinner by 7 30 so that you have that timing consistency so that it also helps you to be compliant with your medication that you're taking and it also coincides with how the medication works in helping to manage your blood sugar level so that's important thank you so the key word is to be in control of your diabetes so remember guys today's hashtag is be in control so my next question is if a person is pre-diabetic what should he or she start avoiding or how should they start changing their diet diet basically the start of it okay now when you are pre-diabetic it already means that your body is already showing signs of not being able to utilize that that insulin well you're not diabetic per se already but it's a little bit like a red flag so this is really a good time to already start making lifestyle changes the first thing you can do is actually look at your weight and your bmi so if you are already overweight or your bmi is already higher than 25 then this is already the time to start looking at bringing your weight down uh and having a more ideal healthier body weight because there is a risk factor that if you are overweight and you are pre-diabetic then that can cause you to end up becoming diabetic so keep an eye on your weight so for those of you who are not familiar with what your bmi is right you see i would really recommend that you uh google up a bmi calculator key in your height they will ask you what your height is so you put in your height in meters like for example i'm 1.67 and then key in your weight in kilograms put it into the formula and the bmi calculator will let you know your bmi so you want a bmi to be between 20 and 25 that's the healthy bmi range okay so if it's higher than 25 then ding ding ding time to start making some changes okay so that's important uh the other thing you can do is also use a measuring tape like this you know the good old measuring tape that you use at the tailor and you can measure your waist circumference so you use about two inches or from where your belly button is and then measure yourself so for men you want your waist circumference to be no more than 94 centimeters that's about 37 inches and for women you don't want your waist to get more than 80 cms or that's 31.5 inches okay so like your work is important and to already start being very careful about your refined carb intake so cut out all the junk food sugary foods uh start learning or start incorporating a healthy eating plan into your daily meals okay so um so so that at least that weight of yours can be managed better and as well as the pre-diabetes i'm so sad i love sweets okay okay it's okay it's okay i i'm controlling that now i know it is possible in control being in control of my um my health the other side um what is the typical meal that a diabetic should have okay that's a very good question because a lot of people when they assume what is a diabetic meal they really think it's something very severe but a diabetic meal right maizy is actually no different than a healthy eating meal now what is a healthy eating meal right a healthy eating meal is one that consists of a variety of foods from all our five food groups so you have your grain food and grain food are things like your rice your noodles your pasta uh bread chapati toast uh noodles any kind of noodles so they fall under our grain group quinoa millet couscous okay it falls in there and then you've got your protein foods your protein foods are things like your meats any kind of meat uh fish uh poultry chicken um what else falls under oh your plant proteins for example your beans all our kakachang lentils tofu they all fall as proteins and then fruits and our vegetables as well and uh dairy for example milk cheese yogurt if you don't take dairy you can always switch to a plant-based dairy like for example uh almond milk or or rice milk or oat milk okay so they all fall in those groups so a healthy eating diet for a diabetic has a variety of foods from all these groups um how do you proportion them can you see this okay okay can y'all see it i hope you can i think we can this is a healthy plate our malaysian ministry of health calls this suku sparrow quarter quarter half so for a diabetic you want one quarter of your plate to be your carbs your grain foods for example your rice your noodles your breads they will they will take up a quarter of your plate the other quarter will be your proteins and then half of your plate now is going to be the superstar which is going to be your vegetables okay so you're going to a diabetic diet that essentially is about increasing your vegetable intake your food and vegetable intake and you're going on a more moderate amount of carbohydrates and proteins okay now what you can do is you can use the plate as a model so the next time you go and have your nasi champa or your chak fun right use this this picture keep it at the back of your head so that when you're putting foods onto your plate you already see if you're taking chicken that you occupy a quarter of the plate if you're taking your rice it should uh it should take up a quarter of the plate and then you should have more vegetables there okay now maybe your hand is your best tool guide for portion size because your hands go everywhere with you so use your hands as your portion guide right so for your for your carbohydrates it should be about a fistful a tight fistful like this can you see that a tight fistful yeah that means it's very for me i have a very small hands yeah like the size of the hand is relative to our body la right so i've got a doubt because portions is also about not it's not an exact science but it gives you at least a visual of how much you should consume at that one meal okay so this should be a portion of your carbs and then for your meat it should be a palm size portion so like for example a piece of fish or if the meat is in slices then take a few scoops how many scoops that would fit roughly this portion okay and then for vegetables two whole handfuls of vegetables okay two whole handful if it's a fruit it's a fruit that you can fit into a cup ten like this so like a medium apple an orange or a couple of blueberries or a couple of strawberries okay or a slice of papaya or a banana and then you can have your dairy as like a yogurt for example or you can you know you can add your milk to your beverage your drink that counts as your dairy serving so or even a fruit can be like an after meal dessert so you can munch on an apple after a meal it helps to freshen up your breath and at the same time it's part and parcel of your meal as well so that is roughly what a diabetic diet should look like i hope you guys are listening okay i'm going to uh actually jump straight into the questions because i think there are quite a few so thanks a lot for answering all of my questions uh i think it has really helped me and i hope helped the rest of the people although i'm sure everyone here is really sad because we love refined carbs well i do uh but i've been cutting down a lot already fyi okay we'll start off with um tanglan hoi's question for home testing what is the threshold level for diabetes for home threshold level what does she mean by blood glucose maybe well the best person to answer that question for you is your doctor um well to me your doctor normally when he talks to you about your testing when you test your blood sugar level he will pretty much let you know okay i'm okay with this level for you between this to this so the best person to ask this question to miss dung is actually your doctor your endocrinologist so the next time you go and see him ask him this question and then try to keep within that but the most important thing i would remind you is keep a diary of your home testing uh that you do so that you jot this down so that at every checkup that you have with your doctor he can see the trend of what your what your blood sugar level is so that will help him to then decide should he increase your medication amount or should he can he decrease it because he's your doctor is also trying to find the best dosage for you to help you manage your blood sugar level as well so this is this is the important thing for you to do so keep a diary of it uh and determine with your doctor what is your best threshold because he would be the person he or she would be the best person to know it thank you thanks miss sandra i hope that answered your question tang and for da bandan uh hi is he he or she asks is consuming two apples a day will it contribute to diabetes no so definitely not there is no one food that actually causes you to end up with diabetes diabetes is an is an autoimmune condition so there's no food that actually when you consume it actually then causes you to have diabetes so please go ahead and have your two apples it's good that you're including food into your diet so don't be afraid of that definitely not i agree um mr yong asks hi joey does organic food is it a good choice for diabetics for organic foods organic food well you don't necessarily have to only eat organic produce for diabetes because organic farming just technically means that they don't use uh too much fertilizers you know things like that and that's what organic farming is about but that doesn't mean that you only have to choose organic produce you can actually eat any type of fruits or vegetables any type of produce that is also fine so yeah you don't necessarily have to only go just for organic produce all right i agree um miss jezreen asked hi jason fruit contains natural sugars should that's true should we limit any intake of fruits which are high in sugar and is there a right time to eat or not to eat fruits okay now yes you are very right fruit does contain natural sugars in the form of fructose so for diabetics the recommendation for fruit intake is two servings two to three servings of fruit in a day as part of their healthy meal plan you don't want to eat fruit in excess because it does contribute to your overall carbohydrate intake as well so you want to balance it balance it out with your vegetable intake uh your protein intake all the other foods that we talked about as well so don't make the mistake i think here in malaysia a lot of times you know when we think fruit is healthy for us for example we buy tuku langsat and then we end up buying a whole basket of it yeah we'll be watching some korean drama on tv you know the the basket of dooku langsan would be in front of us before you know it you're plucking plucking eating eating eating before you know it that means the whole entire basket of the fruit is gone now that is too much even it's a good thing fruit is nice it's healthy for us but too much of it will contribute to too much carbohydrates at that one meal so remember what was the portion for fruit i mentioned earlier using your hand just yeah just a cup full or if you have um like um like a teacup okay for fruit it shouldn't be more than a cup full okay for example even if you have grapes for example uh put however many in a cup flat that that's one serving okay so use a tea cup like this don't go beyond this for one serving all right so and fruit or moreover fruit you want to eat the whole fruit because when you eat the fruit you also get the fiber so you want to stay away from fruit juices if you are diabetic because when you drink juices the fiber has been removed so all you're getting is the sugary part of the fruit which is the juice so try to avoid juices that wouldn't be your best way to consume your fruit you're much better off eating it much better than interesting and back to her question about the timing uh there's no real timing in terms of when to consume the fruit but try to have it together with your meal or or as a snack so it all depends on where you want to put it in your healthy meal plan okay thank you um so there are many questions i'm going to try to pick okay right now so as lee asks i i don't know what this is but there's drinking more more dikka karanthia he put in bracket perrier and ambala la gaja help control diabetes i guess it's a oh yeah honestly i have never heard of that so i i i have no no i've never heard of it is it a curve is it some kind of subject so as me maybe the other thing i really have no idea what it is uh bitter gourd is a vegetable so add that into your your your daily diet definitely but i guess when it comes to diabetes managing diabetes be very careful about just taking one kind of product thinking that that can help you to manage the diabetes managing the diabetes does include your overall diet so it's really important that you that you eat a meal plan that is where you are aware of how much carbs you are consuming you know things like that so it's a and you also eat a variety of foods so that you get all the nutrients that you need to support your health and to uh support uh the health so that you don't end up with secondary complications so your goal is to manage your blood sugar but you also want the nutrients the protected nutrients that you get from eating healthy so that you stay optimally healthy because remember when you have diabetes it's about managing and being in control of the illness uh but the truth is i've never heard of that herb okay so the more it's actually bitter melon it's a melon oh okay but no i don't think it would actually bring down your blood sugar levels so no i wouldn't i wouldn't recommend it honestly all right thank you so with much with some of these supplements especially if they are marketed as something to to how to say to solve your problem because there's no quick fix around it honestly okay so we have to go quicker with the questions yeah okay so i'm gonna copy so ask are there any herbs we can take to regulate our blood sugar herbs are not that i know of or at least as a dietitian my main focus has always been about eating foods so yeah i don't i personally don't know of any herbs that you can use just to regulate your your blood sugar like that so i'm not confident to even recommend or even talk about them but to me it's still about food it's still about food okay so tim asks what about alcohol does drinking a lot of alcohol increase the risk of diabetes well i think that says yes well as i like the way he asks that that's drinking a lot of alcohol the thing about well if you are drinking a lot of alcohol there's also a lot of other implications of alcohol consumption on your overall health not just diabetes alone but if you are already diabetic then your alcohol consumption has to also factor into your intake because alcohol um can affect your illness uh so you have to be very very careful about that so um yeah i it's definitely something you must be aware of so especially when you're taking medication for diabetes uh to taking too much alcohol can also bring your blood sugar level down you don't want to end up in a diabetic coma so wherever you are consuming alcohol you must have a sense of responsible drinking and you've got to know how much you're consuming so yeah so jesuine asks again is molasses good for diabetics or cancer patients or should we consume coconut sugar which has a low gi to replace refined sugar okay now coconut sugar molasses honey uh yours white sugar white table sugar brown sugar they are all forms of a sweetener and they're all sugar okay so whether you're using the coconut sugar or molasses it's still about using them sparingly to add a touch of sweetness to your food so it doesn't mean that you can consume a lot of it in place of your regular table sugar okay so you still need to be mindful of using it so uh you can go ahead and use it but use maybe no more than one to two teaspoons to sweeten your food or the things that you're making but in terms of it it has to still factor into your carbohydrate intake as a whole note that that's a good advice so remember guys today's hashtag is being controlled we want you to be be in control of your health and your diet so okay gimme your ass as a diabetic should she limit consumption of some fruits as it can be quite high in sugar i think you answered that in a way it's still about portions with everything that you consume so where fruit is concerned no more than half a cup to one cup of fruit so yeah and like i said with fruit be very careful don't go more at each time remember you always have another meal where you can have some more fruit at another meal but at that one particular meal try to stick to that sensible portion of no more than half a cup or one cup you mean half a cup to one cup per meal that means three times right well remember in your meal plan fruit would be about twice two servings of fruit in a day two to no more than three servings of food in a day so yeah so two you can have a food maybe at lunch and one at dinner or maybe you can have a fruit as a afternoon snack so where you want to fit in the fruit so no more than two to three servings of fruit in a day okay um lucy asks does low or high sugar in blood relate in blood actually relates to mood swings for instance one moment a person is happy and one moment the person is angry due to hunger yes actually your blood sugar level can that can have a slight direct a slight link to your mood and you yourself will notice it whenever you're hungry uh overly hungry your blood sugar level has dropped that signals to your to your brain that you're hungry and when you're hungry research shows that you have an inability to focus for example if you're doing a task that requires concentration a repeated task research shows that people who do that kind of task tend to lose a bit of their focus and concentration and they are more prone to making mistakes and as and as any of you who know whenever you're overly hungry you do tend to get a little bit moody uh your mood changes a little bit you get moody so yes your blood sugar level has a lot to do with your hunger because it will signal to you whether you're hungry or not and it can affect your mood you might not really notice it but maybe the people around you might notice it so yeah right so yes to answer that it does have a little bit to do a little bit so the idea is not get overly hungry make sure that you keep some snacks with you and don't go too long a period without eating something or snacking on something true thank you so much miss indra we'll take one last question and i'm going to announce how to win guru sana uh which is a milkshake type dream guys from abbott malaysia there will be five to give away so please stay tuned we have one last question that we're gonna take okay so andrew asks there are many sugar-free products out there most are not recommended for diabetes are we supposed to stay away from it too well the a lot of the diet you'll notice that in the supermarket you have like diabetic jam you have sugar-free cookies now they are sugar-free meaning to say they don't use your normal you know your normal table sugar but what they use are sugar alternatives uh artificial sugar like for example aspartame uh some will do stevia so it's they are using a different form of sugar that when you eat it it doesn't cause your blood sugar level to rise as wood your normal table sugar so that's how they are they are categorized as diabetic products now as to whether they're totally bad for you no they actually can be used in sparingly as part of a diabetic enjoying some of these foods but without having the the sugar content that would raise their blood sugar level up you can consume them sparingly but for me it's also about finding other alternatives so you can always use fruit as a sweetener or if you want a touch of sweetness have fruit because to me those kinds of foods are a lot more wholesome for you it's got a lot more nutrition in there a lot of these artificially sweetened food products still contain calories and they are still not going to be your best choice but i guess for some diabetics for example like they like a little bit of sweetness to their coffee then using a sugar alternative like that sparingly here and there is fine for them at least it helps them to adapt to a healthier diet but i think in the long run the idea is to also look for other foods and other alternatives uh to your to your healthy eating diet yeah thank you thank you so much miss indra balaratnam for answering everyone's questions today i know there are a few of you that i

my Congress person I'll speak to my City Council just tell me what I have to do I've been tweeting at you your biggest Korova let me help you let me help you and help them to guys figure out what you need to do to get this know to 100 because we do not want that 100 milligram cap here I believe Colorado it has that cap and it is not as fun place to be in terms of edibles okay so last but not least last but certainly not least the very last thing we have to talk about here is the big whopper the bird is best 1000 milligram white chocolate macadamia cookie this will be another special video this will be one that we watch maybe do over for hours eat half come back two hours later eat another half don't think I'm ready for the whole thousand milligrams by myself in one go so this will probably be a special video as well in addition to the kirova experiment that we will be doing in the future with mangoes so that's it that's the dispensary haul we talked about my mom as mr. Crocs wanted do you guys have any other questions for me anything else you want me to talk about if not we'll be signing off here pretty soon doesn't look like it okay guys well that's going to do it here for this dispensary haul video thank you so much for watching wheats guys we'll check you out on a future review peace", "yYIhHawBeHY": "[Music] welcome to the herbal hour I'm your host Stephen horn with me is dr. Kimberly ballast talented naturopathic doctor and we are going to talk about the marvelously healthy male natural health care for men so this is a very important issue and as I'm doing this I'm aware that many of the people watching this video are going to be women of course the primary aim of this is a message towards men so ladies that you don't mind we're going to talk to the men and you can learn a lot kind of by listening in but the main point of this is to give some some tips to males about dealing with some of their common health problems of course you also know there's a lot of times it's women who are like are pushing men to do something about your health problems too so there are some basic principles that are important in maintaining a good male reproductive health and we're going to cover those first so first the first part of this presentation is important keys to maintaining masculine health and we want to talk particularly about testosterone and Kim since you're like so hormonal whiz kid why don't you tell us a little bit about testosterone and you know it's important than male health well let's look at a couple of things here we have testosterone and how it affects aging that let's look okay what is testosterone okay testosterone is an anabolic hormone okay what does that mean it is something that increases lean muscle mass it decreases fat production it tends to decrease towards mental age and the hormones levels shift towards being a bit more estrogenic so went cuz i don't know what what does it do and it has a lot of things that it's responsible for like increasing sexual interest is one increases your senses emotional well-being so it's like an anti connectional antidepressant increases your muscle mass and strength and helps maintain memory it's a big factor in that it stimulates hair growth and it helps sagging skin and decreases body fat it decreases bone deterioration and it works like a natural antidepressants and increase your self-confidence so there are a lot of things that the testosterone plays a role in it does have some factor so that it does need to bind with estradiol so estrogen is important in men as well I know we always hear that for women but the estradiol has to be present for the testosterone to get optimized so for it to work well so without it it can't attach to specific brain receptors for the testosterone to be utilized another thing that's one study that actually shows when using testosterone and you balance it with the estradiol or some of the natural phytoestrogens that you actually have a lower cardiac risk so the testosterone used alone or in conjunction with another androgen like DHEA actually increased cardiovascular disease so it's again we're back to the whole issue of balance so it's about balancing hormones for men as well as women there's one term women have menopause and one of the an temperament is called andropause because there is a hormonal shift men have around the same age time that women have menopause right too and then also in men estrogens increase the production of cortisol in the adrenal glands and the adrenal gland is the one thing that is responsible for producing testosterone so this pedestrian and the cortisol or the stress hormones start competing like for the same risk sighs so it's the cortisol or the stress hormone increases the DHEA which is an androgen which is a precursor to testosterone that's important because they they work very similar then that it causes that to decrease so you get high cortisol low testosterone and that causes more back deposition especially like around the waist area so that's why we get the middle aged bones as we get older huh well at that and it's that's it and when those fat cells increase then you're also at a risk for diabetes and the heart disease because you're going into that hyperinsulinemia state and it does change it does affect how your influence are regulated so another thing we're going to look at a couple of things of what causes some symptoms of low testosterone and some causes of low testosterone so some of your symptoms as low testosterone is there might be frustration anxiety decreased sex drive and less night dreams are not remembering them muscle wasting low self-esteem weight gain mild depression and lack of muscle tone so those are all some things fit that low testosterone some symptomatic things that get do that what causes some of those okay if you've got the rounds of chemotherapy that can cause death or inch drop it just excessive stress or burnout physical trauma depression xenoestrogens we're going to talk a little bit more about the xenoestrogens there are some medications also that we probably want to look at like a lot of your statin drugs or your cholesterol lowering drugs those can diminish testosterone the these are the anti androgens so those are a big one that really affect how your testosterone is with medication ok so the xenoestrogens let's talk about this yeah what okay xenoestrogens or environmental toxins that have an estrogen mimic effect and they're a major cause of Health reproductive problems in both men and women and in men they tend to cause prostate problems infertility low sperm count erectile dysfunction low sex drive weight gain loss of muscle mass and an increased risk of heart disease diabetes and Stroke where the smiths income and Tom well we're surrounded by nan out together it's a lot of your commercial meats and dairy products because they'll inject that are GBH breads hormone or depending a lot of hormones especially into chicken and I know how we hear like you know we chicken is better than beef well it's probably the highest and hormones along with some of the eggs and other dairy products chance well yeah they use the estrogens to increase egg production and milk production in farm animals so you get a lot of up through that and then pesticide residue if they spray on like you know your vegetables some of the top ones that are sprayed or actually your lettuce your strawberries apricots was one that was really high grapes or one that was really high so it's like we're doing fruits and vegetables we think we're doing something really really good except all these pesticides on it or creating a xenoestrogens effect that's causing a toxic reaction in the body Plastics is another one and especially if you're microwaving proteins are back in plastics that well first of all just don't eat the microwave but that enhances how it extracts a lot of cozinha messages out of the plastics and actually shampoo as the source of it there is enough estrogen in one ounce of shampoo that almost equals a mild prescription of estrogen so you're thinking about I think went out to probably takes a guy a lot to go through one else but um you're still getting exposure to the xenoestrogens ya know there's also some drugs that affect this in other words you mentioned that earlier but there's a whole list of here of drugs that could be lowering your testosterone yeah every difference and drugs like with the clutch of eggs some of your anti-inflammatories your antibiotics or antifungals depressant calcium channel blockers and sleeping pills which seems to be the latest and biggest rage for everybody to have one and a lot of the high blood pressure medications can affect how testosterone is produced so that have warning labels on some of this you know warning this drug can cause erectile dysfunction I think a lot of men would avoid a lot of drugs like a lot of antidepressants can type that in fact if some of the health problems we're going to be talking about specifically one of the first things you should look at is the side effects of medications if you're on any of them and see if those may be having a problem there are some foods that are highly estrogenic and if you're having problems with low testosterone you might want to consider not using too much this black cohosh licorice soy is particularly a big problem if you're consuming in large amounts and if you're having a lot of problems negative estrogens grapefruit actually interferes with the pathway that breaks down those estrogens in your liver so you might want to avoid the estrogen and one thing that isn't mentioned on the slide is not an herb but it's a substance that negatively affects testosterone levels and manage fluoride before they did toothpaste for these drinking water and so forth has been shown to reduce testosterone in males and I've read studies where when they for day drinking water supplies and it's probably not politically correct to say this but amount of homosexuality in those communities Rises and so there is definite effect of male hormones that are linked to this so I understand it was discovered back in Germany this before the drinking water supplies that needed made people less aggressive because of that now here's an interesting thing I learned from herbalist named Steven booner it's about hops and beer hops is a highly estrogenic plant and it does reduce sex driving men because it reduces testosterone levels and most beer is made from hops and it can have a direct implication and prostate inflammation and plays a role in prostate size benign prostate enlargement and prostate cancer what brunner says is originally there were a lot of beers made from many different kinds of herbs and plants including some beers were made from highly testosterone 'ok herbs that would really enhance testosterone and what happened is in germany which is primary place for beer they considered these beers made people too aggressive or whatever and so they passed a law that that beer having meeting with hops which is a sedative and lowers testosterone and makes people less aggressive and this was largely due to the influence of the church pushing for you know less male dominance so interesting guides you might want to watch about not like overdoing it with the beer or the hot so what are some supplements Kim that can help increase testosterone in mid whilst we have supplements that we can work with some key elements to decreasing your calorie intake getting enough sleep exercise losing weight increasing your protein and decreasing your stress are all going to help to balance out testosterone so some things that you can actually take are the DHEA m for men pregnant alone on first barilla then formula the men's x action the ps2 progesterone because you're trying to regulate those receptor sites so a lot of times the annual give men progesterone zinc zinc is a big one because that helps with delivery of testosterone and vitamin b5 which is pantothenic acid you have things that support the adrenal glands like your adaptogenic herbs your eleuthero yeah yeah there's number of herbs here a Lutheran and cream ginseng of longwood noted is actually having a testosterone effect and also pine tree pollen interesting is very highly testosterone 'ok and there's a panax notoginseng nettle root and this little vine called tribulus or puncture vine also known as caltrop plant which I absolutely detest so the growth in my garden and it produces these little psyches means that like stick to the bottom of your shoes and you track them in the house and then you step on them and they's like poke poke your feet and my son started calling them caltrop plant and I looked up that was the actual latin name plant is caltrop and it and it caltrops are these iron spike balls that they used in the Middle Ages to throw on the battlefield two when the horses were running across them they would hit in their feet and they're actually named after this plant but disgusting weed but it's good for men so maybe I should just harvest it and you didn't like doing it consumed is another one that we should probably add to this lymphomas that's an adaptogenic or adrenal to help reduce anxiety because testosterone for men is produced in the adrenal gland with women it's produced and ovaries and adrenal and test often does have these in women as well but with with males it's really focusing on the adrenal gland in the stress levels so the stress level have a lot to do with this now in addition to this basic issues with testosterone you know guys we need nutrition too and think about it this way I mean would you put in molasses in the crankcase of your cards but oil or kerosene new gas tank and no of course not we guys know that you take care of your toys you know really well and your body is more important than any car or machine so it's very important that we mail learn how to fuel our body right and then basically the bottom line of that is to eat natural foods instead of refinement processed foods refine the processed foods are going to deteriorate or help their lesson our strengths are going to cause a whole bunch of reproductive problems we just avoiding processed foods and eating natural foods is going to make a big difference in how you feel and in your overall health and of course there are three basic types of food and first one is protein and we know we need protein but one problem is don't overcook proteins better to eat red meat rare to medium-rare if you can get some fish cooked that way too that's great chicken of course in Turkey has to be cooked all the way through but they shouldn't be overcooked and also slow cooking foods at a lower temperature like in a crock-pot also helps to protect the proteins so that you are getting the amino acids out of them unique there's a big difference between organic meat from grass-fed animals then there is from commercial feedlot beef not only will the organic meat from grass-fed animals taste better it also has a higher nutritional profile has more omega-3 essential fatty acids less cholesterol that our balance of fats a better protein composition and also eating organic meat dairy and eggs helps you avoid xenoestrogens which are think of xenoestrogens as male robbers they're robbing you of your your manly hormones here also another thing that's really a myth about nutrition in our modern society is that fat in general are bad for you and the truth is you actually need good fats for reproductive health you need a mega three essential fatty acids which are found in deep ocean fish grass-fed meat pasture raised chickens and eggs and so forth rod rod nuts are a good source of good fats avocados are a good source of good fats really great fat is coconut oil and also butter and cream made from there come from organic grass-fed cows is also really healthy fat the facts you want to avoid are the hydrogenated fats like shortening and margarine commercially fried foods and the excess use of vegetable oils most of which are partially hydrogenated and a lot of the fat that clogs your arteries is actually vegetable oil fat we've been led to believe it's all like animal fat it's not a large part of it is vegetable oil fat so you need to have good fats in order to stay healthy avoiding fats is really bad and I'm also might mention that the testosterone is made from cholesterol so if you take the statin drugs and you drive your cholesterol too low it's going to cause problems and that's another thing this reaction is still the lower is not lower you go is not better right I'm not always better now you can get to certain levels like the low 150 that you're definitely going to have to fuss room issues and you'll start seeing probably like the mild depression especially the infertility and yeah and even some of the inflammatory responses and carbohydrates of course are the Bugaboo you want to avoid simple carbohydrates sugar white flour polished rice and focus more on complex carbohydrates whole grains but even more on fruits and vegetables and if you're craving carbohydrates and sugar you're not getting enough good fats and protein and love will take him that also possible finding me alright well I'm not the thyroid issue as well because and then do you have thyroid issues that go undiagnosed because they're within normal laboratory ranges so you can still have thyroid issues within those normal ranges and that's you're going to experience sometimes like a little bit of hair loss as well ships in weight gain and the fatigue guys you know one of the things that happens is a lot of times men don't really do much about their health until they have a problem and then they don't even sometimes do something about that problem until it becomes a serious problem we got to get over this most of the real serious chronic degenerative diseases you know the cancer the prostate problems loss of our memory Alzheimer's dementia so forth and old age cardiovascular disease please take 20 years to develop and by the time they actually do develop it's a little late to start working on them so what we want to do is start you know thinking in prevention get regarding our help for upfront and so improving our diet is a big part of that but also found with things are going on in modern society it's a really good idea to adopt a program of basic supplementation for prevention so Kim wedding you tell us about some of the supplements that men should consider us kind of some basic supplements that would benefit most guys this is a general kind of maintenance type plan the omega-3 essential fatty acids you know for anti-inflammatory anti-carcinogenic I aging so that's going to help with also your testosterone combustion your antioxidants ty go has Suzanne thumbs in it which is a very potent antioxidant I of relief also contains the banthas in it and any time that you keep inflammation at bay you're going to have help it's going to reduce your risk of chronic and degenerative disease right and then enzymes just you know most of us with our eating habits and prior years up to the point that you start having issues everybody pretty much needs an enzyme for digestive fiber you know you're you need to bind these toxins and these environmental toxins chemicals so that they're not able to get to the self that fiber is a really big one officially for men eleuthero are other adaptogens for the adrenals the Korean or American ginseng anything with adrenal health because we've talked about how the stress affects hormone balance and Men the men's formula helps with prostate issues and it also helps with kidney issues co 2 10 which is another antioxidant and that's going to help keep the cells from breaking down too soon and really helps prevent cardiovascular always right then your protein increasing your protein that is going to help with testosterone production and I love these guys it's okay it's okay you're not overcooking it so it needs to be medium rare to rare then adrenal support to focus on the adrenal gland again this is a broad renal glandular and then iodine for the thyroid support in health so that you have adequate production recognition and uptake and iodine counteracts that fluoride problem iodine counteracts fluoride chlorine and then bro my bro night is like in a lot of your baked flowers baked goods some of your energy drinks things like that yeah and that first supplement unless the mega three essential fatty acids that's something that just about everybody in our society should be taking it's particularly important for men and here's a couple of just basic things we can talk about it more but omega-3 essential fatty acids the inhibit prostate cell growth they decrease the omega-6 fatty actually what that means is they decrease the biggest explains that produce pro-inflammatory chemical messengers that increase inflammation and increase your risk of disease so it decreases the things that stimulate prostate cell growth and eskimo man you have a fish rich diet have significantly lower levels of prostatitis and prostate cancer then men who don't eat the fish and other good sources will make it three essential fatty acids so moving on to part two of our program we're going to talk about natural solutions to common male health problems and health problems we're going to address our prostate problems specifically prostatitis benign prostate hyperplasia or bth prostate cancer genital herpes erectile dysfunction infertility and hair loss so starting with the prostate the prostate gland of course is a very important gland before men it's a walnut-sized entregan gland that releases testosterone estrogens and antigens it's just right underneath the bladder and wraps around the urethra and so when it swells it can cause pain and that inflammation will constrict the urethra and reduce the urine output and frequency and there's a lot that's not known about the prostate gland this is a quote from a doctor of medicine to specific function of prostate gland is unknown largest organ of unknown specific function in the human body but Kim you have some information site Center like some things that aren't well known but there is some research showing that the project had placed a critical role in a number of things going on in the body on there well that's simple biological function it helps with hormone confession it stores the sex hormones it actually facilitates and regulate some of your cholesterol levels so that collects lg's for combustion with the hormones so it helps the body burn fat right it helps burn fat as well know now the three prostate conditions we're going to talk about our prostatitis the be a pH and prostate cancer so prostatitis is simply inflammation of the prostate gland and anytime something becomes inflamed it swells so swelling of the prostate cuts off the flow of urine and causes men to have to have frequent trips to the little boy's room and it causes a weak stream insufficient to fully open the flop of penis so cause you kind of miss a man dribble and so forth and it can also cause pain and discomfort the causes of prostatitis are not well understood but basically anything that irritate the prostate tissue is going to cause an inflammatory process so it could be due to a urinary tract infection but it's difficult for bacteria to get into prostate so less than ten percent or bacterial infections often it could be related to yeast infections or parasites in the colon or viral infections so forth but it also could be just chemicals that you're being exposed to now that there's a little bit of a difference between prostatitis and bph as i mentioned prostatitis is just inflammation of the gland but bph is a non-malignant abnormal growth of the prostate gland so the tissue of the prostate gland is it swelling it's actually growing and the prostate can go from wallet size to a grapefruit sized and the severity of the bph is measured in stages like one to four from mild to very serious obviously as you get things grapefruit science prostate you got a very serious problem so bph there's a rising epidemic of prostate enlargement in men and while there are very even controversial opinions as to the cause in the medical community there are some interesting facts like men in China have lower rates of bph and American men and they also have the same DHT levels which is often blamed for this prostate enlargement which suggests that there is a dietary or environmental cause and quite honestly I think that xenoestrogens are the major thing that's increasing this in our hope it will be major causes and then when you don't have enough fiber in the diet earn enough of the good fat then you don't have anything to counteract us alright so tell us about a lot from therapy for these conditions it wasn't of the conventional treatments that we can look at usually they just give you that alpha blocker drugs so what those do is relax smooth muscle contractions in the prostate and they also use a 5-alpha reductase blocking drug and that prevents the conversion of testosterone to DHT but what that does is it also like deregulate your androgens so you're affecting DHEA as well which kind of tells the adrenal well you know I don't have a lot to do so probably should does not deal with a lot of other stuff and that causes this whole domino effect of how your minerals are delivered how your anti-inflammatory work actually it also of how mass cell production occurs and how you're dealing with allergies so a lot of times some men I've seen on this actually do you start developing allergies later in life if they never had before and it's just all adrenal gland related so I'm a natural side of this and natural things that we can do for prostatitis and bph KBC which is actually stands for kidneys phone but if some structural it's building then Chinese kidney activator is to move toxins out and PS PS to the men's formula and Vince formula i use for a lot of different urinary tract saying in men or women vivir earthy is a diuretic probiotics to help rebuild the good bacteria in the system and kidney drainage to help flush some things out via the vatican kidney so there's another thing that you're going to especially the one that we've already talked about before the essential fat so that's increasing your omega-3 fatty acids and we've already talked about how that inhibits that prostate cell growth but it also reduces like nighttime urination increased elimination increases you know how much you eliminate reduces the prostate gland it decreases pain and fatigue and it also can increase libido without resorting to things like viagra okay increasing zinc zinc is a big one because think is a mineral that the prostate relies on it helps to shrink the prostate and it also alleviates symptoms of BPH and of course there's ink in the men's formula one with several other herbs I don't think in the adrenal form of the adrenal support yes prostate cancer is of course a more serious condition that affects the prostate and it's increasingly common one in nine men will be diagnosed in the United States and it's the second leading cause of cancer deaths among men so what are some supplements that men could look at if they were interested in preventing prostate cancer I think when it's kind of been newsworthy lately that we've heard a lot about it like a pain there there are low levels and the test days and adrenal glands and the prostate are associated with prostate cancer now like a bean has been promoted that ok it comes from tomatoes or things that are more red in color one little minor factor that we haven't talked about with that as if it's like saturated and pesticides you're not going to get the like a team out of it and there's another factor that's not mentioned too readily either is in order to have like a pain from a food source it needs to be vine ripened oh so if it's not a vine ripened tomato it is where you're not going to get as much bioavailable like a pain out of it so unless you're growing your own tomatoes basically you're not going to get the substantial quantities out of it of course it's not going to be detrimental if it's an organic tomato that can help but probably the best thing is to just take like I like a pain supplement and there is like a pain in the men's formulas some other things we're back to the omega-3 so this is going to become a little bit of a redundant see in this video of how important those essential fatty acids are so they inhibit the formation of prostate cancer you have three different fat pathways so-called hydroxy Estrin pathways in the body and each of those pathways kind of like allows the fats of certain fats they're all kind of channeled into which parking place they go in and that determines whether they're an inflammatory or an anti-inflammatory a carcinogen are anti cancerous of whether they're used for hormone combustion or they're used to just or toxins so you have these different areas that these fats go down and the omega-3 is the one that chooses the best parking place you know it gets the one by the front door it's the one that is the anti-inflammatory it's the one that prevents cancer it's the one that helps with hormone combustion so that that's a huge key essential element to men's health and all of the the prostatitis of bph prostate cancer for prevention and all of the other topics coming up that we're going to talk about it it's the major one so I guess we're kind of saying if you don't take anything else do the omega-3 well actually the other thing that that causes those fats to go down the wrong path way is high insulin levels which is related eating all the sugar and white flour in the final my date so probably the two best things you can do for your help right off the bat to prevent some of these problems is you know stop eating the simple carbohydrates and take omega-3 you're going to a chicken fats in your diet right reuter your sections on it coconut oil olive oil things like that so will we get metal roof because that's another one that going to actually inhibit prostate cancer iodine you know it's pretty much your bacteria your fungal your viral and cancer cannot exist in an iodine rich environment so what we're doing here again is changing the environment so that you don't have expression of abnormal labeled diseases or whatever syndrome of the day it is enzyme please talked about our key elements especially digestive enzymes your is relief is an anti-inflammatory and I ate Chinese lung support not for the lung tissue but basically for transportation so that you're getting transport you're getting movement and out of the self great the next problem you talk about is genital herpes and there there's a herpes simplex which is the kind that produces cold sores and there's a type 2 herpes virus that produces the general herpes is sexually transmitted and this affects one in five people over the age of 12 and it can be a silent infection now there was not kind of benign or it can be really serious and when it's serious it can cause inflammation of the liver fever brain damage and in women stillbirths and in women babies can pick up from the birth canal and because it can be [ __ ] you know for by sexual relationships it's real important to deal with this it's in women it's also a problem with causing cervical cancer some of the symptoms of herpes is source will appear around the genitals it may be a low-grade fever muscle ache it's contagious when there's an open sore and it can be dormant for long periods of time but when your immune system's down because you're sick because you're stressed because you've been drinking too much because you're eating badly then it will outbreak although if the virus does tend to burn itself out so the older you get the less likely to break out we're going to occur so Kim might tell us a little bit about some of the causes and can then therapy for our peace um well when we look at causes you know you've got the viruses that you talked about being transmitted unprotected sexual activity and viruses are like junk DNA so they're trying to link to your DNA so they can lie dormant for dormant for a while and then cause outbreaks but if your immune system is up and functioning like it's supposed to it'll tend to recognize these and flush them out some of the conventional therapies that they use for herpes are usually like topical creams and those reduced like viral replication and decrease the lesion area and it so it gives it time for healing but most of the drugs pretty much suppress symptoms just for severity and frequency so the viruses can go dormant even when you have drug therapy present so just kind of hanging out so it's it's fated that it's incurable of course using protection for sexual and of course it's going to be one of the key elements some natural remedies that we can look at for it some antiviral remedies the colloidal silver or silver shield the vsc was like specifically formulated for this and that you can use topically and internally and it does take a little bit higher quality so using the concentrates probably a good idea get it got to our cat's claw again this one has to be in large quantities to get the results that you need and it needs to be taken over an extended period of time to make sure that you can in dormant violence really neither one of these needs to be taken 40 6 to 12 months to really be effective and yeah in the larger quantities for that time and then olive leaf does work better in larger quantities that sometimes people get intestinal spasming from doing too much olive leaf so if that's happening you might want to just back off that try another one and some amino acids that help with this increasing the intake of out lysing can help [ __ ] the growth and decreasing l-arginine because that feeds for growth and some of that in in some of your nuts I think and your grain chicken and then of course arginine supplements that would be contraindicated so some of the topical remedies that we can do for it is in a and E and then a liquid black walnut and you can even like we said use the vsc topically to put it like right on the lesion okay this next problem is kind of like an intimate one guys it's called erectile dysfunction formerly known as impotence which talk a little bit later not the increasing use of creative meaning of problems but it does affect 30 million men in the US about one-third of the sexually active male population and there have 1 million prescriptions for viagra phila cells at the time that drug was released suggesting this is a rather widespread problem and now we have sigh Alice so there it's obviously a market because now they're developing different tricks right so let's look at some of the causes here I directions are really strongly dependent on the blood flow to the penis so if you have narrower clogged arteries so that there's not a good flow of blood you're not going to get an erection and that is one of the major causes of erectile dysfunction is poor circulation so if you start to develop our a thorough sclerosis of the female already in other words getting clogged with it with plaque that's going to cause this diabetes which causes high blood sugar levels narrows the blood vessels that's another major cause so a lot of times just improving circulation is a major help to to fixing this there are some other possible causes that could be hormonal e related xenoestrogens are big one just general poor nutrition and you should really look if you're taking any pharmaceutical drugs and see if any of them have this is a side effect because we already mentioned a lot of drugs depressed testosterone and of course anxiety in men can also be a problem that can cause an occasional problem with impotence and your herbs that reduce stress the adaptogen and also to help with the adrenal function can be very helpful there so Kim talks about some natural therapy for erectile dysfunction okay well look at this one of the things that I have noticed lately too is that some of the males that I have been on sleeping pills that has been an issue with the ED so some of the therapies we're looking at are improving the circulation balancing hormones regulated blood sugar that's the big one with the insulin transport using reproductive tonics and then checking again the medications like we talked about so things that we can do to improve circulation mega Cal is actually an oral chelation so you're getting heavy metals out and you're working on changing how you're up taking your other minerals because they're a lot of minerals and the mega Cal the RG max unless there's gentle Herbie president then of course you want to avoid that one at the XLR tina's dilates the blood vessels but I have gotten like tremendous success with libido with ed with a lot of male disorders and especially ones that are circulatory base with the RG max like that a lot of men that are very happy on that farm you happy and it reduces high blood pressure and basically what that's doing is the nitric oxide l-arginine increases the production of nitric oxide which is a little neurotransmitter that dilates blood vessels and that's really what viagra is doing but this is doing it naturally as a nutritional supplement rather than as a drug medication so it has a great effect and its work permanent it's actually going to accumulate a improve circulation over time then I'm so many things that help circulatory are capsicum garlic and parsley and that's for transportation issues ginger damiana damiana also actually helps increase sperm count and then probably one of the more popular ones who know him me which is it's mildly toxic you have to be careful with that one but it does stimulate blood flow to that area of the body so some things that we want to do to balance out the foremost help with a dr avoiding the xenoestrogens avoiding a lot of the estrogenic herbs that that can ship link especially the hops in the beer and the soy but we want to keep the estrogen balance so we want to look at doing things like adrenal support or things that help enhance the testosterone orally throw korean ginseng your DHEA which is the precursor to testosterone it's another antigen and then the men's X action okay and then there's some supplements for regulating blood sugar that's a problem yeah the blood sugar seems to be a big issue when we're looking at hyperinsulinemia it's usually where the men's waist is bigger than their hips and then you can also if there are elevated triglycerides and the triglycerides are three times higher than your HDL cholesterol then usually you have complied sugar related issues so some things that with that again are back to diet avoiding the simple carbohydrates and using more complex carbohydrates so these are your low glycemic index a lot of them with your greens and vegetables and some supplements that help the chromium your target p14 your sugar rig your glyco essentials help with the cellular communication sites and zinc again because zinc polarizes what's known as polarizing the glucose molecule so that means it helps it it acts like it's little bus driver to get it to where it needs to be dr. Hugo roadie a of medical doctors a friend of ours he says if they if they labeled the candy bars and the sugar stuff with warning may cause erectile dysfunction that might scare a lot of men off meaningfully good interesting because I don't see men that have sugar cravings like women do so that's why it's like a lot of this one of the basic root things is that biological turing with circulation yeah exactly so some other supplements to look at here again the men's formula which is just i would say probably after age 40 should be like a formula that men just take rain early as a general supplement I would even prefer to see men do this over a multivitamin because we're looking at her door overall kidney yer no checked even on structural and perfect health with the men's formula KBC we talked about that being Kenny phone and helping not only with kidney but with prostate with structural again iodine with the thyroid issues be complex for the adrenal and stress of course increasing the good fats vodka we haven't talked about Makkah and that is another one to use for ED as well fava beans and oxide beans I have never used those that was actually increase dopamine which it dopamine is a neurotransmitter in the brain that is responsible for helping stimulate sexual arousal and desire so if there's a problem with the dopamine they can be helpful and that's probably where I use for different creams topically a little bit with men as well so another thing that we want to do you know what this is check your medications that that's a key element because a lot of times your doctor is only going to give you like two points of contra indications of the meds and those key points are probably only what they've been told by a pharmaceutical rep so be responsible for what you're taking and go and check out all your pharmaceutical and medications you can go online to a lot of different sites and check out all of the country indications another good source is just ask your pharmacist because I find that the pharmacists are highly more educated and contraindications and interactions between certain drugs because it may not just be one drug that you're doing it may be the interaction as one or more things that you're doing and usually your local pharmacist is fairly knowledgeable in the interaction of the bio chemical elements now we're going to move on to talking about male fertility MLD male infertility rather and some of the things that may cause infertility men is low sperm count comatose sperm sperm that are impaired in their ability to move properly blocks in the ducts or vector infection there's a few other causes heat like soaking in hot tubs that can kill sperm wearing really tight underwear that again anything that creates like too much heat can kill off sperm anything else might add to that well again we've got some of the fat drugs that all in lower sperm count the cut you're not getting the combustion there all right and of course you know the therapy is going to depend on what the actual cause is so you've got to do a little bit of an investigation into it but why you tell us about some of the remedies that might be helpful some of the natural things that we want to use to help with increasing male fertility is Korean ginseng your American ginseng the arginine or the Archie max we've talked about that just meant go reducing stress levels so working on things with the adrenals be complex and vitamin C together which is in the Nutri com KBC again to keep you know the pathways clear the search ettore with the kidney influence the men's x action we've already said a lot about that the mineral ketonic these ours or minerals so getting you know without minerals you don't have electrical current going in the cell as well as adaptive just ridiculous it has disappearance in it right and then host she woo it's another one a single herb damiana we talked about the earlier actually increases sperm count optimizing thyroid health and getting hormone balance via the thyroid with iodine and huge bundle detox to remove any possible causes of Candida that or bacterial stuff that might be interfering l-carnitine is listed because it helps with that emulsification so if you're emulsifying the fat from the good fats that you're going to get more hormonal combustion and zinc we talked about how zinc polarizes of glucose molecule so that's going to help with transportation and then tribulus and go in chi ginseng I haven't used those yeah those are two herbs that increase testosterone production I mentioned that the workload caltrop plant okay and then you know sometimes it's just something as simple as think there's a quote from dr. john christow or some couples have conceived when they've included more zinc in their diet especially the father I mean zinc is extremely important for prostate health then lose zinc with every ejaculation so zinc says like iron is for women because they have a lot of blood loss every month zinc is for men until men really seriously considers zinc supplementation sometimes all right now we come to male pattern baldness okay Darren like they're like same side remember no I want Singh design but there's that there's a little song about bald-headed men by christine lavin and chick says everybody knows it's testosterone that turns a bushy haired man into a chrome dome but testosterone is what makes a man a man so anyway but they'll pattern baldness of course you know women help this too but its more common problem with men it follows a typical sequence or pattern of hair loss and it tends to be genetically predisposed Otis predisposed and it's also a thyroid issues and a lot of times you can tell if it is more thyroid related that like the outer part the less like third of the eyebrow is usually very thin or not there at all and that gives you a good indication of whether it's iodine and thyroid related okay well one of the causes that is that the testosterone is converted to the dihydrogen chester on vht the same thing that's implicated in the prostate swelling that slows down or stop tear production but there's actually more to it than that because there's circulation to the scalp there is also issues with minerals Amy minerals and proteins to grow hair properly and iodine mentioned so what are you talk about some of the conventional therapies and some of the natural things that can be done for hair loss well definitely surgical hair replacement or hair transplantation with their drug I think we went on and insider hitting drugs that prevent testosterone from being converted to DHT that can also include your statin drugs too so then there's saima steroid is used to prevent conversion and then your vasodilators drugs crusing book slogans increasing blood flow to the scalp which and by the way get coffee or caffeine is a constrictor so decreases that also that could actually like contribute it to us losing a little Harold caffeine and copy are highly estrogenic that's another another little component in this as far as acquaintance some natural therapies that we want to look at for hair loss now this is a really tough one to deal with because sometimes you can regain hair growth but i would say probably the percentage is that you don't and it's going to depend on again your transportation and circulatory delivery to that area so doing a lot of scouts stimulation you know just really i recommend people get like even just the little brushes that has a little hard bristles on it and do it while you're in the shower you need to really get blood flow and circulation going to tana scalp massage and not many people turn those down okay so getting out like your cell 10 so this game is our deals very transport to the area is going to help you know liven up those hair follicles again so some other things that you can take internally are zinc of course we've talked about that one your vitamin b6 salt palmetto host shoe blue oh she was also known to help regain hair color as well like if you're going a little gray it can help bring on the color back to the hair HSN debut this is specifically a stands for hair skin and nails one of the key components in there is silica silica is essential for hair regrowth and hair health again your iodine supplements if we're looking at it being a thyroid issue so that way you would do thyroid support and the tea to as well or target to us too and then family no acids because a lot of times when you start when men get receding hairlines where it's like here from the scalp back a lot of times that's about protein assimilation and you're not register that was a sign of very high intelligence because you're burning all your protein for other things you know the best bet amino acid conversion so you can get a really good source of a lot of your Amenas or like you're super algae then we have the free amino acids but I'm getting those in and getting circulation going well there's an interesting think you're on saw palmetto for hair loss the supplemental berry favors comparably to learn a popular drug and it is that the used false / / benign prostate enlargement and it doesn't have the side effects it doesn't affect erection and activation or libido as prescription drugs do and pilot studies shows us sixty percent of men with mild to moderate para los using supplemental saw improvement let's hair loss and higher quality of care growing in so saw palmetto can also be used in hair lotions but the effectiveness of using it topically hasn't really been studied so on the notes that accompany this DVD we have some additional information on single herbs and formulas that can be beneficial for men that we encourage you to study on your own we hit this video is considerably shorter than the one we did for ladies does this mean women are more complex commended can just convince attention span Webster well whatever that guy's you know it's it's it's important that we take care of our health too we gotta we've got to look handsome and beautiful as well this is a he-said he-said she-said it remember video that's right so we hope that you able will incorporate some of these tips for being a marvelously healthy nailed into your program so that you can enjoy the help that you deserved", "0XQ1UIUpCI4": "you hey everybody derek here at luckyvitamin headquarters in a beautiful northeast USA it's great to have so many people joining us today for our wellness webinar about mindful nutrition presented by our good friends at carlson thank you all very much for attending today we're joined by Jolie root who is a nurse nutritionist health educator medical journalist and is also currently the senior nutritionist and educator at carleton Jolie travels throughout North America and Europe attending medical conferences lecturing and educating the public about the role of nutrition in integrative medicine so before we begin our webinar just a few quick reminder this webinar is being recorded and will be emailed to you after its conclusion if you have any questions during today's webinar please enter them into the question box on your screen so thank you all again for attending and I'm going to turn this over to Jolie now so lean take it away all right thank you so much and I want to thank Carlson laboratories and let me see if I can shrink my sorry I'm looking for a place to shrink your windows let's see there so that I can what can you see do you just see the slide Derek we just see the slide over here let's great perfect okay that's perfect thank you so much I want to thank carlton for sponsoring the webinar and also thank everyone at luckyvitamin for giving me the opportunity to share this information with you today and we're talking about healthy diet healthy mind there's a lot of great information to share and the idea is that optimal nutrition helps us realize our maximum potential for everything as far as cognition mental achievement happiness fulfillment and also longevity the the health of the brain every life stage so right now on screen I have salmon on a bed of lettuce with some blueberries a lovely kind of salad for lunch featuring omega-3 and the salmon blueberries are featured here because blueberries are a very high antioxidant fruit that has been shown in studies to stop the shrinking of the brain blueberries are for brain longevity and they're people at Tufts University that suggest a cup of blueberries daily in order to hold on to brain volume and brain volume is connected to brain function particularly in later years so this would be a very brain fit meal this nice salmon salad garnished with blueberries what we know is that the modern Western diet the junk food diet that unfortunately so many people in the US consume is linked to problems with physical health obesity obviously heart disease and cancer diabetes and things like immune suppression but what people don't recognize is readily is that diet affects our brains and our behavior and the junk food diet is a rotten way to feed our children we understand physical risks to children but we also need to understand that behavior learning abilities and mood is directly connected to the sad the standard American diet the Western pattern of eating which is a lot refined and processed foods and not enough whole foods so in the UK they spend millions of dollars in school behavior improvement programs in the US we have unfortunately in many many school districts around the country inadequate funding to deal with the challenges that teachers are increasingly facing with children that have very high levels of need because they struggle with things like attention deficit learning challenges and and even autism the world health organization expects a fifty percent increase in child mental disorders by 2020 and autism dyslexia hyperactivity reading and spelling and learning challenges are all on the increase so the question is are we still in a period of evolution or have we begun to devolve because of the way that we feed ourselves unfortunately the children of the generation being born right now are the first generation in developed countries in all of our lifetimes that will probably not have the same lifespan as their parents which is shocking we have been increasing human longevity for the last several centuries with improvements in medical care and improvements in all of the hygiene and other standards of living that we right here in the better developed countries but because of the junk food diet because of excessive consumption of bad fats of too much sugar of too many refined foods we actually are not increasing the lifespan we are increasing the rates of chronic diseases and we're increasing the likelihood that people will live shorter lives than their parents and grandparents not longer lives so the junk food diet particularly when we talk about the brain was never the plan we were never meant to feed our brains chips and cakes and cookies and candies and crackers and things that come from boxes brains need whole foods and I really want to get into how we nourish the brain lifelong starting in the womb but going until hopefully along and Rosie lifespan people living into their 80s their 90s and even beyond one of the biggest problems that we see and it directly relates to having a healthy mind is that sugar consumption has has risen so dramatically since 1820 in 1820 in North America and particularly the u.s. we consumed around four pounds of sugar per person per year and we are now just under 100 pounds the good news is we're on the decline slightly we were up at about 150 pounds per person per year of sugar but we are on the decline so our efforts in education and the attempts that people that are in nutrition policy and education have been making are having a good impact sugars on the decline but it's still far far far too high for optimal health because with all of the sugar intake especially high fructose corn syrup comes obesity diabetes heart disease even dementia and Alzheimer's there was a very compelling study that was published last year in the Journal of Clinical Investigation looking at whether or not blood sugar elevation was driving Alzheimer's disease and what they found was that sugar impacts amyloid plaques in the brain and those amyloid plaques are seen in patients with Alzheimer's boosting glucose in young healthy mice made their brains produce beta amyloid faster and if they it when they increase the blood glucose it led to a twenty percent higher level of amyloid compared with mice that had normal blood glucose levels they doubled blood glucose and that might seem like that would be hard to do but in humans that's not hard to do at all and sometimes when people take a glucose test after a meal particular high carb meal or after consuming a bunch of ounces of a high-fructose corn syrup sweetened soda or fruit juice the blood sugar level can double now when the team repeated the experiment in older mice that already had some amyloid plaques in the brain the amyloid levels rose by forty percent this would be a parallel of a middle-aged or older human who we know that Alzheimer's takes decades to develop and that beta amyloid and amyloid plaques can form in the brain for 15 or 20 years before any symptoms show up so what the result study showed was that diabetes and other conditions of elevated blood sugar levels like insulin resistance which is unfortunately an epidemic in our population today harm brain function and increase the risk of Alzheimer's so the message is very clear we should if we really want healthy brains throughout life eat less sugar we're already sweet enough now the good news is there are nutrients and nutritional approaches for reducing amyloid levels and amyloid plaque formation one of those is the omega-3 DHA which is in the cold water fish like salmon and tuna we'll be talking a lot about DHA as we go through the call and the foods that provide DHA but the other thing is activated vitamin D the hormone form calcitriol vitamin D actually reduces plaque formation and makes the amyloid protein that forms the plaques in Alzheimer's brains more soluble helping it to be cleared and so when the amyloid levels reduce and when the plaques dissolve memory and other brain function improves so what this showed was that the reduction of amyloid actually translate to improved cognition and so things that reduce amyloid include the DHA omega-3 include the hormone form of vitamin D and what that means is we need good circulating levels of vitamin D for most adults until we get a vitamin D test to find out exactly where we are it's probably a good idea to make sure that we are getting a daily amount of vitamin D in supplement form because we know that vitamin D can be produced from sunlight on the skin but when we wear sunscreen it blocks that production another big issue with cognitive impairment in the last century has been a big shift in the balance of omega-3 and omega-6 seen here with things that represent omega-3 and omega-6 what would be great is if the scales were even if we got the same amount of omega-3 as Omega 6 what's unfortunate ly true here in America is that we are anywhere from 10 times 2 in some cases 50 times higher in omega-6 intake vent omega-3 intake and the omega-3s in particular that are important for the brain are the longest omega-3s the EPA and especially the DHA so on the one side of the scale we've got some salmon and we've also got some soft gel fish oil capsules which is how a lot of people who don't love eating fish get there EPA and DHA on the other side we have omega-6 foods represented here by the burger the fries the pizza fast foods are very very high in omega-6 other things that are high in omega-6 our vegetable oils and we need to really look at balancing omega-3 foods with omega-6 foods and I'll be more specific about that with some nice pictures in just a moment but I want to talk about omega-3 for brain development and function for a second here Omega threes recognized as essential nutrients in the 1960s and the longest ones the EPA and DHA which can't be formed by the body they need to be taken in through the diet the body formation of the longest omega-3s is flight at best then that's because of too much omega-6 in the diet well the long omega-3s EPA and DHA are very important for structure and function of the brain the eyes and the nervous system and shifts over the last century lower sea food intake higher vegetable oil intake have reduced our levels of these critically important Omega threes so here are some great omega-3 foods you see the kale leafy green vegetables spinach collard greens The Shard the all kinds of dark leafy green vegetables are good sources of the plant omega 3 alpha linolenic acid and so our flax seeds and chia seeds and flax seed oil to a very small amount those plant omega-3s can be elongated into the more important omega-3s EPA and DHA but those more important omega-3s are provided preformed already formed in things like omega-3 eggs Coldwater fish sardines tuna salmon mackerel and they can also be derived from supplements if people don't like to eat fish walnuts are a great source of the plant omega-3 and the plant omega-3s are healthy we just had a big study a week ago that showed a reduction in heart disease with people with higher intake of even the plant omega threes but the brain needs DHA so we really need to make sure that we are consuming preformed foods that have preformed eh eh that means the omega-3 eggs the cold water fish and if you are a vegan there algae-based DHA supplements that you can take in order to make sure that you're not coming up short where DHA is concerned now these are omega-6 foods you see all the vegetable oils things like corn oil and soybean oil are much higher in omega-6 than Omega 3 and so are fast foods and a lot of convenience foods the prepared foods so we have to be paying close attention to getting more omega-3 but we also have to pay really specific attention to taking in less of the omega-6 foods so when it comes to cooking oil a suggestion that i have is olive oil because olive oil is more of an omega 9 it doesn't really contribute to that excessive level of omega-6 that one might see with these other vegetable oils and the other thing that is important is grass-fed protein sources it your your free range chicken grass-fed beef and pork and veal if you do eat meat because the animals that graze that are pasture-raised actually accumulate more omega-3 into their systems and so we get more omega-3 from those protein selections where our mega threes are very important for brain development is in the womb and a number of studies have demonstrated that DHA is required for normal brain development in humans we need it for the formation of nerve cells and their membranes and when DHA is in short supply the structure and function of brain cells is compromised infant studies have shown that newborns that are supplemented with DHA have improved brain development and they process information more rapidly other benefits for babies are that they sleep through the night sooner DHA allows them to settle it has a calming influence so several years ago infant formulas began to be available that were supplemented with DHA and that is a great option for parents who are not able to breastfeed so DHA infant formula is an option and also supplementing babies with DHA is another option mom needs to benefit from DHA also and the benefits for pregnancy are well established they include less likelihood of giving birth prematurely 600 milligrams of DHA is required to most actively protect women from premature birth and of course that protects the baby too because preemies have some real challenges when when they're born particularly if they don't get well into the third trimester so expert organizations all around the world are recommending supplemental DHA throughout pregnancy and on the average the recommendation is 200 milligrams daily that is a minimum recommendation a minimal amount of DHA for pregnancy and it certainly is fine to take a higher level of DHA here on screen is an example of a product called mother's DHA which have a 500 milligram DHA and 100 milligram epa which would meet that six hundred milligram number that i mentioned earlier for protecting pregnancy there's also a woman's omega multi it's a multivitamin with DHA it's an excellent choice for women to make to be on a nice potent multivitamin and have it contained some DHA omega-3 even before conception because studies have shown that if the mom is on her supplement from day one of pregnancy she's far less likely to have a baby with neural tube defect and other birth defects and she's also far less likely to lose that pregnancy so women of childbearing age need to be on a great multivitamin and hopefully one that provides some omega-3 either that or be on a daily omega-3 supplement now cognitive destiny it's something that I think about from a nutritional standpoint because we have had a long argument in nutrition science during the whole length of my career as a nutrition educator which is is it nature or nurture is it that it is a genetic given that a child has a certain potential so for example IQ or column child versus a very hyper child is that strictly genetic or does it have something to do with the way the child and the parents prior to conception are nourished meaning does nutrition have the ability to overcome maybe not such a great deck of a hand of cards as far as genetics are concerned can nurture can an environmental choice overcome a genetic predisposition toward something like attention deficit or autism the World Health Organization suggests that infants be supplemented with DHA either that the mother is very well nourished and is breastfeeding and passing the DHA along in breast milk and in that case that 500 milligrams of DHA would be a minimum amount recommended for that mom through the breastfeeding period as well as during pregnancy and that let's say mom isn't rest feeding the baby should be getting 20 milligrams per kilogram of DHA daily so a 12-pound baby that's a hundred and twenty milligrams of DHA that's a great recommendation the problem with that is in America across the board we get less than 100 milligrams we get right around 115 milligrams of both EPA and DHA on a daily basis and one in five of us get none one in five Americans consume no EPA or DHA so that means that the average intake across all age groups doesn't even meet the requirement that is necessary for a 12-pound baby of these long-chain omega-3 s that's an issue and something that we need to correct so babies and children can take supplements and there are cased award-winning liquid supplements that taste like the flavor lemon or orange or bubblegum fruit splash fruit extract flavor and are not fishy tasting and parents that want to boost the children's omega-3 levels can incorporate those liquids the child's doses half a teaspoon and infants dose might start at one-fifth of a teaspoon so the baby DHA product actually comes with a syringe so that you can accurately measure even a fraction of a teaspoon and that should be on a daily basis and it doesn't need to even be off of a spoon it can be mixed into a smoothie it could be put on popcorn it can be mixed into anything that the child is about to eat and because these liquids from Carlson are not fishy tasting their taste award winning because they're not fishy tasting they can be incorporated into something that the child is about to eat and it takes the fight out of the equation so the mom doesn't have to we all have memories of our grandparents chasing us with a chief spoonful of some kind of cod liver oil or people my age have that memory anyway the mom doesn't have to do that today because these oils are very clean and tasty now omega-3 is not the only thing for parents to be concerned about prior to conception there was a very interesting study this year looking at brain function in children of mothers who had very low levels of vitamin D at a 18 weeks gestation period and what they found was neurocognitive problems a higher level of that in those children at 10 years of age they also had eating disorders there were issues with bone mass impaired lung development at different ages just because the mothers had very low vitamin D levels in in kind of the midpoint of pregnancy so parents who want to have healthy children have to be healthy themselves and make sure that they're well nourished with multi vitamins vitamin D and omega-3 and there were two studies looking at vitamin D and omega-3 yet last year and the year before looking at how vitamin D and omega-3 work together to increase the production of serotonin that vitamin D hormone regulates the production of serotonin in the brain serotonin is the mood neurotransmitter serotonin elevates your mood makes you feel happier and drugs like Prozac and Zoloft or prescribed to boost serotonin levels but our brains make serotonin from the amino acid tryptophan which is in Turkey and milk and other proteins but vitamin D the active vitamin D the hormone calcitriol enables the tryptophan to be turned into serotonin in the brain now what the relevance of that is is that if we have very low levels of vitamin D and that is something that we see across our culture then we may not be able to to switch on the formation of serotonin from the tryptophan in our diet so we need to pay attention to eating foods that contain tryptophan but we also need to make sure that we have adequate vitamin D levels and the Omega threes play a partnership roll with the vitamin D in regulating the signaling of the serotonin so serotonin activity requires not just tryptophan in protein foods but also vitamin D and omega-3 so here is a brain food shopping list blueberries avocado green leafy vegetables rosemary and turmeric are antioxidant herbs that protect the health of the brain walnuts chocolate also very high in antioxidants salmon for the Omega 3 and Omega 3 eggs those omega-3 eggs have the phospholipid form of DHA which you could get from krill but it's much more expensive it's much less expensive to get phospholipid omega-3 from Omega 3 eggs but what about older people what about if we want to preserve our memory and not become older people with dementia or in the worst case scenario Alzheimer's disease well studies have shown the B vitamins vitamin E and DHA support brain function and improve memory for healthy older adults who are experiencing decline in cognitive function and what they show is that neurons the brain cells cope better with aging when we have B complex vitamins vitamin E and DHA on board now we know that the risk of dementia is increasing as our demographics change as our population gets older and the risk doubles for four people after age 65 every five years what that means is that we potentially are looking at millions of new Alzheimer's disease cases over the next 10 to 20 to 30 years and because the elderly populations are increasing and that is an epidemic that we may be facing and financially most nations are not prepared for this so the good news is that we need to eat fish because a recent literature review found epidemiological studies that showed that increased fish consumption reduce the risk of dementia including Alzheimer's disease eight out of 10 studies found that hot tub levels of omega-3 fatty acids were associated with a reduced cognitive decline and blood levels of omega-3 s can measured a doctor can give you an omega-3 blood test and there is a target of eight percent and that requires in most adults a thousand milligrams a day of EPA and DHA combined so it's hard to get that from eating fish unless you eat say four to six ounces of cold water fish four times a week you certainly though can take a high quality fish oil supplement read the label on your fish oil to see how much EPA and DHA the fish oil provides so there are some do's and don'ts stick to whole foods that are rich in omega-3 don't use the omega-6 vegetarian cooking oils use olive oil in cooking eat omega-3 enriched eggs snack on nuts and seeds which are high in plant omega-3s you can enjoy sardines salmon or tuna at least two days a week and don'ts avoid fried foods don't avoid vegetables love your veggies green leafy vegetables and also the bright colored vegetables that are high in antioxidants have fruits low glycemic like berries will be careful about fruit juice because it's high in sugar and grass-fed animal protein sources keep that too just a couple servings a week avoid cakes cookies pies and pastries and then pay attention to brain nutrients the B vitamins folic acid it regulates homocysteine which is a thing you can test for in a blood test it creates blood vessel damage brain damage and an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease folic acid should be taken together with vitamin b12 and vitamin b6 you can get that in a good B complex or a great multivitamin and energy metabolism depends on the B vitamins also now you can get B vitamins from foods boiled eggs avocado peanuts oatmeal meats cheeses are all sources of vitamin B in the food supply other brain nutrients choline it's part of the b-vitamin family it's a precursor for something called phosphatidylcholine which helps the brain make something called acetylcholine it's the memory neurotransmitter and it supports cognitive function Alzheimer's patients experience sharp declines in acetylcholine levels and the brain actually breaks down to supply phosphatidylcholine to make a fetal choline if we don't have it in either our supplement regimen or ala diet so foods that are rich in choline include eggs salmon chicken tilapia is even rich in choline peanut butter skim milk liver almonds broccoli for the vegetarians the soy protein powder and soybeans like edamame peanut butter broccoli brussel sprouts cauliflower these are all good sources of choline so that we make acetylcholine at levels that keep our brain from having to break itself down to supply phosphatidylcholine another really important family of brain nutrients is the antioxidant family vitamin C and E it prevents the breakdown of the lipids in the brain cell membranes with lipid oxidation and protects our blood vessels the endothelial lining of the blood vessels helps the blood vessel relax and that means dilate and that means better blood pressure better circulation when we have that it provides our brain with the nutrients oxygen and glucose but also things like the omega-3s and choline and the other antioxidants that the brain needs so aces vitamin a vitamin C vitamin E selenium and high antioxidant foods and there are so many and think colors when you think about foods that are high in antioxidants and yes coffee is one of them so that's good news for people that love a cup of coffee just be careful and don't load it with sugar coffee tea green tea the darkly colored fruits and vegetables pomegranates berries of all sorts walnuts are very high in antioxidant peppers tomatoes the spices rosemary I mentioned earlier garlic turmeric which provides curcumin broccoli and all of the cruciferous vegetables these are all food very high in antioxidant activity and they protect the brain now there's a really large percentage of the American population that doesn't meet the recommended taken levels the Dietary Reference intake levels for specific nutrients and some of the nutrients that are very important for brain function we're getting less than half of what we need and almost across the board nutrients are not being not being taken in at a hundred percent of our needs and we need to remember that the Dietary Reference intake supports protecting us from the depletion of nutrients and the diseases of insufficient nutrient intake but those are not levels that necessarily protect us the way that optimal nutrition intake would protect us and my point about all of this is that we probably need to cover our bases with supplements and maybe take a good multivitamin now just in the past few days there was a major Middle Eastern study the first coming out of Iran that investigated the link between diet and mental health and found that the healthy diet is associated with a lower risk of anxiety and depression so the foods that were really specified as meeting the standard for healthy diet were as you might just guess fruits and vegetables whole grains beans and other legumes nuts and seeds leafy green vegetables and very high quality proteins particularly cold water fish so again we we stress the importance of a Whole Foods diet that offers nutrients in really dense levels nutrient density is what whole foods provide and empty calories so the absolute lack of nutrient density is what refined and processed foods provide so we we just cannot overstate the importance of Whole Foods when it comes to brain health at every age from prior to conception to throughout pregnancy throughout childhood and adolescence and then adulthood in every decade of life so the right foods and supplements improve the structure of our brain cells the efficiency of the communication between those brain cells which means our thoughts our memories our emotions makes certain that the signaling all around our brain those signals are transmitted and received more clearly and more quickly we realize our optimal potential when we eat a nutrient-dense diet and we take advantage of the science of dietary supplements and make sure that we avail ourselves of a good multivitamin the b-complex the omega-3s the vitamin D and adequate sunshine adequate exercise there are just so many lifestyle choices that we can make that will help to make sure that our children get a head start in life that they can go to the head of their class and that we can age gracefully that we can enjoy life and be vital and contribute to our families into society in every decade of life rather than experience some kind of unfortunate decline as we get older so with all of that I think that I'm just about out of time as far as information to share and we're going to go to questions and answers great Julie thank you so much for that presentation it was very informative and make sure everybody remembers that you will actually get this email to you as well because there's a lot of great information there and it's always good to kind of go over at all so i'm going to write into some questions that we have here Jolie feel free to reference your presentation because some of these I felt like you might have touched on already but nevertheless we have a couple questions from some of our customers one of them asked what brain boosting foods might you suggest for babies to help with cognitive development well I think it's so important for parents to get babies off to a great start whenever possible breastfeeding for the first six months of life if that isn't possible mom should not guilt themselves choose an infant formula that is enriched with omega-3 d Jay and the American Academy of Pediatrics also recommends 400 international units of vitamin D for breastfed babies beginning with day 1 and vitamin D is available in unflavored drops super daily d3 is an example of one that karlsen makes in a 400 unit dose for infants and children it's a single drop there's no flavor you drop it into something you could drop it into one of the one of the foods as the babies eating if mom has great vitamin D levels she doesn't need to add vitamin D if she's breastfeeding but it should be checked because the pediatric Academy feels that breastfeeding moms are too low and so the baby needs supplemental vitamin D once we are starting with foods with infants and young children it's important to offer a variety of foods and the protein foods that i mentioned salmon and cold water fish are critically important for continuing that omega-3 intake but also high quality carbohydrates the you know a variety of vegetables and berries and high quality fruits being careful of course to offer a variety so that children don't have either too limited a selection or develop sensitivities because they get the same food over and over again the brain building foods are the whole foods practically any food that is grown or animal protein sourced food will have nutrients that impact the mind of that child whether it's because of the antioxidants or because of the B vitamins or because of the proteins like tryptophan and the other proteins eggs are great source of choline I mentioned the DHA in eggs but eggs have choline so practically any whole food that a child is offered or a you know very young child an infant or baby is given is going to benefit the brain so a variety of Whole Foods some cold water fish good protein sources grass-fed meats those are suggestions that I have and during the formula phase if mom isn't rest feeding make sure that the formula is enriched with DHA alrighty thank you so much a customer is asking about alcohol and the resveratrol and red wine really contribute to overall health alcohol is a problem for brain health it's small amount you know we talk about moderation but alcohol is one of those things that a wide swath of our population has trouble moderating and here is one of the problems with alcohol I mentioned something about the plant omega-3s that it's hard to elongate those into the longer chain fatty acids like EPA and DHA when we have too much alcohol so if it's yourself if you have an issue with chronic heavy alcohol consumption it costs you nutritionally you do not elongate your fatty acids not just the omega-3s but also the Omega sixes and there are some good Omega sixes when you have chronic heavy alcohol intake you lose B vitamins status and one of the one of the big problems with chronic excessive alcohol consumption is thiamine depletion the b-vitamin Simon and that creates a manic personality and other neurological problems and and there you know the end can be something as severe as cerebellar ataxia which can have a person be slurring their speech like a stroke patient and be in a wheelchair so alcohol small amounts if that isn't possible none is resveratrol beneficial absolutely resveratrol and its cousin taro still being our antioxidants that are very potent you don't have to drink red wine to get resveratrol of course you can take a supplement and resveratrol is in the dark purple grapes and in some of the red fruits so cranberries for example but resveratrol and pterostilbene which is in blueberries and available in supplements those are very potent antioxidants that protect the brain protect that lining of the blood vessel I mentioned the endothelial lining of blood vessels and that's a place where the pterostilbene and resveratrol really do their job well and they provide relaxation of blood vessels within impacts blood pressure and they are antioxidants that protect against that oxidation of the lipid the lipid membranes in cells so I'm a big fan of both of those nutrients and for people who would just rather not do the alcohol the resveratrol is available in grape juice and in the grapes themselves skins is where you get most of it so eat the whole grapes and it's available obviously as a supplement as is its cousin pterostilbene which persists in the bloodstream even longer alright thank you so much let me really have time to let us kind of pick out a couple other questions here leave a customer asking if gluten is really that bad for you or is it just the gluten of GMO wheat that is affecting our health well that is a that's a well-framed question so that person is definitely paying attention to this conversation the gluten conversation specifically because we think the GMO wheat is probably the alteration in the gluten because of the advent of GMO wheat is probably a reason why gluten is a problem for the people for whom it is a problem for clarity's sake gluten is not a problem for everyone so there are people who obviously if you have celiac disease gluten is is absolutely a problem for you and then there are people who are intolerant without being full-blown celiac patients that have a gluten sensitivity and for them gluten is really a problem you can get a diagnosis or you can do an elimination of all gluten for say three to four weeks and then add back in and I would do it one at a time and I would only do it every three or four days add back in the foods that you used two most commonly consumed that contained gluten so if it's a dinner roll or it's your favorite but or whatever the gluten food is that you suspect might be causing a problem it generally when we have food sensitivities its foods that we are consuming most frequently that are our problems so is gluten a problem for everyone no has it become a larger problem yes does GMO wheat have something to do with it I bet I bet it does there are juries that are deliberating on this some people think know some people think oh yeah so I Prime in the oh yeah camp I think that GMO wheat probably is part of the problem but I also do know that lots of people do just fine with gluten-containing foods alrighty thank you we have time for one last question so at customer is asking what you think about all of these packaged foods that are claiming to be fortified with X vitamins and minerals well fortification happened because of the processing of wheat back in the day we used to use whole grains to make flour products and and even sprouted grains and when we started making white flour we started stripping the B vitamins and many other nutrients the magnesium and other nutrients from those foods and so we decided well since we lost all of that let's put back in some vitamins but you never get everything back that was lost number one and the fortifications were using synthetic vitamins so in the case of niacin enriched flowers they're not as healthy as a whole grain or sprouted grain flour product with and sprouted grain of course is flourless which bypasses the whole problem of flour entirely when we see things like DHA fortification in orange juice orange juice would have never had any omega-3 but now we're starting to see some omega-3 levels being boosted in foods that didn't typically contain omega-3 a lot of times that's the algae DHA that has been used in lots of studies and is absolutely beneficial so if you look on there and you see that you know the DHA has been fortified in your milk or in the infant formula or in other foods I'm a fan of that I think that's a good idea particularly for people that would rather not eat fish vegans and vegetarians who choose not to eat fish ideologically based choices can take advantage of the algal forms of EPA and DHA and boost their omega-3 levels so in that case I think fortification is a great idea but the question mentioned packaged foods and boxed foods I'm not a fan I yes okay orange juice or lemonade or something like that it's of a necessity unless you have an orange tree you're going to be going there for your orange juice but it comes to other foods I think cooking from scratch is the better answer and and creating a diet around the basic foods of fruits and vegetables proteins dairy products the the whole food diet I just think is not in need of fortification and it is the processing of foods the freezing and the other technologies in the packaged foods that sort of robs those foods of the richness of their nutrient density necessitating fortification I would rather see us eating real food like our great grandparents used to cook you know cooking from scratch that's that's a thing and and so there's the local foods movement there are you know the meatless Mondays and eating at home with your family and making your own food from whole ingredients that I think would be a direction that would support our health think Mediterranean diet think of the cultures around the world that market more frequently and cook from scratch that that I think is the real direction of health I totally agree with you there and thank you again and thank you for all the information Jolie a big thank you to our friends at carlson for helping putting this webinar on we're going to wrap this up now thanks to all our great customers for attending and this was a whole lot of information so

thank you again it would have a fantastic day and if you enjoyed this webinar tell a friend tell a family member and help us spread the Wellness you you you", "Ddi3Y0K-zGk": "good morning folks going to take a few moments of your time this morning I'm going to turn it over to you want to be a colleague and styrene who wants to explain a little bit about the Pecola what you hand that you there after we will turn it over to dr. Patel who has a wonderful lecture which will go into your endocrine module so that's all it's on deck no current events this morning thank you i'm hi everybody so for those of you who walked in you should have received a packet if you didn't we have extra up here so just peace for you to feel free to come take one but this is a survey that we're conducting because as of you as you all know Rho Chi and azo conducted a piccola review at the beginning of the semester so this is just a survey to assess for the students who did attend whether or not you felt that it was effective and for those of you who did not attend what the barriers were for preventing you from from joining us so this is a completely voluntary survey we just are hoping for your feedback with regards to those points so again it's completely voluntary but we do appreciate your feedback so for those of you who do want to take the survey if you could take it now and then we'll we'll collect them thank you guys so much that doesn't have one just raise your hand how many did you guys have a time you want the total class here yeah okay yeah okay can you give me a favor and roughly and you just see if you can count how many we have in the class best yeah if you need to move around feel free would take an average yeah yeah - just walked in we just threw everyone off now yep oh yeah all right guys a couple more minutes if you're done just hold them up we'll may come around and collect them is okay I tried that it didn't work it won't go the other way and then I'll just rather I'll leave it zoom then I could just move it down yeah I could just move it down yeah I just moved it down so zoomed out that way okay it's gonna be up close and personal today yeah yeah they have someone always alright guys so if you still have your surveys go ahead and finish him up they'll come by and collect them but we're gonna get started so by a quick show of hands says has everyone been through both modules yet or everyone's at least been through one pulmonary how many of you still have cardiology left to go okay so majority of you have now been through two iterations of this and so the last module in this sequence is the endocrine module so I'm not going to go through a lot of the things that have been the same in those two modules many of you probably now have two sets of feedback also that you're working with in terms of knowing where you kind of fumbled where you need to kind of focus your efforts on the hands-on portion for this module is gonna be a little bit different from the prior to where it's a little bit more involved so you're gonna have a lot more that's crunched into that a 12 minute and so we're gonna go through what that's gonna look like and I'm gonna focus on the things that are just unique things that are the same from each module it's not going to vary even for this one so your introduction ensuring safety or conclusion your QA those are all the same sections so it doesn't vary from module to module even in the endocrine module what is going to be different is the things that I'm gonna walk you through today and then in the subsequent two weeks the next two thursdays you guys will get a chance to manipulate a lot of the devices so in the cardiology module and the pulmonary module Palmeri modules probably a little bit closer to what you're gonna have here in terms of hands on there's gonna be a lot of different glucometers a lot of different pen devices that you're gonna be responsible for for knowing and you're not gonna know what you're gonna be presenting on so you're gonna all have one glucometer and one pen device that you'll be responsible for will go through which pen devices and glucometers you'll have and which ones you're kind of gonna have to know all of the rubrics have been loaded on blackboard including the presentation from today so if you have any questions you can always refer back to that but I do want to spend a little bit of time going through purposeful communication and so you'll notice that in your rubrics it says that portion is not going to be graded and so we get it because it's a lot of stress and so you have to worry the hands-on stuff but know that that is what's going to probably become very important as you get to your clinical rotations because without that purposeful communications just because you know how to use a glucometer doesn't mean you'll be able to actually conduct a visit and talk to a patient so here's your opportunity to kind of practice that even though you're not being graded on you don't want it to be so scripted when you actually get on clinical rotations that you can't you know talk to a patient and you're kind of almost robotic right and so that's where you can practice some of this purposeful communication and so things that fall under that section or you know assessing how the patient is doing so you don't go straight into the task of okay I'm going to teach you how to use your meter so you have you know what we call small talk kind of get in the patient comfortable figuring out you know what how they got here and then module specific things that you're gonna be focusing on here are knowing what the patient's a1c is right so if you work in a clinical capacity we'll have access to labs even if you don't you're in a retail setting through MTM and various things you're gonna have a good idea of the clinical picture of that patient so it's okay to just engage them beyond just oh you know this is your medication and this is what I'm responsible for today you need to go kind of beyond that you'll talk to them about low blood Sugar's high blood Sugar's if they've any recent hospitalizations those going to be important to figuring out why they were admitted and making sure that that doesn't happen again and then moving to the lifestyle piece so when we talk about lifestyle modifications for patients with diabetes there's a ton that we need to do and so a lot of the care that's delivered for patients with diabetes is very multidisciplinary and so at the setting that I work at at the VA we have three under chronologist myself and a nurse practitioner and we take consults from all of our primary care doctors so in addition to the team of five that we have that see all of our endocrine consults we have nutritionists and dietitians that we can then refer to to be able to kind of complete our care team because there's a lot that needs to be done we use our nursing staff to do the diabetic foot exams the immunizations and so you can kind of see the list and that's going to vary from site to site and your when you get to your rotations and what your role is going to be for some of you might be more on the immunization side and the counseling piece for some of you might be doing you know the diabetic foot exams we do those in our clinic and then immunize if necessary but that for our institution is very much done by nursing and the last one is not just saying that here's the medication hopefully your blood Sugar's improve but then truly working with them to kind of figuring out their lifestyle piece what other health issues that they have if they have comorbid conditions and if that could be affecting their glycemic control and so we'll go through some of those as well in terms of the hands-on stuff like I already mentioned you have your glucometer and your pen device so that pen device could be either an insulin pen or a non insulin pen and then next week you guys are gonna all be injecting yourselves with saline so it would be cruel if I made you guys inject with insulin so we're gonna stick to saline if you miss prelab so any of the next two thursdays that saline injection will get added on to your actual endocrine visit and lab so in addition to the glucometer the pen device then you'll have the injection all within 12 minutes so you can kind of pretty much assume that if you're not there in the next two thursdays endocrine module is probably not going to go well for the amount of stuff that you have to cover so make sure you're in pre lab and make sure you're checked off for the saline injection as I already mentioned it's not going to affect your overall grade but we will give you feedback like I said this is probably the most important part as you move from fifth to sixth year and we're going to go through some of those things so I know you've already had the lecture so I'm not going to rehash all of your therapeutics lectures but I'll give you a quick refresher of things that have changed so from the last time that you guys got diabetes content those guidelines have completely changed so that ad a chart that you had with those six columns with the colorful chart it's completely outdated now and there's a new chart so this just shows you how quickly this information moves so both the ACE guidelines and the ABA guidelines were updated in the beginning of 2018 so everything that you guys were taught last year is outdated some things haven't changed which include the diagnostic criteria so when you're looking at the patient's paperwork or their lab records or in the or in the EMR whatever setting you're working in you'll have access to some of this information so you need to be able to quickly look at this and figuring out if this patient is pre-diabetes or they have diabetes because that's going to impact how you counsel that patient you could have a prescription for just metformin and the patient isn't a full-blown patient that has diabetes and they could have pre-diabetes so it's important to be able to look at these levels and figuring out what category that patient falls into what's nice here if this all falls on a continuum so if you take fasting plasma glucose for example it's a hundred to 125 anyone know what the diagnostic criteria is for diabetes using a fasting plasma glucose no one okay so it's 126 right so if you have pre-diabetes it's 100 225 if you have diabetes that it has to be greater than 126 on two separate occasions so what do you think your number should be if you don't have diabetes yeah exactly less than 100 so if you try to think of that as a continuum will be much easier for you to remember this same thing goes for your two hours post readings so here the number is between 140 and 199 and you'll notice here that it's above 200 and so if you check your blood Sugar's too after meals and you don't have diabetes it should be less than 140 and the same goes for the a a 1 a 1 C where it's five point seven two six point four and then greater than six-and-a-half is diagnostic for diabetes on two separate occasions so in terms of the guidelines there's two sets of major guidelines that are out there the ADA a guidelines and the ACE guidelines a lot of its institutionally driven and then also based off of your patient population in terms of goals of therapies what I do in clinic is probably more in line with the ATA guidelines because I'm dealing with the geriatric population at the VA so I'm not as stringent with my goals but my management and the treatment I use are probably more aligned with the ACE guidelines here are your differences among your fasting and your postprandial the reason I put this out here because if you're teaching a patient of glucometer that patient may ask you well what should my numbers be right so when you're counseling them that's a question that on the other side the preceptor card asks you is when I go home if you tell them to check their fasting blood sugars then you might need to give them a range also as to this is what your number should be within a range so otherwise just randomly checking without having context for that patient is not very meaningful and the same thing for two hours postprandial other things to kind of keep in mind as you're starting counseling therapy counseling on therapy is the hypoglycemia risk profile right so if you have something like a met Foreman you're using that mono therapy unlikely that that's going to cause hypoglycemia but however if a patient is also funny area backdrop of insulin again those are high hypoglycemia risk profile medications where you want to make sure you stop and you educate them regarding the self-care management skills that are needed and that would include counseling on hypoglycemia so some reasons listed here again pretty obvious to you and I but it might not be as obvious to patients it's actually the number one reason when you're thinking about patients with diabetes as to what results in hospitalization its hypoglycemia admissions are the probably the number one cause so some signs and symptoms you'll notice that I've listed the signs and symptoms here in patient terms and I didn't use you know tachycardia so when you're counseling when you're talking to that patient in lab again hypoglycemia is from something that they probably don't understand or they don't know what that is so when we're in clinic we interchange when we're talking to patients were like have you had a low blood sugar or a low blood sugar reaction so they understand what it is and if you notice all of those signs and symptoms are in patient friendly language otherwise they're not going to be able to kind of detect it or tell you if they've had events if they don't know what those true signs and symptoms are a patient does go low what do you tell them how do you tell them to get out of one we teach the rule of 15 so 15 grams of glucose and then check in 15 minutes how they consume that 15 grams of glucose is totally up to them they could do any one of these bullet points that are listed here we usually give glucose tabs and glucose to most of our patients that are at high risk otherwise they can just treat with what they have in the house it's important to let them know that in many cases patients with diabetes may refrain from using just regular soda or drinking juice and so these are some things that they may not have and if they do reach for something like soda you need to make sure that it's not diet soda so that this actually could serve as a source of glucose after they check if their blood sugar is up then you want to make sure that they follow it up with a small snack or a meal because anything that's liquid will go in quick but it'll also leave quick right and so there's a chance that even after treating that low blood sugar they're gonna go low again and so the small snack or a meal after that will ensure that it stays up and it doesn't drop again in terms of hyperglycemia there's a very long list of what can cause hyperglycemia you've understood it from the pathophysiology standpoint but also from the lifestyle piece obviously a long list of things that can cause hyperglycemia and what those symptoms look like again you were taught the three P's polyphagia polyuria polydipsia you'll notice I didn't use those terms here again if you're talking to a patient you need to be able to talk in the same language that they understand and so these are the symptoms that they may feel if they're presenting to you hyperglycemic so purposeful communication so the continuation of that when you get to that section that it says work with the patient to implement one or more of these strategies and so you don't have to include the entire laundry list if you think you can effectively do it great try it out but I wouldn't do that at the point where you're gonna jeopardize not getting to through your exercise so you could pick one or two of these based off of the past medical history of what's presented to you it could be that you see that the patient is a smoker that's something that you could ask and see if they're ready or assess if they're ready to quit smoking or just make sure that their routine diabetes care is up-to-date when that could be you know simply asking a question related to immunizations or a diabetic foot exam or diabetic a foot exam or an eye exam so we'll break down each of these in the subsequent slides in terms of smoking I think you've had that in every single lecture and it's been probably linked to everything that you can think of Under the Sun so we advise all patients not to smoke specifically in patients with diabetes we know that it's actually more difficult to get someone to blazing at goal if they are a smoker versus a nonsmoker and so we obviously don't want anything that could hinder control ecig arrest is a question that I get a lot and you probably see a lot now where people are walking around with it the 88 is not recommended the FDA does not endorse it we don't know what the long-term implications will be so from a health care provider standpoint it is not a safer alternative you could argue that there's no carcinogens that's true but we don't have anything or we don't have long-term data that's supported by guidelines to say that so if a patient chooses to you so use that that's fine but from a counselling standpoint if a patient is smoking you probably shouldn't get into alternate forms of smoking smoking of all types because the here the addictive substance is that nicotine which they still have that addiction to so it's important that we you know just don't transfer that to another form of smoking in terms of alcohol again especially important in patients with diabetes so it's not that if you have diabetes you can't drink at all so they have specific requirements that are listed out and I actually wrote the amount because in many cases when you talk to a patient they'll say yeah I have a couple beers and I always use the example with my rotation students when we're talking about what adequate alcohol consumption if you so choose to drinks if you don't drink this is not something that you would counsel and saying hey you're actually allowed to drink you can this is if you choose to drink if you go down to the mission and you ask for a beer what are your two options 16 or 22 right so one actual beer is 12 ounces which no one serves anymore so you could say when you're asking a patient they always when it comes to alcohol and smoking they always underestimate but they're always consuming more than you actually think so if you've had two beers at the mission you've almost that depending on what ordered you've almost had three to four beers so it's important to quantify that and the other example that I use is with wine you know I have goblets at home that I could take a bottle of wine and divide it between two glasses right and so it also depends if you go to a nice place to eat versus if you go somewhere to like the 99 where they fill your glass up to the brim so that's what you're allowed 5 ounces of wine so if you think about those of you that work in the retail setting if you've dispensed robitussin with codeine 5 ounces is that bottle that's not a lot right so I've listed those quantities here for you it's different for men and women no more than two drinks per day for men and one drink for women and then alcohol consumption is very tricky because of hypoglycemia and so especially if a patient is on insulin or cell phonee areas it's important that they have some type of food at somewhere because they could have delayed hypoglycemic reaction in the setting of alcohol consumption physical activity again quite obvious but now we need to list it out because of our obesity rates and where things are headed to the point where we now have specific recommendations of how long you shouldn't be sitting which will violate today but it recommends no longer than 30 minutes at a time and that you should be breaking up that extended period of sitting in terms of exercise it's got to be realistic so if you see on your patient profile the patient's 84 you're probably not going to want to recommend that they start running half marathons so again make it realistic to your patient and what the patient can actually do so for our patients where we see you know will recommend mall walking something that's safe like gardening something in the pool which is not going to be worsening some of their other comorbid conditions it's easier on their joints and so it's pretty much any meaningful activity if they can actually get to that hundred and fifty minute 150 minutes a week that's great but if you can't you have to make sure that it's realistic to the patient that you're talking to in terms of healthy eating that's probably the number one question that we get in our clinic well which diet should I be on because there's always fad diet this year I think it was the whole 30 and there is no perfect diet if you're looking at evidence based diets your - diet that you guys learned about in hypertension and your Mediterranean diet are probably the single number one and number two that come up every year that are actually evidence based otherwise I basically say whatever works for the patient is gonna be the best diet as you can see all the things that you need to take into account specifically you know health literacy financial background cultural preferences I mean these are all things that you need to factor in you can't just say don't eat this or just only eat this because again that's not realistic this behavior change that we're looking for it these aren't you know diets and we don't even actually use that term because by definition a diet is something that signals it's temporary so we're just trying to make lifestyle changes so these patients can even there are smaller changes that they can make will last in terms of foot care obvious reasons as to why we need to make sure one of the complications of diabetes is neuropathy and so if a patient does have neuropathy in their hands and feet they're less likely to feel this and so this is important that at least get an annual foot exam for our visits nurses always are each visit have the patients take their socks and shoes off and they do a diabetic foot exam to making sure you know it's not there's no any ulcers or open sores or cuts or anything like that and then in terms of what you would tell a patient obvious things to you and I I can't tell you how many stories I have probably over the last ten years where you know we've had patients walk in with attack on their foot and they never realized it because they have no sensation three years ago I had a patient we were doing looking at their pillboxes and we noticed that there was attack in there and we're like why is there attack in here he's like oh that's what I pulled out of my foot that day so I wanted to make sure that I remember to tell you that so you will hear these stories but again things that are common sense to you and I not walking barefoot you know keeping the skin soft again moisturizing in between the toes because that could create fungal growth so any one of these points or just a simply saying you know do you get an annual foot exam or making that referral would be appropriate again some of the other things that we kind of just talked about and we tell these patients that this is not something a patient with diabetes already has a lot that they need to worry about in any given day so we try to just incorporate this to any routine that they think is going to be easy so if in the morning they're exercising when they put their shoes and socks on just do it at that point if it's in the shower and if it's easier that's fine we have a lot of patients that are overweight that they can't see their feet and so for that situation we'll have them talk to a spouse or a partner or just have a mirror on the ground so that they can kind of see the reflection of the bottom of their feet to see if there are any issues I care again these complications so your retinopathy neuropathy nephropathy it's different for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and I've listed what that looks like here basically would type 2 diabetes it's right at the onset because by the time you diagnose a patient with type 2 diabetes on average they've already had it for about 7 years so they're kind of already into their progression of diabetes whereas in a patient with type 1 they usually present more acutely and so you have within the first 5 years because they're gonna pretty much get started on insulin therapy right away which might not be the case in a patient with type 2 diabetes where you see it more with progression of disease and then the last one which is very easy for all of us to do is the immunizations right so if you just by dispensing a medication for patient with diabetes you automatically know which immunizations that they would be a candidate for again I've not listed them here specifically but you've already had that in other courses and you should know that the ones that are specific to patients with diabetes include your flu shot Hep B and your pneumococcal vaccines any questions on any of the purposeful communication before we kind of go into the medication management so like I said your class notes from last year are no good so throw those out don't rely on them to study this chart is completely brand new these are the ATA guidelines you'll notice that there was that chart that had six different classes and it was all different colors and it had the a1c hypoglycemia cost that got changed pretty drastically so now in both guidelines what's supported is metformin first-line and so that hasn't changed and that's what you see there they make a mention of the fact that if a patient's a1c is greater than nine they're presenting to you they're probably going to require more than one medication very similar to the approach that you see even with blood pressure from your last module where they're going to require at least two drugs excuse me to get them to control after metformin and this is because of a lot of the cardiovascular comes and the data that has been coming out with these drugs is that you have a hard stop where it says does the patient have a SC VD and if they do then you need to go to a medication that has cardiovascular data anyone know what those medications look like or which ones they are from your prior lectures someone said it so Vic Toews does one anyone know the other one Guardians excellent so if you follow this chart over and I'm not gonna you you guys will see it on your slide so it's hard to see here so if a patient has established a SC VD you probably need to go down the route of either one of those two medications that's what that table will take you to if the patient doesn't have established cardiovascular disease because that's where the data lies that info is with secondary prevention and not primary prevention then you can use pretty much any of the other medications based off a variety of factors that I'll walk you through and here's just a zoomed in version of what we're kind of talking about here's that dual therapy language and then adding a second agent after consideration of drug specific effect and patient factors that you'll see in table 8.1 so extremely busy and that's why you have this uploaded but for the a DA this was actually a very different way to present their stuff and so what they basically did is you have all of the factors that you should consider when starting a patient on a medication and so across the top you see efficacy low blood sugars weight gain the cardiovascular effects that I just mentioned about so that a SC VD column it outlines which medications have that data so that it helps you guide your treatment decision if a patient has heart failure or some medications worse than heart failure some medications improve heart failure you can factor in the cost whether it's oral or subcutaneous what its effects on the patient's kidneys will be and so that is listed for each of those classes and so this is probably a good review chart for both you guys in also the six years you can pretty much review all of the different classes and get an understanding from a high level of each of those things that we previously talked about for purposeful communication so that's the extent of what I'm going to go into with the newer guidelines and similar to the ad a guidelines the ACE guidelines also changed here there it wasn't as drastic as the ad a guidelines and the ACE guidelines approaches a little bit more prescriptive and they specifically tell you what to do so after segmenting the patient based off of the patient's a 1c it basically says metformin is first line which is consistent in both guidelines after that you'll notice that there's a little bar underneath each class and that bar actually recommends their strength of their backing behind it there's a level of evidence behind it and it's posted in this small corner there which most people miss and over the years I've actually done this I know it's kind of kind of sounds lame I've compared that bar to see what the strength of leviton's has changed and you can see that the GL PS have pretty much cemented themselves as a second line option whether regardless of the patient's a 1c and after the GL p it's sglt2 inhibitors however in practice we see something very different because both of these classes are branded right and so you'll still see a lot of s us and so funny area is used because of its cost you see a lot of insulin usage but you'll see here they have a caution because of hypoglycemia and weight gain concerns you see the other medications elevated in the algorithm because they cause weight loss versus weight gain and their hypoglycemia risk profiles are better than the older agents that we've been used to similar way of looking at it so this is the ad a chart that I showed you they basically kind of stole a page from the ACE guidelines similar stuff here they have all of the drugs up on the top and all of the other things that you should factor in on the side some of it is a little bit different from the most part they're hitting on the same themes there as well any questions before we move on to the hands-on portion section everything clear all right so we're going to start off with glucometers so when it comes to glucometers there's a ton out there now to the point where you can see your readings on your watch so at our institution we have a contract with Roche for Aviva meter so it's awesome every person that I start get started on interview that meter I don't have to worry about knowing any other meter but you guys don't know where you're gonna be working so you need to be able to use at least a few of the most popular meters but if you know how to use a meter in general you're going to be able to counsel a patient and then just look at the package insert look at the box and explain those what those differences look like so these are your top five by market share that we're dealing with and so I picked the best within each company so these are the meters you can star this if you want to go online and look at videos this is what you're going to be responsible for so when you walk into the counseling room you're not going to know which meter you're going to have they're going to put a meter in front of you and it's going to be either the contour the Freestyle the OneTouch or the Aviva what we'll do is we're going to go through how to check your blood Sugar's using a glucometer in general today so you have an idea of it and then it's easier for you to know and just learn the differences I basically tell patients that come in that are on different meters there's connected meters there's all these fancy meters that are out there but we only have one option for the patients we have that and a talking meter for any of our visually impaired patients is that they're like cell phones right you've had different versions of your Android's and your iPhones they're all gonna make a call but they all have different bells and whistles on them and that's basically what you're dealing with when it comes to glucometers you have ones that will graph your blood Sugar's it'll track your a1c they'll track your next doctor's appointment you can get us complicated as you want to or as simple as you want to be but what is gonna stay common regardless of what meter you're going to be using are basically your steps and your supplies so the reason I have this slide is that you're also going to be get graded on the terminology that you use in your counseling sessions so you can't say like take the thing majiggy off like you need to like refer it to what it's actually called and so that's why I've labeled the numbers and so you know what they look like and so you should practice next week using the actual names so we have lancets your device cap your alternate site cap so this is something that may throw you off when they give you the kick because you're gonna have the regular cap as well as the alternate side cap make sure you pick the right one as a general rule of thumb if it's an alternate site cap across all of the devices it will be clearer in nature and that's your dead giveaway that you might have the wrong cap on the monitor itself the lancing device you'll have a control solution and we'll talk about that not all of them will come with it that's something that the patients may have to buy and when we should use one and if we do need to calibrate the vial of the test strips the test strips themselves and other things that aren't featured here will include a code key and a logbook depending on the meter so in terms of the performing a test we're going to show you that if you want to start setting up but these are your general steps they're gonna walk you through the actual rubric so do you guys did anyone print the rubrics that we're gonna be going off of you guys have seen those yes no how many have the rubric no one okay so that's good that's good so you guys have no idea what you're getting graded against so at some point between now and lab we have the answer key to how we're grading available to you guys so you literally have ten steps that you need to hit hit you can miss one and still get a hundred so next week when you practice or you practice at home you will basically know what grade you're gonna walk out with if you can get all these steps so if you miss two of them you're gonna end up at an 80 if you miss three you're gonna end up at a 70 so there's no mystery behind your grades when you walk out of the two hands-on piece so you know exactly what this is this is what you should practice against and this should be on blackboard so if you don't have it it's good because you they won't know if you missed a step or not but I'll let you guys know if that is the case but these are the basic steps that you're going to be covering so making sure the patience wash their hands they prepare their meter lancing device lance their finger they're going to perform the test record they're reading and then cleaning the monitor so this could also show up as an exam question so it could be all of these steps in sequential order or for you guys rank orders and for boards the new type of format put all of these steps in to order so there's a different ways you can get quizzed on this material in addition to the actual demonstration that you have to do so other factors that we're not going to get into again like I mentioned these are all the different bells and whistles regarding size weight blood type memory downloading capabilities we have connected meters for our patients that are enrolled in telehealth so when a patient checks their blood sugars it's automatically transmitted to me via bluetooth and so I have an idea of what their readings are even before they see me again that's not going to be the case for all patients but that technology is available if you so choose to utilize it so now what we're gonna do is I'm gonna turn it over to Shivani that she's gonna basically go through the rubric and show you what a general counseling session would look like for a patient that you're starting on using a glucometer any questions while we bring this up no okay a little bit further down all right so everyone can see that perfect I'll keep moving her if we go off off the screen let me hello everyone hear me okay all right so your first step is gonna be washing your hands when you do this in lab you can just say out loud that you're washing your hands and then you'll swap the injection side that you'll be using so most likely the side of your finger and then you're gonna want to let your hands dangle for about 15 to 30 seconds to let the blood flow to your fingers and right before you lands you can also sort of massage up from your palms to get it ready for the injection so once you wash your hands you're ready to prepare your glucometer which is coding is dr. Patel mentioned earlier in the case of this glucometer it's already been coated the first time so it just corresponds with the code on the test strips to make sure that you're using the right product and is properly calibrated another way of sort of making sure that your glucometer is working is using the control solution that dr. Patel also mentioned so that has like a predetermined value that's specific for the meter that you're using just to make sure that it's reading the values properly and it's gonna read your blood glucose properly one thing to keep in mind is that all of the meters do sort of different things so with regards to coding all of them need to be sorry none of them need to be coded with the exception of the OneTouch ultra so now that you've prepared your kilometer you're ready to prepare your lancing device which is this right here and so to make sure you can see it so there's this little window on the lancing device that has a bunch of different numbers on it and there's different ranges for different devices it basically indicates what the depth will be of the injection so if you have a device that has a large range and you haven't used it before you could start with sort of the middle value the first time and then based on how that feels for you know the patient then you can change it to make it less or more deep okay so then you're going to take your needle and you can put it right into the device like this and then take the cap off and put this lansing cap right back on it and then you're going to in order to load it you pull this back okay so you're gonna pull it back until you hear a click I don't know if you guys were able to hear that okay good so it's basically ready to go and then what you're gonna do next is load your test strip into your glucometer you want to make sure you do this before you prick yourself so you're not getting blood everywhere so like this with the channel facing up because that's where the blood is going to go so I keep forgetting how it looks up there so now you're ready to go ahead and Lance yourself something that you'll want to counsel your patients on is obviously when you prick your finger it could be a little painful and if they want to find ways to reduce that you can recommend it they use the side of their fingers or they alternate the testing sites or do they use thinner Lance's another thing is that their automatic reaction might be to direct their finger away so if you tell them to just rest it right up against you know a ledge and keep it there then it'll actually be able to like properly inject them and they won't be getting blood everywhere for hygiene purposes I'm not going to inject myself right now but if I were you'd basically hold it right up against your finger and you press this button right here and you hear that click and it really quickly goes and injects you after that what you would do is bring the glucometer up to the drop of blood and let it completely fill the channel here and then it should display your blood glucose reading over here so now that you've lanced yourself you can take the cap off and then put this protective cover back onto the needle yep okay so then you'll remove the needle and you'll make sure you throw that in your sharps container and then the test strip that actually has a plot on it this doesn't need to go into sharps container there's nothing sharp here you just go and you throw that in the normal garbage and once you're done make sure that you clean down your glucometer as well in case there's any blood on it and then congratulations you've successfully taken a blood glucose reading another thing you want to keep in mind is like dr. Patel mentioned all the different glucometers have different capabilities so a lot of them let you fly your reading is whether it was before or after a meal so just to keep in mind the only one that doesn't have this option is the Freestyle freedom light meter so that's everything on your rubric and everything that you need to keep in mind for your lab [Applause] so nothing really changes other than two lines on this machine right the first one is regarding the control solution or the coding requirements and the other one differences in terms of flagging so you should go in cold no way and then where those two differences are depending on the meter so as you see the pen cap you have your outer needle cap inner needle cap those are going to be important because there's gonna be one that you save when it comes time to disposing of the actual sharp your needle itself the rubber seal it could be an insulin pen it could be a non insulin pen so you it's not always going to be an insulin reservoir this picture thank you the picture depicts that here then you have the dosing window the dosage knob and the injection button so the devices that you guys are going to be responsible for there's a ton of devices and it's not realistic for you guys to be able to remember every single device so you're gonna be doing the top four here as well so you have the solostar device and underneath it and you'll also see that on your rubrics I've listed what is what is available in that device itself some of it is long-acting some of it is rapid acting insulin so your preceptor I don't know who is gonna be on the other end of it they may specifically tell it you by brand then you need to have a context of what that actually is is that a basal insulin is it a rapid acting insulin and so I've listed what is available in that actual pen device because the day supply you'll notice that on the last step of every single pen rubric goes through storage requirements and those storage requirements are different depending on the product right so it's gonna be important for you to know what's available in that so let's start pen device next we have the quick pen these are all the different things that come in a quick pen so regardless of what a patient is on if they're on a quick pen the steps in terms of counseling are the same except for maybe priming it or getting it ready some you're going to shake some or some of your gonna resuspend some you're not going to suspend and then also the storage requirements and then the last the next one is the Flex pen there's not a lot of differences between the Flex pen and the Flex touch so if you notice on that sheet I just included a couple lines at the bottom that are different so that way you don't have to remember do different forms everything is all consolidated onto one form and then the last one that we're gonna be dealing with are your GL p receptor agonist and there's way too many devices and there's a one that just recently became available called o's empik which is also here as well as by jury on beasts ice but they don't have a lot of distribution yet they're not even on some pharmacy shelves so I decided to not torture you with those so I will do that to the next year so you only have are responsible for the ones that are highlighted here so you could be responsible for showing someone how to demonstrate a Victoza and again that's already in the Flex pen device so you're all set there but the only two that are going to be unique to the GL p is the trulicity auto injector and the buy during on pen so at the end of the day these are the five devices that you pretty much need to understand and know and that they have five different rubrics that you'd be responsible for questions on any of that before we walk you guys through the different pen devices yes for the pen devices okay did someone just say that there was the rubrics were online where physical assessment try there all right so while they set up if you have them you can open them up there on blackboard if you want to follow along and that way you get an idea for it what the different components are if not that's fine too you guys can look at the doc cam and kind of go through those as well okay so we're going to start off with the the Flex pen oh thank you okay so as you'll see through the demonstrations a lot of the initial steps for all the Pens are the same so the first thing they're gonna do with the Flex pen and also with every other pen that you use is to wash your hands and lay out everything that you'll need so in this case that's the Flex pen itself one needle cap the alcohol swab and this is gonna this is gonna serve as the as the patient slash area on your body that you're injecting so the first thing that you'll do is remove the cap from your pen and you'll want to check the pen to make to see whether there's any discoloration or crystals or lumps in the case of the Flex pen you're using the Nova lock 7030 you'll roll it ten times slowly between your hands and then you'll turn it over in your hand up and down ten times just make sure that you're not shaking it too much and basically the purpose of this is to resuspend the solution and you've wanted to look cloudy and white and in order to do this accurately you need to make sure that there's at least 12 units of insulin in the vial to make sure it's it's actually able to be resuspended so now that you've done that you're ready to go ahead and take your alcohol swab okay all right okay so then you're gonna swab the top the rubber cap of the insulin pen and then you could go ahead and swap the part on your body that you'll be injecting in so in this case that could be the upper arms your thighs your stomach or your buttocks as long as it's not Victoza or Tris Eva okay then you can go ahead and attach the needle so you'll do that by taking this cover off the needle screwing it on to the pen and the needle has two caps so you can safe this big cap off and leave it on the side you'll use that again when you're discarding the needle and then you could that wasn't on properly okay and then you take the smaller cap off and you can just throw that away okay and the first thing that you'll want to do it keep on how to recap it now is prime but then you'll want to do this for the insolence every single time that you use them floor Victoza you just need to do it the first time so the way that you do that is to dial it up to two units and then hold it hold it facing up can you see it like this so you'll want the needle facing up and then you can tap the vial a few times and so technically you're supposed to hold the needle like this when you do it I just want to make sure that you can see it so I'll hold it like this and you push this trigger down and I don't know if you could see that but it basically causes a drop you can see it up okay and it's gonna cause like a drop of insulin to form at the tip of the needle and you can repeat this step if it doesn't work the first time five additional times for a total of six attempts if it still doesn't work then that means you have a faulty pen and you need to throw it out well once you successfully do that you're basically ready to go ahead and use your insulin pen so look back at your dose selector and make sure that that's put to zero again and you've gotten all that extra err insulin out and then dial it to whichever dose that you're given to inject so in this case I'll dial it up to ten okay and then you're gonna grip the pen firmly and injected subcutaneously into your skin and then you'll press down all the way until the entire dose is injected and then out loud make sure that you count to six and the point is that you just want to make sure you have everything injected into the skin then you take the pen out you look back at your dose selector and you make sure that it's dialed back to zero and then you're ready to remove the needle so you put this big cap back on you unscrew it and you throw that into your sharps container so congratulations you're done injecting with your flex fan another thing you'll want to be aware of when you're counseling patients is all the Flex pens have different storage conditions based on whether they're opened or unopened what the product is so if you look on your rubric you'll see a list of the different storage conditions and just make sure that you're well versed in those need to know what's relevant for the product that you'll have oh yeah okay so in addition to the Flex pen there's also the Flex touch the steps of using it are the same the only difference is that over here this injector the way that it pulls out like when you dial a dose the higher the doses the farther out this part is gonna go and that could be a just dexterity issue for patients who are injecting really large amounts of insulin because their thumb might not be able to go all the way back so with the Flex touch it makes it a little bit easier if you're injecting large amounts and it also holds more insulin I think the flex touch holds up to 80 units whereas this holds 60 so you guys will notice the difference so here this is dialed up to 40 units you'll see you know SEC and it doesn't protrude through the back where if this is dialed to 40 units excellent any questions thank you okay please hold [Music] I'm doing the soleus okay so the next pen device I'll be demonstrating is the solostar pen and just like you did for the Flex pen you're gonna wash your hands and lay out everything that you'll need which is the exact same supplies and again the first step is to take the cap off of the pen in this case you'll want your head to be at room temperature before you use it for the first time so we're with the Flex plan you check to make sure there is no discoloration in this pen you want to see that the liquid in the window is clear and colorless and for this one for you don't how to resuspend it you're ready to go and you open your alcohol swab and you swap the top of the pen again and then you swab the area on your body that you'll be using which again are the same areas the upper arms thighs stomach your buttocks okay in the same manner you'll take the pen the needle off screw it onto your pen remove the top cover and keep that and then discard the inside cover so for these pens they need to be primed before every injection every single one of the solostar pens and the way that you'll do that is to dial two two units again unless you're using two Jo in which case you'll dial two three units then the same way you did before you hold the pen with the needle facing up and you press in until it forms a drop of insulin on the tip make sure that you press all the way and then when you check the window again it's back down to zero okay if this doesn't work then you can try it two more times for an addition for a total of three attempts and if at that point you're not able to produce that drop of insulin on the tip of the needle then again you know the pad is faulty and you need to throw it out so once that happens you're ready to go ahead and inject your insulin make sure that it's back down to zero and then dial up to the dose of insulin that you'll be injecting so in this case I'm just gonna dial it to eight units again grip the pen firmly put it into the skin subcutaneously and then once again you're gonna press all the way down in this case you'll count out loud to ten unless you're using two Jo in which case you'll count to five to make sure that you get the full dose of insulin then remove it from the skin put the cap on onto the needle unscrew the needle and dispose with that in your sharps container okay also sorry I didn't mention this earlier but once you take the your pen out again you're gonna want to make sure that it's back to zero and that's it that's how you use the solostar pen okay guys can you hear me okay so I'm gonna do the demonstration for our final insulin product this is the quick pen so a lot of crossover with the steps as far as all of the different insulin devices again the first step with this one is going to be to wash your hands gather your materials and everything then just inspect the pen make sure that you in fact have the correct product also take a look at the expiration date on there make sure that it's not expired then you're gonna want to take the cap off just inspect the insulin so this particular pen there are different types of insulin that come in this pen a few of the products are mixed products so like our Humalog we have 70/30 50-50 so there are a few mixed products those are going to appear cloudy whereas the ones that are not mixed they're going to be clear so you just want to be sure there's no discoloration if it's supposed to be cloudy that it is in fact cloudy if it's supposed to be clear that it is clear so for your cloudy products your mixed products um you're gonna want to roll it gently between your hands ten times and then also gently flip it over ten times be sure that you don't shake these products if you shake them you can get air bubbles which you can imagine can be problematic so just be sure that you're doing that very gently and inverting the pin okay next thing after you do that we're gonna grab our alcohol swab again swab the rubber stopper and then go ahead and the site that you've designated to inject go ahead and swap that with alcohol as well remove the protective layer from the pin cap and screw that screw it on to the top okay just as Shivani demonstrated there are two caps with this one as well so the outer cap you can go ahead remove that and keep it the inner cap is a smaller one go ahead remove it and you can discard of that you won't be using it again so next I'm going to demonstrate priming these devices as well so for priming purposes you will dial the dose counter up to two units up to two units and then we'll do what we call an air shot where you point it toward the sky and press it down to zero so I'm just going to show you here you can see the insulin as you can see you see that insulin just kind of squirt it out indicating that it is ready to go and then just double check to be sure that the dose counter is back to zero so for these products you can do this four additional times for all of the products so that's going to be a total of five attempts for everything except for the u 200 so the more concentrated insulin you can do that at an additional eight times for a total of nine times de part of the device just to make sure that it's working okay so then after you've primed the device you're ready to use it just be sure that the dose counter is in fact such a zero doll it up to the appropriate amount of units so I'm gonna do six units just for teaching purposes today make sure that you have it dolled up to the appropriate amount inject it into the injection side again you're going to want to be sure that your rotating injection sites just as Shivani said with all of her products press it firmly down until the dose counter is back to zero hold this for five seconds just to be sure that the patient receives the full dose and then remove it make sure that that dose counter is at zero again then go ahead put the outer cap back on unscrew the top and then you will dispose of this needle top and sharps container as well well all right a thing to note with these products they have different expiration dates based upon two different types of products so that's something that you're going to want to look at your rubric really be sure that you include that in counseling points whenever you're in lab and doing your clinic visit they all have different expiration dates depending upon whether they're refrigerated or kept outside of the refrigerator so just be sure that you note that in your accounts link any questions about this product what that's just for your mixed products you want to resuspend so the question was whether or not you have to roll and resuspend the product if it's a clear one so a non mixed product um you do not have to do that but if it is a mixed product so your 70/30 50/50 there's a 75 25 there are different types of insulin that are in those and so you do have to roll those and then also gently flip them over ten times just to be sure that you do in fact resuspend the product I'm okay so as you can see this device is very different compared to the insulin pens that we've been using it almost looks like a bottle rocket or something so very different definitely pay attention to this rubric and all of the different steps that you're going to be using something that is unique about this product is if it's kept in the refrigerator you actually have to take it out of the refrigerator and let it sit for 15 minutes before using it so that's very different from any of the other products that we've seen an important counseling parameter and sorry an important counseling point to just be sure that you reinforce during your clinic visit for this product so once you have it out of the refrigerator ready to go after sitting outside for 15 minutes outside of the refrigerator just be sure to check this clear window here make sure that it's in fact clear that there aren't any crystals in there that it's not cloudy discolored anything like that and then the first thing as always be sure that you wash your hands priority use that's a given with all of these devices so then the first thing that you're going to want to do is remove the tab from this needle cover here you can see it's a little larger and then place it on top of the device okay the next thing you can see here at the base there's a green portion and then also an orange portion so you're going to twist here until the green portion disappears and then at the time that the green portion disappears you'll hear a click I'm sure all of you won't be able to hear it but does anyone hear that up here so you can hear it's kind of a faint click just to indicate that the green part is completely submerged within the pen and then you should only see the orange part now this step is pretty unique so after the green part it has completely disappeared within the pen you're actually going to tap this against your hand 80 times yeah yeah and then so 80 times in every 10 taps you actually have to twist it so do this eight times I'm not going to do it 80 times for you guys but just be sure that you counsel your patients on that so then after you've done that 80 times just make sure that it is mixed appropriately so on the demo device it actually shows you what it should look like if it's mixed appropriately versus not mixed well so whenever you're doing like your hands-on and practicing with these devices you can actually see the demonstration on the pen it's pretty neat demo to show you what the patient should be looking for versus what it's not okay for them to inject all right so after you've made sure that it's mixed uniformly go ahead wipe your I find my alcohol swab go ahead wipe your injection site then what you're going to do go ahead and remove well actually we're gonna not remove the needle cap go ahead and inject the orange part or twist up the orange part first so whenever the orange part is fully submerged within the pen it actually releases this button here can you guys see that all right so the button is now released that means that it's ready to go so then remove the needle cap all right there's not actually a needle on the demo so I'm just going to show you guys how you would normally use it inject it into the skin and then press this button down and you're going to hold that for 10 seconds and then just to be sure that the patient has the full dose and then remove the pen this is a single dose unit so they're not actually going to be reusing this like the other insulin pens you know they had multiple doses within there they'd be reusing that this is just one dose and then it's completely finished so toss it in the Sharks all right any questions on that also no expiration date on this one it's different from the insulin products this one's good for 28 days so just be sure that you include that in your counseling parameters whenever you're in your clinic visit and lab anything else on that one okay so one last pin to demonstrate to you guys this one again very different from the insulin pens this is another GOP medication this is the trulicity pin so the first step to this as with everything wash your hands gather your supplies so with this one there's actually a gray base here at the end of this it's an auto injector so you can actually remove this here go ahead and toss it you will not be keeping this be sure that the patient knows that after they've removed this gray base don't try to reinsert it you can mess up the needle that's in there and then also be sure that they're not playing around with the base we don't want them to accidentally stick themselves or anything like that then here you can see there's a dial the dial whenever it's set to red that means it's in the locked position whenever you twist it to green it's in the unlocked position so grab your alcohol swab swab your injection site just as you've done with everything else be sure that you're rotating sites with this so with this one here whenever you turn it to green that means that it's set to go so you're going to this end here the wide base you can kind of see it's like a triangle shape you're going to put that against the skin can kind of see that yeah so once you have it right up against the skin against their injection site that they've cleaned and it's in the unlocked position you're going to press the screen button here on the end it's important to counsel the patients that they're going to hear a first click but do not remove the device whenever you hear the first click they actually need to hold it in place another five to ten seconds then you're going to hear a second click and that second click is whenever the medication that's been administered so I'm sure that not all of you will be able to hear this but I'm going to demonstrate now so press the button whenever it's an unlocked position there's the first click there's our second clip so it's important for them to hold it in place five to ten seconds it's just to ensure that they get the dose delivery once the medication has actually been delivered I know but there is a gray plunger that comes out in the bottom this indicates that the patient has received the dose so it's important to counsel them on that after it's actually been administered you will see that grey plunger there again single dose within this pin they're not reusing this so go ahead toss the entire thing into the sharps container yes so with this one it's important to counsel the patients in your clinic visit it's actually on your graded rubric just be sure that you're counseling them on missed doses they shouldn't be taking two doses within three days of each other so 72 hours that's the golden rule for this one just be sure to counsel them if they've missed a dose be sure that it they don't take a skip dose to catch up if it's 72 hours until their next dose and then again take note of the expiration date on this one as well it's different from the other products this one doesn't have to be primed it's not on not on your grading rubric at all the other thing I'm not sure if I pointed out with this one to buy jewelry on as I mentioned 15 minutes you have to let it sit outside of the refrigerator trulicity the second you take it out it's ready to go you don't have to wait okay I'm not going to inject myself in front of you guys I'm not very good with needles you have to yeah I had to as well when I was in pharmacy school it's just a rite of passage okay so the first step as with everything is to gather your materials so identifying your injection site the bottle of insulin which in this case will be saline your alcohol pad and your syringe so first identify your injection site go ahead if there is a top on the vial of saline just go ahead and pop that top and then grab the alcohol swab and clean that and then also clean the injection site so then grab your syringe for teaching purposes I'm just going to pick a number we're just going to do 20 units of insulin so it's important with the syringes that before you inject it into the vial that you go ahead and draw up the appropriate amount of air due to the pressure that's within the vial you have to inject the appropriate amount of air in order to displace the volume and be able to pull back the appropriate volume of insulin so I'm just going to draw up 20 units of air here okay then you will place it in the vial you can rest it against your palm inject the air into the vial and then you're going to draw back the appropriate amount of insulin which as I mentioned I'm doing 20 units okay also you want to check be sure that you don't have any air bubbles in the bio or in the syringe it doesn't have to be absolutely perfect for lab purposes so don't spend forever getting out teeny tiny little air bubbles but it is important whenever you're counseling your patients to be sure that they don't have large air bubbles in the syringe because it displaces volume and then they could get a sub therapeutic dose of insulin so just kind of want you to understand why that's important clinically but yeah we're more so worried about them getting the appropriate dose of insulin but just double check it make sure that you don't have any large air bubbles floating around in there and you could just tap those as you need to make them go back into the vial then remove the syringe the spot that you've identified for your injection site inject it just like that sorry it's probably should've done that where you guys could see and then just remove the needle and place it immediately in the sharps container as you can see that's a needle that we don't float it so when you guys are so don't you can wear whatever you want but just be when you come up to your groups just make sure you shed at least a lab coat or whatever else you have because you're gonna have to do do a subcutaneous injection but it's gonna be subcutaneous injection in the abdomen good question yes so the question was guys hold on we're not done do you have to do this for laughs the answer is no so it's over the years we used to have to actually have this step but it was way too nerve-wracking for you guys we removed it so we used to have you guys do it in free labs so you at least experienced once and then when you get to lab it wasn't your first time but we've removed that step over the years just because it's just again like I said this fear of injection makes it really difficult that you can't everything else you're done if you have any throw them in here portfolios if you so choose you you you", "YGms3UFr344": "[Music] [Applause] hello and welcome to the brave near weed podcast and now here's your host Joe Joe Joe

actually they made my saliva really fluff I'm awful I had a couple of things I had I had the wild berry myself you liked it I did it was my favorite between the two and the other one was watermelon lemonade then whatever eliminated on the on the packaging it says it's good for bliss Wow Berry says it's good for chill well it wasn't I can tell you that I went to bed my mind was not chillin okay it was on the rev I would say it was good for rev what about you how did it work oh it totally did what it was supposed to for me it relaxed me I I wanted it I wanted a nice couch lock so I could I could just unwind at the end of the day and and it it was very nice my wife and I each had a chill and we did we just chilled and we hung out together and we cuddled on the couch and we had a nice relaxing evening oh well and the Camino gummies are manufactured by Kiva yeah yeah they may they make one of my personal favorite edibles which is their chocolate-covered coffee beans yes they make a sativa 5 milligram chokolate covered coffee bean which I am just the biggest fan of so Big Ups to Kiva yeah they work they work they work they work for you know they really work great for speaking of the holidays they work great for holiday gatherings like if you ever have to go yeah I suggest giving every member at the table a little 5 milligram yeah but even if they don't want to partake and you do I promise you there's gonna be one less argument at that table yes everything's gonna taste really good too what something else to that that that I had was was kick cocoa tranquil tea how was that it was actually very relaxing it was for sleep I got it for my dad actually because my dad has Parkinson's and he has trouble sleeping getting to sleep at night and so and he took like he loves tea obviously there's no caffeine in this cuz it's to help you go to sleep and it's it's five milligrams of CBN 3 milligrams THC and it just relaxes you puts you to sleep and it works really really well Wow did you try the flavor what flavor was it it was chamomile valerian sounds like something out of Game of Thrones I'm from house chamomile valerian anyway you know I'd love to hear you know we

they have synth the sympathy sensual positivity they have all sorts of different stuff for different effects it seems I'm looking at their web so they claim anyway well by the way this is not a paid endorsement this is not a paid or folks this is just us sharing our is with you okay well I'm also back in New York for some work and a visit and I did spend the week upstate in the Catskills in the woods and also had a really delicious gummy this one was a little bit different I think this one comes out of Colorado and it's a company called Incredibles and this was a peach gummy 5 milligrams we were kind of popping them every I don't know six eight hours depending on how the ride was going throughout the course of the weekend and these were also fantastic really manageable it was a good uplifting you know we're communing with each other we're communing with nature we're cooking food having a great time and it really lifted our spirits had us laughing and giggling about so again these great quality products that are available and out there they affect obviously affect people differently some are uplifting some are down lifting so you're just gonna have to get out there and try it but let's start slow yeah five milligrams a great place to start totally enough totally enough just just enjoy the ride these were available out of Massachusetts and but I think the company is out of Colorado look around Incredibles and if you want to find more on them online I love Incredibles com will show you their entire product listening and I guess they're like an old guard you were saying

conversation about cannabis sex and aging with with two pretty extraordinary elders Charlie and Shelly winninger's you're probably not going to hear this kind of conversation on CNN you're certainly not gonna hear about it on Fox but he's 70 although that's probably where they should be their target demographic yes I guess I don't know he's 70 and he's the author of a new book that will be out this year called listening to ecstasy which you can figure what that's about he's also a psychotherapist she's 68 and a retired RN and listen they've been married for 20 years and they told me point-blank that their sex life has really never been better hmm he's having full-body orgasms amazing men most men don't say that and hers are getting more powerful as she ages at one point in this interview they even said that they knocked Charlie out of bed so what so they use a bunch of substances and this interview will it be exploring many substances because we are a poly substance we are Pro poly substance but they really like cannabis and a little dark chocolate and they're gonna talk about a lot of the secrets that they have learned over the years and if you go on to our our blog and brave new weed calm I also posted a something called a harm reduction call which is if you are gonna use substances that do change the neuro chemistry of your brain it's very useful to take some supplements before during and after a journey that will reduce some of the depression or negative feelings you may have following them everything in the protocol that I posted online is available in a health food store or on Amazon instead of natural supplements about yeah like when you do Molly you come down and well what so the service component really drops right so you can you can you can mitigate that by taking these these up your list a few na RA la I don't know what that is magnesium glycinate vitamin C and grapeseed extract okay now when you're after the journey I've always known about this you take something called 5htp which which again sort of changes the way the body produces serotonin it gives you it makes it much nicer much easier so anyway that harm reduction protocol is posted on the brave new weed site under this episode episode 72 it's a very valuable thing I think okay so in the meantime let's talk to Shelly and Charlie Winton sure so I'm here with Charlie and Shelley winning juror thank you for joining us on the brave new weed podcast folks we're gonna talk about cannabis and sex and aging is what we're gonna talk about today these are topics that are interesting to me and to many of our listeners I just want to introduce you all to the listeners before we begin so Charlie you are a licensed psychoanalyst and you're also the author of a book that will be out in 2020 called listening to ecstasy just tell me in one sentence of what listening to ecstasy is please it's about the transformative power of MDMA and a memoir about our 65 MDMA experiences together and how they've made me a better husband a better psychotherapist and has helped both of us with the aging process that's great and surely you are a retired RN what's your what's your role in this other than the significant other well it all started by being a woman going through menopause and we found we were kind of sad that our sex life is going to kind of be depleted somewhere I I didn't meet Charlie until - until 2000 is this your second are you married i we are we are we are married okay great and is this your second marriage yes okay and you met him in 2009 Oh sex life started declining when four or five started going through menopause I went through it at age 53 uh-huh yes ooh look these are topics that are not often discussed in the mainstream so that's why we have podcasts cuz we get to talk about them freely and openly here so tell us so menopause happens sex life gets to be a bit of a drag or not as interesting or exciting how did you come across cannabis as a possible antidote to this and feel free both of you to talk to us freely well when I met Charlie he told me he was a hippie I had been a hippie during the day and we started smize started smoking with him I do smoke before maybe five times not really so and I raise children working as a nurse you know and life was different for me okay but I found that it made me more sexual and what we did actually I think we added hash to the mix a little bit of hash and it made me even more sexual and that we started playing around with it cured the menopause symptoms the symptoms being pain dryness discomfort no just low libido libido yeah Charlie how about as from the man's perspective here has this helped you in any way in terms of libido or desire I've known about cannabis in specific you are talking about kind of it sure I I mean when we have sex generally the only drug I'm doing is very dark chocolate and Shelley is the one who's smoking because I don't I'm fine and she is she turns me on completely and and and actually more than ever before okay that's great so you're not a cannabis user in terms use it but every now and then I'll use it and make love with it and I I what the only thing I notice is it heightens my sensual pleasure and my orgasms oh great okay yeah so are you guys smoking are you eating what what method of ingestion are you using smoking mostly either vaporizer or regular joint a joint well actually no vaping vaping okay vaping bud or vaping a Candace okay or oil yeah but what I have found what how it works for me especially as I've gotten older it's like noise a noise cancelling headphone it blocks out all the the [ __ ] from the day yep from the day and from like my son called me or my daughter is having problems with the kids and you know with my grandkids cetera and it helps me focus on but on him on Charlie yes and yourself no doubt yes it I listen to the music I listen to my body I'm feeling Charlie whatever he's doing and the love that we have I know the fight we were talking about it I don't know if I would be as responsive it was if it were a casual relationship but because our love is just so deep it just it's like whipped cream on top it's just wonderful that's great that's great I've always thought that it increases the word I use is receptivity so in that that expect goes I like that work as it sort of spans all things be it sex be it music be it food right the things that we know that cannabis does I think it makes us more receptive actually with anything to do with this senses but you think yes how does that work for you Charlie can you be more specific well I mean certainly for music at heightened his musical pleasure anything to the touch anything to the taste so and she looks like I say even better to me than normal so when you know on some good weed we're having sex and I feel like I am strolling into the garden of Shelley so Shelley I have have you told a lot of people about this obviously you're on a podcast I know you've done public appearances on it in New York it shows you talk to your peers about this you talked about other women your age who do you talk to you about how you use cannabis for sex most of my peers that's a good question thank you because I don't work anymore so and I couldn't when I worked I could not talk about it to my coworkers okay because by law just by now legally I was they could report me I could have lose my license right back in those days okay yeah otherwise no difference attacks yeah so I I it was mostly in this psychedelic community I mean we went to a concert in Brooklyn and there was some women who was it Disco Biscuits and we were table is talking after the concert to some women behind me who were younger they were in their like 30s and Here I am in my 60s and I don't know how it came about but we started talking about weed and sex I mean it was a Disco Biscuits concert Disco Biscuits is a yeah our jam band Phish like jam band and Disco Biscuits it's actually named after an old term for ecstasy okay but we were smoking smoking pot so you know it know you're taking ecstasy as well probably we were that night yes okay that does tend to enhance conversational bill you know was a conversation right yes so do you guys use it I just want to finish that god yes because with you were talking to these women about it and I was noticing that they were they start surrounding her in a rapt attention they were all like 20-somethings and they were fascinated by how as they get older they don't have to stop they don't have to stop rocking and rolling and they don't have to stop smoking and they and their sex life can still be as alive as ever they don't have to stop rocking and rolling or smoking and screwing okay I don't what I don't want you to feel inhibited we are an open podcast I say we want no advertisers are gonna drop because we don't have an advertiser but so it's a lot to talk about here there's cannabis there psychedelics how do you use so you're smoking what kind of sex do you find is enhanced with cannabis for example I know that I tend to get dry mouth if I'm inhaling so it doesn't it takes me a while to sort of like get get kissing back back in order got up to speed you have any do the create any issues for you no that's good the only thing is sometimes I do have to smoke a little bit more than if I want to just relax I need to get a little higher you need to get higher yeah that's what needs to be that's your noise-cancelling yes it doesn't mean I'm not present and it also depends what kind of pot I'm smoking what kind of weed I'm smoking or whether it be sativa or indica what do you notice the difference ah well with a sativa even though the Charlie's like oh sativas best for sex I was using sativa and I was having problems it wasn't helping and it's making you too anxious no no it just wasn't making me as orgasmic Oh once I started adding indica making it like a hybrid whether it be a vape or vaping a combination of different weed I became much more receptive and more orgasmic cuz it changed the quality of your orgasms and can you describe that really it just makes it easier easier mmm I'll tell you what I've experienced on this end from her yes I know and this is just you know very subjective and I don't know exactly what she's experiencing of course but it seems to me that is she gets older her orgasms get more intense because that that's what it's been like and more frequent than when we first started almost almost 20 years ago Wow more powerful would you say yeah the one thing I do find because these substances are powerful sometimes after having I call them orgs so they're like little orgasms sometimes I'll have larger orgasms but many times most of the time actually afterwards I still have a lot of excess energy inside me and Isis after I'm done he's finished I wait a few minutes sometimes some I'm listening to the music and I'm like I'm not finished you finish that a certain point in life and yes we do and but those because they come fairly quickly and I mean I'm using more stimulation a strong vibrator and it's like BAM and my whole body he can feel it a full body organ yeah he can feel it after times it knocks me out of the bed and it's not that the vibrator is you know a better lover than Charlie because it when I I don't think I could do it unless Charlie helped me but it just gets that energy out if somebody was to come to you and say look I'm in my 60s I want to have better sex with cannabis what would your recipe be either one is a play with different kinds of cannabis whether indica sativa or hybrid and smoke enough or eat enough whatever you want to do where your your high start that way or start low and then if it doesn't help just get a little higher and music helps again let's talk about music for a because you've now mentioned music both of you several times what's what's the playlist chill out 2016 it's there the trip hoppy kind of music that I put it on shuffle oh we on Spotify or we on Pandora what are we on here well Pandora we do trip up okay but this I have Amazon music so I can download different of different albums the plug for Amazon music will work for Amazon I'm thinking of switching over because they don't have everything I want but in the meantime they have this one album 30 30 songs I shuffle I sometimes I'll say I never heard that song before and because it's just shuffling and sensual and exotic music sonic erotic it's edgy 0-7 is another is a group that has some albums and they're very edgy and what I what I do is when I'm listening to the music I kind of pretend well now we're talking about a little bit of fantasy I go for it I pretend that I'm in a movie and or in a in a in a place and the whatever music I'm hearing that's what in my mind I'm surrounded by whether it's if it's Eastern I'm surrounded by colors you know from rugs like like you know in a tent if if it's like a Scottish kind of thing I'm I'm with a fireplace it just just helps me set the mood so it also sounds like cannabis somehow stimulates your imagination as well as your your vagina and other organs is that correct yes absolutely absolutely cannabis is great for well it's it's notoriously good for creativity and I used to use it creatively now I can access I write a lot so I access my creativity and just like I said with dark chocolate but interestingly cannabis and dark chocolate are two of the world's most complex chemicaly chemicaly complex organs or or substances I should say but yeah certainly when I'm high my imagination runs wild they both stimulate the under cannabinoid system they both have an effect on the under cannabinoid system I'm not quite clear I don't think anybody quite knows how they affect it but it's quite interesting to look at is there any particular sexual act that you've been more prone to exploring has cannabis opened your your your I want to say your your sexual imagination in any way are you comfortable talking about this just um finding different parts of my body that I know are reactive but like on my breasts but even more so anything anything goes and I will tell you just to tell you if we're talking about a combination of psychedelics with with pot yes let's just just standing at a concert over this summer listening to music and just moving back and forth I hadn't or against what psychedelic was that MDMA and wheat they go well together did you go well together but I want to ask Charlie do you find that MDMA is a sexual stimulant as a man good question thank you it's it's a double-edged sword I think it is to Tommy I find it frankly more difficult to get or stay hard on MDMA similar but there's something I can take for that right yeah I do that if we're gonna have sex I will do two things I'll take a cialis and I'll smoke and both those things will will help me stay hard and also if I if I smoke enough the MDMA is if I'm not at the height of the roll I can come got it so lots of I went to the maps conference this year in New York I know you were there - I saw you're there and there's lots of information about MDMA and its ability to increase empathy right I mean obviously ecstasy I think you know this was when it first came out they called it empathy but right really a great brand right people didn't really go there so ecstasy worked much better yeah how do you find the connection of empathy and and physical pleasure how does let's make let's sort of draw some connections there they're not necessarily connected well for us they are I mean it's like I don't know it's like the difference between you know the part of Wizard of Oz where all of a sudden they enter Oz and things go from black and white to color yes well it's sort of like that so when when the MDMA comes on whether we're smoking or not it just heightens the intimacy between us and our kisses are more the less delicious and and and a touch is more remarkable and astonishing and so it just heightens everything and that is where the sensuality is heightened it heightens the heart-to-heart connection yes I find the same but so let's talk a little about your book please listening to ecstasy oh okay if you don't mind how many trips did you do 68 we've we've we make it called rolling over also 65 about 65 rolls that that we have done together over how many years over about 1516 years so it's like four or five times a year and can we talk about what got you going on this ah Shelly I had given up MDMA by the time I had met her but she said you know she was just out of a what'd you want to talk about it she was just out of a long hard difficult marriage and she wanted to spread her wings and when she found out that I was interested in psychedelics she said I want to try ecstasy people told me about it I want to try this so I said all right it's and I I had given it up I I didn't know about the protocols at the time and how to make it a safe and rewarding journey so I turned her on and decided to do it again with her and we learned about how hydrating and keeping ourselves hydrated during the experience we learned about 5htp afterwards too - we've never had what they call the Tuesday blues never did it never but we regulate the dosage we get a lot of sleep the night of so we're very careful and we've we've followed the protocols and since then I mean it's it's just it's add icing to our cake you said that but it must have added more if you're writing a whole book about it but before you go there I want to ask you what is the correct dosage of 5htp to kill those Tuesday blues well if you make that measurement that's a good question III don't know what it might be for you for us we take 200 milligrams the night of and another 200 milligrams the following night at that time not in the morning no we do the night of at bedtime for two nights that's what that's what works for us Shelley I just wanted to say one thing something interesting I have coronary artery disease I have a six stents and when I tell people that they're like what and you you take MDMA and I cleared it with a expert a physician who's an expert on ecstasy and this doctor said just take a beta-blocker MDMA has some amphetamine in it so it'll speed you a beta-blocker makes your heart go slower so and I'm on beta-blockers anyway so I just take an extra one I've never had a problem you've never even had a symptom or anything when we're rolling and that's something that people older people especially with their medical problems it doesn't mean it's a life sentence of abstinence not necessarily I mean some people with some heart problems you definitely should stay away from it and if you really have a high blood pressure issue MDMA will increase your blood pressure slightly but often the medical community is a little hysterical about things like MDMA and so but don't take our word for it check with your doctor if you have a have an issue good good good warning right there are good disclaimer but let's go back to other things that listening exes to ecstasy other topics may be that you're broaching other than sex it really has helped me and both of us I believe with the aging process well that's it know about that a little bit well for one thing you know Minh my time comes I am NOT going to have too many regrets with or with the I mean I've lived a full life and can't continue to live a full life but MDMA makes it even richer and more complete and so I know that I and we are living life to its fullest so just from an existential point of view we're choosing to live a very full life that is not in the norm and and and gives us four or five times a year walks in heaven together and that is an interesting it's an interesting way to look at it but it's a way of preparing for one's demise to tool it to know that the one has lived fully and but also it just helps me because it helps with transitions as I'm listening into older age psychedelics and an MDMA in particular it just helps me get get it get be at peace with the changes that are occurring I think that's crucially important I'm thinking about these things a lot now as as I begin aging or ternal there are two opening let's say opening a new narrative how's that okay and you know I mean it's a struggle it can often be a struggle especially when you're beginning to sort of recognize oh I don't recover as quickly right I don't hear as well or I may lose my balance the things that want I don't have all those issues but you know for people I know my pot my parents did certainly you watch it always hit you as a bit of a surprise doesn't it yes it does and I'm wondering how you know psychedelics I mean obviously I know I know the studies that have shown that it helps people who are really at end-of-life deal with end of life yes people with cancer and they know they're dying especially we just know we know we're dying on a different scale rising on a slower more more gradual yeah scale right they're giving in studies famous John and hop Johns Hopkins study over ten years ago where they gave psilocybin which is magical mushrooms to two people who are at the end of life and it it helps them deal with faced their mortality and quell their anxiety you know yeah yeah and they're giving it to other people who are very mature who are who are well and they're coming back and saying this was one of the most profound experiences of my life and they follow up a year later and they say that was one of the most profound experiences of my life so a lot of doubters would say you're you're taking psychedelics which is a complete sign of your craziness it's obviously gone to your brain and obviously I'm not one of those people yeah how do you address that that sort of response there is I would say to that person you know if I was exposed to the same drug war information that you've been exposed to all your life without any opposing point of view I would believe the same thing there's been a lot of hysteria around that and around psychedelics I rock your brain they burn your spinal fluid they destroy your chromosomes all this has been debunked but the media doesn't follow up with the debunking story so it gets a bad reputation I also gets bad reputation from people who abuse the drug and you know if you like I say if you abuse MDMA it will return the favor you know if you do too much or if you do it too often it's it's going to hurt you but that's why you have to follow the protocols as I outlined in the book you should never do more than 120 milligrams that at one time and halfway three hours later you can do another half of that amount you've got to stay hydrated and you've 5-htp and getting the sleep that you need and and and after you do it especially if you're over 40 you shouldn't do it again for at least a four to six weeks do you choose ceremonial occasions do you or do you create your own ceremony around them we well let's put it this way we don't sit around on a Saturday night and with nothing to do and say gee why don't we take some whatever little let's drop some acid let's take some mushrooms we don't do that everything is plant when we go on on trips out of the nut nuts like Delic chips but regular trips yes like what vacations like vacations we do often do psychedelics in fact our most the it wasn't the first probably my third or fourth time doing MDMA we went to a place in British Columbia called Butchart Gardens and it was the most beautiful garden I have ever ever seen I'll bet it was and every time we when we travel we were in Barbados one year and we went to a botanical garden couldn't compare so so with jug garden this is like our gold standard so we're often checking out places to see what can be our next gold standard we also will if it's New Years Eve sometimes New Year's Eves will spend at home and we will plan an experience around that this New Year's Eve we're gonna be second time in a row we're going to be celebrating with a few friends and eighteen other thousand people in Madison Square Garden at a Phish concert oh so that's so great I thought we were going to say eighteen friends at an orgy experienced yet yeah we have it all right you know I'm not sure psychedelics or cannabis lent to that they are more intimate in using experience correct yeah and I know they're certainly orgies that occur within the MA and have you been to any well we did we wouldn't that we didn't have sex with anybody else but we went into the there's an a regional burn a burning man light experience called the Philadelphia Experiment or PEX and we went into the sex tent that pecks one one one night and it kind of blew us away no pun intended it was like a just a an extraordinary experience what we saw there and you'll have to wait for the book to read the details now that's a good two years but let's just say when we entered it we knew we weren't in Kansas anymore it was one of the most remarkable experiences of our lives and it's still every now and then I'll get back to it in your mind in your cannabis fueled imagined absolutely have you had either of you had any negative experiences using cannabis with sex as it made you overly thinkI or overly cautious or overly paranoid III do notice that I can get into my head and get lost there when I'm smoking the way out for me and this just works for me I don't know for anyone else is to get into the body and into the into my senses as I'm a gestalt psychotherapist and Fritz Perls who innovated and created Gestalt therapy said lose your mind and come to your senses so with cannabis if I focus out if I get to get out of my head I'll get into making love to this gorgeous woman I will get into the music that we're listening to I'll taste some rich chocolate anything sensual helps me get out of my head taking a bath sure absolutely hot bath hot shower absolutely sauna on the sea swimming in the in the ocean we want to swim we were on a cruise and it where it was freestyle dining so at dinner time like six seven o'clock there was an indoor pool we were we were the only ones and we we just had the pool to ourselves and they had lights and under underwater and it was beautiful beautiful amniotic sac experience yes yes absolutely yeah any other revelations that have occurred to you about cannabis and sex I mean you guys go out you talk about it public if kids by the way I do so they obviously know that mom is talking about having sex at the age of six what do they say well they don't know too much about me talking about sex they do know that that I do psychedelics my daughter actually had a misconception she thought that I was doing drugs and I just recently ahead all the time yeah like all the time I said I have to tell you I only I done LSD once every two years same with magic mushrooms once every two years MDMA four to five times a year and and she smokes more weed than I do so you know it and I said and that's it she said oh I thought died for some reason I thought you did other things I'm like no well it is you know look I think one of the very effective propaganda tools of the drug war is to put all substances in one bucket yes yes and make no distinction between them and make no distinction for Responsible use versus whatever other countries there is other people will disagree with me they'll all say you know all drugs are good and human beings should be able to put whatever they don't want in their body I mean I have a slightly different opinion about that because I've seen people go off the deep end sure a lot of feda mins and I mean it's not always been pretty that way and I know enough people who work in substance abuse clinics to know that addiction is one real problem I think that substances we're talking about here have never been shown to be in any way addictive or physically debilitating right right everyone draws a line somewhere when it comes to drugs but there's another issue there are people who to them what we're doing it is almost sacrilegious they feel that these these medicines medicine these medicines should be sacred and just used for sacred for ritual or or spiritual enlightenment like people who who will do ayahuasca or magic mushrooms for for spiritual development and so there are those who on the other side will judge us for using something like the like using mushrooms or LSD or MDMA or cannabis for recreational purposes and I like to say that fun joy play these can be transformative experiences I I I don't take that lightly I think that's a really important conference really important point fun is psychologically healthy I think another thing when when we talk about it with a group with groups and I say well I don't usually set an intention but what I do is especially if we're out in the park or something I learn not learn but I really appreciate nature i reaiiy appreciate what we have here on this earth so even a blade of grass or a little flower i'll see there's no question so so even though I say I'm doing it for recreationally I'm learning I'm appreciating and that's important to me also I prefer from to recreational which which sounds too many years as trivial frivolous and frivolous I prefer the word celebrational I like that so you look at these as celebratory experiences you make sex a celebratory experience you make a holiday or a yes walk through nature as a celebration yeah yes I love though I think it's really gorgeous let's end on that note Charlie and Shelley winter I'm so glad you came by to talk to us on the brave new weed podcast I want to end it but is there anything else you want to tell us or do want to discuss there anything we haven't brought up in this rather wide-ranging well interesting you use that term I have found that with psychedelics and and with cannabis it's wider ranging that when I was a younger man because of what I learned from set about sex from other guys I thought that sexual pleasure was really limited to my penis or just the tip of my penis yeah little one-inch that's right think about it it's like it's it's so limiting and and so what these substances have taught me is that there's a wider area of pleasure and that my whole body can I mean I want so twice in my life had full-body orgasms I've been really yeah yeah so but when when using any of these substances I can experience intense sexual pleasure and orgasms throughout the entire it's often through the entire pelvic area from my belly button down to my knees I'm like having an orgasm let's learn dog that no because what could be better thanks again folks so glad you joined us thank you thank you hi listeners we are always on the lookout for great things to talk about on the brave new weed podcast and we'd love to hear from you you can always email us at brave new weed cast at gmail.com with links to articles interesting news stories personal accounts of things that you've done or leads on books or products that we should know about you can always contact us at brave new we've cast at gmail.com [Music] alright gentlemen here we are yeah we've just heard that interview what a conversation what do you think I think it's great I think it's great first and foremost just from the most base level of people being able to talk about sex just in the same way that we have experienced prohibition of cannabis and other substances by nature Western society especially in the United States has this weird mental prohibition about talking about sex I think that because so many of us were raised in the church and had this morality beat into us or abstinence only education in public schools we just have this massive shroud of mystery and sort of general kick about talking about sex and one of the things that I've learned in in moving to Germany is that you get away from that moral abuse I'm gonna say and and and people are better about talking about sex people are better about communicating what they like what they don't like what works for them what doesn't work for them sex positivity is a thing in the world and needs to be a bigger thing just like talking about cannabis normally and normalizing it if we can talk about sex normally and have it just be a normal thing that people do because we we all do it or we all want to do it one way or to bury it and hide it and say oh it's dirty and it's immoral and you shouldn't do it because God says or because you know people will talk about you you know we got to get past that mentality and I think it mirrors cannabis prohibition in a lot of ways to be able to just freely talk about our sex lives thank you Matt what struck you the comment on that I want to lump therapy into that mental have Salou mental health as well our culture just the generation of you know 40 and above like our parents generation 50 and above I guess at this point just don't want to talk about mental health it's bearing it barrier to hide it and then it's all it's like don't enjoy yourself don't express how you want to feel it and I just like how you know there are many things I don't like about Millennials but one of the things I do like about Millennials is it there's like well in therapy let me tell you about what we just talk - yeah we're getting to a good point anyway about that interview it was very very interesting to me her comments on menopause because I've as a man who has a partner who has not gone through menopause I don't know much about it and it's going to come oh yes it will I'll tell you about buck yeah of course I will and and for me you know like libidos can change after childbirth and libidos change obviously during menopause and so for me to my question was about like whether or not orgasms are affected and I guess that's an orthogonal conversation too - libido so you can still have powerful orgasms and and have things to amplify and sustain that side of your body while doing things the other conversation is how do you have the sex drive back to then want to have the origins and how do you keep the intimacy factor going right I mean that's that's not easy after 20 years we all know that if you don't know it let me assure you it's not easy okay so I I thought that they were very bold and very brave to come on and talk about this I'm so glad they did and I want to remind you all that this episode was brought to you by 420 summit which is part of the YPO organization young presidents organization or to actually but here's how you do it you go to dub dub dub YPO org forward slash summit for 20 20 20 I'd sign up space is limited don't delay bring your partner bring associates who are members of I p\u00edo and i look forward to meeting you all there again well I think a big a big get and a big thing to look at and note about that conference is the keynote speaker being Ethan Adelman since he is retired from the DPA we don't get to hear from him as much and he's just a brilliant mind and a brilliant thinker about drug policy and to have an opportunity to see him on stage speaking to a forum in such a way I think it's an opportunity that people shouldn't miss yeah and I think we'll know more about who else is speaking in in the upcoming week so stay tuned we'll be talking about it they graciously sponsored this podcast and we couldn't thank them enough meanwhile come back next week we'll be talking about some more very provocative topics thanks for

calm [Music]", "af-Lc_fb3lg": "what's up everybody thanks for tuning in for another video today I'm gonna be talking about something pretty cool and that's something pretty cool is CBN we've all heard about the cannabinoids THC CBD and probably some people have heard of CBG so CBN is another manner and cannabinoid found in cannabis we generally see cbn in high levels in older bud THC will degrade into CBN I do believe that cbn is also a precursor to CBD THC CBG it's like the the it's think of it as like a stem cell can turn into any type of cannabinoid anyways it's not very common this is really the first product I've heard of it contains high levels of CBN I'm just gonna read you a little bit this is on leafy I'm reading a little bit about some there's not a lot of research out but I'm going to read you about some of the research they have the CBN it's been shown to be antibacterial neuro protectant appetite stimulation and anti-inflammatory think it's pretty cool that it can increase appetite and it's not psychoactive I know a lot of people use medical cannabis for appetite stimulation but maybe don't want those psychoactive effects hmm there's a misconception about cbn that it can be like heavily sedated that's actually not really true there was a study in the 70s that gave people old cannabis high in CBN and they got really sedated but that was more so due to the older terpene profile the cannabis not directly related to the CBN so be careful if you're buying CBN for like sleep it may not work as well as you think it might hmm CBN kind of seen it very similar to CBD to me but definitely a little bit different based on the research it's very expensive to make right now so for the the comb leaf I'm him on YouTube about a year ago he owns the website the calm leaf it sells hemp products and we've been talking and he wanted to send me out this new uncut CDN cartridge this cartridge is from for the people it's a hemp website they mainly make cartridges high CBD cartridges and now they have this cbn cartridge first company I've seen that has any type of cbn product so he sent this out to me a few days ago and i've been experimenting a little bit with it so CBM is real expensive to make I believe they have to go through three three or four rounds of distillation to really extract cbn at high levels because it's such a minor cannabinoid so it is very expensive so shout out to the calmly for sending this out to me feel free to try I always love trying new things hmmm and I got the flavour granddaddy purp 500 milligram cartridge so this cartridge is hmm two-to-one CBD to CBN so it has 44% CBD and 28% CBN so very high cbn levels anyways i'll talk a little bit about the the cartridge it's kind of hard since cbn is non psychoactive it's been kind of hard for me to gauge the effects especially because it's mixed with CBD so this cartridge definitely has a relaxing effect similar to CBD it's kind of hard to tell if I'm getting any other effects from it but I will say it's very relaxing and this grand a deeper flavor tastes amazing I'll go back head and hit right now the flavor kind of like lingers in my my mouth after I hit it and it's a good flavor so this Karcher just made by for the people like I said and the palm leaf sells these for the people cartridges the coma sells a lot of hemp products for a lot cheaper than what the actual companies are make them are selling them for and that's the case for these for the people I'm cut CBN cartridges so if you're interested in CBD cartridges or hemp products definitely check out the calm leaf I believe he's gonna have cheaper prices starting Valentine's Day on all these for the people cartridges the packaging on this is good 500 milligrams for this cartridge like I said it's very expensive so shouts and for sending this out I think it's cool too I think it's cool that the stigma about cannabis has started to fade away and we know it's you know we're not a hardcore drug and it has a lot of benefits to us as humans so it's cool when we start discovering these new cannabinoids and all the benefits they have specifically CBN I think we'll start seeing a lot more stuff related to CBN just like we did with CBD I actually saw a study that CB CB n can be an antibacterial for MRSA which is a very hard to treat bacterial infection so that's cool anyways I'm just going to hit this a few times great vapor production off these actually has like a little adjustable airflow thing so you can determine how big of a hit you want to take it's like a nice light gold color tastes good thanks for tuning in guys I've been getting a lot of positive feedback on these videos I've been putting out and I'm just doing this for fun sorry my gimbal collapsed but thanks for tuning in guys thanks for watching this if you're interested in cbn go ahead and check out the calm leaf on the company or only website I've seen that carries CBN and if there's anything you'd like to review or any questions you have for me you can go ahead and DM me as always thanks for watching peace oh and comb these supposed to have a price drop in the cartridges starting tomorrow Valentine's Day which is why I'm uploading this tonight peace again", "VY8q0hN6KwA": "so I'm rich are tell on professor faculty member here at the University of Wisconsin huge candy signs so we make some heart candy today this is a mixture of granulated sugar you can see the white stuff here we have corn syrup in here as well and then we have water to help dissolve the sugar we're just gonna dissolve all the sugar and make sure that there are no sugar crystals in here because eventually we're gonna make heart candy which is a sugar glass so we don't want crystals so we've reached the boiling point now and so essentially we're gonna follow the boiling point elevation curve up so in making hard candy we're going to boil up to what's called the hard crack stage where temperatures are on the order of 300 degrees Fahrenheit and water contents are down around 2 or 3 percent so we're now at the 233 degrees fahrenheit range and and this is where we have the thread state and what that means is the viscosity is high higher that high enough that when you pour this into cold water it forms threads as it falls through there but the viscosity is still low enough that those threads dissolve fairly quickly so we're now at about 240 degrees and this is according to the candy thermometer where we find the firm ball state and so we boiled enough water that that when you pour this into when you drop it into cold water it forms a coherent mass that you can take out and form it into a ball that can still be manipulated so it's plastic enough to be malleable but it's still a firm ball I can hold its shape okay and we're at about 298 now and and so I'm going to stop it and take it off the heat so we're now going to take this over to the cold table and pour it out and start the next stage of the process so at this point we've poured it onto the cold table and it's starting to cool you can see that as it cools it becomes more plastic more firm we have some color granules and we'll add those in here some flavor so we're gonna add a little bit of lemon flavoring to this and then we're gonna add a little bit of acid as well so right now we're in the stage where it's becoming a plastic mass and we're just trying to get it into a shape that it will go through the rollers it still has enough heat in it and the viscosity is low enough that it starts to flow so far to form it now it would form but then it would quickly deform just like it's doing here so this is just about at the point where where we can form it it's viscous enough that it's not flowing very quickly yet it's still plastic if it enough that we're going to be able to get it through the the rollers and and turn it into a nice candy [Music] so as you can see we're sending this plastic mass through these drop rollers they fill into the shapes and make the drop shaped candy so now our lemon drops have solidified enough to reach room temperature where now they're in the form of a sugar glass so this is just like window glass except it's made of sugar molecules not of silica but now because it's in a sugar glass I can drop this onto the tray and it's going to shatter it'll shatter along the webbing here or leaving behind some intact lemon drops so at this point we have lemon drops but they have all these sharp edges on them still so the next step in the process would be to put them into some kind of tumbling drum to smooth out the edges [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "jOixW6-oEL4": "bye okay i just got done doing finishing up 21 day fix extreme cardio it's 30-minute cardio session she has you do it slightly warmer than a slight cooldown other than that is basically a form of the negative and that she has you repeated a second time and that's considered one the circuit and this should give you four more moves you repeat 2 times is two circuits and then she has to do another one so it's based on circuits I think the hardest one is the last one because you do squats to clean lunches and then you do burpees you just got done with a fast feet hopped around four so it's a really tough cardio anybody can do it i will say that is just about and a mental game making yourself go taking breaks when you need 30 minutes you're done and i think what i think i have burn more calories today then i have been on elliptical because when you're on the elliptical you push yourself and when you follow a video they push you and so I think I pushed myself a lot harder doing this program and it went a lot faster because the fact of your not just in your own head you actually have something to keep your mind occupied and by switching things up as much as she does by doing the circuits you don't get bored where I was signing doing cardio at the gym try to stay on the elliptical or on the treadmill or in the bicycle whatever it is for 30 minutes which is very difficult for me I just couldn't mentally do it and then because mentally I wasn't there I wasn't getting the sled I wasn't getting the elevated heart rate I'm drenched right now absolutely drenched good morning guys okay i'm going to show you my breakfast my try to do a full day of eating vlog for you in here is one-fourth cup of dry regular old-fashioned oats and i mixed it with two tablespoons of creamer and a half and half creamer and then a little bit of my sugar-free butter flavored Maple Grove Farm syrup that is my dog eating over there and then here i have three fourths of a cup of egg whites with one whole egg and then in there you can fairly see it that is half an ounce of cheddar cheese slices i am going to drink a scoop of this which is fallout this is my recovery because I just did my cardio this morning already first thing I can't do it one-handed so I'm just going to add in a heaping scoop to Malta okay so i really like this I've never had it before up until a couple weeks ago about two weeks now but it's for muscle recovery joint health it hydrates it helps with repairing your connective tissues so I mean it does a lot for you it has a lot in it it was not the cheapest in the world I will not lie however the flavors good i have candy apple I'm not sponsored by them but like I said no calories no cards no gluten it's wonderful spy atomic so I will drink that as the copper ad it is it's already starting to turn green this is the supplements when I take I'm going to take one of these it's a pearl digestive I'll take one green tea is 500 milligrams one caffeine 200 milligrams to l-glutamine I'm going to take a tablespoon of elk our team 1500 that one's really good too it's grape flavored it's just a liquid and I put it in a little tablespoon thing it's really good CLA just for fat burning and omega shred I use this again mostly just because it has fish oil and stuff in it so I like it so this is my morning routine of what I take this is my after work out normally I would drink a protein shake with it but I'm going to save my protein shake for later on this evening after I do Katie but anyway let me show you the back rows on breakfast so this is where we are at for macros for breakfast again it's old-fashioned oats 1 whole egg three-fourths of a cup of egg whites half an ounce of cheddar cheese and then two tablespoons of the fat-free half-and-half milk brought me to 397 calories 17 carbs I'll show you the fats this is where I am mad as far as 13 grams of fat 17 carbs 30 protein and three sugars so again not bad and this stuff here is pretty good i can find Walden farm every once in a while but not all the time so that's my go-to anyway meal one done so I'm a little bit behind on my meals today so I'm going to go ahead and make up my steak for the next couple of days I normally grill it but today I'm not so I'm just using some Uncle Chris's gourmet steak seasoning and have my top sirloin already on the pan this does have faults in it but it's mostly a garlic and parsley let's see if i could tell you with thee so two hundred and ten milligrams of sodium no carbs no protein no fat no calories so it's not too too bad a fourth of a teaspoon as a serving the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to make some protein waffles real fast because again I'm behind so I'm gonna go ahead and have real pancakes so all I do is one serving of this is a third of a cup you want hope so I'm just going to take my measuring third of the cup of dry and the throw it in the container just stay there you don't the color and then I'm putting in one scoop of my belly core and this one here is the cinnamon swirl one full scoop and then I just add water sir that and by the time I get all this done then my waffle makers should be ready to go as well you just want it to be the consistency of a regular pancake mix so I just guesstimate on my water I don't ever measure it spray your waffle maker and then pour in your mix up okay so here's the final product I ended up getting one two three four waffles out of it and i put 1 tablespoon of peanut butter on there here's my steak I'll eat it with my salad and a little bit so I have it a tupperware it just cooling off right now there's the waffles and again I just put some jiff creamy peanut butter on top 1 tablespoon the macros on that is two tablespoons is actually one serving and I only took one so there you go it's not too too bad so everything's in half the pancakes again this is just nice because it's only it's 27 grams of carbs so this is going to use the rest of the carbs that I do have for the day I just used him on this again that's only 140 calories 1.5 grams of fat and then my protein out of it I got 25 grams of protein for 130 calories with my cellucor whey protein that is going to be my second meal and I'm actually combining it with what would have been considered my second meal because my second meal I should have had a turkey and avocado wrap so that would have been my protein in my fat so instead I'm doing protein and fat alright pre-workout meal to rice cakes with one tablespoon of peanut butter and sugar free blueberry or black berry jelly making my own little version of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich it's about 14 grams of carbs because I'm fixing to go do body beast bill legs so I need a little bit of the carbs and stuff to get me through my work out some I eat that right now and I'm working up ok so today is a thursday and it was body beast build legs I feel like a broken record I feel like a birdie said this over and over this week but again the same thing goes I did this routine last week at the gym in the pace that he goes is totally different than the pace I was going at the gym and i tell you what i want to kind of reflect for a minute um tomorrow's going to be my day off I have a 12-hour shift to work tomorrow at work unloading at $18 so me as it is my off day and then saturday i'll do fridays routine and then legs as well at the gym probably and said totally different weights this week as compared to what i did last week at the gym i also modified a few things the first thing we do sumo squats someone study using a dumbbell like he does in his program i actually used my my rogue squat section here that i have and i use a straight bar with 225 pound plates on it and I did my sumo squats I never went up and wait where he does go up in weight so it's 15 12 8 and then a drop eight like I said I just did 25 pound plates the entire way through and I was perfectly fine with that late there's no way I could have gone up it was complete burn out it also going to be a superset active that you do alternating lunges and go straight into a step up reverse lunch that one absolutely killed me because I did do so much bright for that at the pace again 25 pound place isn't a whole lot for me but with the amount the volume that he's having me do the reps in the speak that he's having you do the rest without rest will in between it wasted my legs so by the time I got to not alternating lunges you're supposed to do 15 per leg and then it then you go straight into your step up my bench here is a little bit of higher than a regular bench as well so I'm getting a lot more into the higher hip flexor hi quad hamstring into the glute area so I really feel in a totally targeting in different parts of my lower body then I didn't ask the gym on a regular bench again I just used some 15 pound dumbbells for the alternating front lunges and again is just right leg left leg right leg left leg non-stop 15 / legs and then and I would i tempted to use 12 pound dumbbells for my step up and i tell you what i could not keep up with the pace that he was going it was just really taxing on my legs I ended up doing the last two sets just straight up without weights for the step ups I was just gas and I even got behind and how to pause the computer because it was taking me double the time to get up get down and get into it safe back lunge position and then back up with again the type of that I used I think next week i will use my regular smaller bench because it doesn't have as much Patti so it won't be quite as wobbly and it's not quite as high so I think it would be a little bit easier your timing wise to get up and down all over again I did kind of like having the higher bench because again it's targeting different areas of the leg then I have been targeting because again on a regular you're going to be able to see it on a regular bench my foot would be about here but on this binge my life is like here so it's really targeting hi hi hi and the chi hair is really great movement again it's more like a burnout round for me than anything I thought I ain't going to like he calls a giant sets you're going to do paradise watch which is basically a standard with squat he uses dumbbells i'ma back gonna use my straight bar an olympic-sized borrow 25 pound place and then so you're doing 15 12 8 again very very little west it's almost non-stop just go go go so I did in my caramel squats over there and then instead of Bulgarian squats which is what he's doing IHG's my hack squat machine that had that come with my body solid machine I utilized it and I just did on this a reverse lunge into it and the way that it hits it it hits it where it focuses more on a hamstring bucking would appear on a Bulgarian squat and I was able to do a little bit of your weight now that means that I'm it too heavy the first round the first round I used 45 complex kill myself won't do that again but I just too lazy to go get different weights and I didn't want to see it weights off with my straight bar and the mark is not enough time so what I did is the first one I just stuck it out almost died finish that up and then you are straight into straight leg deadlift again I do mine different than he did he has you get into a position to where you're almost facing the side almost like you're going to do a lunges just dropping it down and use the straight bar between the letter just lean forward and then come up and it's us be targeting your glutes and your hamstrings I chose to forgo that movement and just do a one legged dead lift instead I felt like I got a little bit better workout from doing that my personal opinion but again that's not what he does in the program i used 15 pound dumbbells of her leg on that and it gave you in 15 12 and then ate the second time in three go I could not do another complete set of the 45 so I actually went down like way down and I just put on 15 on each side and again that was more than enough wait for me because I the second and third round through I basically just lifted up the leg that I was not utilizing and almost did a one-legged squat so to speak up but the way that a machine has you do it is more like a hack squat position so again it's tiny more my hamstring and the glutes because the angle that you let is that and how your body actually forces you to sit down into it like this more we're going to rather squat you sit more like this so it's a little bit different angle and then the last thing that he does is he to the giant set of single leg calf raises and then see the calf raises again I don't ever do the Beast caps I always do the three way calf raises again if you follow me you know it is that the other day but it's 10 this way 10 with my toes in and then attended my toes out and then I just repeated that three times I'm good over there so overall I feel really good about today's routine I think I need to play with my numbers a little bit more I'm pleased with the modifications that I made especially for what my focus is in my focus right now is I'm trying to build I don't have much time left but I need to lift as heavy as a candies last few weeks so I don't lose any more muscle this morning I did do my cardio the 21 day fix extreme off of that one here as well I probably already showed it actually so I hope you enjoyed that little clip it so my legs of tax man i need a day off just to in tomorrow's a high carb day so i'm so excited to have cards bring it on i'm back to the win I'm gonna do my dinner and I'll show you what that is alright so dinner is going to be half a cup of hundred percent egg whites and one whole egg I'm just gonna beat it a little bit and then I'm going to pour it in here this is my steak that I made earlier here's the snake that I'd made earlier I like mine pretty bloody so because when Yuri cook it it's going to cook it anyway and then so that's four ounces of top sirloin steak half a cup of egg whites one whole egg and one ounce of marble cheese it's going to make a steak omelette and that is what i am eating for dinner i'm at a card so what I get protein and fat alright that's the finished result um it is like I said just top sirloin steak one whole egg half a cup egg whites and then one ounce of cheese here it is your mat go break down on it for today so I am pretty much done for the day so right now I'm sitting at 1527 calories 63 fat 75 cards if you notice I'm over a hair and carbs so I'm over by 11 grams I'm not too worried about that because it was a leg day and I still have about 50 for protein in 78 calories left so I'm going to have a iso protein shake Karen a little bit that'll send me a little bit over in my calories for the day but it's ok I'm going to take that as a win", "MhAxL7ENWsY": "hello and welcome to lofty pursuits and public displays of confection in tallahassee florida this is greg today we're going to make some orange chocolate candy and it's going to be great for times like easter and we're making this thing using cocoa powder which solves a problem most chocolate candies to me taste like wax but this one tastes like chocolate and then it fades into orange jake added the orange oil which you saw in that little vial to the hot candy and then poured it on the candy cooling table and now he's adding colors because we need an orange component and the rest is going to be colored brown and it'll be colored brown by the cocoa powder itself if you look carefully as he adds the color you'll see that he's stirring it in and the color starts to boil this is because the color contains some water in it and the water evaporates out because the liquid is not water it's molten sugar and the molten sugar is so hot it raises the water in the food coloring past the boiling point and boils out all the water keeping the candy from being sticky the white powder is citric acid as the orange flavoring has no acid content you don't get the sour of an orange and we have to add it in retroactively and now jake just works the cocoa and the citric acid in so when he does the next step hopefully the cocoa powder won't go all over the place and truthfully it does a lot of the time [Music] anyway [Music] do and now it's time to do the break break the bars away from the candy the candy is partially cooled here the center is still hot and molten the edges where it touches the metal is cool and jake has to even out all the temperatures and he does this by folding we usually do this with dripping the candy too but the cocoa powder goes everywhere so this is more of a delicate process than we normally have to do with the candy [Music] i'll keep that [Music] [Music] [Music] um this candy is part of an assortment we make chocolate orange chocolate black cherry chocolate pomegranate chocolate strawberry and chocolate raspberry and if you want to try this candy for yourself you can get it at www.pd.net we ship to most of the world so we can get it to you almost no matter where you are jake is building the orange stripes they'll be a bit muted because they'll be hidden between the chocolate which is a dark color but hopefully it'll allow you to identify the different flavors because each of the flavors is in a different color this is part of our easter assortments we have more than one of them we have these chocolate fruit drops we're going to have some old rabbit rollers and chick rollers from the 1800s making drops in marshmallow flavor and we're working on a third one which will be an image candy assortment of all sorts of easter themes we haven't done this for a number of years but we've had enough requests asking for it we thought it would be fun so over the next couple of days or weeks you're going to see new flavors appear at our website [Music] hmm jake stretches the candy preserving the stripes and he cuts off a hunk to put through our old candy press this press will make square chip shapes and it was made in 1879 so it's older than we are by a long shot but i love a piece of machinery that was designed to work for a very long time and then did can you imagine thinking about building a machine that you're designing to last for a few hundred years you know it'll be used long after you die think about the pride and the manufacturing of this stuff and it shows in the quality of the equipment sadly there isn't much of it out there and people ask me all the time where do you get it the answer is from old candy makers who want it to be preserved and they call me up every now and again and say i've got this would you like it and i feel because of that that i'm part of this tradition that's been passed down over the centuries if you like this video please subscribe to us here on youtube and click the alerts button we currently have just over 500 000 subscribers and we're trying to get to a million and you can help us just get a half million of your friends to subscribe and we'll be right there i also do a weekly podcast called lofty pursuits that may be a little less about candy and more about my life and the intersection of art and business and life and how they really aren't different things to me of course we're on facebook instagram and twitter and we have two facebook pages public displays a confection for the candy and lofty pursuits for our retail store now it is time to break the candy into individual pieces jake does this both by dropping it and by scraping it across the table with a scraper [Music] so [Music] so thank you for watching if you ever make it to tallahassee please come for a visit you may be lucky and catch us making candy we make candy a lot we don't make candy all the time but we are open 8 a.m to 9 00 p.m right now and we serve great food and we have a full service soda fountain and this is all in the middle of our toy store see you in the next video", "VEiE_EhsW6Y": "a warning from police in Westchester County tonight about cannabis candy they discovered some during a bust last week and now one police chief wants to warn parents that these marijuana infused treats could easily be confused by kids for the real thing Marcus solace has a story police admit it wasn't the arrest of the century an alleged low-level marijuana dealer busted in Tarrytown this week but it's more than buds that were seized there's THC in liquid form attachments for e-cigarettes and what's most troubling for the police chief edibles in the form of gummy candy I feel very strong that there is no need to put it in the form of something that's very attractive all to young children Chief John barber Len says the issue isn't whether recreational use of marijuana should be legal in New York as it is in several states and most recently in Canada his concern is the marketing of certain products containing THC there's two issues here hey is it an attraction to younger people that really shouldn't be making that decision and B what is the possibility of accidental exposure the chief points to a Journal of the American Medical Association study that found in Colorado the number of children hospitalized due to accidental exposure jumped 34% so could the sugary stuff be mistaken for something harder the similarities are striking down to the same shape and coloring of the products so if I was to put this on my counter with my ten-year-old daughter home what's to say she's not gonna pick it up and he didn't think it's a gummy worm from CBS who was to say the difference a difference he says parents should be aware of", "ao4ybXb8bjw": "[Music] [Music] hi everybody thanks for watching dance ballet acro I'm back you guys really like the last video I made about flexibility foods I do contortion acrobatic circus all kinds of things like that and I also do ballet and it's really important to me to keep my body at a high level of performance on a day to day basis so that not only I can perform safely but I can perform efficiently and effectively and for a really long time throughout my life so not only am i hoping to reach people that really also need to be on the same type of performance level but I also hope to save lives this is my video on foods that will absolutely destroy your flexibility over time if you continue to eat them and I'm not just talking about adults I'm talking about even children I have coached children I have seen children that have lost their flexibility and I have known the diets that the children eat I have seen parents give their children these types of foods after school and I have seen their children struggle with behavioral issues anger issues issues where they can't focus on anything because they're distracted or they have a DD or ADHD you are feeding our pets foods that have no wheat in it no soy in it whose don't have dyes in it and it's interesting because if we are trying to protect the youngest in our generation like the babies if we're trying to protect the pregnant women the senior citizen even our pets why are we not asking questions about what we are eating on a daily base in no particular order so just bear with me this is the list of things that I've compiled that I would personally never eat or if I eat it it would be like maybe once a year because I super love it like gummy bears I really like them yes they have healthy ones out there they're really bad okay we're just gonna get started a lot of people think that health bars are healthy you can look any type of it could be a breakfast bar it could be a any type of like quick to go package thing so I'm going to show you on the back of this it has some things in here that raise a concern for me first of all these bars are very small and you can see there's 140 calories in this bar okay that's kind of a lot all right we have quite a bit of sodium in this bar 94 just a teeny little bar there pretty much about the size that it shows on the package and we also see here that has 8 grams of sugar in just a tiny little bar it also has some other things I'm going to point out to you it has soy in it soy has been connected to problems with women like their estrogen levels will be a little too high and it has also been linked to breast cancer before okay I'm not sure if it is proven but in a lot of cases doctors have said that okay we're also gonna zoom in here a little bit more it also has corn syrup and canola oil now both of these things are made when they heat up the oil or the whatever they're trying to get down to that texture they heat it up to a really high temperature so that actually in your body what happens is it it will like it will kind of like Harden okay and it becomes really difficult to digest that so that is that's obviously not good we don't want a difficult time they just think things in our body because if it's in there for a long time it's not going to it's it's gonna probably be more likely to be stored as fat we all are born with a number of fat cells and I think they said like by the time you're 20 the number that you've stored up that bar will be the number that you always have now they can shrink or they can blow up but you can also multiply the number of fat cells that you have in your after 20 so you can have a whole lot but they can shrink down but maybe that's why you see a lot of you know larger people who have even undergone surgery where their body is still maybe a little saggy I don't know that's that's my opinion you might want to look that up but it's it's an interesting note okay moving on another thing that people eat is a lot of starchy foods they might think oh you know it's fine now starches I don't recommend eating a lot of starches if you are trying to be flexible and it's a lot of that white starch that's not going to sit well with you see what else we have on here this one looks this one looks not too bad but it also has wheat and another thing with wheat is wheat has a lot of sugar in it and sugar is an inflammatory it makes your body tight it makes your body stiff it makes your body sometimes even painful for your muscles and for your joints I personally am gluten free and I did that back in 2013 to help me with contortion it was a night and day improvement and things that were really hard for me to do warming up wise is now I can do it at any point and not be sore now and it's pretty cool so gluten free I'm just gonna throw it out there if you're having trouble with mobility and you want that change go gluten free it will make a huge difference for you okay that said I'm gonna skip over to this side just because you're gluten free doesn't mean that everything that you eat is going to benefit your flexibility for example I just ate this last night and I loved eating gluten free box food but I do it very sparingly because it doesn't make me feel so good after I'm done eating it all the time we have you see over six hundred and ten milligrams of sodium so that's kind of on the high end alright we have a little bit of sugar in here my rule of thumb is I don't really like to eat any sugar in my food okay if I want to put a type of sugar flavor in I use something that comes from a leaf it's called pure stevia raw extract and I can show you that in a different video but my problem with this is the amount of sugar in it and I feel like that's the problem I don't I'm not really a calorie counter I don't feel like calories are a big deal I feel like the bigger thing that I look at personally is sugar and ingredients that could potentially have something harmful or synthetic in it again I'm gonna show you this I used to eat this a lot being gluten free because these are rice noodles I got them from the Asian grocery store pretty much there was nothing in it there's no sugars in it there's no wheat in it there's really nothing in it and that's also a problem when you don't have things with fiber in it it's going to just go pretty much stored as fat in your body right so you can have stuff like this occasionally right but if you're eating it every day I don't think it's gonna make you more flexible and it's definitely not gonna make you lean and if you're lean in certain sports like ballet or contortion or gymnastics or dance being lean even if you're like a cross-country runner it's gonna give you more mobility right and it'll also you if you're lean and strong so this isn't bad but I'm putting it out there just because there's no wheat and it doesn't mean that it has health benefits a lot of people think that yogurt is good for you we're gonna take a look into yogurt here in this tiny little cup of yogurt I want you guys to see this there is 15 grams of sugar in this little tiny thing of yogurt okay that's not good that's really not good at all and in a lot of cases the yogurt has artificial colors in it this one does not and I will get into artificial colors later on because I have some other stuff show you but if it's got this much sugar this yogurt is not helping you this is going to store as fat for you and the sugar is going to inflame your body so pretty much I've never seen a yogurt that's under $3 which I wouldn't buy it if it's over $3 that is actually gonna be beneficial for you it says it's good for your gut right here but it's probably going to add on to your gut okay um a lot of people say butters bad don't eat butter but you know it's even worse than butter I don't even think butter is bad I eat it all the time okay um but what is really bad is this stuff that's not even identifiable as butter okay this is just a bunch of synthetic spread they call it spread they can't even call it butter because it's not it's got these ingredients in it let's see it's like I don't want to be eating chemicals I don't know what it is but it doesn't seem like it's food this is just I want to talk a little bit about canned food pretty much I'm very skeptical of eating anything out of a can because it's got a long shelf life which is not going to be good if it's got a long shelf life it can last a long time on the shelf it can also last a long time in your gut than in your body that's not good you want food to go in and then come out naturally right we don't want to store anything too long also notice the amount of sodium there is in this amount of food it's wheat flour there's also high-fructose corn syrup again this is that unnatural stuff where they heat it up to a really high temperature and then it strips all of the nutrients out of it and you're just stuck with something that is this liquidy stuff that gets hard in your stomach and stores this fat because your body doesn't recognize it as food if your body doesn't recognize it as food it is not going to process it as food we're just going to inhibit your flexibility a lot of people use cooking oil they might think oh there's vegetables on it so that means it's better for me than using butter well not necess again we're looking at foods that they're not really food it's just heated up really high and it's going to turn hard in your stomach and it's not going to do a whole lot for you on here just says canola oil they can't say you know we took this and this and we heated it to a really high temperature and you know now it's just gonna turn hard in your stomach but it is going to affect your flexibility okay corn again it doesn't matter if it's from the United States or if it's from Mexico or wherever it's from you know a lot of times corn has a lot of starch in it and you know if you're gonna have something right or corn yeah you can have for you know just be careful because um even though there's no sugar in it it is a white starch so it's going to make you bulk up a little bit and the white starches have more sugar in it so if you're eating rice if you're eating corn and it's white you know go for the brown rice you know if they're going to eat it you know I'm gonna touch on bread so here's wheat bread a lot of people think oh it's healthy its wheat it's a hundred percent it even says organic on the side so that means it's a better choice than eating bunny bread white bread or whatever you know but actually you know the bread has been linked in so many studies to cause inflammation to the body to cause irritation to the joints it can cause a lot of pain and that's why more and more you're seeing more doctors recommending the elderly and the pregnant women and anybody that's been like some type of serious injury or they have brain inflammation or irritable bowel syndrome all those things or gut problems they will have them go gluten-free now if it's wrong for those people to be eating wheat because it's harming their body it's inflaming their body how is it any different for anyone else that wants a body free of inflammation I see so many people that say yes I'm going gluten-free and I'm not in pain anymore it's made me feel so much better so yes so just because it's holy then I would say throw it out the window okay jerky it has a lot of sodium in it for just 1486 this day you're getting five hundred and fifty milligrams of sodium that is a ton also notice we've got the process mechanically separated chicken or pork or whatever we've got the soy we've got corn syrup this stuff is going to irritate you really bad and just FYI the mechanically separated food that is all the parts of the animal that might have diseases on it click the tumors on it it could be the eyeballs they they could even blend up the chains around the animals nuts they're not going to go in separate everything off the animal they put all this stuff through the grinder right and they just blend it all together heat it up to really high temperature and then we eat it okay if you're not skeptical about that then you might want to be do I eat hot dogs or hamburgers yes I know it's not good for me but at the same time I know that if I'm going to be eating this stuff it's going to be not because I'm bringing it into my house it's because I'm at a church picnic it's because I am at a barbecue okay it's very rare it's not probably gonna kill me but if I brought this stuff and ate this stuff on a regular basis into my house the mechanically separated stuff it wouldn't probably make me bloated because of all the sodium in it it would probably make me fat it would probably make me in a lot of pain and who knows how much other stuff okay um this one's kind of rip sorry this one is just I'm using it as an example of an after-school snack for kids or adults they're like oh it's it's small its mini package it's good again though we've got a ton of sodium for a tiny bag of chips it's about 300 milligrams of sodium for this and I like I said I like to stick around like under 600 milligrams of sodium a day so this is like a little snack would be almost half of your a there's 4 grams of sugar in this also there are colors in this there's yellow five blue one okay these synthetic colors also again they're not natural and even some of the dyes have been linked to cancer we're just we are seeing more and more children with cancer with leukemia children that are being put on all these medications really early because they have mental problems well you have to ask why are they getting all these meth mental problems and all these diseases well the food is not really food that we're putting into their bodies we are giving them this food okay and that's kind of scary and this isn't even like the worst thing they have out there this is just the worst thing I could find around my house also not to mention in this there is milk wheat and soy my neighbor has actually several my neighbors have diabetes and so they like to eat I'm sorry they like to drink this stuff that has zero sugars in them where does it say zero sugars I guess it just doesn't mention it on here but where they get you is on the sucralose which is again a synthetic sugar there's also red forty on here which is known to be the worst out of all the colors I don't know why but they said red forty is extremely dangerous to put into your body think about all the fruit snacks the kids eat on a regular basis they have behaviors a th chicken me know okay that um and that's not good so anytime you have something that says zero grams of sugar check the back because chances are there's gonna be something like sucralose or aspartame both of those are synthetic sugars which makes it way more dangerous because with at least a natural sugar your body knows what it is your body can process it but with a synthetic sugar your body has no idea what it is so again it stores it as fat and there could be chemicals and that are harmful to your body could even be causing diseases such as cancer or hero bowel syndrome or gut problems these are things that I encounter in people a lot of the time you might think the harmful harmless snack like popcorn would be fine but again you know you're you're getting a lot of these vegetable ills and things just because it says vegetable doesn't mean that it's good it's still heated to that extremely high temperature and it's going to cause potential blockages in your stomach and it's again this stuff isn't meant for human consumption with the heated at really high temperatures your body doesn't know how to process that there is one gram of sugar in this but I'm not that concerned about one gram of sugar but it's interesting like we go through a lot of these at the house I don't personally eat these but yeah hey it's not I don't think this stuff is good it's probably better than eating a piece of candy but there are better options out there this is my unhealthy food suggestions my neighbor loves to eat fruit she eats a lot of fruit fruit in itself like grapes apples oranges those already have a lot of sugar in it so if you need something sugary get a mangos get it orange something like I get a watermelon it already is gonna have a lot of sugar and your body will react to that it's gonna feel a little stiffer but if you're gonna have something sugary or if you want something fruity that's gonna be better than this let me show you why in addition to the peaches in this can it has 19 grams of sugar added to it so there you go in addition to that it's probably also got yeah it's got the corn syrup okay that stuff is not processing in your body the right way because it's not a natural food it's a synthetic thing so it's not going to make you more flexible it might even make your situation a lot worse okay also a neighbor loves to drink a lot of juice kids drink a lot of juice it's really not good for your teeth it's not good for your body this isn't just um a serving I believe is I don't know you can tell me but there is 40 grams of sugar here it looks like eight fluid ounces I don't know is that a cup I don't know but 40 grams of sugar that is a ton of sugar and you're not even getting anything out of it you're just drinking it okay um if you need something sugary there are other options out there I can do another video on that another time but kids are drinking liquid sugar and it is definitely affecting their mental health their emotional health there are behavioral activities it's being affected by and juice is with that much sugar anytime you have sugar you're gonna have inflammation and you're gonna have a lot of pain in most cases especially if you're an adult or if you're even an athlete you know a child athlete um this is it was a tea it's an empty bottle now you might think Oh teas really healthy look at the first ingredient I'm sorry the second ingredient it is sugar look at that and look at much sugar um it's 27 grams of sugar I mean again just because it seems healthy they have a nice healthy looking picture on the front it doesn't mean anything okay it even says no artificial sweeteners but again doesn't mean anything they they still have the regular sugar and there's enough of that to make a difference okay so whether it's synthetic sugar or it's you know which is artificial or whether it's natural sugar you need to be careful about the kind in the amount that you're eating okay or drinking I have peanut butter here a lot of people love peanut butter I personally don't ever eat it if I can help it because it is not I don't recommend it at all there's four grams of sugar in this and there is hydrogenated oil in this again that's almost like the worst thing you can put in your body that syrupy stuff that just hardens in your body your body doesn't process it so it stores the fat again not a good choice definitely not a healthy snack like they say in school it's not the healthy snack energy drinks this could be Gatorade that was like Gatorade it could be Powerade they give this stuff to kids after they run or do you meets at school because gets their energy up against the sodium and their body back up it replenishes the electrolytes you can do that in other ways too you can do that without having to put all this weird ingredients into your body okay so this one I'm gonna look at it I haven't looked at this yet it looks like there's zero sugar in it there is sucralose though again so it is a artificial sugar it is a synthetic ingredient right so our body is not going to be able to process that as well so this is I would not recommend anyone drinking this also caffeine is not really good for people to be drinking or eating it causes a lot of issues so I don't personally drink any caffeine I don't eat any caffeine and I feel fine I have lots of energy I feel the people that drink caffeine are the most sluggish people I don't know why they're just like beer there's wheat and beer and sugar and wheat so I mean yeah there's not anything on the back to look out for this one but um yeah you're gonna gain weight it's gonna store his bad it's sugar who's your dream we just don't um here's a diet soda do you see anything that says diet on it just put it down especially if you're diabetic you think oh cool there's no sugar wrong there is sugar it's just hidden as a different name right aspartame can you guys see this if I can get it up to the camera right aspartame right there aspartame is a synthetic sugar if you put this into your body your body will not know how to process it so it will store it as fat so just because it says no sugar check the label because chances are we're putting something even worse the sugar and your body you're putting a synthetic ingredients and it's not going to help you in any way you can get sugar from natural things such as booze that already have tons of sugar in it like fruits right okay that was a diet soda this one I found in the back of the alley because I don't drink any soda and there's a lot of people that litter around where I live so okay we're just gonna look at this this is one serving size we have 77 grams of sugar in just this bottle that's almost like eating an entire box of sugar right that is pretty disgusting okay there's also yay another really harmful ingredient high-fructose corn syrup okay I don't know if you guys can see that but high fructose corn syrup again this stuff is harmful to your body is this harmful to your children's body it's going to be harmful to your athlete's body this stuff is toxic get it out of your life it is bad okay um also milk I need to give this back to my neighbor ASAP it's been sitting out for like as long as this video now okay um milk our bodies were not really meant to have milk in it made from cows cows calves don't even drink milk past a certain age yet we put it on our milk we put it in our recipe sorry we put milk in our cereal we put it in our recipes we put it in our dishes that we eat pretty much everything has milk in it Dairy cheese whatever this stuff is not really that good for you and it also causes inflammation so you know if you're really looking for that high performance diet if you're really looking to help your child in school cut dairy out of it there are other things that you can do to be healthy and to still stay full if you guys want me to do a video on all that I would be happy to and I'm most likely will cuz I know leave anybody hanging spirit Enon is another one it can be found in toothpaste ice cream and things is like a taking gelling agent and it is made from seaweed when it is heated up to really high temperatures it looks like this and it is known to cause cancer okay and all kinds of inflammatory issues that are really severe so carrageenan is another one this is kind of more of a healthy cereal right but let's take a look at it even though it has all these good supposed things in it it has four grams of sugar now you don't need to be starting off your day eating a lot of sugar right and it also has wheat in it and I wouldn't be putting that into your body because it's gonna make you less flexible and it's got a lot more natural sugars and they don't even list on I was helping this lady she had all of these different supplements she had a serious disease a couple of years ago and she was trying to be healthy she lived with a tremendous amount of pain in her body and she wanted me to kind of go through her supplements and vitamins and tell me if or tell her I noticed anything like that would be concerning and there was an unbelievable amount of stuff in there that she didn't even realize was in there there was food dyes synthetic colors and all these and there were lots of things with sucralose aspartame even with the ones that didn't have the synthetic sugars they had the natural sugar but there was like a ton of sugar and at like 27 grams of sugar and like a tiny little capsule so beware of supplements right these things are promoted as healthy be careful of those types of things and I hope that that will be a blessing to you guys you're having flexibility or mobility issues or health issues isn't your health worth protecting and taking some of these foods out since I've taken these foods out of my life my life has been a lot more comfortable living in my body so I hope that you will do this to you and if it's helped you leave a comment below so I hope you guys have a good day right keep your knee keeping of use-values", "9byEOvA8-0w": "hello everyone we are back yet again with another week's review it is time for a week's mini review where we help you make sense of your dispensary and in these mini reviews we take smaller size edibles this is a 200 milligram edible and review them in a smaller format than traditional instead of our 30 6120 I just come back with you guys at two hours later and let you know how we're feeling so today we are reviewing something that we have never reviewed before a new brand this is from mcclenney confections quality you can taste and feel we shall see as you said this is a 200 milligram edible handcrafted cannabis nougat and caramel dark Belgian chocolate and it's the dark sneakers I guess kind of like Snickers except dum sounding all-natural ingredients whatever that means 1 to 8 servings we're just gonna have one serving and it says at the top the portions of a portion of donations go to animal shelters in need which is great ok it's got kind of this fancy plastic packaging just sort of unique I've never seen packaging like this for an edible nicely sort of floral rounders just got this odd plastic packaging let's open it up see how difficult is this it's not so bad inside maybe the slightest slightest hint of marijuana smell but nothing that's gonna get you busted that's for sure more of a dark chocolate aroma as it says but let's go to try okay and it's pretty good you can see the nougat and caramel inside there wow that is pretty tasty it tastes kind of like a dark chocolate Snickers bar without peanuts it's good it's very good um I'm eating it refrigerated so it's a little cruel but I like it that way I could get it and suggest you try it that way so in terms of taste Wow those consumed excuse me this gets high marks for taste but the proof is in how high this is gonna give me this this family at 200 milligrams only cost me I believe seven bucks is pretty affordable but we will check back with you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling thanks for watching Leakes hi guys I'm back it has been two hours since I had the dark sneakers chocolate bar from mcclenney confections I've really enjoyed it this bad boy only costs me six bucks maybe seven bucks can't remember exactly which but it's a hell of a value good tasting really enjoy the taste no discernible marijuana taste whatsoever I'm pretty quality chocolate I think and over two hours later I'm still feeling pretty stoned so if you see a dark sneakers at a dispensary near you go ahead and grab one you're not going to be disappointed thanks so much for watching wheats we'll check you guys out on the next review", "HitC2IvnkPs": "The main causes of dementia were known to be due to family history and aging but recent researches have discovered that genetic factors and dementia aren't strongly correlated. There are certain statistical outliers that have genetic mutations that triggered the onset of dementia, but in most cases, diet and lifestyle are the ones that brought dementia. Lisa Mosconi, an American neuroscientist and nutritionist, did research on keeping the brain healthy and prevent it from diseases, through lifestyle. She discovered the relationship between brain and food, and was appalled by the false information which was prevalent online. What are the food items that we must consume for our brain, that Lisa Mosconi revealed in her book ? 1. Water If you didn't think water is one of the key nutrients, you must change your mind. Around 80% of our brain is made up of water. Water transports oxygen which is necessary for generating energy and it also maintains the structure of the brain by filling in the spaces between brain cells. What kind of water must we drink? Beer, soda, milk, coffee, sports beverage, etc. Drinking these kinds of water that contain fat, glucose, artificial sweeteners don't help. Our brain health depends on the consumption of 'hard water'. 'Purified water' is water with its chemical ingredients removed, and this signifies that all the essential minerals that the brain needs have been removed too. Since hard water in the market is expensive, it's better to filter water ourselves. This can remove harmful ingredients while leaving the good minerals. If you're drinking purified water because you are concerned about impurities it's good to supply the minerals with supplements. How much water must we consume? For adults, if you drink 8 glasses of water with a 250ml cup (2L) a day, you can enhance the brain performance by 30%. 2. Red beets Our organs, except brain, can use both fat and sugar as energy sources, but the brain only depends on a form of sugar called glucose. Although onions, turnips, and red beets aren't very sweet, they're the best natural sources of glucose. Especially, red beets are a 'natural candy'. A small red beet contains 31% of our daily requirement of glucose. Honey, grapes, and jujube fruits are great sources of glucose as well. In contrast, although sweet food such as sweets, cookies, and orange juice contain great amounts of sugar, they hardly contain the necessary glucose that our brain requires. In contemporary society, people consume too much weight-gaining sugar but rarely ever consume the kind of sugar that keeps our brain robust. We need to increase the consumption of food items that contain glucose. 3. Chia seed For our body to secrete serotonin, which controls sleep and appetite, tryptophan, an essential nutrient for the brain, is absolutely necessary. An average adult requires 5mg of tryptophan per 1kg of their weight per day. A 50kg woman would need to consume 250mg of tryptophan a day. Chia seeds contain the most tryptophan. 2 teaspoons of chia seeds contain more than 200mg of triptophane, omega-3 unsaturated fatty acids, and minerals. Unrefined cacao, oat, and spirulina are some of the best natural sources of tryptophan as well. The book called  by Dr. Lisa Mosconi, a globally prominent scholar who led & updated the recent researches of dementia, shares about her findings regarding the correlation between brain and food. This book informs in detail, the kinds of food that you should consume or avoid, and the effects of nutrients in each food on the brain. The author firmly tells people who are concerned over brain-related diseases due to their family history. Your brain in the future depends on what you consume. (The surprising science of eating for cognitive power) ", "G7yFfQX3R1s": "So now we're going to turn it over to Karmella. Yay, alright. Now I get to talk about some good stuff. Alright. (laughter) Alright. So we did carbohydrate counting about a year ago, actually, when I was looking at my old slides. So I thought we could kind of do a review, to kind of briefly introduce carbohydrate counting, help with some points that I suggest when we talk to patients about dietary modification and supporting blood sugars, and then towards the end, some new apps that are available. Ones that some of my patients are using, and then a newer one as well. That might be something for you guys to be able to think about recommending or maybe something that your own patients are using as well. There is so much confusion out there, when it comes to what should we be recommending to our patients? And also for the patient's themselves being confused with all of the new fads, and types of diets, and products that come out all the time. So my goal is to help kind of, work through some of that confusion and give you some basic suggestions and recommendations on how we can support patients with their diet. So, let me start with, what is a diabetic diet? There isn't one. Actually, with our new guidelines, we want to refer to patients who have diabetes, a person with diabetes. So when we talk about a diet that's best for blood sugar control, It's very similar to what we might recommend for somebody else, even if they do not have diabetes. Specifically, the goal is to support them with eating a healthy eating pattern, that includes all food and beverages that are within a calorie level that's appropriate for a healthy weight. And the dietary guidelines Kind of speak to more of an emphasis around calorie, nutrient- or calorie levels of the foods that we're eating for a healthy weight. So it includes vegetables, fruits, grains, especially whole grains. Try and encourage patients to eat low-fat or fat-free dairy products, having a variety of protein foods, not just red meat. And then oil, specifically healthy oils that include more of those mono-unsaturated fats. So that's what we kind of want to encourage our patients is to eat a variety of foods, an to be able to hit on all or most of these food groups, in order to get all of their nutrition in. But outside of that, a tool that we have when we're thinking about a meal plan, when we're thinking about how we want to counsel patients on what they should be eating, is we have carbohydrate counting. And this is an evidence-based way of helping patients understand what role food has on their blood sugars, and specifically carbohydrates. And the total amount of carbohydrates that a patient eats, can directly influence what their blood sugars are going to do. And that's really important because carbohydrates, although absolutely necessary for a healthy diet, you know, they're our energy source. They're what our brain uses for energy, they're what our muscles prefer to use for energy. But we want to make sure that we have a more moderate amount of carbohydrates, instead of over consuming them, which is what I see happen a lot. And carbohydrate counting, kind of fits well into diet recommendations, thinking about exercise and how consumption of carbohydrates before an exercise session, or afterwards can be helpful. And then carbohydrate counting can also be useful when we talk to patients about you know, if you do experience a hypoglycemic event, you know, how carbohydrates can be supportive and treating that. So carbohydrate counting is the best way in terms of helping patients change their diets in order to support blood sugars. So one of the first things that I start with when I talk to patients about carbohydrate counting, is helping them to understand how food impacts our blood sugars in the sense that different foods, and the amounts of the food that we're eating at a particular meal or snack, can have dramatic differences in what our blood sugars are going to do. The foods that we eat are composed up of three macronutrients You all know them, carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. And they actually all can have an impact on our blood sugars. But carbohydrates are- is the nutrient that has the most direct or highest impact on what our blood sugars do. Proteins and fats, I'm going to go back for just a second. Proteins and fats, when consumed in a large amount, can also cause blood sugars to go high as well. And that's a lot of times what we might see with patients who for example, have pizza. And they might have four or five slices of pizza. Yes, there's a lot of carbohydrates, but there's also a lot of protein and fat along with that that can all have an impact on how high their blood sugars go, and also how high or how long they stay elevated. So this is a graph, it's not very technical. It's very basic. But my point with this type of graph is to understand that when patients, or us, eat carbohydrates at meals, our blood sugars go up. Whether you have diabetes or not, when our body is digesting and breaking down carbohydrates, our blood sugars are going to increase. So we will see a postprandial rise in our blood sugars. But what we want to try to do, is not allow that blood sugar rise to go up too high and then come down in a short time period. One to two hours. So the first blue, blueish line there that you see there is for when people have a large amount of carbohydrates, and there's not much protein, perhaps there or even perhaps some fat there, that we see that those carbohydrates are quickly turned into sugar in the body. Our blood sugars go high, and then we can actually see that the blood sugars drop pretty quickly as well, after eating. And this is what people might say when they experience, I feel really tired I need to take a nap after eating, or they might actually feel like they're having a low blood sugar you know, a couple hours afterwards. So this is something that we want to kind of keep from happening. I see this happen a lot when patients either forget to take their insulin, or sometimes when people are eating 90 or 140 grams of carbohydrates in a single sitting, and that is not uncommon. I see that happened a lot, especially when we see patients consuming beverages that have sugar in them, and then also carbohydrates in the food that they're eating. So there is kind of like double dipping in a way, because we have a high consumption of carbohydrates in a single sitting. A lot the body kind of has to work through. The mixed meal, that red line is what our goal is. Yes, we're going to see some increase in blood sugars with eating, but then we would hope that that doesn't increase too high. So one to two hours after eating, keeping that below 180, maybe below 150 for some people, and then seeing that that line kind of stays with us longer. So this helps us to feel energized with food. Feeling like we can get through our day, feel like we don't need to take a nap, or feel tired, and we feel like energized. And the energy, or the nutrition from those carbohydrates are sustaining us. Okay, so as I mentioned carbohydrates are the foods that have the most dramatic effect on our blood sugars in terms of increasing them. And anytime I start this conversation with patients, I see how the patient can immediately hear, for some reason, and I'm very careful about addressing this, is that they hear, \"Okay, well blood sugar- or carbohydrates increase my blood sugars, and my goal is for that not to happen, I want my blood sugars to stay down, my doctor keeps telling me to keep my blood sugars down, I'm just going to avoid that.\" And that's not necessarily what we wanted to see happen either. As I mentioned earlier, carbohydrates are our main fuel source, so they're what we need for energy and being able to do the things that we need throughout the day. So I'm really intentional about telling patients It's not that we want to avoid carbohydrates, but that we need to understand that a moderate amount of carbohydrates is the goal. So having some at breakfast, some at lunch, some at dinner, and how many, we'll talk about that in a second, really depends upon a few things. And sometimes it's starting out with a certain amount, seeing how they respond, and then making adjustments as necessary. These are the foods that contain carbohydrates, and that's a big list, right? There's a lot of foods that have carbohydrates in it, and so most of the things that people are eating at meals, there's going to be carbohydrates. So, quick review. Breads, crackers, cereals, pasta, rice, and grains. Only the starchy vegetables to really concern ourselves with. Other things like broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, you know, they are gonna have some carbohydrates in them but such a small amount that we don't consider them in the carbohydrate group. Beans and legumes. Milk and milk products. Fruit and juices. And then all of those sweets we love and enjoy. Cakes, cookies, that sort of thing. Proteins and fats have little to none carbohydrates. So just so we're all on the same page, proteins would be meat, fish, chicken. And fats would be things like butter, cheese, oils. Peanut butter would fall into that as well. And as I mentioned, these can also increase blood sugars, but it's more if they're eaten in a large quantity, and in a high amount. So we prioritize first with patients, looking at the total amount of carbohydrates that they're eating at a single meal, and their total for the day. And then usually follow-up appointments from my perspective, going to talking about fats and protein, other suggestions, but we first prioritize carbohydrates. The more carbohydrates that you eat in a single time, tends to find higher blood sugars after meals. So there's a threshold, in a way, of how much the body can take, and for- to keep blood sugars under control. Some common challenges that I see, is that we don't fully know how many or how much we're eating at a single meal. The typical american underestimates what they eat by at least 30 percent. And that's rather significant. So a lot of people think they're eating less than they might actually be eating. The amount of carbohydrates found in food, some patients can get confused on what foods have carbohydrates, and how much? Hidden sources of carbohydrates. Another common challenge I see, is that because we talk so much about blood sugar control, keeping blood sugars low, is that that word \"blood sugar\". So sugar, is that patients instinctively look on a food label only at the sugar grams, and they forget to look at total carbohydrates. And so that sometimes is something to kind of address with them. Another challenge is that patients are not looking at the serving size listed on a food label. Which can be really different from their own personal portion size, whatever it is that they may be eating. Easily forgotten sources of carbohydrates that can actually add up rather quickly. Milk substitutes, yogurts, baked beans, tomato sauce, salad dressings, barbecue sauce, I forgot to add on here ketchup, that's another one. Orange chicken with the syrup, and the sweet sauce that's on there. Sugar free foods, protein bars. So these are some things that some patients can actually be eating, and they're not really considering impacting their blood sugars. A few other challenges that I think are just important to be aware of when we're trying to address supporting patients with diet changes, is that patients sometimes will prioritize looking in the grocery store for sugar-free products, and thinking that they don't have to worry so much about how much they're eating, or thinking if it's sugar free It's not gonna really impact my blood sugars. But I always say sugar-free doesn't mean carb free. And so sugar is a type of a carbohydrate. And helping patients understand that their total carbohydrates are what are impacting their blood sugars can be helpful, so that they're not feeling like or assuming sugar free candies is not going to impact their blood sugars. Some people responds differently to different foods. And as years and years go on, I find this more and more often happening. Because it does happen. Some people, you know, have a different response to certain foods compared to other people. So some people don't really see too much of an increase in blood sugars with oatmeal. And then I have a few people that that is, their postprandial blood sugars increase rather significantly. Even with the total amount of carbohydrates. So I think there is something to be said with that. Some patients, when they're eating new foods expect it to have the same impact on thier blood sugars as other foods they've eaten. An example is quinoa. So some people who start to eat quinoa might think it has same type of impact on their blood sugars as rice does, and it might actually be different because of the protein content in quinoa being much higher than rice. Okay. So in terms of how to carbohydrate count, we have this little bit of like a conversion factor, if you want to call it that. Where a serving of a carbohydrate food contains 15 grams of carbohydrates. Now, the reason why this is such a helpful thing to understand, is because some foods have a lot more volume. Like you can eat more cups for example, of that food before it contains a total of 15 grams of carbohydrates, and other foods not so much. So the example I give, three cups of popped popcorn has 15 grams of carbohydrates in it. Two tablespoons of raisins has the same carbohydrates, 15 grams. So reading labels is really helpful to look at grams of carbohydrates. And that's often how I kind of counsel patients is learn carbohydrate grams versus servings, but when you can give something like that as a comparison, it kind of helps people to understand \"oh, so you know, I can't equate different foods being the same volume amount, and having the same amount of carbohydrates.\" Another example, a 1 ounce slice of bread is 15 grams of carbohydrates versus a quarter of a large baked potato is 15 grams of carbohydrates. So again, volume wise, that's a lot different. That can be different. One medium piece of fruit is 15 grams of carbohydrates. So a medium piece of fruit, you kind of want to imagine like the size of a tennis ball is 15 grams of carbohydrates. Juice, it's 4 ounces of juice is 15 grams of carbohydrates. I compare a lot of times milk and juice. So 8 ounces of milk is about 15 grams of carbohydrates, 4 ounces of juice. And this is where patients can kind of have some flexibility in terms of their own personal preferences. You know, some may say \"I really want my juice in the morning time so I know that if I'm gonna have juice, I'm gonna have to be really diligent about measuring out 4 ounces, or if I want 8 ounces, I have to count that as 30 grams of carbohydrates, and then I might not have much more left over for my toast, and my oatmeal, and cereal and anything else that I may want.\" But they can make that choice if that's what they want. But to understand volume differences can be really helpful for guiding choices. This is a picture of the new label. Last year we were told that this was going to be mandated by manufacturers starting in July 2018. And now there's some discussion about perhaps that being delayed. But I'm already actually seeing it on some of our products, is this new food label. There are a lot of changes that are being made. And I think there's some good changes on here, but specifically for us when we talk about carbohydrates, is that you can see the total carbohydrate row here. And then listed below is dietary fiber, which we've always had. Total sugars, which we've had. And then there's going to be this new one, which is added sugar. I mean I think to be honest, It's a good thing. The reason I like that is that it's going to give some accountability to manufacturers. Because how much they put- how much sugar that they add to their breads, or to their cereals, is that they're gonna have to actually disclose that. So added sugars is what the manufacturers specifically added to their product. And so patients can use this to help kind of decide maybe brand to brand what's maybe a better choice for them. But this does not remove the overall intention of looking at a food label, which is, it's the total carbohydrates that impact our blood sugars. And so that's what they need to look at when they look at a food label. And again, a lot of times they're only looking at sugars or sometimes what they may do, is they may think that fiber and sugars is not included in that total carbohydrate row, and so some people will add that. And so I do make sure it's clear for patients to understand that those numbers below the total carbohydrate row are already included. So really, the only thing they need to look at outside of the serving size, is the total carbohydrate grams listed on a food label. And again, the only time I might find is compare Oroweat Bread to Dave's Killer Bread, how much added sugar do each of them have and then that can maybe help guide choices. But other than that, it;s the total carbohydrates. Okay. How much should people be eating? How much should we have carbohydrates at each meal and snack? Technically, it depends on a lot of things. It depends upon a patient's weight, and what their goals are, what their activity levels look like, you know, how active are they at work? Are they sitting for most of the day? What medications that they're on, and how far away are we at  goal, in terms of their blood sugar control, that can sometimes help to kind of decide. But for our sake here today, a really good starting point for many people is to have them start with around 45 to 60 grams of carbohydrates at each meal. So if some some people want to start there and then we have them occasionally check postprandial blood sugars one to two hours after eating, and we can see where they are, we can make some adjustments where we can say okay, well you can technically have a little bit more if you're really hungry, and you're finding that a lot less and you typically eat, or remind you that your blood sugars are still quite not where we want them to be after meals, so let's reduce that a little bit. I generally don't recommend below 30 grams of carbohydrates at a meal. I think that's too low if we go below that, and again, carbohydrates give us a lot of nutrition, energy, and fuel for for ourselves. So, I would not recommend below 30. So somewhere between 45 to 60 grams of carbohydrates per meal per meal. Not per day. Sometimes patients get confused with that. They hear \"per day\", but I think it's good to be clear, 45 to 60 per meal. And if you want to think about snacks, I suggest perhaps 15 to 30 grams of carbohydrates per snack. If the patient likes snacks, they find that's helpful for them to have something between meals, so they don't overeat carbohydrates or meals. That is, as I mentioned earlier, It's not uncommon for me to see three times this amount of carbohydrates in a single sitting. Especially when eating out, especially when eating out. For some patients, this could be a significantly less than what they're doing now. And if that's the case, I suggest just slowly decreasing per meal until they feel a little bit comfortable with this. Okay lastly before we get into the apps, for some people carb counting is overwhelming. They don't like it. They're not gonna do it. So instead, this is a great suggestion for visual people. When they're sitting down and have a plate in front of them is that half of their plate is those non starchy vegetables. So carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, or lettuce mushrooms, onions, any of those things. And then the other half of the plate is divided into quarters, one being the meats or alternative soy products perhaps, and then the other quarter is where those carbohydrates are. So that's going to be the potatoes, or the rice, or the yogurt, or fruit for example. So that can be just a way of helping the when you first call it \"anchor your plate\" with those non-starchy vegetables, is that they're just not gonna have that much more room left on that plate for those carbohydrates. So if they're not willing to carb count, and you want to help them to reduce their total carbohydrates if they're eating any (inaudible), this is something that you could potentially help them to kind of visually see. Myplate.gov has posters that helped this, it's a little bit more colorful, that could be also useful for patients as well. One thing I didn't mention earlier, is that anytime we start to carb count for patients I mean they're kind of grasping it, and they're counting them, and they're trying to stay within their goal, is that some of them may experience some hypoglycemia. Especially if we haven't adjusted their insulin. And we don't ever want a patient to have to cover their insulin. So eat more carbohydrates so they don't go low. Instead, we would want to work with them on reducing their insulin with the healthy carbohydrate level and helping them to not have a low blood sugar. So, that can sometimes happen. And then unfortunately if you're not aware of that or giving the patient a heads-up, that as we slowly decrease their carbohydrates, we may see that some of them may say \"Forget this. I'm just gonna eat more because I'm going to low.\" So that's something else to think about. Okay, so apps. So we've talked about MyFitnessPal before and Calorie King, and I just wanted to mention them again because I really do like these apps. And then the three new ones I have today are called One Drop, My Sugr, and then Glucose Buddy. So MyFitnessPal, there is an online and an app version. The free version is what most of my patients use. And then the premium version, I've got like three people that use it. Which you just get a little bit more reporting functions and information. But I certainly don't think it's necessary. It's rated really pretty well. There's a lot in the database that they already have within this. A program which is really great for many patients. It's not really meant or set up for tracking blood sugars or medications, though. There is one note section where technically I have had patients indicate what the blood sugars are, and  what they're taking for medications, but there's no reporting function from that aspect, and more useful for counting calories, carbohydrates, proteins, fats. Okay. Calorie King, we've mentioned this before. There's that book that I absolutely love, many of my patients love it. It's super small, in a sense that it can fit in purses or in the car. And there's so much information, in terms of fast food places, restaurants, just general food items, where calorie, fat grams, and carbohydrate grams are included in this book. So it's a great reference book. And there is also an online version as well. And an app available that it does allow for tracking blood sugars as well as carbohydrate intake. So that's something that might be good to consider for some people. Okay. There we go. So now we have a newer app Which is called One Drop. It is available for free for Apple and Android devices. It has a rating of 4.5 stars, but it's only been out for a short time here, so I wouldn't be surprised if we see this go up. Because, not to bias everybody, but I really like this one. This one was really fun. And I'll show you some screenshots here in a second, But what they actually did- They did a clinical trial, and they did two types of things. So the first one is that they just kind of monitored those who use the app, in terms of blood sugar control. And they found that those who were getting into it throughout the week, whether that was just once a day or actually a few times a day, found that their hemoglobin A1C went from 8.2 to 7.2 in two months time. So a 1% drop, I think is rather significant in a two month time period. But anytime patients have something that they get information from, reinforces what they should be doing, I think that motivates patients. And apps, I think are like the future. I think we're gonna see more and more of these things available for for patients. They then also had what they called their \"Experts Program\", and it's available at cost. And I think it's $20. I have a slide here in just a second, but patients can actually get coaching support from a certified diabetes educator. And in four weeks they found that average blood sugars went from 185 to 158. So it's using the app, and then getting some support within that app, with suggestions and just accountability to carb counting, and exercise, and taking medications, and monitoring blood sugars. So, it is a feature within this, which is interesting. Within the app, so you can see on that first screenshot you see that drop so they can check blood sugars, they can enter in that blue one, is their medications. Basal-bolus and oral medications. They can then measure or add in what they're eating, and then the last one, that orange one is for exercise. So this app allows you to do all four things. The middle screenshot you can see here, is that they just tap that middle circle which is this one, is the pink one or somewhat red, that allows them ti put their blood sugars in, and then you can actually get some feedback that when their blood sugars are entered, this white dot shows them if it's somewhat elevated or low. So if it were a 300 blood sugar it's going to come around a little bit more. So visually speaking, it helps people to kind of see perhaps how high their blood sugars are in a different way, outside of like an absolute number. I know it's kind of hard to see, but down a little bit lower it allows people to kind of rate themselves on how stressed out they are, how their energy levels are, happiness and confidence, or you know, their care of their blood sugars. So, there's added features within that. And then this is a screen shot I know it's a little bit overwhelming, but I played around with it and what I did is I entered in like for a day, a random blood sugar number, insulin, I entered in Lantus and Novolog, they actually have a list of medications entered, so people just have to search for that. So I start typing Lantus, find it, and so they can actually account for what types of medications they have in there. And then at the top there, is that it will average out for the day what their blood sugars are. That 100% is how much of their blood sugars is above goal. So this is 100% of blood sugars being above goal, and that 0% is below goal. And you can actually modify that, specifically within the app what your goals are, high and low with the range. And then keeps track of the total units of insulin that has been entered into the app. So you can see here, at 74% bolus and then 26% basal. And then you see it tracks carbohydrates. You just- you can either enter in directly a certain amount of carbohydrates, or you can search for the individual foods being consumed. So I searched pizza, and English muffins, and bananas and it had a lot of that already in there, so then it will also track calories which I think is really great as well. And then also for steps, and then activity time. Great color coordination, in my opinion. Really easy to see that. Some additional features within this app is there's a- they call them \"food moments\", so there are recipe suggestions and with carbohydrate count information. This okay- so it's $19.95, is what it would cost to get that experts program, access to the CDE. They have their own glucometer, where when you're testing blood sugars is that, that information is automatically uploaded within the app. So this program have a lot of features. The last feature of this that I wanted to show you guys, is that it has a reporting function within the free version, which I think is kind of nice. And so it just does it in a different way, that you can actually send these reports to- the patient you can send it to you. So they can email it to you, or whoever that they want to. This is a different one that they have available. And then, I'm not sure that you would consider this a good thing or a bad thing, but when I emailed this to myself, and then when I opened up my email and clicked on the link, that brought this to view within my Google pages, is that it then alerted me on my phone that somebody was looking at it. So it lets them know that whenever anybody is looking at the reports that they send, they're looking at it. But this is, I think a really easy graph. Good color coordination, again. It gives a lot of good information with how many times are they monitoring their blood sugars, how much in, below, or above range are they, what their insulin is, and how many units have they taken, and then their carbohydrates. So that's One Drop. The other the other one is My Sugr. So it's almost like this little sugar monster that you either make happy or you make sad, depending upon what your blood sugars are, or how many carbohydrates that you're eating. This was started back in 2007 in Austria, so it's been around quite a long time and it's the rating of 4.7 stars. For additional cost, you can get PDF reports as well as access to a CDE as well. So that has the same feature in here. Here are some screen shots. You can kind of see on the left-hand side, entering a few things I've got ten points so far. Positive points, because average blood sugars, deviation from that, and whatever carbohydrates that you've entered. But there's some good color coordination. And when you're entering in your carbohydrates you can select breakfast, lunch, dinner. You can select how you feel, you can select if you're having a low blood sugar, and it keeps track of that information. I have one patient that uses this and she really likes it. This could perhaps be used for somebody who might be wanting some fun with the type of an app because again you're, you're trying to make that little sugar monster happy. But these screenshots are just kind of features that you can add in. Again, your ranges, you can put in reminders for when you need to take your Lantus, or when you need to take your your Novolog. And you can even specifically enter in what your carb to insulin ratios are within that app. So it's kind of already in there for you. So a lot of like, individualization that can happen within this type of an app that allow people to kind of, set it up for them. This is a whole day entered in, so a little bit different type of a screenshot here. But essentially similar information in terms of average blood sugars, how many highs and low blood sugars do they have entered, and then what's the carbohydrates. I couldn't report- or I couldn't print, or show you guys the PDF reports because that only comes within the paid version. And I didn't pay for it. So I was only using the free version. But that's what apparently it looks like, so I pulled from their website. Okay, the last one, since we have a few more minutes, Glucose Buddy. So this is actually an app that's been rated number one for the last nine years, in terms of diabetes management apps out there. I also really like this app. So apparently, I could only find that it was used for iOS devices, so I could be wrong about that, but when trying to search and see, I have an iPhone, so I was able to use it But I don't, I can't, couldn't tell if it could be used for Android devices. One thing that's a little bit different about this app, that I thought could be a positive for some patients who don't always remember what medications that they're on, is that they can- you can see that little like, grayed out area \"name your medication\". So they can just write in there, or type in there I should say, what medications that they're on. So it's not them trying to find the right one It's them being able to just put it in themselves. So that could be a good or a bad thing. But, you can add in what medications again, you're taking, you can add in carbohydrate goals, you can enter in your blood sugars, you can enter in just carbohydrate value of a label that you've eaten, or you can add in individual foods that you're eating, as well. On the left-hand side though, that screenshot there, is that you can add in your blood sugars, I know it's not really great here, you can add in your A1C, your medications, I can't tell what that- blood pressure, you can add in your carbohydrates or calories, you can add in your weight, and activity. So it seems to be a little bit more inclusive in terms of what you can get. That middle screen shot is not that great. So let's go to that far right one, there we go. So this is where I was entering in blood sugars, insulin, and then carbohydrates. And so it does something similar to One Drop, which is great in my opinion, is it gets that top panel banner there which kind of shows for you what your average blood sugars are, how much insulin have you taken, what your carbohydrates look like, you can see I'm already at 500 grams of carbohydrates this day. And then what the activity is, as well. Great color coordination, I think easy to see. And navigation, I think within all of these apps, are pretty easy to kind of use, just to play around with. It does give some, they call it \"insights\" in terms of like, reports that you can get for averages, and insulins, and carbohydrates. And it can then on the far right side, also do for the week. So you can kind of see not just day to day, but then in a week's time on the last seven days, some of the information that's there. So those are the three that I played around with, and I think all of them were pretty good. Some that were- had other features that others didn't, but I think all of them were pretty good in terms of ease to use and color and things that you could enter in. But I was curious if anybody had any other apps that they used, or have patients that use, that they've liked. Maybe you guys could share with us? Yeah! I've got- you mentioned My Fitness Pal, I think it's called. I've got a number of people who use that. Awesome. Very good. (silence) Anybody else? Quick question not regarding the apps, but can you comment a little bit, what do you recommend your diabetic patients, as well as like overweight children regarding new like sodas, you know, with low calories, or a Coke Zero, and Crystal Light, and all these like new things out on the market? Sure, okay. So yeah, I mean some of the items in our food system where more calories and sugar are coming from, in our diet, are sugar-sweetened beverages. So it's a good area to address for a lot of patients, including those that are younger. So we kind of work on some of those long term healthy eating habits, and get ahead of it, or address it sooner. So I encourage patients to first switch to non calorie beverages. So as you mentioned Crystal Lights, those ice drinks that are available, that are calorie free, that are carbonated. But I also really encourage patients to try water. And to really understand that water is really important for us, and that it takes time to get used to it. People who are used to drinking a lot of sugar-sweetened beverages, water, it's gonna taste terrible to them and they're not going to like it and they're just non going to drink it. So one way of helping them, is that I'll encourage that they either dilute whatever it is that they're drinking, that has calories in it. And slowly kind of reduce that, especially when it comes to juice. Diluting it. Or, a lot of times I'm seeing more and more people being open and liking fruit infused water. So whether they are throwing in frozen strawberries or frozen pineapple into their water, or you can actually get some of those more formal water bottles that have like, that insert. But that would be what I would suggest to help patients. But the other thing is can patients, can children have you know, some of these non-nutritive sweeteners using Coke Zero using Crystal Light, some of those those sweeteners that we have available? And as long as they're not consuming, I mean the high recommendation for safety, for like aspartame, Splenda, Sweet and Low, it amounts to a high enough level that as long as we're not encouraging all beverages being diet sodas or Crystal Light, I think they can have one a day. So the high level is a six-pack of diet soda a day before we start to reach levels that are probably unsafe for those non-nutritive sweeteners. So again, I think one a day would be fine, but I think we should talk to them about drinking water. And we've got to get used to it somehow, and it's something that's going to help them long-term. And that it's okay if it's something that they don't particularly like in the beginning, but it takes time, so. Does that help? Yes. Thank you. Yeah, of course. I have a question over here. Yeah! So, my question is in regards to hypoglycemia treatment. So like, if a patient experiences a hypoglycemic event, you know, and they follow the rule of fifteen and try to correct it, do you recommend, you know, patients eating like, a high-fat meal after they treat they hypo to kind of help prevent, to drop- you know, prevent whatever it is that dropped off their sugars? Or do you just recommend they just eat something? What do you- What are your thoughts on- What do you guys do? Great question, great question. So a lot of times, what we use for many patients is our fifteen-fifteen rule. Is if they have a blood sugar and that's technically low, or they're not feeling the greatest, is to have 15 grams of carbohydrates after they've measured what their blood sugar is. What you know, making sure that it's it's below a certain number, below 70, or 80 or 70. Eat 15 grams of carbohydrates, wait 15 minutes, and check it again. Make sure that it's coming back up. As long as it's come back up, I am okay with telling patients to have a little bit of lean protein. So maybe a string cheese, maybe a couple slices of some meat, and, but it's a small amount or they should go have their meal if it's time to eat a meal. So I don't necessarily recommend a high-fat specific item. I usually recommend that, if they have in the past struggled with after they've gotten it back up, and it doesn't stay up, is to then add in a lean protein to go along with it. But generally speaking, in my experience many patients struggle with this. And they over consume carbohydrates because they feel so terrible. And so, it's talking through some strategies on how to help them really stick to those 15 grams of carbohydrates so they're not over consuming, because now we're just, we're on that roller coaster all day long, of highs and lows. And a soda, for example, is often one that I see a lot of patients will use. They'll get a 20 ounce regular soda, they'll drink from it until they feel better, and then they go high. So I counselled them a lot on, what does 15 grams look like? Wait 15 minutes, check again, see where they're at, and then they could eat a lean protein if they needed to. But I don't always recommend it, if they can overdo it. Okay, any other questions before we finish up for today? Alright, thank you so much everyone. Thanks, see you next month.", "s6wv6AtOTbo": "Hello and welcome to lofty pursuits in\npublic displays the confection in Tallahassee Florida Greg is doing the narration and Jake is doing the subtitles. The candy I'm going to be making today is  sugar free Sour cherry. As I pour the hot candy onto the table let me tell you how unbelievably hot it is. This is hotter than sugar by 25 degrees F (4C). It does not seem like a lot , but ti is. \n The candy is been flavored with a natural cherry oil. Unlike most cherry candy, this does not taste like cough syrup. Also it is a great flavor for masking the flavor of the sugar free part of  the candy. I thought there would be two parts of The flavor to cover.The front of mouth taste, and that I covered with the cherry oil Then the back of mount flavor I thought I could cover mostly with a good sour. To do that I added this citric acid. It's trickier to add acid to isomalt because everything is hotter. And this citric acid while harder to add  gives this candy a crisp sour tart flavor just like you'd\nexpect from a sour cherry. Sour Cherry isan American tradition it's the most common cherry here in North America and it's known for being made into\ncherry pies and things like that but its history is ancient it was first discovered by Roman soldiers when they were on duty near the Black Sea. They  found this cherry\ngrowing in towns along the Black Sea and they brought it back\nto Rome and eventually the cherry was called the Montmorency cherry. It was  named\nafter a region of France even though it didn't come from that region in France. It was just the flavor I was going for and I'm happy how it came out. This candy is sugar-free, and as such it's not made of sugar it's\nmade of isomalt. Isomalt is a substitute a type of sugar alcohol and is a sugar substitue used primarily for its sugar like properties it has little or no impact on\nblood sugar levels and it does not stimulate the release of insulin so\npeople who aren't supposed to eat high levels of sugar this candy is good for\nisomalt is also about 1/2 the sweetness of sugar so to tweak the sweetness up a\nbit to match what we expect a hard candy to taste like we had a little bit of\nsucralose and we don't need to add much sucralose because sucralose is between\n300 and 1000 times as sweet as sugar. Since I only needed a tiny amount I used a very accurate scientific scale to get the proportions rights. So we build on the sweetness of the isomalt with the sucralose and we count on the isomalt to behave like what you expect hard candy to behave like. Neither of these mate rials promote tooth decay or effects insulin levels. I heard from so many of you that you wanted to try our candy by could not. iI's a little different to work\nwith than regular sugar it's a lot hotter when I pour it and it also sort\nof behaves more like plastic than clay so I have to get the temperature just\nright now that it's adjusted we're gonna cut off pieces and we're gonna feed it\nthrough our drop roller this little machine was made in the late 1870s and\nthis particular machine was owned by the A Cincinnati candy company.

roller a machine that makes drops that was made in 1871 in Philadelphia Pennsylvania we're gonna use this machine today to make some hard candy and the hard candy is a bit of an experiment in color and flavor this is about the fourth batch of the day and this is what I like to make experimental candy because the machine while it's a little stained with food coloring from the previous batches is also just right for making candy easily there is an old saying that you taste food with your eyes long before you taste it with your mouth the sight of a food or a color triggers a response which brings on the flavor and leads you to expectations and this video is about those expectations and expectations also take place culturally as we've discussed in other videos the United States sees purple as the flavor of the grape specifically the concord grape and europe sees the purple flavor and candy as the flavor for black currant so now that my hot sugars are 310 degrees i pour it out on my candy cooling table and I ask what flavor is this I mean it's not clear it could be anything and that's what this video is kind of about wondering what the visuals which you can see on the other side of the internet are and how they compare to the flavors which are on my side of the video camera these associations are well known by the people who make food and prepare food for you walk down the aisles of any supermarket and you will see the tomato sauce mostly in red and something that has blueberry in it will have a splash of blue the color is there to key you to what you can't see and can't taste outside the packaging and you are tasting with your eyes and this is okay it's because it's the way we were programmed if you think about it we must have developed food skills before we even developed language skills as a people because if you didn't know when the food was ripe or when it was dangerous to eat you wouldn't be able to you know process the nutrients you made so when something feels soft and even versus lumpy or picky when something smells nice or something looks nice you have expectations and the expectations are programmed into us earlier this year with a laundry detergent tablet we can see these expectations going the wrong way and I think this is a video about breaking those expectations let me give you an example there's something called the strip effect you see you can't taste or smell the candy across the internet but you can see colors and words just fine so let's have some fun with them and then try to apply that to candy so let me demonstrate how you're programmed with colors now I'm going to display some colors on the screen and as I display them save the color out loud for instance we're starting with orange will then do red green yellow blue pink red orange and you'll see the speed is pretty consistent when you do this remember we're saying the colors we don't really care about the words but here the words and the colors will match I want you to read these out loud left-to-right the colors that these words are we'll get back to the Stroop effect in a few moments but we're gonna go play with the hot sugar now and it's cooled off to a great consistency it's sort of the consistency of silly putty or playdough we're gonna put it through these brass rollers that'll cool it off a little bit and make it keep its shape if you'll notice we're making lots of drop rolled round candy here and an opaque red and that opaque red is gonna be important in a moment so now to get at what I'm demonstrating when I show you this next card read out loud the colors not the words but the colors and see if the delay is a little longer than last time [Music] if you did this experiment correctly and just read the colors you'll find the delay going on between when you see it and when you can say it because your body's trying to say or your brain is trying to say the word that's printed not the color of the word and flavors are like this too if you try a flavor that is red and it's colored blue unless you've been trained to recognize that like we have with blue raspberry you're not gonna end up saying or tasting in this case the flavor and that's what our experiment today is we're making drops in bunches of flavors but they're all gonna be the same color and one of the meeting I told everybody what we're gonna do they looked at me and almost as once they said that's madness and I realized our flavor assortment now had a name and madness it is and we're going to pack these candies randomly mix together so you should get some of all the flavors but what flavors some of them are going to be normal do you expect black berry in pink or would you expect an apple in pink we might have butter we're looking at doing a salty flavor and a hot flavor with chili pepper in it and other flavors with this and the fun part is we're gonna be replacing flavors as we run out so we're never quite gonna know what's in the assortment but there's always gonna be six or seven flavors I'm gonna aim for a salty and a sweetness sour and some other things in here and you're gonna have to guess the flavors it's an assortment of fun and love it's sort of combining spin the bottle and Russian Roulette and will give you hints online as we put them up so pay attention when you order but they're gonna change and we're gonna throw some wild cards into because you know April first is coming up and we're gonna have some fun with this candy thanks for watching our video if you liked it you can subscribe to us here on YouTube

In many contexts, potato refers to the edible\ntuber, but it can also refer to the plant itself. Common or slang terms include tater, tattie\nand spud. Potatoes were introduced to Europe in the\nsecond half of the 16th century by the Spanish. Today they are a staple food in many parts\nof the world and an integral part of much of the world's food supply. As of 2014, potatoes were the world's fourth-largest\nfood crop after maize (corn), wheat, and rice.Wild potato species can be found throughout the\nAmericas, from the United States to southern Chile. The potato was originally believed to have\nbeen domesticated independently in multiple locations, but later genetic testing of the\nwide variety of cultivars and wild species traced a single origin for potatoes. In the area of present-day southern Peru and\nextreme northwestern Bolivia, from a species in the Solanum brevicaule complex, potatoes\nwere domesticated approximately 7,000\u201310,000 years ago. In the Andes region of South America, where\nthe species is indigenous, some close relatives of the potato are cultivated. Following millennia of selective breeding,\nthere are now over 1,000 different types of potatoes. Over 99% of presently cultivated potatoes\nworldwide descended from varieties that originated in the lowlands of south-central Chile, which\nhave displaced formerly popular varieties from the Andes.The importance of the potato\nas a food source and culinary ingredient varies by region and is still changing. It remains an essential crop in Europe, especially\neastern and central Europe, where per capita production is still the highest in the world,\nwhile the most rapid expansion in production over the past few decades has occurred in\nsouthern and eastern Asia, with China and India leading the world in overall production\nas of 2014. Being a nightshade similar to tomatoes, the\nvegetative and fruiting parts of the potato contain the toxin solanine and are not fit\nfor human consumption. Normal potato tubers that have been grown\nand stored properly produce glycoalkaloids in amounts small enough to be negligible to\nhuman health, but if green sections of the plant (namely sprouts and skins) are exposed\nto light, the tuber can accumulate a high enough concentration of glycoalkaloids to\naffect human health. == Etymology ==\nThe English word potato comes from Spanish patata (the name used in Spain). The Spanish Royal Academy says the Spanish\nword is a hybrid of the Ta\u00edno batata (sweet potato) and the Quechua papa (potato). The name originally referred to the sweet\npotato although the two plants are not closely related. The 16th-century English herbalist John Gerard\nreferred to sweet potatoes as \"common potatoes\", and used the terms \"bastard potatoes\" and\n\"Virginia potatoes\" for the species we now call \"potato\". In many of the chronicles detailing agriculture\nand plants, no distinction is made between the two. Potatoes are occasionally referred to as \"Irish\npotatoes\" or \"white potatoes\" in the United States, to distinguish them from sweet potatoes.The\nname spud for a small potato comes from the digging of soil (or a hole) prior to the planting\nof potatoes. The word has an unknown origin and was originally\n(c. 1440) used as a term for a short knife or dagger, probably related to the Latin \"spad-\"\na word root meaning \"sword\"; cf. Spanish \"espada\", English \"spade\" and \"spadroon\". It subsequently transferred over to a variety\nof digging tools. Around 1845, the name transferred to the tuber\nitself, the first record of this usage being in New Zealand English. The origin of the word \"spud\" has erroneously\nbeen attributed to an 18th-century activist group dedicated to keeping the potato out\nof Britain, calling itself The Society for the Prevention of Unwholesome Diet (S.P.U.D.). It was Mario Pei's 1949 The Story of Language\nthat can be blamed for the word's false origin. Pei writes, \"the potato, for its part, was\nin disrepute some centuries ago. Some Englishmen who did not fancy potatoes\nformed a Society for the Prevention of Unwholesome Diet. The initials of the main words in this title\ngave rise to spud.\" Like most other pre-20th century acronymic\norigins, this is false, and there is no evidence that a Society for the Prevention of Unwholesome\nDiet ever existed. == Characteristics == Potato plants are herbaceous perennials that\ngrow about 60 cm (24 in) high, depending on variety, with the leaves dying back after\nflowering, fruiting and tuber formation. They bear white, pink, red, blue, or purple\nflowers with yellow stamens. In general, the tubers of varieties with white\nflowers have white skins, while those of varieties with colored flowers tend to have pinkish\nskins. Potatoes are mostly cross-pollinated by insects\nsuch as bumblebees, which carry pollen from other potato plants, though a substantial\namount of self-fertilizing occurs as well. Tubers form in response to decreasing day\nlength, although this tendency has been minimized in commercial varieties.After flowering, potato\nplants produce small green fruits that resemble green cherry tomatoes, each containing about\n300 seeds. Like all parts of the plant except the tubers,\nthe fruit contain the toxic alkaloid solanine and are therefore unsuitable for consumption. All new potato varieties are grown from seeds,\nalso called \"true potato seed\", \"TPS\" or \"botanical seed\" to distinguish it from seed tubers. New varieties grown from seed can be propagated\nvegetatively by planting tubers, pieces of tubers cut to include at least one or two\neyes, or cuttings, a practice used in greenhouses for the production of healthy seed tubers. Plants propagated from tubers are clones of\nthe parent, whereas those propagated from seed produce a range of different varieties. == Genetics ==\nThere are about 5,000 potato varieties worldwide. Three thousand of them are found in the Andes\nalone, mainly in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile, and Colombia. They belong to eight or nine species, depending\non the taxonomic school. Apart from the 5,000 cultivated varieties,\nthere are about 200 wild species and subspecies, many of which can be cross-bred with cultivated\nvarieties. Cross-breeding has been done repeatedly to\ntransfer resistances to certain pests and diseases from the gene pool of wild species\nto the gene pool of cultivated potato species. Genetically modified varieties have met public\nresistance in the United States and in the European Union. The major species grown worldwide is Solanum\ntuberosum (a tetraploid with 48 chromosomes), and modern varieties of this species are the\nmost widely cultivated. There are also four diploid species (with\n24 chromosomes): S. stenotomum, S. phureja, S. goniocalyx, and S. ajanhuiri. There are two triploid species (with 36 chromosomes):\nS. chaucha and S. juzepczukii. There is one pentaploid cultivated species\n(with 60 chromosomes): S. curtilobum. There are two major subspecies of Solanum\ntuberosum: andigena, or Andean; and tuberosum, or Chilean. The Andean potato is adapted to the short-day\nconditions prevalent in the mountainous equatorial and tropical regions where it originated;\nthe Chilean potato, however, native to the Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago, is adapted to the long-day\nconditions prevalent in the higher latitude region of southern Chile. The International Potato Center, based in\nLima, Peru, holds an ISO-accredited collection of potato germplasm. The international Potato Genome Sequencing\nConsortium announced in 2009 that they had achieved a draft sequence of the potato genome. The potato genome contains 12 chromosomes\nand 860 million base pairs, making it a medium-sized plant genome. More than 99 percent of all current varieties\nof potatoes currently grown are direct descendants of a subspecies that once grew in the lowlands\nof south-central Chile. Nonetheless, genetic testing of the wide variety\nof cultivars and wild species affirms that all potato subspecies derive from a single\norigin in the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme Northwestern Bolivia (from\na species in the Solanum brevicaule complex). The wild Crop Wild Relatives Prebreeding project\nencourages the use of wild relatives in breeding programs. Enriching and preserving the gene bank collection\nto make potatoes adaptive to diverse environmental conditions is seen as a pressing issue due\nto climate change.Most modern potatoes grown in North America arrived through European\nsettlement and not independently from the South American sources, although at least\none wild potato species, Solanum fendleri, naturally ranges from Peru into Texas, where\nit is used in breeding for resistance to a nematode species that attacks cultivated potatoes. A secondary center of genetic variability\nof the potato is Mexico, where important wild species that have been used extensively in\nmodern breeding are found, such as the hexaploid Solanum demissum, as a source of resistance\nto the devastating late blight disease. Another relative native to this region, Solanum\nbulbocastanum, has been used to genetically engineer the potato to resist potato blight.Potatoes\nyield abundantly with little effort, and adapt readily to diverse climates as long as the\nclimate is cool and moist enough for the plants to gather sufficient water from the soil to\nform the starchy tubers. Potatoes do not keep very well in storage\nand are vulnerable to moulds that feed on the stored tubers and quickly turn them rotten,\nwhereas crops such as grain can be stored for several years with a low risk of rot. The yield of Calories per acre (about 9.2\nmillion) is higher than that of maize (7.5 million), rice (7.4 million), wheat (3 million),\nor soybean (2.8 million). === Varieties ===\nThere are close to 4,000 varieties of potato including common commercial varieties, each\nof which has specific agricultural or culinary attributes. Around 80 varieties are commercially available\nin the UK. In general, varieties are categorized into\na few main groups based on common characteristics, such as russet potatoes (rough brown skin),\nred potatoes, white potatoes, yellow potatoes (also called Yukon potatoes) and purple potatoes. For culinary purposes, varieties are often\ndifferentiated by their waxiness: floury or mealy baking potatoes have more starch (20\u201322%)\nthan waxy boiling potatoes (16\u201318%). The distinction may also arise from variation\nin the comparative ratio of two different potato starch compounds: amylose and amylopectin. Amylose, a long-chain molecule, diffuses from\nthe starch granule when cooked in water, and lends itself to dishes where the potato is\nmashed. Varieties that contain a slightly higher amylopectin\ncontent, which is a highly branched molecule, help the potato retain its shape after being\nboiled in water. Potatoes that are good for making potato chips\nor potato crisps are sometimes called \"chipping potatoes\", which means they meet the basic\nrequirements of similar varietal characteristics, being firm, fairly clean, and fairly well-shaped.The\nEuropean Cultivated Potato Database (ECPD) is an online collaborative database of potato\nvariety descriptions that is updated and maintained by the Scottish Agricultural Science Agency\nwithin the framework of the European Cooperative Programme for Crop Genetic Resources Networks\n(ECP/GR)\u2014which is run by the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI). === Pigmentation ===\nDozens of potato cultivars have been selectively bred specifically for their skin or, more\ncommonly, flesh color, including gold, red, and blue varieties that contain varying amounts\nof phytochemicals, including carotenoids for gold/yellow or polyphenols for red or blue\ncultivars. Carotenoid compounds include provitamin A\nalpha-carotene and beta-carotene, which are converted to the essential nutrient, vitamin\nA, during digestion. Anthocyanins mainly responsible for red or\nblue pigmentation in potato cultivars do not have nutritional significance, but are used\nfor visual variety and consumer appeal. Recently, as of 2010, potatoes have also been\nbioengineered specifically for these pigmentation traits. === Genetically engineered potatoes === Genetic research has produced several genetically\nmodified varieties. 'New Leaf', owned by Monsanto Company, incorporates\ngenes from Bacillus thuringiensis, which confers resistance to the Colorado potato beetle;\n'New Leaf Plus' and 'New Leaf Y', approved by US regulatory agencies during the 1990s,\nalso include resistance to viruses. McDonald's, Burger King, Frito-Lay, and Procter\n& Gamble announced they would not use genetically modified potatoes, and Monsanto published\nits intent to discontinue the line in March 2001.Waxy potato varieties produce two main\nkinds of potato starch, amylose and amylopectin, the latter of which is most industrially useful. BASF developed the Amflora potato, which was\nmodified to express antisense RNA to inactivate the gene for granule bound starch synthase,\nan enzyme which catalyzes the formation of amylose. Amflora potatoes therefore produce starch\nconsisting almost entirely of amylopectin, and are thus more useful for the starch industry. In 2010, the European Commission cleared the\nway for 'Amflora' to be grown in the European Union for industrial purposes only\u2014not for\nfood. Nevertheless, under EU rules, individual countries\nhave the right to decide whether they will allow this potato to be grown on their territory. Commercial planting of 'Amflora' was expected\nin the Czech Republic and Germany in the spring of 2010, and Sweden and the Netherlands in\nsubsequent years. Another GM potato variety developed by BASF\nis 'Fortuna' which was made resistant to late blight by adding two resistance genes, blb1\nand blb2, which originate from the Mexican wild potato Solanum bulbocastanum. In October 2011 BASF requested cultivation\nand marketing approval as a feed and food from the EFSA. In 2012, GMO development in Europe was stopped\nby BASF.In November 2014, the USDA approved a genetically modified potato developed by\nJ.R. Simplot Company, which contains genetic modifications that prevent bruising and produce\nless acrylamide when fried than conventional potatoes; the modifications do not cause new\nproteins to be made, but rather prevent proteins from being made via RNA interference. == History == The potato was first domesticated in the region\nof modern-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia between 8000 and 5000 BC. It has since spread around the world and become\na staple crop in many countries. The earliest archaeologically verified potato\ntuber remains have been found at the coastal site of Ancon (central Peru), dating to 2500\nBC. The most widely cultivated variety, Solanum\ntuberosum tuberosum, is indigenous to the Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago, and has been cultivated\nby the local indigenous people since before the Spanish conquest. According to conservative estimates, the introduction\nof the potato was responsible for a quarter of the growth in Old World population and\nurbanization between 1700 and 1900.In the Altiplano, potatoes provided the principal\nenergy source for the Inca civilization, its predecessors, and its Spanish successor. Following the Spanish conquest of the Inca\nEmpire, the Spanish introduced the potato to Europe in the second half of the 16th century,\npart of the Columbian exchange. The staple was subsequently conveyed by European\nmariners to territories and ports throughout the world. The potato was slow to be adopted by European\nfarmers, but soon enough it became an important food staple and field crop that played a major\nrole in the European 19th century population boom. However, lack of genetic diversity, due to\nthe very limited number of varieties initially introduced, left the crop vulnerable to disease. In 1845, a plant disease known as late blight,\ncaused by the fungus-like oomycete Phytophthora infestans, spread rapidly through the poorer\ncommunities of western Ireland as well as parts of the Scottish Highlands, resulting\nin the crop failures that led to the Great Irish Famine. Thousands of varieties still persist in the\nAndes however, where over 100 cultivars might be found in a single valley, and a dozen or\nmore might be maintained by a single agricultural household. == Production == In 2016, world production of potatoes was\n377 million tonnes, led by China with over 26% of the world total (see table). Other major producers were India, Russia,\nUkraine and the United States. It remains an essential crop in Europe (especially\neastern and central Europe), where per capita production is still the highest in the world,\nbut the most rapid expansion over the past few decades has occurred in southern and eastern\nAsia. == Nutrition ==\nA raw potato is 79% water, 17% carbohydrates (88% is starch), 2% protein, and contains\nnegligible fat (see table). In an amount measuring 100 grams (3.5 oz),\nraw potato provides 322 kilojoules (77 kilocalories) of energy and is a rich source of vitamin\nB6 and vitamin C (23% and 24% of the Daily Value, respectively), with no other vitamins\nor minerals in significant amount (see table). The potato is rarely eaten raw because raw\npotato starch is poorly digested by humans. When a potato is baked, its contents of vitamin\nB6 and vitamin C decline notably, while there is little significant change in the amount\nof other nutrients.Potatoes are often broadly classified as having a high glycemic index\n(GI) and so are often excluded from the diets of individuals trying to follow a low-GI diet. The GI of potatoes can vary considerably depending\non the cultivar or cultivar category (such as \"red\", russet, \"white\", or King Edward),\ngrowing conditions and storage, preparation methods (by cooking method, whether it is\neaten hot or cold, whether it is mashed or cubed or consumed whole), and accompanying\nfoods consumed (especially the addition of various high-fat or high-protein toppings). In particular, consuming reheated or cooled\npotatoes that were previously cooked may yield a lower GI effect.In the UK, potatoes are\nnot considered by the National Health Service (NHS) as counting or contributing towards\nthe recommended daily five portions of fruit and vegetables, the 5-A-Day program. === Comparison to other staple foods ===\nThis table shows the nutrient content of potatoes next to other major staple foods, each one\nmeasured in its respective raw state, even though staple foods are not commonly eaten\nraw and are usually sprouted or cooked before eating. In sprouted and cooked form, the relative\nnutritional and anti-nutritional contents of each of these grains (or other foods) may\nbe different from the values in this table. Each nutrient (every row) has the highest\nnumber highlighted to show the staple food with the greatest amount in a 100-gram raw\nportion. === Toxicity === Potatoes contain toxic compounds known as\nglycoalkaloids, of which the most prevalent are solanine and chaconine. Solanine is found in other plants in the same\nfamily, Solanaceae, which includes such plants as deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna),\nhenbane (Hyoscyamus niger) and tobacco (Nicotiana spp.), as well as the food plants eggplant\nand tomato. These compounds, which protect the potato\nplant from its predators, are generally concentrated in its leaves, flowers, sprouts, and fruits\n(in contrast to the tubers). In a summary of several studies, the glycoalkaloid\ncontent was highest in the flowers and sprouts and lowest in the tuber flesh. (The glycoalkaloid content was, in order from\nhighest to lowest: flowers, sprouts, leaves, skin, roots, berries, peel [skin plus outer\ncortex of tuber flesh], stems, and tuber flesh.)Exposure to light, physical damage, and age increase\nglycoalkaloid content within the tuber. Cooking at high temperatures\u2014over 170 \u00b0C\n(338 \u00b0F)\u2014partly destroys these compounds. The concentration of glycoalkaloids in wild\npotatoes is sufficient to produce toxic effects in humans. Glycoalkaloid poisoning may cause headaches,\ndiarrhea, cramps, and, in severe cases, coma and death. However, poisoning from cultivated potato\nvarieties is very rare. Light exposure causes greening from chlorophyll\nsynthesis, giving a visual clue as to which areas of the tuber may have become more toxic. However, this does not provide a definitive\nguide, as greening and glycoalkaloid accumulation can occur independently of each other. Different potato varieties contain different\nlevels of glycoalkaloids. The Lenape variety was released in 1967 but\nwas withdrawn in 1970 as it contained high levels of glycoalkaloids. Since then, breeders developing new varieties\ntest for this, and sometimes have to discard an otherwise promising cultivar. Breeders try to keep glycoalkaloid levels\nbelow 200 mg/kg (200 ppmw). However, when these commercial varieties turn\ngreen, they can still approach solanine concentrations of 1000 mg/kg (1000 ppmw). In normal potatoes, analysis has shown solanine\nlevels may be as little as 3.5% of the breeders' maximum, with 7\u2013187 mg/kg being found. While a normal potato tuber has 12\u201320 mg/kg\nof glycoalkaloid content, a green potato tuber contains 250\u2013280 mg/kg and its skin has\n1500\u20132200 mg/kg. == Growth and cultivation == === \nSeed potatoes === Potatoes are generally grown from seed potatoes,\ntubers specifically grown to be free from disease and to provide consistent and healthy\nplants. To be disease free, the areas where seed potatoes\nare grown are selected with care. In the US, this restricts production of seed\npotatoes to only 15 states out of all 50 states where potatoes are grown. These locations are selected for their cold,\nhard winters that kill pests and summers with long sunshine hours for optimum growth. In the UK, most seed potatoes originate in\nScotland, in areas where westerly winds prevent aphid attack and thus prevent spread of potato\nvirus pathogens. === Phases of growth ===\nPotato growth is divided into five phases. During the first phase, sprouts emerge from\nthe seed potatoes and root growth begins. During the second, photosynthesis begins as\nthe plant develops leaves and branches. In the third phase, stolons develop from lower\nleaf axils on the stem and grow downwards into the ground and on these stolons new tubers\ndevelop as swellings of the stolon. This phase is often, but not always, associated\nwith flowering. Tuber formation halts when soil temperatures\nreach 27 \u00b0C (81 \u00b0F); hence potatoes are considered a cool-season, or winter, crop. Tuber bulking occurs during the fourth phase,\nwhen the plant begins investing the majority of its resources in its newly formed tubers. At this phase, several factors are critical\nto a good yield: optimal soil moisture and temperature, soil nutrient availability and\nbalance, and resistance to pest attacks. The fifth and final phase is the maturation\nof the tubers: the plant canopy dies back, the tuber skins harden, and the sugars in\nthe tubers convert to starches. === Challenges ===\nNew tubers may start growing at the surface of the soil. Since exposure to light leads to an undesirable\ngreening of the skins and the development of solanine as a protection from the sun's\nrays, growers cover surface tubers. Commercial growers cover them by piling additional\nsoil around the base of the plant as it grows (called \"hilling\" up, or in British English\n\"earthing up\"). An alternative method, used by home gardeners\nand smaller-scale growers, involves covering the growing area with organic mulches such\nas straw or plastic sheets.Correct potato husbandry can be an arduous task in some circumstances. Good ground preparation, harrowing, plowing,\nand rolling are always needed, along with a little grace from the weather and a good\nsource of water. Three successive plowings, with associated\nharrowing and rolling, are desirable before planting. Eliminating all root-weeds is desirable in\npotato cultivation. In general, the potatoes themselves are grown\nfrom the eyes of another potato and not from seed. Home gardeners often plant a piece of potato\nwith two or three eyes in a hill of mounded soil. Commercial growers plant potatoes as a row\ncrop using seed tubers, young plants or microtubers and may mound the entire row. Seed potato crops are rogued in some countries\nto eliminate diseased plants or those of a different variety from the seed crop. Potatoes are sensitive to heavy frosts, which\ndamage them in the ground. Even cold weather makes potatoes more susceptible\nto bruising and possibly later rotting, which can quickly ruin a large stored crop. === Pests === The historically significant Phytophthora\ninfestans (late blight) remains an ongoing problem in Europe and the United States. Other potato diseases include Rhizoctonia,\nSclerotinia, black leg, powdery mildew, powdery scab and leafroll virus.Insects that commonly\ntransmit potato diseases or damage the plants include the Colorado potato beetle, the potato\ntuber moth, the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), the potato aphid, beet leafhoppers, thrips,\nand mites. The potato cyst nematode is a microscopic\nworm that thrives on the roots, thus causing the potato plants to wilt. Since its eggs can survive in the soil for\nseveral years, crop rotation is recommended. During the crop year 2008, many of the certified\norganic potatoes produced in the United Kingdom and certified by the Soil Association as organic\nwere sprayed with a copper pesticide to control potato blight (Phytophthora infestans). According to the Soil Association, the total\ncopper that can be applied to organic land is 6 kg/ha/year.According to an Environmental\nWorking Group analysis of USDA and FDA pesticide residue tests performed from 2000 through\n2008, 84% of the 2,216 tested potato samples contained detectable traces of at least one\npesticide. A total of 36 unique pesticides were detected\non potatoes over the 2,216 samples, though no individual sample contained more than 6\nunique pesticide traces, and the average was 1.29 detectable unique pesticide traces per\nsample. The average quantity of all pesticide traces\nfound in the 2,216 samples was 1.602 ppm. While this was a very low value of pesticide\nresidue, it was the highest amongst the 50 vegetables analyzed. === Harvest === At harvest time, gardeners usually dig up\npotatoes with a long-handled, three-prong \"grape\" (or graip), i.e., a spading fork,\nor a potato hook, which is similar to the graip but with tines at a 90\u00b0 angle to the\nhandle. In larger plots, the plow is the fastest implement\nfor unearthing potatoes. Commercial harvesting is typically done with\nlarge potato harvesters, which scoop up the plant and surrounding earth. This is transported up an apron chain consisting\nof steel links several feet wide, which separates some of the dirt. The chain deposits into an area where further\nseparation occurs. Different designs use different systems at\nthis point. The most complex designs use vine choppers\nand shakers, along with a blower system to separate the potatoes from the plant. The result is then usually run past workers\nwho continue to sort out plant material, stones, and rotten potatoes before the potatoes are\ncontinuously delivered to a wagon or truck. Further inspection and separation occurs when\nthe potatoes are unloaded from the field vehicles and put into storage. Immature potatoes may be sold as \"creamer\npotatoes\" and are particularly valued for taste. These are often harvested by the home gardener\nor farmer by \"grabbling\", i.e. pulling out the young tubers by hand while leaving the\nplant in place. A creamer potato is a variety of potato harvested\nbefore it matures to keep it small and tender. It is generally either a Yukon Gold potato\nor a red potato, called gold creamers or red creamers respectively, and measures approximately\n1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter. The skin of creamer potatoes is waxy and high\nin moisture content, and the flesh contains a lower level of starch than other potatoes. Like potatoes in general, they can be prepared\nby boiling, baking, frying, and roasting. Slightly older than creamer potatoes are \"new\npotatoes\", which are also prized for their taste and texture and often come from the\nsame varieties.Potatoes are usually cured after harvest to improve skin-set. Skin-set is the process by which the skin\nof the potato becomes resistant to skinning damage. Potato tubers may be susceptible to skinning\nat harvest and suffer skinning damage during harvest and handling operations. Curing allows the skin to fully set and any\nwounds to heal. Wound-healing prevents infection and water-loss\nfrom the tubers during storage. Curing is normally done at relatively warm\ntemperatures 50 to 60 \u00b0F (10 to 16 \u00b0C) with high humidity and good gas-exchange if at\nall possible. === Storage ===\nStorage facilities need to be carefully designed to keep the potatoes alive and slow the natural\nprocess of decomposition, which involves the breakdown of starch. It is crucial that the storage area is dark,\nventilated well and, for long-term storage, maintained at temperatures near 4 \u00b0C (39\n\u00b0F). For short-term storage, temperatures of about\n7 to 10 \u00b0C (45 to 50 \u00b0F) are preferred.On the other hand, temperatures below 4 \u00b0C (39\n\u00b0F) convert the starch in potatoes into sugar, which alters their taste and cooking qualities\nand leads to higher acrylamide levels in the cooked product, especially in deep-fried dishes. The discovery of acrylamides in starchy foods\nin 2002 has led to international health concerns. They are believed to be probable carcinogens\nand their occurrence in cooked foods is being studied for potentially influencing health\nproblems.Under optimum conditions in commercial warehouses, potatoes can be stored for up\nto 10\u201312 months. The commercial storage and retrieval of potatoes\ninvolves several phases: first drying surface moisture; wound healing at 85% to 95% relative\nhumidity and temperatures below 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F); a staged cooling phase; a holding phase;\nand a reconditioning phase, during which the tubers are slowly warmed. Mechanical ventilation is used at various\npoints during the process to prevent condensation and the accumulation of carbon dioxide.When\nstored in homes unrefrigerated, the shelf life is usually a few weeks.If potatoes develop\ngreen areas or start to sprout, trimming or peeling those green-colored parts is inadequate\nto remove copresent toxins, and such potatoes are no longer edible. === Yield ===\nThe world dedicated 18.6 million ha (46 million acres) in 2010 for potato cultivation. The average world farm yield for potato was\n17.4 tonnes per hectare, in 2010. Potato farms in the United States were the\nmost productive in 2010, with a nationwide average of 44.3 tonnes per hectare. United Kingdom was a close second. New Zealand farmers have demonstrated some\nof the best commercial yields in the world, ranging between 60 and 80 tonnes per hectare,\nsome reporting yields of 88 tonnes potatoes per hectare.There is a big gap among various\ncountries between high and low yields, even with the same variety of potato. Average potato yields in developed economies\nranges between 38\u201344 tonnes per hectare. China and India accounted for over a third\nof world's production in 2010, and had yields of 14.7 and 19.9 tonnes per hectare respectively. The yield gap between farms in developing\neconomies and developed economies represents an opportunity loss of over 400 million tonnes\nof potato, or an amount greater than 2010 world potato production. Potato crop yields are determined by factors\nsuch as the crop breed, seed age and quality, crop management practices and the plant environment. Improvements in one or more of these yield\ndeterminants, and a closure of the yield gap, can be a major boost to food supply and farmer\nincomes in the developing world. == Uses == Potatoes are prepared in many ways: skin-on\nor peeled, whole or cut up, with seasonings or without. The only requirement involves cooking to swell\nthe starch granules. Most potato dishes are served hot but some\nare first cooked, then served cold, notably potato salad and potato chips (crisps). Common dishes are: mashed potatoes, which\nare first boiled (usually peeled), and then mashed with milk or yogurt and butter; whole\nbaked potatoes; boiled or steamed potatoes; French-fried potatoes or chips; cut into cubes\nand roasted; scalloped, diced, or sliced and fried (home fries); grated into small thin\nstrips and fried (hash browns); grated and formed into dumplings, R\u00f6sti or potato pancakes. Unlike many foods, potatoes can also be easily\ncooked in a microwave oven and still retain nearly all of their nutritional value, provided\nthey are covered in ventilated plastic wrap to prevent moisture from escaping; this method\nproduces a meal very similar to a steamed potato, while retaining the appearance of\na conventionally baked potato. Potato chunks also commonly appear as a stew\ningredient. Potatoes are boiled between 10 and 25 minutes,\ndepending on size and type, to become soft. === Other than for eating ===\nPotatoes are also used for purposes other than eating by humans, for example: Potatoes are used to brew alcoholic beverages\nsuch as vodka, poit\u00edn, or akvavit. They are also used as fodder for livestock. Livestock-grade potatoes, considered too small\nand/or blemished to sell or market for human use but suitable for fodder use, have been\ncalled chats in some dialects. They may be stored in bins until use; they\nare sometimes ensiled. Some farmers prefer to steam them rather than\nfeed them raw and are equipped to do so efficiently. Potato starch is used in the food industry\nas a thickener and binder for soups and sauces, in the textile industry as an adhesive, and\nfor the manufacturing of papers and boards. Maine companies are exploring the possibilities\nof using waste potatoes to obtain polylactic acid for use in plastic products; other research\nprojects seek ways to use the starch as a base for biodegradable packaging. Potato skins, along with honey, are a folk\nremedy for burns in India. Burn centres in India have experimented with\nthe use of the thin outer skin layer to protect burns while healing. Potatoes (mainly Russets) are commonly used\nin plant research. The consistent parenchyma tissue, the clonal\nnature of the plant and the low metabolic activity provide a very nice \"model tissue\"\nfor experimentation. Wound-response studies are often done on potato\ntuber tissue, as are electron transport experiments. In this respect, potato tuber tissue is similar\nto Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans and Escherichia coli: they are all\n\"standard\" research organisms. Potatoes have been delivered with personalized\nmessages as a novelty. Potato delivery services include Potato Parcel\nand Mail A Spud. === Latin America === Peruvian cuisine naturally contains the potato\nas a primary ingredient in many dishes, as around 3,000 varieties of this tuber are grown\nthere. Some of the more notable dishes include boiled\npotato as a base for several dishes or with aj\u00ed-based sauces like in Papa a la Huanca\u00edna\nor ocopa, diced potato for its use in soups like in cau cau, or in Carapulca with dried\npotato (papa seca). Smashed condimented potato is used in causa\nLime\u00f1a and papa rellena. French-fried potatoes are a typical ingredient\nin Peruvian stir-fries, including the classic dish lomo saltado. Chu\u00f1o is a freeze-dried potato product traditionally\nmade by Quechua and Aymara communities of Peru and Bolivia, and is known in various\ncountries of South America, including Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile. In Chile's Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago, potatoes are\nthe main ingredient of many dishes, including milcaos, chapaleles, curanto and chochoca. In Ecuador, the potato, as well as being a\nstaple with most dishes, is featured in the hearty locro de papas, a thick soup of potato,\nsquash, and cheese. === Europe === In the UK, potatoes form part of the traditional\nstaple, fish and chips. Roast potatoes are commonly served as part\nof a Sunday roast dinner and mashed potatoes form a major component of several other traditional\ndishes, such as shepherd's pie, bubble and squeak, and bangers and mash. New potatoes may be cooked with mint and are\noften served with butter.The Tattie scone is a popular Scottish dish containing potatoes. Colcannon is a traditional Irish food made\nwith mashed potato, shredded kale or cabbage, and onion; champ is a similar dish. Boxty pancakes are eaten throughout Ireland,\nalthough associated especially with the North, and in Irish diaspora communities; they are\ntraditionally made with grated potatoes, soaked to loosen the starch and mixed with flour,\nbuttermilk and baking powder. A variant eaten and sold in Lancashire, especially\nLiverpool, is made with cooked and mashed potatoes. Bryndzov\u00e9 halu\u0161ky is the Slovakian national\ndish, made of a batter of flour and finely grated potatoes that is boiled to form dumplings. These are then mixed with regionally varying\ningredients. In Germany, Northern and Eastern Europe (especially\nin Scandinavian countries), Finland, Poland, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, newly harvested,\nearly ripening varieties are considered a special delicacy. Boiled whole and served un-peeled with dill,\nthese \"new potatoes\" are traditionally consumed with Baltic herring. Puddings made from grated potatoes (kugel,\nkugelis, and potato babka) are popular items of Ashkenazi, Lithuanian, and Belarusian cuisine. German fries and various version of Potato\nsalad are part of German cuisine. Bauernfr\u00fchst\u00fcck (literally farmer's breakfast)\nis a warm German dish made from fried potatoes, eggs, ham and vegetables. Cepelinai is Lithuanian national dish. They are a type of dumpling made from riced\npotatoes (see Potato ricer) and usually stuffed with minced meat, although sometimes dry cottage\ncheese (curd) or mushrooms are used instead. In Western Europe, especially in Belgium,\nsliced potatoes are fried to create frieten, the original French fried potatoes. Stamppot, a traditional Dutch meal, is based\non mashed potatoes mixed with vegetables. In France, the most notable potato dish is\nthe Hachis Parmentier, named after Antoine-Augustin Parmentier, a French pharmacist, nutritionist,\nand agronomist who, in the late 18th century, was instrumental in the acceptance of the\npotato as an edible crop in the country. The p\u00e2t\u00e9 aux pommes de terre is a regional\npotato dish from the central Allier and Limousin regions. In the north of Italy, in particular, in the\nFriuli region of the northeast, potatoes serve to make a type of pasta called gnocchi. Similarly, cooked and mashed potatoes or potato\nflour can be used in the Kn\u00f6del or dumpling eaten with or added to meat dishes all over\ncentral and Eastern Europe, but especially in Bavaria and Luxembourg. Potatoes form one of the main ingredients\nin many soups such as the vichyssoise and Albanian potato and cabbage soup. In western Norway, komle is popular. A traditional Canary Islands dish is Canarian\nwrinkly potatoes or papas arrugadas. Tortilla de patatas (potato omelette) and\npatatas bravas (a dish of fried potatoes in a spicy tomato sauce) are near-universal constituent\nof Spanish tapas. === North America === In the US, potatoes have become one of the\nmost widely consumed crops and thus have a variety of preparation methods and condiments. French fries and often hash browns are commonly\nfound in typical American fast-food burger \"joints\" and cafeterias. One popular favourite involves a baked potato\nwith cheddar cheese (or sour cream and chives) on top, and in New England \"smashed potatoes\"\n(a chunkier variation on mashed potatoes, retaining the peel) have great popularity. Potato flakes are popular as an instant variety\nof mashed potatoes, which reconstitute into mashed potatoes by adding water, with butter\nor oil and salt to taste. A regional dish of Central New York, salt\npotatoes are bite-size new potatoes boiled in water saturated with salt then served with\nmelted butter. At more formal dinners, a common practice\nincludes taking small red potatoes, slicing them, and roasting them in an iron skillet. Among American Jews, the practice of eating\nlatkes (fried potato pancakes) is common during the festival of Hanukkah. A traditional Acadian dish from New Brunswick\nis known as poutine r\u00e2p\u00e9e. The Acadian poutine is a ball of grated and\nmashed potato, salted, sometimes filled with pork in the centre, and boiled. The result is a moist ball about the size\nof a baseball. It is commonly eaten with salt and pepper\nor brown sugar. It is believed to have originated from the\nGerman Kl\u00f6\u00dfe, prepared by early German settlers who lived among the Acadians. Poutine, by contrast, is a hearty serving\nof French fries, fresh cheese curds and hot gravy. Tracing its origins to Quebec in the 1950s,\nit has become a widespread and popular dish throughout Canada. Potato grading for Idaho potatoes is performed\nin which No. 1 potatoes are the highest quality and No. 2 are rated as lower in quality due\nto their appearance (e.g. blemishes or bruises, pointy ends). Potato density assessment can be performed\nby floating them in brines. High-density potatoes are desirable in the\nproduction of dehydrated mashed potatoes, potato crisps and french fries. === South Asia ===\nIn South Asia, the potato is a very popular traditional staple. In India, the most popular potato dishes are\naloo ki sabzi, batata vada, and samosa, which is spicy mashed potato mixed with a small\namount of vegetable stuffed in conical dough, and deep fried. Potatoes are also a major ingredient as fast\nfood items, such as aloo chaat, where they are deep fried and served with chutney. In Northern India, alu dum and alu paratha\nare a favourite part of the diet; the first is a spicy curry of boiled potato, the second\nis a type of stuffed chapati. A dish called masala dosa from South India\nis very notable all over India. It is a thin pancake of rice and pulse paste\nrolled over spicy smashed potato and eaten with sambhar and chutney. Poori in south India in particular in Tamil\nNadu is almost always taken with smashed potato masal. Other favourite dishes are alu tikki and pakoda\nitems. Vada pav is a popular vegetarian fast food\ndish in Mumbai and other regions in the Maharashtra in India. Aloo posto (a curry with potatoes and poppy\nseeds) is immensely popular in East India, especially Bengal. Although potatoes are not native to India,\nit has become a vital part of food all over the country especially North Indian food preparations. In Tamil Nadu this tuber acquired a name based\non its appearance 'urulai-k-kizhangu' (\u0b89\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0bb3\u0bc8\u0b95\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1) meaning cylindrical\ntuber. The Aloo gosht, Potato and meat curry, is\none of the popular dishes in South Asia, especially in Pakistan. === East Asia ===\nIn East Asia, particularly Southeast Asia, rice is by far the predominant starch crop,\nwith potatoes a secondary crop, especially in China and Japan. However, it is used in northern China where\nrice is not easily grown, with a popular dish being \u9752\u6912\u571f\u8c46\u4e1d (q\u012bng ji\u0101o t\u01d4 d\u00f2u\ns\u012b), made with green pepper, vinegar and thin slices of potato. In the winter, roadside sellers in northern\nChina will also sell roasted potatoes. It is also occasionally seen in Korean and\nThai cuisines. == Cultural significance == === \nIn art === During the late 19th century, numerous images\nof potato harvesting appeared in European art, including the works of Willem Witsen\nand Anton Mauve.Van Gogh's 1885 painting The Potato Eaters portrays a family eating potatoes. Van Gogh said he wanted to depict peasants\nas they really were. He deliberately chose coarse and ugly models,\nthinking that they would be natural and unspoiled in his finished work.Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet's\nThe Potato Harvest depicts peasants working in the plains between Barbizon and Chailly. It presents a theme representative of the\npeasants' struggle for survival. Millet's technique for this work incorporated\npaste-like pigments thickly applied over a coarsely textured canvas. The potato has been an essential crop in the\nAndes since the pre-Columbian Era. The Moche culture from Northern Peru made\nceramics from earth, water, and fire. This pottery was a sacred substance, formed\nin significant shapes and used to represent important themes. Potatoes are represented anthropomorphically\nas well as naturally. === In popular culture ===\nInvented in 1949, and marketed and sold commercially by Hasbro in 1952, Mr. Potato Head is an American\ntoy that consists of a plastic potato and attachable plastic parts, such as ears and\neyes, to make a face. It was the first toy ever advertised on television. == See also ==\nIrish potato candy List of potato cultivars\nList of potato dishes List of potato museums\nLoy (spade), a form of early spade used

I'm 28 see you", "sOPTCsoAPXw": "what's up everybody today we're going to be making cannabis hard candy using canned butter and kennel oil so let's get into it all right guys so before we get into the video i just wanted to give you guys some information so so in this video i'm going to make a large batch of heart candy but what i'm going to do is divide the ingredients into two different pots however since i'm not actually accurately measuring the ingredient one pot is going to have more than the other one so it's not going to be equally divided so when i add my jello at first it didn't turn out right but overall it did so just for my beginners use this recipe for only one type of method don't do it the way i did it so i just wanted to let you guys know that but let's get into the video so the ingredients to make my cannabis hard candy would be lecithin so we will need the lecithin to help bind all the ingredients together so i'm using one teaspoon per recipe next we're gonna be using two third cups of light corn syrup two cups of sugar i'm gonna be using one pack of jello i'm gonna be using blueberry jello and raspberry jello next we will need our water we're going to be using one cup of water also you will need a candy thermometer so we're going to be using a quarter cup of peanut butter for one batch of our hard candy and i'm going to be using a quarter cup of can oil for the second batch of hard candy make sure your candle butter is at room temperature before making your hurricane but let's get into it all right guys so now what we're going to do is measure out our can of butter [Music] now i'm just going to add this to my container so now i'm going to measure out our kennel oil [Music] so this can of oil was made with 14 grams of blue drink all right guys so once you have all of your ingredients the next step would be to turn your stove on now the temperature that i'm going to be using is like medium heat i'm not going to turn it on high so i have two parts on my stove and that's on purpose so i'm going to be using one pot to make the hard candy but once i finish making a hard candy i'm going to add some of that mix into this pot here so i can add my kennel oil so you don't have to add your peanut butter or your kindle oil mix it after your ingredients reach the 300 mark so just keep that in mind let's get into it all right guys turn your stove on medium so that's high right there i'm not going to do that i'm going to do like right here so like medium to high heat so add your sugar then the water [Music] and then your syrup while you're mixing your ingredients just look on the side sometimes there's going to be sugar crystals that's going to form on the side of your pan just remember to brush the sugar crystal that may form on the side of your pot now it's boiling so i'm not going to miss it anymore now i'm going to add my thermometer all right guys so my temperature is getting closer to 260 degrees which is perfect so at any point now it's going to shoot up to 300 degrees hopefully i can get this on camera but we'll see all right guys so we're getting close to it so this way was perfect so this time didn't shoot up like it would usually do i guess because of the temperature that i got it on once it gets to about like three or five i'm gonna turn off the stove and add a portion of my mix to the other pot it's over 300 degrees so now i'm going to turn off my stove and add a portion of the ingredients to the other pot let's go ahead and turn off our stove [Music] now we add our jello to the mix [Music] now i'm going to add our kennel oil [Music] and our peanut butter [Music] now i'm going to add lecithin [Music] so [Music] all right guys so i had to put this back on the stove to mail the ingredients so what happened is when i split the ingredients from one pot to the other obviously i didn't split it equally so this one here had way more jello didn't have the ingredients so it was really really dry so i put this back on the stove just to give it more of a liquid base so now what we're going to do is now we're going to add this to the mode so let's get into it so now i'm going to add my mix to this mold right here [Music] now i'm just going to pour the rash onto this mat right here [Music] do i'm gonna put this in the fridge for about three hours and yeah i know right now it don't look that good but don't worry it's gonna come out fine all right guys so we've been about three hours so now my hard candy is now hard so now what i'm going to do is break the hard candy into small pieces and remove the other hard candy from the candy mold so let's get into it [Music] [Music] i'm just going to use a knife to break my card candy [Music] so [Music] [Music] all right guys my cannabis heart candy is now done thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace [Music] you", "BhBnkbvzuCI": "[Music] so [Music] 308 it is 308 extra trees what's the temper of the table we got uh between 100 and 110 what's on the other side the other side of the table 104 one same it's like 100 between 100 and 110 okay do you know what it was last time cold it was like 98 oh yeah and it cooled off really fast yeah so this time should be better yeah it's trying to be a little bit better we've got everything i guess hey sure i am watch your head oh screw this on the other side and the ball's not over there oh that's not important i'll do my best [Applause] that's good watch they're going to be perfectly even i'm going to feel kind of done with the air i'm just kidding i feel dumb it smells super banana right put a whole hand of bananas in here it already smells very behind me whoa gloves are going to smell bananas [Music] that's it you already put it all in i should have wished i missed it how many shots you have to put into that 1.75 and then max putting in seven and a half seven and a half yeah i guess that's why it's not as strong over here wonder why i totally smell strawberry yeah no i feel like it's not as strong as a banana which i feel like is extra strong well you know one of the one of the flavorings is twice as strong as the other one yeah i still smell strawberry though it's pretty well you guys haven't tried it yet have you joe did you try basically i had a piece yeah yeah how was it it's good nice juxtaposition flavors well balanced as all things should be we should take a temperature reading between the two and the kettles yeah i mean you gotta assume that the other one on the main stove is cooler but i mean warmer yeah i don't know for sure yeah oh that's cool yeah i'm pretty sure this one's colder yeah yeah i mean it'd be nice to have that on all this so is the the bottom of that double boiler not quite as warm as the stove then well it's that and um we lift this off and move it and that's still sitting on the cut the cast iron ring over there which holds a lot of heat yeah and uh the conductivity of copper is really really it's the most conductive metal so it cools off the fastest so when we take it off that and move it to there it's going to cool off quite a bit yeah by at least like one or two degrees i mean i don't want to get too difficult according to my calculations it's like 3.7 oh exactly every time oh wow no wonder we're having so many cooling problems do you believe me yes very believable oh what calculation stinking spoons that'll do you perfect [Music] do you guys think it is uh evenly split or uh not really probably no one's sure if they just just took more time to fill out and that's actually going to get there this if you look at that i think the table is not quite level because this end is usually thicker it's actually so i guess you guys could invest in like a scale to put underneath to make sure it's always well that's not that important also i guess you would also have to know how much the other one weighs because it's not always going to be the exact same yeah we could like fill this up dump out like exactly half of how much we put in and then mark the kettle but even that and the kettles are different weights too you have to take that into account it's a whole thing is it a whole thing or a whole kitten caboodle i like being alone it's fine just uh come out when you need a hug we'll find terry for you we know how much she loves giving hugs the people who don't know my mom that well because they don't know in real life i've seen my mom reject hugs from family members yep can you count them all oh no like i i've seen i've seen people ask my mom for a hug and my mind goes no [Music] she doesn't really dance around it just goes no yeah we mcdonald's we got pretty good at saying no [Music] um your kingdom look looks good yeah are all your loyal subjects doing your dirty work well i could still uh just bring this off but you're just bringing off stuff that looks clear so you can't really what to see much of anything oh you might be able to see it you see that one line disappear yeah cooled off a little bit but it's way better than it was before yeah yeah last time it was just i could see how cold it was even even me the guy who doesn't make any candy and his eyes are closed all the time yeah that sounds cold the last one actually did sound really cold though yeah you like you picked it up and you put it down the table is like yeah that one's coming together a little bit watch max open up i guess they can i almost said openers but he doesn't really want to use it i got to tell you okay have you ever did you ever play with legos when you were a kid never never ever not even your house with you yeah so so you wouldn't understand no do you know like it's like the gray piece and like you click it on it's got the two pieces you click it onto a piece and then you can bend it to get them up yes i never even used that thing like i i can't listen are they really yeah that's just not right lego i'm disappointed in you yeah remember those giant legos the what do they go clothes lego yeah oh sure he just loves building with him right next to the train set you know i guess wood it's kind of like legos for adults wood yeah yeah just make whatever you want although legos are also legos for adults dude i'm telling you every year for christmas i'm like well i hope there's a lot guys yeah logos are awesome yeah that was like my thing when i was growing up and uh i was subscribed to lego magazine same here yeah did you get the bionicles uh comic uh yeah i got a couple of them yeah yeah and i was trying to i think i remember telling my sisters and my parents that my animals because i was like they wouldn't it wouldn't say bionicle on here if it wasn't a word oh boy show me show me in the dictionary define bionicle these robot things it's a nickel that's made out of bios wow okay so just a heads up joe this this next batch the corn syrup is pretty soft so what's up the corn syrup oh yeah i don't know if that'll have an effect does temperature have much to do with that or that's humidity i think yeah but we've had some batches that are like wicked wicked soft and other batches that are you know you get the water really cold yeah yeah nice and icy and um i don't know if you guys do but i like to shake the excess water off too because sometimes you get more water on your hands or yeah for real yeah when it's sticky i put more water on my hands if um if you have too much water you form a layer in here and then that'll like eat away at the the invert yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yep all right so in one of the last videos that we posted somebody commented wait so putting water in your hands makes the corn syrup not stick to you but then you put water on the candy to make it stick to the candy yeah and they said how does that work i said magic we can put uh the kettle over there that we do for the banana and the lemonade that we usually do you can put water in that pour the candy before it's hardened into there and it won't stick to the copper kettle right this is madness joe it is madness water how does it work absolutely nothing who needs one again water's overrated it's about electrolytes it's what plants crave it's great all right i'll be back you guessing my age yeah i could never remember i know that you're always a few months younger than me and i'm 48.48 what am i younger than my dad yeah hey dad you got five bucks yes we'll give it to you later yeah this seems a little bit warmer than the last this is a little warmer than last time i was going to start with my caramel here oh i'm calling for a new carpal stirrer more sugar in candy this is the broccoli sugar so don't oh my god did you as soon as it touched it was like yep let's go find a scoop wow got even lighter hey steve hey how you doing buddy good you need a hammer yeah i got a little piece stuck on here how could i tell i because of the way it is oh that looks nice [Music] do you know why we hit the hook with the hammer why the vibration loosens it from the hook oh cool wow isn't that amazing i learned that from from the old country the science guy he will not be denied you've been in that room too long buddy humans i remember talking is it coming off no it's still stuck there come on steve work your hammer man i thought you were worthy okay little joe's getting tired dad yeah it's still warm it's a good color i'm thinking tired i got this i could do this all day long and that side [Music] there it goes i think you got it all right good you know one more one more [Music] oh i got a little bit huh so close [Music] that's not too much so are they about the same temperature oh no this one's a little warmer remember when we were pouring these out yeah and i said uh let's dump a little more i shouldn't have said that no they're about same size oh yeah if you kind of squint at it and turn the lights down they're like the exact same size yeah turn the lights off yes close your head you better turn a little less just believe what you want [Music] to switch for this one sure what do you mean you want to pull this one this up extra banana just the way we planned it get your hands up all i can hear in my head was get your fingers off of my butterfinger we'll probably put it up on top of this if you need it go back a little bit further i would i wouldn't put a lot of it but the bottoms would so yeah this thing's plastic yeah [Music] what do you think it does seem a little more strawberry right yeah yeah because it's a little bit cute yeah it just like pops a little bit differently yeah because a little see-through it seems almost like strawberry jelly is there anybody in the planet who doesn't like a piece of toast with some butter and jelly on it like strawberry jelly specifically not something that i ever eat but still delicious did this uh hmm that color difference it's not too different or it could just be the first couple pulls cause you know the car will change a tiny bit yeah uh when i make candy we have been going like every other like i'll first i'll throw it on the hook and then i'll oh yeah he didn't do all the hard work yeah yeah i see what you did there i understand i i am almost 30. yeah we had a lot of youngins next that's it he's only 30 since he's 26. right i've been almost 30 for 15 years dude when i was your age i was almost 40. all right so back off yeah i should be a little bit more understanding well when i was 40 i was 50. oh that he's been 40 and he's not even 30 yet yeah yeah you almost have two friends named bill and ted yes i'm going to pretend like i i i get i get it so like i've never seen that movie huh yeah where do you meet him um they're at a different school you have a girlfriend kevin yesterday [Music] so but people have asked us many times before where they get a candy cutter like that and we usually answer it saying if you find out please let us know because we don't know we just basically inherited these i think that they have friends yeah steve says we just talked about this yesterday because we made ken yesterday he said he always keeps an eye out for those things on the market the last time he saw one six years ago oh yeah he hasn't seen anything that's not burning yeah i mean i guess if you're if you're good with metal you could make one i'm sure i mean it's just like hinges and blades i don't know metal stuff but blades yeah i mean if you can fabricate i mean i'm sure that you can figure out most of anything it's not exactly like a modern model no different book dude you tape like six kitchen knives together you can make one of these at home and you can buy those from them like custom with like as many blades as you want different size spacers they've got those things where they mounted them on a like a table with a motor and they just kind of like push this whole giant tray through oh man it's an accident waiting to happen it's all it's like you know it's an industrial candy setting so they've got it all all the safety precautions in place most of them yeah it's it's pretty safe after like the 37 things that got caught up yeah we should put a guard on that imagine like going to work and you just ask your boss like so is that pretty safe like yeah so is that pretty safe oh so your birthday's coming up huh hmm you ever had banana ice cream uh made out of bananas made out of bananas yeah just frozen bananas blended yeah it kind of makes like a big cream okay but i don't know if i'm gonna eat ice cream bread yeah well yeah because if i'm gonna have ice cream i wanna have like cookie dough or oreo or peanut butter and chocolate i'm a stalker for strawberry ice cream i mean yeah like if someone offered to cover i'm not gonna i'm not gonna deny it yeah that's not my favorite choice yeah see i do like ice cream but i'm not much for like cookies and cream and all that well this is coming someone who doesn't like sweets you know what do you know about sweets yeah a little bit i've had ice cream before did this get smaller a little yeah i think it doesn't do that correct i think the heat might have melted it oh okay yeah yep oh can you see what you're doing real quick dad no no this is also a table too huh what's the temperature of the caramel 190. oh wow it's also because obviously that doesn't have to get tempered so it goes through the funnel right so it has to be like pretty hot to go through with them yeah cool stuff have fun brush turtles hey craig i'm not really sure that these are that sharp we just quickly yeah i'll give you a scale of one to ten how sharp i think it is the louder you scream the sharper i guess i'll take this this almost looks like um the first batch almost looks like a cheesecake-ish kind of color yeah see i i think they both kind of look cheesecakey yeah this one's definitely not good yeah it'd be a good color for the strawberry cheesecake though yeah yeah strawberry cheesecake i think would be great flavor like my mama i know was threatening to do cheesecake of all different types of pumpkin cheesecake yeah well i was just saying i think that would be good i figured the pumpkin flavoring was like the pumpkin mix or whatever i think that's why we don't want to do it outside of the season because we can't buy more pumpkin spice right but uh but yeah those were all really good yeah i think you know everybody knows that i'm not the biggest fan of chocolate but cinnamon over chocolate do it good work kids try our best strawberry first i flipped it over and got the banana that's kind of cool that like it's like a sandwich where if you eat it upside down tastes like a different salad i was afraid i was only going to get bananas because i just ate three bananas maybe we should try the fancy connection here well i cleansed my palette first by standing on my head that's yeah i i just read an article about that that gets all the blood out of your tongue totally works well you gotta stand up really fast oh is that how you do it so what do you have to do like a handstand to a flip or like you just get up really fast and then a somersault you've done an arab fast in a plie yep you do that right mm-hmm i'm gonna say this is a good combo yeah i um viewers or subscribers ideas do strawberry banana yeah yeah i had never heard of this flavor combination a few of them asked but max kept whining or whining i couldn't take it anymore well you wouldn't let me throw away the banana flavor i just had to stare at it didn't i get new banana flavor yeah but the old one smells really good too take it home with you okay i'll put it in my car there you go banana bread it's just flavors flavors it works good in the radiator oh does it hey it is glycol based is it's good in the radiator yeah i mean my regular antifreeze tastes pretty good so very sweet right right right blue is sure a little more sweetness i just put gatorade in mine build up a tolerance no one will ever get me but you know every time somebody's trying for very professional taste duster yeah i already gave it 10 vegans yeah wow 10 whole vegans and i think steve's giving it an 11. oh yeah well he was only giving it one thumb up yeah he definitely gives it two okay i like that's eight out of eight vegans yeah so max it was a good call on your part are you happy now yes were you happy before yes okay good so so what we did here didn't really change anything for you all right this is going to go on forever hey guys littlejoe here reminding you to like the videos and subscribe you", "2QMXLRUbvkU": "[Music] welcome back to free Mike here we are making watermelon infused it well cannabis infused watermelon candies today hard candies so let's do this so I got everything ready here is one and a half cups of infused light corn syrup how you doing today Russell what are you guys smoking on anything good hey guys doing some watermelon infused candy today because I don't know how it happened but I got a phone call this morning saying that we are completely out of edibles at the dispensary which is crazy we should not be out of it this is a third different cup of infused butter so I use infused whipped butter and infused corn syrup and we infused this with a pretty even dose of indica and sativa this is three 1/2 cups of sugar plain water it has a little little watermelon flavoring in it hey guys I'm going to do is I'm just going to kind of stir this up so we can look in the pot so I have infused corn syrup and infused butter in here as well as sugar water I'm the only thing I have left to add is the flavoring so what I'm gonna do is mix this really good and start bringing it to a boil and infuse but tired yeah this this will give you a kind of a head high as well as a body high you will get the euphoria with these candies I use I use an actual indica and sativa so it is a broke up trim of actual sativa and indica it's not hybrids so these are 2 together a pure indica and eight peer sativa put together to give us a pretty even body head high pain medicine this should calm your body down from any of the anxiety shakes tremors things like that do it yeah you know I think we all have stronger moments at times I call the chemo fog because I think chemo did more to my memory than anything so now that I have all of this really good and mixed up I can actually put Meister away and just go ahead and let it boil so right now you can really smell the cannabis you can smell the sweetness you can smell that but you don't really smell the watermelon yet because in to the mix this is super concentrated watermelon concentrate that I will put it that I'll be putting in here so basically I'm gonna put this on the stove I have my candy thermometer in here I want this to reach about 320 degrees and I don't want it to reach that fast I want to do it kind of slow because as it's working its way up what'll end up happening is it'll boil the water off that I added into the mixture boiling that water off allows for the mixture to activate itself and in fully infuse without burning it and that's very important so we want to keep this a butter between 250 and 300 but I do want it to hit 300 once and then I'm gonna bring it back down hey Kevin how you doing today you smell you actually spelled my name the way Nikola Tesla spells his name so that's the male version of Nicola the female version of Nicola is a C instead of a cane so it's Nico LA instead of n I K so you actually spelled Nicola like Nikola Tesla so just so you know and if you ever really have a problem remembering you how does how to pronounce my name just think of Nikola Tesla because we do we both pronounce it the same way well he did pronounce it anyway when he was what sorry I believe in a big Tesla fan Nikola Tesla fan nut car I like cars that go fast so today when we're doing our candies everybody has asked me how I make my candies the smaller sizes because finding some of the candy molds are kind of difficult so for those of us that are using cannabis that we dab quite often I'm sure all of us have seen the little containers so these goes straight into the plastic containers it's just a little silicone thing then you have your little silicone containers like this I use these particular ones I take and I wash them all up really good and then I use them as my candy molds so it's easier all I have to do is line a cookie sheet with them and then I can put them in each one oh it's no problem Kevin don't worry about it I just find it interesting most people spell my name like Nikola Tesla because he's he's famous but it's no worries no worries at all pretty much from this point on you really don't need to stir to too much you're gonna let this roll into a boil and you're gonna also keep a very close eye on your thermometer so I have this set where I don't want it to go over three hundred and fourteen degrees right now it is at two hundred and fifty-five degrees as the steam goes up you'll see all the water evaporating out of here and that's when you'll see the temperatures start to rise which is really nice it gives you a good clean infusion without burning your cannabis all it smells great can we do eat it the smell will be really really good when I add the watermelon flavoring in on this now for those of you that are kind of watching this they're like okay most people have everything in and cook it and do it the way that they just do it all at one time the reason why I separate my flavoring away from the rest of my candy mixture when I'm cooking it it's because I don't want to burn the flavoring because you can the flavoring is very very easy to burn and to singe and it doesn't taste very good once you've done that so you have to be careful hi um english-only sorry I know a little bit of other languages but not enough to really do much so but one of the things that you'll start noticing with your candy mixture is you're letting it go ahead and boil you don't need to constantly stir but you'll see that the mixture inside the bubbles will start getting a very clear Brown clean look to it and that's when you're gonna start noticing that the water is pretty much going away the earth evaporating out like it's supposed to you're gonna start noticing that your temperature is gonna keep going up a little bit more quickly so you're gonna want to keep an eye on that but again you do want the mixture to hit 300 degrees once and by once it doesn't mean it needs to be in the 300 degrees for a long period of time a short period of time is fine so today I'm gonna do this a little differently I'm gonna use it if you different types of molds I'm gonna use my dad containers as a mold and show you how I do it with that I'm gonna make some bunny butts for Easter with the watermelon candies and then I'm gonna make some squares so that's basically what I do is I just get silicon containers it's easy I don't have to worry about anything I don't worry about melting my pot or melting anything into it it works it works good so as you can see I am nicely putting it in there you can see that the bubbles are it's a full boil very clear we are evaporating that water out of there we are sitting at about 241 degrees so at this point you can just let it sit here and let it cook off while you're doing that you can set up your molds and it cookie sheet especially if you're using your your dad containers it's easier if you set them all out on a cookie sheet first now I always recommended you it with the plastic or silicone containers and the reasoning for that is because it's harder to break if they don't melt with glass trying to get the candy out you will break the glass I've seen it done a million times so stick with more of a silicone type of a mold I just do this basically what happens is you can just take and pop the candy right out so it works really really well so I just pretty much get my mold ready to go and set them up on the counter because once this process gets going and setting look at taking those candy off the heat it's going to cool very quickly so I need to have my sandy area ready to go so as you can see I have my area set here I have these all set out I have a silicon tray here in case I want to make shatter shatter candy I'll lay them in here let it harden and then break it that's how you make shatter candy so that's how I have all of this set up I don't know if I'll use them all yet but at least they're there okay we're sitting at two hundred and fifty-two degrees so we want to hit this to at least three hundreds one time so I need to just keep letting it go I don't need to stir it beyond this point until it put my flavor in with this I used I'm using super concentrated watermelon flavoring all of the recipes will be up on the website too so that we you can refer back to the website anytime you need to look at it with this I do most of my candy says a is a heavier infusion slowly I can eat them throughout the day and use them as pain medication so I use both and infused corn syrup and infuse butter in my candies so I'm looking at about 70 milligrams per piece of candy to make it safe so it's it's a decent milligram there you can eat one you can eat two even meet three depending on how bad the pain is or how uncomfortable you are they're gonna be amazing cuz wait till I send you some because I'm definitely sending near some or we'll get you over here we need to get you over here and so we do a video with you sweetie yeah guys let her know there are Miranda Lynn you tell her she needs to get over here and we gotta cook cuz get your butt over here we got some infusions to do because I got new pot art I got a new book new stuffs to play with check this one out haha we're gonna be doing some serious brownie infusions yep so I'm just gonna keep the boil boil boil so you'll see it the color becomes richer and darker and clearer it's not a hazy coloring here at all so I'm just gonna let that go ahead and you really don't need to stir it at this point I'm trying to make sure that I get as much of it off of the sides of the pan as possible because I didn't use my little wet sweat my wet flap to clean off the side so I'm trying to make sure I don't have any crystallization so that's the only reason why I'm stirring is to keep my candy from crystallizing but here you can see how pretty it is see the color in there so these won't be a real red they'll be kind of a brownish red color but they will tasty yummy okay so we are up to 264 degrees as you will notice the less as the steam starts evaporating is we have less and less steam you're gonna notice that my temperature gauge is going to go up significantly quicker and that's a good thing because it's letting me know that I've got most the water out of my candy and that I will be moving to the next step here soon I just want to get all of that back in there so I am not even going to think about putting my watermelon flavoring into this until I've hit the 300 degrees possibly 320 and that's when I'm gonna put my water on flavoring in here because then I'm just gonna let it cook a little while longer and take it off the heat it'll be ready to be put into it it's mulch so we are up to 270 so as you see the whit as the water keeps evaporating out the temperature the Blessed water the quicker that temperature is gonna rise so once you hit about 250 degrees and you start noticing that it's going to rise you're gonna state this pot don't walk away from it because I've watched people walk away from these pots at this point and within three minutes they've burnt it because it's gone well over 320 degrees we do not want this to ever reach over 320 degrees if that happens you will have burned your cannabis in here and it has it will have a burnt taste to it it is not yummy so be careful here we are less than a minute later and we're at we're at 282 degrees so you'll see 284 degrees now so it does jump pretty significantly quick once we get to this point yeah I believe they ran out of edibles shame shame shame I mean I'm glad there's enough I'm glad people like the animals but tell me before we run out so you'll see how it stays rich and dark right now you get you really get more of the sweets cannabis buttery scent to it so it has a very sweet smell you can definitely smell a smell the butter and and the cannabis in there kind of a fruity flavor kinda or scent to it oh I wish you could bottle the scent and send it off to you guys what we're also going to be doing the root beer of candies again - we have just reached our mark that's why that a beeper went off on us so now it's time to get this in there ready oh yeah lovely so this is oh wow you can smell the watermelon Wow Wow oh my god guys you can smell this watermelon something fierce oh and it is red look at this love love love love now I have this off the heat at this point I can add it back to the heat oh wow Oh YUM so young a little warm but really good so I'm gonna throw this back on the heat for just a couple of minutes that you take a look at what it looks like in there now I want the fire off simply because I just want to keep this warm enough okay so now I'm just wanting to kind of take a Scooby and I'm just gonna let it drip into the little molds and yes it does make a mess and then really all I'm doing is just filling them up one of the fun things about doing it this way however is that I make a whole bunch of little drips on to the pan and then I'm going to use those little drips as as decorators decoration on other stuff so these ones are all filled [Music] we can redo it sweetie you can also take these and put them in a bottle to make it a little bit easier I'm trying to do this quickly so because they can be little hardened in the pot sorry I'll look up here in a second so here's this tricky now we're going to move to a beat next ready oh my god they smell so good this is the first time I've used the strawberry or the watermelon recipe on this my bunny boots so I'll probably give a few bunny bucks away for Easter this year just because bunny butts are fun so those are the bunny butts well I have good flavor to it too it has a really good watermelon cannabis flavor to it so not only can you taste the watermelon but you can taste the cannabis Oh yummy yummy yummy oh I don't probably spin any sweetie you don't waste cannabis no no actually all of the hairs and stuff that you see that I pull off I will be using those in another type of candy so all of this leftover stuff fits in here I will still be using see all the little strings I love making candy I just love cooking I don't eat but I like to cook go figure however I'll tell you what as far as eating and stuff when it with my eating disorder hard candy really helps me for some reason it doesn't bother me to use hard candy I don't feel like it's doing an evening I don't feel like it's hurting me but I still use hard candy all the time I've known several people with eating disorders that can't because their eating disorder doesn't allow them to and by that is really simple they just it's a it's a mind over matter thing that it will actually make them throw up when they need something like that so it kind of sucks so hard candies like this help a lot so if you'll see when you make stuff like this what I can do is since it's still pliable and movable I can actually take this and turn it into like a flower like a rosebud and kind of and I'll show you it later but what you do is you take your candy you get it warm make like a little rosebud put a hole in here and then you can smoke through it and still get the flavor of your candy oh my god that's good Wow oh yeah I'm using this recipe again oh that's really good flavor too so that's just as easy as it is then you just pick all of this up so would you see that's all of the fun stuff that I'll play with with my candy and that'll be for what I'm doing my Easter candies and stuff I'll take some of these to decorate the Easter eggs and things like that for when we give it mmm so yummy so it's really that simple to do these candies um they're done I'm just gonna put in the refrigerator let them cool off then I'll pop them out and show you guys what they look like so thanks guys I will be back later have a great day [Music]", "g4tHSckLfGk": "[Music] [Music] only thing i care about is living life the best i could only want to smoke and stay productive till the day is done

video all right peace you", "vGOYds0MKpE": "hello and welcome to lofty pursuits in public displays the confection in Tallahassee Florida I'm Greg and Jake is making candy today and we're gonna ask the question where did the idiom blowing a raspberry come from because it seems to have nothing to do with raspberries but it does these fruit drop rollers are a little different than most of the ones we have you see these raspberry rollers are asymmetrical the top and bottom are distinctly different and they create the top and the bottom of the raspberry and this is cool because when you put one of these in your mouth it kind of feels like a raspberry because you get that 3-dimensional shape you don't even realize you're connected with it this is sort of like the strip effect that we covered in our video number 73 and while I found studies that cover flavors and colors with this strip effect I haven't found any that covers texture so I find these interesting the flavor and color was added when the candy was in the pot but Jake now sprinkles on some citric acid that'll give it just a little tang and make it taste more raspberry like I've always been fascinated with words and the origins of them and sometimes words can be confusing so let me give you three words to think about entomology etymology and entomology etymologies of course the study of bugs etymology is the study of words and entomology is the study of snack cakes and while the third study might be useful we're going to concentrate on the second study and go back to the origin of blowing a raspberry because it has a fascinating story one that takes British television British censors American TV and the paranoia of movie studios all together to add a term to the English language that's an unusual term in the first place so while Jake flips the candy to even the temperature and lets it drip he needs to get it all to the right consistency to go through the machine clearly let's go back to the early days of television television was on unlike the early internet it was struggling for content it could make some but it needed more than it could make and the movie studios in the United States were not being cooperative they were scared of television they were afraid it was going to destroy their business so they didn't want to license them their blockbusters they did license the monster movies that they thought they'd never show again like two Creature from the Black Lagoon which will be in another video by the way and they also did old old films like ah The Three Stooges Laurel and Hardy and our gangs sometimes known as The Little Rascals but what they ended up doing was leaving an opening but American television found a solution that was England you see the British film companies didn't see a threat from the American film companies in post-world War two and for many years after that people in the United States got their first real exposure to British movies and it was a good one and we absorbed accents we considered the British accent cool I think it paved way to the British revolution in music and the acceptance of it here in the United States but it also added words to the lexicon and one of them was blowing a raspberry that sound that you make when you're disappointed with things sometimes known as the Bronx cheer the writers in British films started using terms like blowing raspberries because there were censors in the British film system and there were pretty major cutting things out these sensors were originally employed during World War two to censor letters movies to keep information from going to the enemy but after the war they found a job the censoring films for the public's quote-unquote protection and the directors and writers found this stifling so they try to get around this by putting things in the censors didn't know but the public might and one of the things they used was London rhyming slang sometimes known as cockney rhyming slang if you're not familiar with it it's two words that rhyme with another to confuse the upper classes and the police so table and chair would mean stair but you wouldn't say table and chair you just say table you'd have to know stair to get to chair and for another example is frog and toad being rode well there you had a term raspberry tart but if you think for a second you might be able to figure out what raspberry tart rhymed with fart so because London used rhyming slang in people knew it the movies could use it to get around the censors in England when the movies came to the United States that were shown on American television because the television companies couldn't get American movies and a term entered the English lexicon that meant the term that the sound blowing a raspberry makes and I loved it came full circle there's the Golden Raspberry award that now gives awards for bad movies and the name of that award is the same linguistic origins as the name for sticking your face in a baby's belly and making a funny noise that makes it laugh and if you haven't figured it out already there's a reason why these candies are called drops thank you for watching if you like this video please go to our website www.marykay.co.uk/awilliam a be lucky to see us do it but we don't make it all the time and we don't have a regular schedule you can also subscribe to us here on YouTube and ring that bell we make a lot of videos and you can also follow us on Facebook Twitter Instagram and now patreon and if you're a patreon subscriber you can also get podcasts from Greg and yes that's me and this only leaves one question why a raspberry sometimes colored blue and that is for another video [Music]", "FYsqZXHVnI8": "hello and welcome to lofty pursuits in public displays a confection in Tallahassee Florida where we make hard candy today we're gonna make some crystal flour candy this time in the shape of a sunflower this batches flavor will be honey this was made originally as a custom order for a wedding but we like the results so much we thought we'd show you it and start making it at lofty pursuits for a little while [Music] the table were pouring the hot sugar on is a special table from the late 1800s it was made specifically for this and we're going to be stirring in our food coloring and adding it we're gonna do this before the table cools the candy down to the point we needed to we needed to behave like a clay not like a liquid we use small wooden spoons to stir in the food coloring and let the water boil off that's in the food coloring this keeps the candy from getting sticky our color pellet today will have three colors brown yellow and green this is a part of our crystal candy series that we started earlier this year [Music] none of the candy is cooled a bit we're gonna cut the colors apart and then fold them on the cooling table to even out the temperature within each piece [Music] sunflowers are fascinating plants and they have attracted the attention of everyone from painters like Van Gogh to scientists one of the reasons I think people like them is they all face the same way in a field it's not one sunflower it's a bunch of them that are amazing and they all face the same way because they are Gila tropic this means they follow the Sun so as they turn to the Sun they all turn in time with each other to like a slow dance of flowers and their petals all open up and they're out they are looking at you sort of like faces and this is one of the things that make them cool and we're gonna try to capture this in our candy and now it's time for me to use the candy makers hook on this I'm gonna take the yellow candy fold it over and pull it again and again to trap air bubbles this is gonna change the nature of the candy it's gonna change its texture and increase its surface area with these little air bubbles this makes it taste better when you eat the candy it's also going to make the color brighter and while it doesn't appear so on this video yet the brightening happens after the candy cools off it's more noticeable the color change when I pulled the brown sugar because I'm going to need to Center the little seeds to be lighter than the outside and when I pull that you'll be able to see its color change as I pull I [Music] mentioned earlier that I needed some green candy too and I haven't made me yet I'm gonna make it on the heating table you see I need such a tiny amount of green if I try to make it on the cooling table the color would spread and I'd end up with more green than I could use so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a little bit of a hot clear candy and add just a drop of green food coloring in it I've done this too a pocket inside the candy and I'm going to fold that over again and again with the pocket sealed and it's gonna sculler this candy besides the sunflower being the only flower that has the name flower in its name it also has other peculiar characteristics it's actually not one flower but a group of flowers if you think of it each flower only makes one seed and a sunflower has a Fibonacci sequence of a spiral of seeds in it when it's done and we end up having multiple seeds in each seed as a flower and those are tiny flowers in the center of the head of the sunflower the yellow petals we think of as the petals of the sunflower are called rays and each of them are a special type of flower in themselves multiple flowers on the flower head I'm making the center of the flower out of a group of cylinders the center of the cylinder is pulled lighter Brown candy and the outside wrap is a dark brown candy the nice thing about candy is I can do multiplication with it in other words I'm going to pull one long log out and cut it in half and keep on pulling it and cutting it it'll get thinner but it'll make all the cylinders that I need and they'll all be roughly the same size [Music] and now to make the raise around the head of the sunflower I'm gonna do this by making one large block of yellow gonna put some clear on one side that's gonna act as a spacer to differentiate the different petals then we're going to take two cold triangles of clear and they're gonna shape the top of the petals as best as I can now I'm only going to make one giant petal and then I'm gonna stretch it and cut it in half and then I'll have two and I'm gonna continue to repeat this until I have enough to wrap around our seeds [Music] you can try this candy for yourself you can get it at www.ppsd.com flowers are native to North America there are two varieties native to South America and because of that it's become the state flower of Kansas but it's been exported and it grows beautifully in some other countries it's actually the national flower of the Ukraine and the Ukraine over there grows more sunflowers and produces more sunflower oil than any other country in the world [Music] all the fluff to do is put on the final wrap but it went into the final wrap I make a clean square edge and I add my green so when I roll it up will have a stem on our sunflower I know I took some liberties here with the brown sunflower seeds real sunflower seeds are black if they're used for oil and blocking gray striped if they're used for eating but gray doesn't show up well in candy and I thought the brown would look better and now to our new piece of equipment to Thomas Mills batch roller well it's new to us they started making this model around 1895 I've got a catalog page from an old catalog from before it and when I found that I was very happy it has been able to do what it was advertised to do back in the late 1800s increased my productivity we can now make more candy with the same number of people and what it does is it rolls the candy it does the job that I used to do there is some templates I have located under those mats I used to protect my table feel carefully you'll see that we're getting ready for candy cane season and those are templates for making candy canes we're not going to be using those today now we have to pull the log of candy into Roth's and I've been calling them rods but the industry term for them is canes this term was borrowed from the glass industry where canes a glass were pulled and cut into beads using a similar technique called Miller Flores I want to take this time to apologize to you for not putting on a video lately we've been very busy making candy and we've been doing a lot of work preparing for a Kickstarter campaign which is now over and was quite successful we're gonna be traveling around the country to shoot some really cool candy making videos for you and if you didn't know about the Kickstarter campaign and want to find out what we're gonna do just go to Kickstarter and check us out I want to personally thank you for all the unbelievable support through that Kickstarter campaign we're gonna be able to do things I never thought we could afford to do thank you so much [Music] the last step of the process is to cut it into pieces and then we can go for the quality control check fortunately I have a group of people here who are happy to volunteer to be my quality control checkers [Music] I think this may be the first time that when somebody saw my candy up close they were actively unsure if they should eat it or just save it as a piece of art [Music] we appreciate you watching our video today if you liked our candy and want to try it for yourself you can go to our website www.youtube.com and Twitter too and if you ever come to Tallahassee we'd love to see you in person we call our candy public displays the confection because we do it in front of the public and you can come ballet we don't make candy all the time but we do make a lot of it and you can see us make candy in Tallahassee thank you for watching you", "jcbJVcJrzrU": "hello and welcome to lofty pursuits in public displays the confection in Tallahassee Florida today we're going to make some pink grapefruit image candy with me and Marky and we're gonna talk about the history of pink grapefruits because it's humid we heated the sugar a little hotter than normal it's about 315 to 320 degrees and it's already flavored with pure grapefruit oil and yes you can get oil out of a grapefruit Marky is pouring this hot sugar mixture onto our cooling table which is a giant steel heatsink it's going to drop the temperature a whole lot and change it from a liquid into a semi solid so he can start sculpting it into the artwork that will be the final candy mark he and I take turns adding color to the hot sugar solution I'm adding pink and he's adding yellow the yellow will be the skin of the grapefruit the pink will be the inside wedges we've got to do this before the candy cools down on this cooling table if Zuma gets dropped quickly because soon it will be in a shape that we can sculpt it into its final artwork if you look carefully when we stir you'll see that steam is coming off and the candy solution is boiling the sugar itself is pure sugar there's nothing to boil in there but it's so hot any water in the food coloring boils out almost immediately and turns to steam and this is good because we leave the moisture in there the candy would be sticky in its final product [Music] grapefruits are sour and that's what this white powder is it's pure citric acid going in and that's gonna make the candy nice and sour so that it tastes like a grapefruit now we have to separate our artists palette of colors clear pink and yellow and we're going to separate them and let them cool even more by letting them drip you see the inside of this candy is very hot where it didn't touch the metal but where it touched the metal it is cooled off almost to the point of being solid we need to have urge this out and turn it into something with the consistency of a stiff clay over the years people have asked me what the favorite flavor of candy that I make is and the answer is grapefruit and I realized I've never made a grapefruit video before now grapefruit we don't sell separately we sell as part of our assortment pack it's a citrus assortment pack of orange grapefruit lime and lemon not only is this a delicious assortment but it's also a great way to train a new candy maker as they're all the same and design so there's a lot of repetition and repetition will make smoky and excellent sugar Smith's over time you may have noticed we only put the citric acid in the white that's not a problem you see the white is gonna be in every piece of candy and it's gonna hit your tongue and your tongue doesn't have endpoint accuracy on where the taste is so as long as we get the right amount of acid in every piece it's gonna taste just like you want it to but we need to make part of it white and the citric acid being white itself hides beautifully in the white and we do this by pulling the candy on the hook this is both a harder skill and a hotter skill to master than most people think and here goes marque as he's going to do a beautiful job with it this is just about his first time soloing doing this [Music] we sell our grapefruit online as part of our citrus assortment which includes lime lemon orange and grapefruit and you can get that on our website too w WP e D net and check out the website there are all sorts of cool things there to ever come through Tallahassee Florida please come and visit we're open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. we don't make candy all the time but we have brunch in the morning and serve ice cream in the evening and if you're lucky you can catch us making candy because we do make a lot of candy there we're going to start building the art for the grapefruit and we're gonna do this with six pink wedges one wedge for each ledge of the grapefruit marquee and I shaped the grapefruit wedges and let them cool just a little bit so that they'll hold their shape I pull the white and I picked my strength against the candy this will be a line stretching across the diameter of the grapefruit grapefruits have their start in the Western Hemisphere but their ancestors did not they are a cross between a Jamaican sweet orange which is actually an ancient variety and a pomelo which comes from Barbados it probably started as a naturally occurring hybrid it came to North America in 1823 here in Florida in a town known as safety harbor it didn't originally go by grapefruit either it went by Shattuck or shoptalk until sort of in the mid 19th century when it changed a grapefruit because the fruits unlike most citrus forming bunches around the tree or at least that's what the documentation says I have a 40-foot grapefruit tree in the backyard of my house and on a good year I get 200 grapefruits and on a bad year I get 800 grapefruits and I gotta tell you these things don't seem to clump together in more than bears on my tree and then in Texas the first pink grapefruit was found naturally and it became extremely popular and they discovered if they did some breeding they can get some that were absolutely blood-red but unfortunately in a short time they faded back to pink they solved this problem by exposing the trees to radiation yes some cesium it seems and the radiation locked in the red mutation this may make the red grapefruit the first genetically modified organism end up on our supermarket shelves and this is why we make our candy grapefruits make now we built one giant piece of candy and we have to mass-produce it down to about four or five thousand pieces and we do this by scaling it we first have to get a little narrower here as we convert the log into rods [Music] Marky's scales down the candy on the batch roller this big metal machine makes this a little easier it keeps the candy spinning you see it's still sort of a liquid and if we leave it still it will go flat under its own weight by spinning it like this we get to keep it in a round shape and keep the image we've worked so hard on from distorting we now have two things going on and one is our patreon page and thank you patreon subscribers if you're a subscriber you already know that you get almost daily updates about what I'm

patreon is they're allowing you to make this podcast public after a month you can find the lofty Procedures podcast on most podcast services but you can also find it on our website WWE there's a new podcast button in the upper right hand corner so the podcast that's going to cover this video is going to cover the music its origins its connection to history and its connections to grapefruit as

a lot and you may be lucky enough to catch us doing it and thanks to everyone who visited in person we really appreciate that too thank you for watching see you in the next video [Music]", "3V4wLZjxwY8": "what's going on you too so I made a video last night and I had some technical difficulties so be sure to hang out you can see it you guys really didn't miss too much but all you really missed is me talking about my ingredients and watching me putting it in and all that stuff but other than that you guys are good and check it out additive you're gonna add to your base very very strong you don't want to kind of make do all this and have it just you know you have to eat 10 candies to do whatever you're trying to do you want to make it worth it spend the money put the effort in and I assure you it'll be well worth it in the end so it's been about four and a half five minutes now and we are just crossing 240 degrees so I like I said this doesn't happen super fast it but once we hit around 270 degrees it will start moving a little bit a little bit faster so when you're flavoring with this recipe you want to use one of these kind of bottles you can get them at a Seymour Michaels any arts of crest or you can get them at Walmart when I went to Walmart they only have peppermint cinnamon and that's not my thing but right here I have cherry and I have an orange oil that I like to add so usually if you're going to say if you're going for lollipops or like life savers or anything like that flavor to get that exact flavor like they come out like it comes out of their factory you want it for this recipe when you use a half of one of these bottles and a half of orange oil bottle and it'll taste just like you bought some lifesavers what the orange oil does adds a little citrus and it just gives a little brightness to it but you don't need that I did a batch with just watermelon and you know I loved them they tasted great it wasn't super watermelon flavored and to be quite honest with you I hate the flavor of water now so these these oils then they they taste great but I know you're probably wondering why you don't add it now so you have it all incorporated it's all said and done well this is a different kind of liquid than what we got going on here obviously so if you added this to a 320 degree sugar base and this will probably burn out see they want you to wait till 250 degrees to add your additives if your flavoring but I feel like that is just way too late of a weight I like to do at almost 275 degrees you're gonna deal a little more heat when you gives you a little bit more time because once you add this stuff this is going to cool down drastically and fast so and one thing you don't want to do with this is mix it around a bunch because if you think if you live in New Jersey you walk along the boardwalk what do they make in salt water taffy so you keep stretching the sugar adding air adding air what's it gonna turn into a taffy it's not going to be as much of a hard candy it's gonna keep out again it's gonna it could turn into a candy corn which is honestly not a bad texture in itself either but it just now we're done for right now well what I like about doing these little candies and gummies and stuff like that is these molds there's so many damn cool molds that you can pick up like a robot dude here it got lollipops dinosaurs and it's like pixelated dinosaurs are pretty cool I seen Super Mario Batman ones like Legos you can actually take the Lego ones and build with them so there's like really cool stuff you could be doing with candy and if you get really good at it you know pull your kids aside and you can do a day with the kids and show them how to make the favorite candies and kids blown away that you can actually make this yourself it'll definitely be way more impressed with this than a batch of cookies that Pillsbury makes just don't have any funny business to it so we're crossing about nine minutes now it's a nine 10 minutes and we are hitting 250 degrees so in about four minutes we only went about ten degrees so once we're all mixed up and our basis set we add our additives we add our flavoring the name of the game is speed and just I don't want to say steady hand because if if you know me I am the last guy to ever have a steady hand you can people will hand me a 2 ounce ladle got a 2 ounce souffle cup and say fill up some butters just the laughs at me because I shake but for some reason I can do this pretty well but you want to almost come down and just go in a line 1 1 1 1 1 if you're just all over the place you're going to lose quite a bit of what you're doing here and nobody wants that but I would say 1 to 2 ounces for this batch usually I do a 2 cup of sugar 1 cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water and so I'll do it it's basically a double batch of this that I would do 2 to 4 ounces but this I think 1 1 2 2 maybe 2.5 ounces will be good all right it's been about 4 4 minutes later and we are just hitting 290 degrees so I'll check back up at the end a couple of minutes all right it's about 3 minutes later and now we just hit hard crack we're at 300 degrees so most people will want to go to 310 but we're going to 320 so I'll check back when we get there well it's about 30 seconds later we're at 310 so we're almost there so get ready all right so we hit 320 degrees so now what we're gonna do is so now this is a so now this is a hard Canyon and it's going to be very hard it's not going to be questionably hard and it's not going to be and it's not gonna lose its hardness from what we had so now we wait until about 270 degrees and we're gonna add about one to two ounces of whatever additive you're gonna add and your flavor so we'll check back in about five minutes when we get there so what I like to use to make my my tinctures or if whatever I'm going to make the most is I'd like to use either a leave o or a magical butter machine the the two of them it's it's perfect the you can perfectly adjust the temperatures and you could really make it long and really strong or you can make it really fast and get you get it done fast so if you're looking for a way to do it without having to you know use mason jars and stuff like that look into buying a leave out or a magical butter machine those two things makes the process so much easier and not just easier but it makes it stronger and enough of talking we're there so now that we're at 270 degrees we got to move fast so speed and accuracy is the name of the game now do not let any sugar touch you so first get all your stuff ready because you're gonna add at one shot so I'm gonna add my flavoring to my additive half I want of the cherry I'm gonna do and I'm gonna do half of the orange oil now people like to do food coloring and all that you don't have to I don't like it because I just don't like the I like the natural color that you get so this part you don't mix too much the more air you're gonna add the worse off it's gonna look so you got to be fast go okay so we're all mixed up don't know what to do let's go and then we pour accuracy now look guys I have super shaky hands and I'm go it's all about accuracy if you tried to reheat this it would still work but it's not gonna be as clear its goal is is clarity and just like I said if you reheat it you're gonna be mixing it again so you're going to add more air the more air you add the different the texture is gonna get try some of these but a nice steady pour and you could if and when we look you're going to tell that we didn't even have that much waste so this a little bit I got here and the rest I got here I can reheat and I can make other candies so what we'll do now is we're gonna is we'll wait and I'll give it about it don't take long about three minutes five minutes and these things will be rock-hard and check them out so check back in a minute all right everybody we're all done so let's take a look at what we got just like that all you gotta do is pop them out and move and look these things they're rock-hard they don't stick together nothing and you're really that worried you can get some powdered sugar and you're good look at that perfect so I got these little robot guys so many cool things you could do and I got these little dinosaurs so what I like to do is I like to have little ones and I like to have full-size ones because a lot of ones honestly where you're gonna find yourself like in these little small ones the best at least the parquet knees but like I said guys super easy super fast and anybody can do this you've got to get yourself two simple ingredients throw it all together and you're home free you can take these out in the lake with you and your fish and boom you're good but if you guys like what you saw today leaving a like subscribe don't forget to check me on instagram at the edge a chef and a lot of big things happening this week with medical edibles calm which I will be announcing later in the week so definitely be on the lookout for that because there's some big things happening I appreciate you guys watching and as always smoke on", "0bf4NtxIhNY": "hi everybody it's me Alicia Bunn thank you for coming back today and joining me we are going to be making some of this delicious kool-aid candy this is so fun and it's so good so let's get right into it first of all we're going to take a cup and a half of sugar and add it to a pan make sure you do not have your heat on just yet next I'm going to add a tablespoon and a half of cornstarch and I'm going to give that a stir and make sure my ingredients are mixed together pretty good you want your clean starch and sugar mixed together really good next I'm going to add a half a cup of light corn syrup and then I'm going to add 3/4 cup of water and give all of this a stir until your sugar is almost dissolved next I'm going to add 1 tablespoon of butter and then I'm going to turn my heat on medium and I'm going to let this slowly come to a boil you don't want to make this come to a boil too fast because you can you can burn where your sugar will burn a clown why's so I'll just let this slowly come to a boil you're going to need a candy thermometer I got this one at Michael's for about $4 and after your candy starts to boil you just want to stick it in and you want to let your sugar heat up to about 250 degrees Fahrenheit this is very important because this is what makes the consistency of your candy so you don't want to overcook it and you don't want to undercook it so 250 degrees Fahrenheit once it's reached 250 degrees Fahrenheit then you can turn your heat off and we're just going to move it off of the heat and I'm going to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract I'm going to stir this really good until my vanilla is completely dissolved and then since I'm making three different flavors I'm going to separate this into three different bowls so I'm going to try to get it close to an even amount in each Bowl if I don't know well but my three flavors as you can see our orange blue raspberry lemonade and watermelon so after I have my bowls all distributed evenly then I'm going to pour my package of kool-aid into each one I use the whole package here but my candy turned out really really sweet it was really good but it was really sweet so I actually recommend only using half a pack for this amount of candy if you were going to do one full batch of what I did instead of separating it use a whole package but since I divided it into three separate parts I should have only used half a package of kool-aid so after you have your kool-aid in each Bowl then you're going to start each one until all of your kool-aid is dissolved completely you want the color to be bright and pretty and you want the flavor to be evenly distributed so all of your Chanti has that really good taste so I'm just going to mix this together really good and then I'm going to mix my blue one in my orange one as you can see here it's already starting to thicken up but you want to let this sit for about 15 minutes before you actually try to touch it because it is hot and it does cooled down but you don't want to burn yourself so here's a third of my flavors mixed together and they've been sitting for about 15 minutes so you can see on camera that even they look thicker now - so I'm just going to move them on to the side and place down some wax paper so that I don't make a mess all over my cabinet because this stuff gets really sticky so have to have my wax paper down I'm going to take some more butter if I'm just going to coat my hands with this stuff because this candy like I said it gets really really sticky and really messy so coating your hands with this butter is going to make it to where it kind of slides off your hands where I won't be sticking to your fingers and everything so give yourself a generous amount and cover your hands then I'm going to take my spatula and I'm just going to stir my candy and you can see here just how thick it is and after I see that it's thick enough to actually play with and give it a little touch and if it's cool enough to touch then go ahead and dig on in there and I'm just going to pull all this out and just start working it now I wish I got to show you the pink candy on camera but my battery died without me knowing so here's the blue one and the pink one looks exactly like the blue one you'll see it later but the consistency is really good I was really happy with the way it turned out I just have to keep adding a little bit of butter until it doesn't stick to my hands and I'm just working it and working it until it's firm and have to not drip all over the place this is a lot like the slime if you haven't seen that video I'll put it in the description below on how we made slime but it's a lot like the consistency of that here's my orange one and this turn got really good too I really like the colors it smells so good in here and I can't believe the taste it's just so so good incredibly sweet but really really good so after I got done with all my candy just for experimental purposes I had a few candy molds that I used and here are a few little flowers and I just stuck my Jandy down inside here and I stuck it in the freezer for about 20 to 30 minutes just to see if it would hold its shape so here they are cooled off and out of the freezer and I'm just gonna pop them out so you can see here how they turned out and I have to say I was really really excited and bummed that this picking time because they held their shape really good when I popped them out and I was so excited I thought they were gonna stay that way but sitting just in room temperature after a few minutes they started to turn into candy blobs so did not hold the flower shape but it was pretty cool to see that they did maintain the shape for a little while I think after a couple days if you would let them sit they'd hold their shape here my lollipops I did the same way in the mold refrigerated and then popped out then I actually kept these in the refrigerator and they stayed they held their shape the whole time until they got eaten behind my kids and then here are the stones I'm the same with them they really didn't make it past 24 hours but the time that they did sit in the refrigerator they held their shape pretty good so if you're not going to eat these right away I recommend keeping them in a cool nice and cool place but after a couple days this stuff does stiffen up and become like a real taffy candy so I hope that you enjoy it if you liked this video don't forget to give it a big thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe if you haven't already if you want to see more videos like this later thank you so much and I can't wait to see you guys on the next video see you later bye", "VeH8zfDrt9k": "[Music] hi welcome to infuse these the cooking show where everything is infused especially me today we're making lollipops this episode is brought to you by the body fast herbal infuse er you can save money on my favorite herbal infusion machine with the cove ruff house at the urban futurecom here's what you need to make infused lollipops you need 1 cup of granulated white sugar I have a cup of light corn syrup or a quarter cup of water and 2 to 3 tablespoons of infused tincture you can use alcohol or glycerin tinctures 2 teaspoons of flavored extract such as orange lemon mint or whatever flavor you like 6 to 8 drops of food coloring which is optional you'll also need some lollipop molds and a candy thermometer the first step is going to be to make your tincture if you don't have one already and you can use a vegetable glycerin or an alcohol tincture either way though you're going to need to deke are you for 250 degrees Fahrenheit for 25 minutes then put them in the hopper of the mighty fast if you're using that machine and then you're going to add in about a liter of 151 proof alcohol you don't want to go to the hundred ninety or any stronger with the herb oil infuser machine it will burn it up and then you choose the mighty long cycle that'll give you the right temperature so that four hours later you have a nice tincture just like this then you just need to strain it through the provided hemp cloth or whatever cheesecloth however you want to strain it out put it in a jar and then you have your your infused tincture that you can use for any kind of recipes such as this here now we're gonna proceed along now with the rest of the recipe we're gonna take our two sugars our that's both the corn syrup and the white sugar or put those into a very small saucepan I'm gonna put that over a medium to medium-high heat and just let it start melting and you also want ahead and add your water and at this point what we're doing is we're just making all this syrup turn into sort of a simple syrup and then we're gonna bring it up to a boil it won't be long all of yours Sugar's will be cooked together it'll turn real clear and start boiling and at that point you want to start monitoring the temperature make sure you have a candy different a candy thermometer that will go up to over 300 degrees because that's we're gonna do we're gonna boil this it'll take a little while but watch it very carefully because it can get hot really fast once it starts getting hot but as soon as it hits 300 degrees exactly we're gonna take that off of the heat [Music] and then that part we're gonna let it start cooling down now you're going to also monitor the cooling process because when eight hits to 250 degrees Fahrenheit that's where we want to start adding in the rest of the ingredients so I'm adding I'm using orange because I want to orange flavored lollipops here so magadh about two teaspoons of the orange flavoring then I'm also I'm heading in some yellow food coloring a little bit of red food coloring to make the orange lollipops and now I'm adding in the tincture you can use two to three tablespoons here I'm adding two I don't want to be too strong but you can add in two to three and you can evaporate it down if you want to first but it's gonna be okay but you can see now when I start mixing anything together it's still 250 degrees so it's going to start evaporating and bubbling out the remaining water for you already we're just going to continue mixing that down by hand very carefully it's still very hot until you see it'll all incorporate together and become very sort of translucent and sort of unified in color and you need to move pretty quickly here because you don't want to the candy to harden up which it does pretty quickly so you can put the lollipop sticks into the molds in advance and you won't have to be rushing through it like we did there but then we're going to pour that carefully pour the candy into the molds until you cover up the sticks of the lollipops and then after you have all your molds filled up you're gonna let that chill best in the refrigerator or freezer for one to two hours till they get fully hardened [Music] and once they're fully hardened you can pop them out of the shells really easy you can use these silicone molds that I used here they're perfect for this this recipe had filled up three of the molds that came with four in the pack but just filled up three of them came with the sticks if you like that

studios thanks for watching [Music] you", "AaGHDrI4EEM": "do you remember the old-fashioned candy with all the bright colors and cool images well I do and I thought they were beautiful to look at very Christmasy put you in this season but you know what they never really tasted that good these are handmade candies and it takes a lot of work to get those images in place seems like all they need to do is upgrade their flavoring and add some citric acid then they'd be delicious well unless you're making cinnamon or peppermint I don't know maybe I've only had the cheap kind because I'm looking in this magazine and these look fancy so I decided since it's my birthday month I'm going to order just random things that I wanted to try and I've watched this YouTube channel called lofty pursuits for a couple of years and it's always interesting to watch how he makes this image candy so I thought you know what I'm gonna order me a couple of these packages to see how they taste it took about three weeks for the package to get here and just when I thought they might have lost my order it showed up in my mailbox and of course I had to start digging right in because I was really curious about this package it's called Thanksgiving leftovers and it's supposed to taste like Thanksgiving food and that is very strange so I had to try it each 2.75 ounce bag costs $5.99 and they come with one of these fresh packets to keep the candy from getting sticky this package is the variety pack and I thought it was a good idea to get this one because then I can try all the different flavors and look at all the cool designs they come in different shapes and sizes somewhere kind of skinny and some are a little bit wider they start out hard in your mouth and then they dissipate where you can crunch them without hurting your teeth that's because of the air that is incorporated into a portion of the candy when he pulls it on the candy hook this one looks like a mug of root beer and I believe this one is a tutti frutti he adds citric acid to a lot of his fruit flavors and it really amps up the flavor and he won't know this one is called police Fox and it was inspired by Doctor Who and it looks like a little TARDIS inside this is a yummy raspberry flavor ignore my fingernails I teach elementary school and I just do my best these are black currant drops and I haven't tried black currant before I don't think but anyway these turned out to be my favorite it was the Thanksgiving leftovers that actually made me bite the bullet in order from lofty pursuits this time couldn't imagine how you could make Thanksgiving food tastes good in a candy so we're gonna try these he made a bunch of image candy and it was so successful that it sold out so quickly that he made it into drop form and he calls them leftovers to be sold after Thanksgiving this one was either cranberry or apple pie and it has sort of a cinnamon eat flavor there's also a merlot in there some I think this one was the buttered corn and it tasted okay it had a buttery flavor with a touch of corn this one I'm pretty sure was peach cobbler can't really go wrong with peach cobbler this one is honey baked ham and yes it tastes like you're sucking on a piece of ham and it sort of lingers in your mouth for a while too I didn't like it at first but it kind of grew on me this one has to be the pecan pie and it was really sweet and caramel II it was okay I guess but this one had to been the stuffing and I could not even finish this one I think it had garlic in it and celery powder I don't know if I got all the flavors that were available but I think this one was a sweet potato casserole and my husband recognized it right away and he liked it so that was kind of a fun little adventure for the taste buds I put them in a candy jar with a couple fresh packets and they didn't really last that long because we ate them pretty quickly so a big thumbs up for lofty pursuits these are fun beautiful colors and some wonderful flavors so I highly recommend thanks for watching", "xlfkPFBW36o": "hey Pennsylvania patience it's me again medical Mary let's melt down some butterscotch we're gonna try to make some hard candies with our SL and let's open some of these I put 20 in here we have 1/2 gram let's melt them down I highly suggest using a rubber spatula we're trying to stir this mixture because it's gonna get stuck on everything else even though I swear when you cook with these I will never lick the spatula because it tastes like rubber okay it's a weird taste to it so well melting these down you just kind of want to keep stirring it so we don't burn it we're get it stuck to the bottom it will start to melt if you want it to go a little quicker you can smash them up first but I kind of want to see how long it took just to melt when I need the Jolly Ranchers on here we had them crushed up and I had them on low forever they just it turn into this weird like you dumb mixture ooh so I'm trying them from full and I'm gonna go a little bit higher I have it [Music] when these all get melted we're just gonna add straight our so to it and I think a little butter but I don't know that I would add anything else so if you still want that candy to get part again and here we start adding all this sticky stuff I'm not sure that it would solidify and starting to clump together keep stirring the hardest part is judging like how many you're gonna make I put in 20 hard candies I'm going to use half a gram or so it's so hard to dos when we just need peanut butter cookies doesn't that look like peanut butter I think it was a good idea that we didn't start on low started around four but I don't even think it's been ten minutes and it's almost ready for the RSO and butter ah broke this dang injector maybe this will work [Music] ding-ding-ding we have a winner [Music] [Music] oh yeah there's a piece of plastic but I don't want to waste all this I'm gonna pour it in here everything's ready to go it gets cold fast and you want to pour it back [Music] [Music] you were there you were there I know you're incorporated with the mixture damn it give any court ring for top number two [Music] [Music] so like to see which is a little lip on it [Music] so far we have a nice little mixture [Music] [Music] we had a butter double chocolate [Music]", "U3IdxTpVE04": "hey guys today I have something a little bit

here and eat these for you here on this video review but I've tried them several times they're mango habanero just look at that these come in four and a half ounce size packs but very large pieces of hard candy probably at least thirty in here this has a very very delicious mango habanero flavor it's the mildest of the three not much heat from this one at all but a really nice delicious fruity mango type flavors what you're getting from from this one I think this would be for everybody it's really not that spicy I'd probably put the heat on my one to ten scale at about a 1 out of 10 but very very delicious so this is their mango habanero if you like that combination if you especially if you love mango and fruit and you love hard candies I definitely recommend this one now this one is delicious guys this is moving up in the heat department a little bit this is their whoops their orange ghost chili hot candy look at that dragon on there and now this has a nice sweet and sour blood orange type base to it I think this is the favorite of three this has a little bit more heat coming from the Ghost Pepper so you definitely can tell that it's got more heat than the mango habanero it just kind of fills your mouth all over with with a very very to me low level ghost pepper type burn but super super delicious blood orange flavor to this one with a little more heat I'd probably put this one maybe at a 3 out of 10 oh my one to 10 scale it's kind of hard to give heat ratings for candies it's so subjective but I'm just trying to give you an example of how I would rate them for heat so maybe that will help you and then this one here guys this is their hottest one this is the one made with Carolina Reaper now if you love cinnamon type candy if you love Hot Tamales or if you love a those fireballs you're probably going to really love this one so it's got a nice cinnamon spicy flavor to it this is the hottest of the three and I think it's probably seems a lot hotter than maybe you what it is because of the cinnamon I think cinnamon candies sometimes come across as being a little bit more spicy but you could definitely tell that because of the Carolina Reapers it are in here this is spiced up probably to about a 5 out of 10 on my one to ten scale the longer you keep it in the mouth you got to give these time as you suck on them and keep them in your mouth you've got to let it dissolve a little bit and then you can start getting more of the flavor you could start getting feeling more of the heat to sum this one they may want to take this out of their mouth for a while and put it down and maybe get something to drink it may reach that level to some but it does you know heat the mouth up pretty good with that nice awesome fiery cinnamon flavor so about a five out of ten for heat on my window ten scale but great candies highly recommended once again this is the Carolina Reaper hot candy I think the favorite to want to really enjoy the most is this one this is the orange ghost chili hot candy I really loved that blood orange base and then the very mildest of all of them once again is the mango habanero hot candy so thank Texas Company out guys once again

we'll see you guys later [Music] you", "FAWkFq5zPi4": "hi everyone there's flowers on 1970 and this morning I am going to show you how I make my suckers it's basically the same way you make the candies your quarter cup of canola oil which I already put in the pot your half a cup corn syrup I use beehive please do not use like Aunt Jemima or anything like that like pancake syrup don't use that use beehive or you can use a no-name brand I believe that is bought a fresh coordinate Aunt Jemima because it won't turn out so we got our quarter cup of oil in there we have our half a cup of corn syrup and I'm going to do the 3/4 cup of white sugar while there's no numbers on it so I had to put a mark on the stove so medium it depends how hot your stove goes to be quite honest so I keep it if it was numbered I think it would be number four or five on the stove so I'm just gonna stir in the goodness and don't worry about it all being granule e because it will dissipate it'll heat and it'll go to a liquid state so there we go get my candy thermometer you will need a candy thermometer it has to go up to 300 degrees because 300 degrees is the hard candy state so I put that in there and put my timer on the stove for 12 minutes just so I don't forget that there's something on the stove I have done that before so we let that go and it sometimes goes from 12 to 15 minutes depending on the temperature of your stove you don't want to burn it because it's a total waste of ingredients especially the can of butter so I have my sucker trays I have my sucker sticks I'm going to make 20 suckers I believe it is we'll see how many we can get out of the mix I should be able to make 20 suckers and their happy face suckers so we're gonna watch this boil which is probably gonna be boring so maybe I should pause it you know we'll just let it go if I pause it I'll probably rough it and shut it off or something like that so I'm gonna go get my ball and I'll be right back piece got my tea got my bong so yeah it takes about 12 minutes or so to reach 300 degrees I do stir it occasionally just to move the mix around the butter doesn't always cling to you'll see it's kind of like when you fry eggs and you put oil or butter in the pan you'll see a little bit of the the residue on the outside of the item you're cooking and that's basically what happens here so I try and stir it all together but you're not gonna get it all mixed even when you're pouring it out you'll have some butter left over and I call it sweet butter there you're see see how well that's bubbling that's what you want so we got nine minutes left and I'm not even sure what kind of candies I want or what kind of suckers I want to make today I have caramel watermelon Apple raspberry butterscotch and cherry I'm thinking cherry what do you guys think wish I was live so I could ask you guys so butterscotch or cherry I don't know I'm gonna put them in my hand I'm gonna do this I'm not even gonna look I'm not even gonna look and I'm gonna pull one out and that's which one I'm gonna make cherry so we're gonna have cherry suckers yay sometimes I put food coloring in them just to give them a little punch of color I don't always do this just because sometimes my friends when they're over here know munch on some of my candies and one of my friends this is allergic to dyes so I don't know maybe I shouldn't only two batches of suckers I'll do cherry and butterscotch and that way she can have butterscotch because there are no colorings in the butterscotch well I don't have a butterscotch colors though so as you can see it bubbled very vigorously and then it fell down so that's all normal don't think it's too high of a temperature as long as you have your thermometer in there your candy thermometer and you're paying attention to the degrees on the thermometer and keep in mind that 300 degrees is hard candy state so as long as you reach 300 degrees with your mix even a little above 300 degrees you will have a hard candy it will solidify into a hard candy state so we are at almost 375 we have 6 minutes left to go and I'm gonna take some of my medicine in a little store today so I have some Skywalker og lapped no more CBD oil that did not last long I wish it lasted longer who excuse me so I'm also gonna take you once this is all done I'm gonna put you on the other part of the counter over there and we're gonna pour out the candies so I'm thinking what a neon color or just regular color for the cherry probably regular color yeah so I hope everyone's having a good day I got my healing health compassion center shirt on and on the back it says THC and CBD equal healing so yeah this is from my local compassion center I went to a little party that they had they had their two year anniversary and I went to their anniversary party and they had games and they had some really nice food out there some cookies and cakes and sandwiches and it was really nice and they were handing out these t-shirts so it's it's an extra-large I am NOT an extra-large person but I got myself a nightgown it works so we are reaching 300 degrees and let that bubble a little longer clean up my mess over here so I can put everything down on the counter yeah so hope everyone's having a good day hope it's a beautiful day where you are it's very warm out here today I think right now it's almost reaching 20 degrees and it's I don't know not quite 11 o'clock yet so I guess we're in for a hot day I was hoping for a cooler day so I'm shutting the stove off because it is at 300 degrees as you can see it said 300 degrees whether you can see that or not I don't know so we shut the stove off I need my knife so they're very hard to open at least for me so I gotta score it with the knife whoo there goes my bone there's the cherry oil oh my gosh it smells amazing maybe I should do too just so that we have really good flavor oh my gosh what did I do with my knife I am just not with it today folks know I'm a little out of it I had a good sleep though come on okay there we go - dreams of cherry we're gonna stir this baby around you can see the smoke that's okay it's just the oil you can smell it it smells amazing so I'm gonna move you over to this part of the counter so that I can show you please excuse the dishes in the sink oh no is that gonna work okay yeah please excuse this think I have a few plates in there and some stuff from doing all the baking yesterday I was just too tired to do the dishes last night but after this batch I'll do it there's no suckers gates and not prepared you are known to propose so we put the sicker sicker sicker stalks stick oh my gosh sucker sticks say that five times fast in the trays so when you pour the hot candy mixture in here that is going to push down the sticks okay so here we are oh I know something I forgot to do and I got to do it before the candy mixture goes in here you got to do this folks you have to use complements butter flavored to lubricate the sheets for the candies so I have to do that right now so that my suckers come out of the containers so there we go we're ready to pour it into the funnel got the dye today guys so there we go we got the dye in there so they look like cherry coming on folks [Music] so here's our funnel we just pour it in you're going to see the butter remain on the top some of the butter that didn't get mixed into the mixture which is fine because we just reuse that again and they pour off the SX and just put that aside so where are we at I'll go this way so he just pour it out maybe I won't get 20 suckers but that'll be alright a few is enough just munch on these throughout the day so be careful not to overflow just one enough in there sometimes I twist the stick so they get coated I think I have to do that this time too so that they stay in there sorry for the sniffling folks they still have that little bit of a cold going on oh we're gonna get 20 suckers hi mama oh wait that's Molly and because there's still so much in there I'm just gonna pour out the butter the oil I have another tray I don't know if you can see this pink one over here I'm just gonna fill that with the rest of [Music] they smell amazing you guys I wish you to smellivision love cherry so there we go that's it and then you stick them in the fridge or the freezer for about 10-15 minutes and they will solidify but with the suckers I can't move them like that I'm turning the stick so that they all get covered with the mixture and they'll be gooey and all stick together instead of this one didn't even go in excuse me I'm so sorry about that everyone it's I really feel like I have a cold I should probably be wearing gloves but because I'm the only one eating these suckers so we're gonna let them sit there for about 20 minutes I'm gonna put this one in the freezer and there you have it so I'll just let these solidify I might even put these in the freezer and you see if the Train will fit there we go good thing I didn't go shopping and fill that freezer full of stuff yeah so it smells amazing in my kitchen smells sweet and there you have it folks and in one of my videos I will show you the actual suckers but there you go just let them Harden in the fridge and I don't know about 10-15 minutes maybe 20 minutes if you want and pull them out and enjoy so enjoy everyone have a great day love and peace stay tuned stay unique bye", "SjbUk89pY7Y": "that is so good don't get greedy Jeff Hayley sorry I was like so sophisticated when we met a little hard to do that whatever it's great

"[Music] hi guys I'm Jen John's welcome back to the channel today I have another episode of my amazing homemade candies for you now this is probably the one that was absolutely most requested out of all of the homemade candies that I've been receiving and it is homemade Jolly Ranchers I'm gonna be showing you how to make homemade Jolly Ranchers there the little rectangle ones you can also do them square if you prefer and I'm then I'm going to be showing you how to do them in lollipop form so kind of like two videos here and you know like at Christmastime when you have gifts that you have to give to people that are like not always on your list but you want to come off as like this really cool person that gives gifts to like everybody but you don't have a lot of money and you kind of want to be cheap with your gift or is that just me but anyways I think that making these homemade lollipops and giving them away to gifts for Christmas time to like anybody that you meet is a brilliant idea so let's get started on this tutorial to make our homemade Jolly Rancher candies we're going to be using one and a half cups of granulated sugar we need 3/4 of a cup of clear corn syrup you can use dark corn syrup if that's all you have but it will affect the color and it may affect the flavor of slightly we need 1/2 a cup of water and then the secret to Jolly Ranchers is in the citric acid we're going to be using 1/4 of a teaspoon to a half of a teaspoon you can even add more if you want to now citric acid is a natural occurring fruit acid and what we use it for is to enhance the flavor of the candy we're going to use a gel paste to add a bit of color to the candies you don't have to but if you want that traditional Jolly Rancher look you do need to add a little bit of color to it and for the flavoring that your original flavors are watermelon grape raspberry apple and cherry my favorite is a blue raspberry so I'm going to be showing you guys how to make the blue raspberry but all of the flavors you would follow the exact same procedure that I'm going to show you up next and if you're looking for the candy flavoring I find mine at bulk barn in Canada and you can also get them at different times of craft stores or cake decorating stores and I'll also put a link in the description box to everything that you need here so I've got my sugar here in a saucepan on top my element I'm going to put it on to around a medium heat and I'm going to add in my water and the corn syrup and these are the only ingredients that we put in at this point so what I'm going to do is just stir it until the sugar actually dissolves and once the sugars dissolved I can put my candy thermometer in to the pot and then we're going to heat it to what's known as hard crack which is around 300 to 310 degrees Fahrenheit once your candy has come to temperature we're going to add in our other ingredients so I'm putting in my coloring and it's going to bubble and hiss for on us here and I'm putting in a 1 and a half of these little gems of the color of the flavoring you can do that adjust it to your flavor to your desire whatever you want it to taste like I just found that one wasn't quite enough to get that real Jolly Rancher flavor so while it's still nice and hot here I'm going to add in half of a teaspoon of the citric acid so again if you actually like when I was testing this recipe I kind of I had a real jolly rancher went you know what it's way tartar then I remember it being so you could even put more of that citric acid in if you so choose so I've got this nice blue color here you just want to keep stirring it until most of those bubbles are kind of gone it's kind of working them out here if you leave the bubbles in it's really no big deal it just gives a little bit of texture to the candy and you might want it to be a little bit more smooth you can see it happens quite quickly now I'm going to pour it into I've just got a bread pan here with a parchment paper lined in here I'm just going to let it cool in here now I'm going to let it cool for about 20 minutes or until I'm able to start cutting it and then I will show you how to score it after we've let it cool for a bit once the Jolly Rancher mixture has cooled we can remove it from what we're going to do now is for it so I'm just taking a sharp knife that I've got I've sprayed it with some nonstick spray and I'm just making the places where I want the candy to be able to break or cut once it's cooled completely so you want to do this while it's still relatively warm because that's the only time once it gets really hard you aren't able to manipulate it like this it will just crack on you so if you wait too long it doesn't work but if you do it too soon you actually will find that it's really difficult to cut and that your cut lines will disappear and that it will just melt back together so what I'm doing is I'm just starting at the center and then I'm working my way towards the outside here and once your knife starts to get a little bit sticky you can reapply the nonstick spray or vegetable oil whatever you've got handy so once I've got it going that direction I'm going to turn the other way and I'm starting in the middle both times because what I found is like when I'm working it does press the Jolly Rancher little area here it changes the shape of it and I just found that working from the middle and outwards towards the outside had the least impact on the shape it still does change it as you can see but it's kind of the easiest rather than starting at one side once the Jolly Ranchers slab has cooled you can start you can either break it with your hands here or you can use the knife or something to to actually cut it in half it's quite easy to break into these little pieces so I just kind of prefer to do that and if they just have they end up like together like that you can take a sharp knife and then just help it along like that so I'm just going to finish breaking these all up and then you can wrap them up in like little pieces of plastic if you want to and you could put them in a little jar and give them to your friends makes a cool little gift so I'm going to show you how to do the lollipops next so to make the lollipops what I'm going to do is use this sphere mold it's just got nice little round domes on the other side now you're going to take the lollipop or the Jolly Rancher pieces that either you didn't like or you just have extras if you want to and you want to really squish them into the mold it's going to miss shape the mold to start with but what you want is that to have enough inside of it when it goes to melt it fills up the whole thing or you'll end up with like kind of a weird wonky looking a little like sucker there so I'm going to pop these into the oven it's preheated at 375 degrees and I'm gonna put it in for about 15 to 18 minutes I want to make sure that all of the Jolly Ranchers have melted completely so once the Jolly Ranchers have melted in the little mold all you have to do is take a lollipop stick and insert it into the center there just pressing down to the bottom and it will be a little bit wobbly if you try to do it while they're still super super hot so you can let them cool briefly before trying to put the sticks in so you can see that a start kind of starts to tilt over but I've got some ones over here that I have already finished and I'm just going to pop them out you just have to like play with the mold and cuz you have them like shoved in here quite hard you got to pop them out so there we go a little Jolly Rancher lollipop so there you go everybody how to make homemade Jolly Rancher candies it's a totally easy and I hope you guys thought so too don't go easy on the citric acid because that is definitely what makes it a true Jolly Rancher or you just made yourself a plain old lollipop now you know that I love the blue raspberry like I told you guys and the watermelon though mm-hmm it's delicious too totally amazing if you liked the video please give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and leave me a comment about what homemade candy you want to see me make next and I might just pick yours and thank you so much to everybody who suggested Jolly Ranchers because this was a delicious tutorial see you guys all again next time bye", "pUhJnKKQDTE": "as marijuana becomes legalized throughout North America [Many] are trying edibles for the first time as a healthier option but with Edible marijuana Providing such a different experience than smoking how does it work and is eating pot Actually better for you? When you heat cannabis you effectively change the chemical makeup of compounds within it called Cannabinoids Smoking heats it to around 800 degrees Celsius and converts thc a to Delta 9 thC which binds to receptors in your brain making them continually fire and causing your imagination, thoughts and perceptions to magnify this is why every thought can feel like a significant one and Because it travels straight from your lungs into the bloodstream and to your brain the drug works within minutes and lasts about two to [three] Hours, but when making edibles the weed is heated to around 150 degrees Celsius burning less of the actual plant and minimizing Carcinogens ThC is Lipophilic not water-soluble so the activated Thc must be dissolved into something fatty like oil or butter and once the substance is consumed the onset of the high is delayed as the drug is absorbed more slowly through your gut but this high typically lasts four to eight hours and most report feeling more high than Compared to smoking marijuana [this] is because when you eat edible weed the ThC is first metabolized by the liver before entering the bloodstream and here Delta 9 thC also becomes 11 o h thC which Passes the brain barrier more rapidly and is a more potent chemical so using the same amount of marijuana You actually get more high with Edibles because it ends up creating both Delta 9 ThC And 11-OH-THC which is a stronger compound and because there are more? psychotropic types of Cannabinoids acting on your neurons you'll be high for longer of course you also get to skip out on the toxic chemicals that smoking provides like Carbon monoxide Bronchial Irritants and tumor Initiators smoking anything means you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules so if you can get high without smoking it will be healthier for your lungs and body the downside it's much harder to control the High you'll get because it can take up to one to two hours to feel the full effects and the dosage can vary significantly modulating the effects or Titrating as it's called is much more difficult [and] as a result you can end up a lot higher than you intend - but unlike those who consume too much alcohol Opioids or other drugs you won't be suffering any serious long-term harm Toxicity [or] Lethal overdose if you do consume more than you intended [if] you've ever wondered why marijuana gives you the

handed out to more than 60 families at a food bank at the First Baptist Church in Roy this morning the church partners with the Utah Food Bank Fox 13 Sydney Glenn is in Roy tonight Sydney what are police saying about this well let's ask them ourselves right now I am live with sergeant Gwen and they are responding right the second you can see all of the officers behind me talk to me about the latest several children accidentally ingested this candy today yes a little after 3 o'clock this afternoon we were notified that a five year old girl was in the hospital for a THC overdose and we learned that the candy she ingested was provided to them through a Food Bank donation center here in Roy and so what you're seeing now was our officers are actively reaching out I believe it's 72 different families to make contact with them to ensure that we can recover as much as we can make sure those children who have ingested are seeking medical attention so you said to me earlier five children and told so far you have confirmed have ingested there's two of them in the hospital how successful have you been in reaching out to those families so we're looking at reaching out to 72 families and I think so far we've contacted I believe it's 44 families and we haven't been notified of any new victims probably within the last couple of hours let's talk about this huge response that you have right now for something that has never happened here before it's never happened here before and I can say probably for the first time in my career here we've actually called out half the department for an incident such as this you know and it's just a mistake and this is what it turns into you guys learned so far well we've learned so far that we need to be able to respond to these with haste to make sure that no other children are injured or two maybe notify those who aren't aware of what's in their donation that they need to be looking through them probably more carefully to ensure that this doesn't continue and we unfortunately have a bunch of volunteers who are trying to do a good thing and unfortunately this is what a yeah such an unfortunate situation I also spoke with the Utah Food Bank earlier today the CEO says she's just absolutely horrified about what happened the president and CEO of the Utah Food Bank said they were absolutely horrified that this product went out she went on to say she can easily see how volunteers would not have known what to look for a spokesperson for the agency said the THC candy donation came through a bulk commercial donation the CEO of the Utah Food Bank expressed her apologies and said they are changing their procedures to make sure this never happens again so if you are one of those people that did get that THC infused nerds rope you're asked to call the Roy City Police Department if your child has ingested that you should call the Utah poison control we have all those phone numbers for you on our website Fox 13 now calm for now live at the Roy City Police Department Sydney Glenn Fox 13 News Utah", "GlCw8icMXRQ": "[Music] my friends welcome to wheats the marijuana a show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at a new product new brand and we are taking a look at I don't actually know the name of this brand I think it's the master bud teller doesn't have an oh sorry the master baker 420 and they're lovingly named multiple Bayer Gazans 200 milligrams again from the master baker 420 very small edible company Emily seen them out a couple of places the gummy bears look a little weird never seen gummy bears that look quite like that very shitty packaging generic little prop 265 label seems to be prop 215 label cheap little ziploc bag with some cheap little stickers on it never a good sign no ingredients no laboratory testing also very bad sign but it was a more expensive than then you would imagine at 15 bucks for 200 milligrams for gummy edibles is a little bit higher that's a little bit more than so like you're at a pure or infused creations normally for that price so hopefully it'll be good I don't have a lot of faith I generally find to be gum needs to be not very good I've found a few exceptions to that rule but again the exceptions that prove the rule and generally shitty packaging no laboratory testing are pretty big indicators that something's gonna be a pretty shitty shitty product but will give it its fair shake hopefully they taste good and hopefully they'll get me high at 200 milligrams they certainly should so I'll go ahead and shut up give them a taste and if you guys have never tuned into a wheats root review before the way they work is I'm gonna eat the product some number of it in front of you maybe not the whole thing don't wanna bore you to death and then I'll come back to you guys in two and actually let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review so okay nice little tear open packaging easy to open it's always a plus so here are our gummy bears very again weird we are looking gummy bears it's not focusing very well there but nothing like I've ever seen before a lot of like crystallized sugar on them let's give it a taste mmm not bad certainly taste better than infused creations or at a pure it doesn't have that really astringent cannabis taste there's a little bit of a cannabis aftertaste but it's not nearly as bad again as the sort of more egregious companies yeah not bad slight cannabis taste but not gonna make you gag so guys I'm gonna finish off these multiple bear gasp limbs which I do kind of like that name and then I'll be sure to come back to you guys in two hours to actually let you know how we're feeling so thanks for watching weeds and I will see you guys in just a bit peace welcome back to weeds guys there have been no bear gazans to speak of certainly not multiple bear Gazans not that I really know what a bear gasm is but I assume it's kind of like getting high or having a normal gasm orgasm and this is nothing like that this is like having shitty gummy bears and then not much else happening after that yeah there's not much to say about these they're bad they don't taste as bad as a tepee roar infused creations or some of the other really awful tasting gummies out there but they're just as weak as those in terms of potency and even shittier packaging and maybe a little bit more expensive than those as well so uh straight-up no thank you when it comes to the master baker 420 I think I might try some more of their products review some more cuz I think they have some things that are more confectionery in nature your brownies your cookies we'll see if those are any better but a really bad start so far for the master baker 420 with the fun named but not so hot of a product multiple bear Gazans 200 milligrams that's a total total pass for me if you guys see these skip them no problem saying that well that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys sorry for the bummer hopefully next time we'll have something a little bit more fun for you I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a future review peace", "njfnqSonUw8": "hi welcome to much makes it today I'll be showing you how I made Jolly Rancher James these are the supplies you're going to need a little goes a long

period of time you will know that I am NOT great at keeping the promises that I make sometimes although this one still has hope I'm just you know giving you a fair warning if I don't get two to four of this week but anyway some of you may remember that a long ways back I made jello Legos with these molds which did take me a couple of tries but they ended up looking okay and today I figured I should try to get more than one usage out of these $23 Lego molds I decided to take some inspiration from a tipsy bartender and all the other channels that have been doing shot glasses made out of Jolly Ranchers recently and use that same concept to make these Legos instead now there's a couple different ways that I'm considering doing these one of which I am assuming is going to come out the best but I will try a few so let's get right into it now if you are if you are out there that is more intelligent than the YouTube algorithm meaning that you have at least one brain cell and you make any amount of sense at all you would be able to assume that we need a whole lot of Jolly Ranchers for this project if this video gets taken down by YouTube you all know why but what I decided to do was to tump out the entire bag and to separate each of the five colors into their corresponding bulbs while also unwrapping each individual candy piece and this step is just about as fun as this time-lapse looks but once you complete that we can move on to the first method that I will be attempting and that is the double boiler method I've seen people melt down different types of hard candy like this before which is why I think that this might work so I've started with a few of the cherry flavoured because I tended to have the most of those and get even a while to melt down in the bulb and if you guessed that this was going to be a thick sticky mess than you were absolutely correct every single utensil I tried to use to stir this just did not work and got stuck everywhere the candy never really melts down completely to a liquid form it just stays really thick and the second you take it off the heat it thickens up even more so I tried my best to put the mixture in one of the little molds and let it cool down which as you can imagine was also at a C and a half but I guess when I took it out of the fridge it kind of worked a little bit but I think we can do a lot better for method number two all I did was stuffed each mold with different colors of the Jolly Ranchers I used four in each of these blocks which I'm hoping won't be too much or too little and once I had one of those molds completely filled I threw it in a 400 degree oven for about seven to eight minutes that's it for you if you're gonna try to make these things if you see a ton of bubbles in the top of the candy that means your oven is too hot or you left them in for too long but all you really have to do is just go in and try to pop them with a toothpick or a different sharp object just a little bit of extra work so avoid it is possibly but once I had done that that into the fridge for about 15 to 20 minutes until it hardened up and these look a ton better they still didn't take perfect shape of the molds they really didn't get all the divots in it and you can kind of see the crevice where all the candy is kind of melted together so I made one more batch like that and they came out just about the same the last thing I want to try with these though is to do the same method but halfway through the baking process put another different mold on top so that way the divots from the top mold will hopefully melt down into the candy so you can stack them together I did a few batches with that method and they came out even better than the last one so I tried to build some stuff with them I tried to make a nice little candy staircase and I guess that came out pretty cool I tried to make a YouTube logo which came out pretty crappy if you ask me honestly and lastly I tried to build a wall with an accurate representation of the theoretical integrity of Donald Trump's [Applause] one last piece of advice I do not recommend being overly aggressive with these or dropping them from any sort of height because they're kind of fragile and will chip a lot being that they're hardened candies they're actually almost on par with being just as fragile as a drama channel's YouTube career but I hope

make awesome homemade lollipops hello everyone today I'm going to show you how to make lollipops at home using three different methods store-bought candy molds free form on a cookie sheet covered with a silicone mat or parchment paper or how to make your own mold using cornstarch making your own cornstarch mold is actually pretty easy all you need is a shallow container I'm using a baking dish that's kind of small but I was only making a few lollipops in there put in the cornstarch you're going to smooth off the top using a spoon or maybe something like a like a popsicle stick just drag it across the top to smooth it out you don't want the cornstarch to be compacted because you're going to be using a some kind of object in this case I'm using I'm going to use a juice bottle cap I'm going to press that into the cornstarch to make the mold cavities now I made a mistake here I dumped the cornstarch in what I should have done was sifted the cornstarch into the container and it would have been kind of light and fluffy and I wouldn't have the problem I'm having here when I was pressing the bottle cap into the cornstarch I had to press pretty hard it was sticking to the cap and made the bottom of my cavities uneven so sift the cornstarch smooth it out gently and then press in whatever object you want to make as your candy these are hard candy lollipop molds I bought these online because I couldn't find any locally I'll put a link in the description box if you're interested to prepare these you'll need to spray them a little bit with some cooking spray just so that the candy releases well now these are specially made to withstand high temperatures and are for hard candy making you could also make chocolate lollipops with these as well but do not try to make hard candy lollipops with molds the clear ones that are designed for candy melts or just for chocolate because they will melt nd I bought two kinds I bought just the plain round ones and I bought flower ones but there's a whole pile of different ones available okay so here we go on to the actual candy making in a large saucepan place two cups of white granulated sugar a quarter cup of water and two thirds of a cup of light corn syrup you can also use the golden corn syrup as well it'll just affect the final color of your candy if you can't find corn syrup where you live you may be able to find a candy recipe that doesn't use it you just might have to look around a little bit now to flavor this candy I'm using some orange extract I put in one at teaspoon they actually sales specially made candy oils for candy making you only have to use a little bit and if they have intense flavors I didn't have any in the house at the time so I just used the orange extract now you're going to begin to heat this mixture over high heat at the beginning you're going to have to stir continuously because you don't want it to scorch or stick to the bottom and at this point you can also add some food coloring if you want to change the color now I wanted to match the orange extract so I added some yellow and some red to make a nice bright orange color I'm using paste food color but you can use the liquid food coloring as well now you're going to need to stir this continuously until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you can stop stirring now I've seen some candy recipes that ask you to add in the coloring and the flavoring after you're done boiling the candy either at the beginning instead of the end and it still worked out okay so I don't think it matters so I'm a mixture has come to a boil now you can stop stirring and you need to continue to boil this until the temperature of the mixture reaches 310 degrees Fahrenheit now in order to be able to tell you've reached the right temperature there's a couple things you can do you can use a candy thermometer these are relatively inexpensive if you're going to make candy often go and buy one because they're really really useful if you don't have a candy thermometer or don't want to go buy one you need to heat your candy until it reaches the hard crack candy stage I'll put a link in the description box that shows you what that means now I turn the heat down just a touch from high to medium high I just made sure that the candy continued to boil until it reached 310 degrees once it reached the right temperature I transferred it into another container that had a spout on it just so that it would be easier to pour once you're done pouring the candy out of the pot into the other container do not scrape down the sides of the pot or the bottom just leave the residue in there and I'll show you how to clean that pot out in a minute now at the beginning you'll notice that your candy mixture will be very runny and I'm going to fill the hard candy molds up first with it you just pour enough in to fill the mold and try not to add so much as if they leak out into the handle or where the lollipop stick is going to go the lollipop sticks I'm using are actually paper and I purchase them at the bulk barn but you can also buy them at candy-making supply stores or baking supply stores so I just push them into the candy and there was a bubble there so I just burst it and push the candy onto the stick now I'm going to fill the cornstarch mold cavities with the mixture same thing just gently pour it in there now I'm very intrigued with this cornstarch method and I think I'm going to try maybe another video and try to make different shapes and this time I'm going to sift the cornstarch in to see if it makes a big difference but you can imagine how much fun you can have with this so I filled in all of the mold cavities and then I added the sucker stick or the lollipop stick I just put it in there gave it a little bit of a turn and then just gently press down on it to sink it into the cornstarch so that it was in the center of the lollipop now another variation that I actually saw on Martha Stewart website was it you can add sprinkles and decorations to these while the candy is still hot these are little fall leaves sprinkles different little maple leaves different colors and while the Candy's hot just sprinkle it on and just gently press it into the candy and let it harden and you've got these little decorated pops you can decorate for absolutely any occasion as you can imagine I had these little pumpkin sprinkles as well so I press some of those now for the freeform lollipops if you're making them freeform without a mold I suggest that you allow your candy to cool a little bit when it cools it won't be as runny and if it's not as runny it'll be easier for you to control the flow and to make nice little round lollipop shapes if the candy is really hot and are really runny it may leak all over the place and you'll get very very thin lollipops the Martha Stewart website actually suggests that if you're making them free freehand like I'm doing here you take your pot when you're done boiling it put the pot into an ice water bath to cool it down a little bit more quickly but since I filled all those other molds first by the time I got to the freeform method it had cooled down quite a bit so as you can see it's a bit harder to get the same size of same shape but it's the same idea you pour it on and then you add in your lollipop stick and you can see here just by looking when I was pressing in these sticks that they had it had cooled significantly and you can even add candies in this case I'm pressing in some candy corns because it was near Halloween time that I was making these and the cool candy had cooled quite a bit so I had to press them in but it still worked quite nicely now as far as cleanup goes when you're done with the pot put it immediately in the sink and fill it with hot water and just the hot water sitting in the pot will dissolve any of the candy that's in there the same thing goes with the rest of your utensils like the this measuring cup that had some candy left in it and any measuring tools you have like a spoon or maybe your candy thermometer put it in let it sit in the hot water and the candy will dissolve all on its own or you can even take the pot and put it back on the stove filled with water and just let the water simmer and you'll simmer away all the candy as well so you can see it's sat there for about an hour a lot of the candy has gone out of the measuring cup and all the candy has disappeared out of the pot as well so it's nice and clean so cleanup is not a nightmare if you just are patient and let it sit in some hot water so I refill but measuring cup with hot water and let it sit and give it a stir every once in a while and the candy will just dissolve right off your container so you're going to let those candy molds cool completely and then you're just going to pop them out of the mold and they should come out quite easily I did spray these a little bit of cooking spray first and they popped right out and they are just gorgeous I was very impressed with this first attempt using these candy molds so there are some flowers the candy stick is cold white adhered to the can you don't have to worry about it falling off and here are some of the ones with the little sprinkles on them and the lollipops are nice and clear so you can see them from this angle which kind of looks like they're floating in the ambi or you can look at it from this side as well pretty cool these are the ones I did free form and they should come right off the silicon mat you'll have a little bit of an imprint from the silicon mat on the back of the lollipops and here are this cornstarch lollipops just take them out tap off the excess and then you can wipe them down with a clean dry towel to get rid of more of the cornstarch and the core starts in the container you can reuse that for baking put it back in the container or you can use it for more lollipop making as well it's completely reusable now here are some of the completed lollipops it made about two dozen of them and they tasted great they tasted just like orange now these this is one of the cornstarch ones and you can see the back of it is not smooth and it actually looks a little like the surface of the Moon it actually holds details quite well which is kind of interesting here's another cool recipe it is for candy apple chips this video will be going live on November 4th 2013 so if you're watching this video after that date please go ahead and click right on your screen or see the link in the description box and if you're watching it before

I am currently quarantined with may family inn our home in Los Angeles. Across the world, people's stress levels are high. Now, more then ever, it is important to keep our immune systems working at their peak. Getting adequate sleep is key! Hi, I'm Darnell Cox with Live Young\nLifestyle and today we are talking about SLEEP. Now health advocates have been\ntelling us forever that we need are seven to eight hours of sleep. Sleep\ndeprivation and especially chronic sleep deprivation has been linked to high\nblood pressure, heart disease, heart attacks, stroke, diabetes I mean it's very\nvery unhealthy. So sleep deprivation has also been linked to memory loss because\nyou need to be able to sleep in order to turn those short-term memories into\nlong-term memories. And there's a whole host of other things. Everything from\nyou're more prone to accidents. I mean the biggest national disasters that have\nhappened like Chernobyl or the Exxon Valdez a lot of the different plane\nflights those crashes have happened due to sleep deprivation. So if you think\nthat you're immune to this and you're gonna walk down a flight of stairs and\nyou're not increasing your risk of falling and breaking a hip or anything\nelse. You need to think again. In addition to that, your sex drive is also affected.\nThe research is now showing that men who have sleep sleep apnea that's untreated\ntheir testosterone is much lower so your desire is much lower your performance is\nmuch lower. The more time that you spend actually getting restful sleep the more\ntime you spend in bed doing other things. so now that we know how important sleep is. I'm gonna give you my tips to having your best possible sleep. And it starts\nby creating a sleep sanctuary. Now we spend a lot of time and a lot of money\nadjusting picture frames by our front door and making sure that there's\nflowers or at least I do. But we spend all this time with the with the part of\nthe house that our guests see. And very little time really creating the best\nsleep environment that we can. So first of all, you gotta love your\nmattress. I mean if your mattress is giving you pain, make the investment and\ngo get a new mattress. Love your sheets, make sure that you've got comfy cotton\nnice sheets that you love that are soft. Another thing that you need to do is\nthey're saying now that the temperature in the room should be between 60 and 67\ndegrees for optimal sleep. That's really cold but it's better if your environment\nis cold and your bed is warm so I sleep with mine at about 67 and it kind of\ncreates this place where you just want to snuggle under the covers so that's\nanother tip. I love this red light. Something that we have to do is power\noff our TVs our computers our phones all emit this blue light which messes with\nour melatonin and so if you change that and shut off those screens at least\ntwo hours prior to sleep and use red light instead, it promotes melatonin\nproduction and starts making you sleepy. So for those of you that are like the\nlate-night you know Instagrammers, Facebookers, tweeters and textures, whatever you're doing on your phones before you go to bed and then if you're having a\nglass of wine while you're doing it you are setting yourself up for an insomnia\nsession. So that brings me to alcohol you need to reduce your alcohol intake and\nthis is a big one for some people it's a big one for me.\nBut I have realized that when I stopped my last glass of wine at 6 p.m. that I\nsleep much better. I mean we think that alcohol makes us sleepy because it is a\nsedative and it makes you kind of drowsy but you have fitful sleep so you wake up\nthroughout the night so you're really not getting the rest that you that you\nreally need.  So if you're trying to make sure that you're getting those 7 to 8\nhours cut your alcohol intake or stop it after 6 p.m.. So have that glass of wine\nwhile you're cooking dinner and then cut it out.  And then you start reaching for\nthis is my favorite tea. This is an organic nighty-night tea.\nIt actually has passion flowers so this was from native South Americans they\nhave been using this to kind of calm down your scent\nnervous system. So I always have a glass of tea and it's little pot so this is my\nlittle nighty-night tea and I start drinking this probably a couple hours\nprior to bed that's the goal there's a couple hours prior to bed and I've got\nno screens on and I'm walking around with this little red light on so that's\nthe that's one of the ways that I get sleepy. Another way is to start eating\nlike melatonin rich foods these include fruits and vegetables such as cherries\nasparagus, tomatoes, pomegranate, olives, grapes, broccoli, cucumber, goji berries,\nand a ton of nuts and seeds like walnuts almonds, peanuts, sunflower seeds, and flax seeds. If you need a little bit of extra I love these sleep gummies but people\nmake a mistake with these melatonin gummies all the time you do not need\nmore than three milligrams. I see all the time on this on the store shelves that\nthere's five milligrams people are taking two or three of those. They're\nreally tasty because it's kind of like you're eating like candy it's like a\ngummy bear you know but it's this as a moon but you don't need more than three\nmilligrams in fact one milligram is usually optimal up to three milligrams\nand that's it if you're eating five. If you're taking a five milligram melatonin\nthe next day that sleepiness can kind of still be there and so what happens you\nhave that extra cup of coffee your caffeinated throughout the day and then\nthe whole cycle starts again. So you want to stay off the alcohol and the caffeine\nyou know after like the caffeine after three o'clock I think the alcohol after\nabout six switch to melatonin rich foods and your tea make sure that you're not\nstarting that whole cycle again with taking too much melatonin so you only\nwant the three milligrams now remember if you're gonna take the melatonin\ngummies that you need to take them about an hour and a half to two hours prior to\ngoing to sleep.  So I wouldn't have these necessarily on the side of my bed I have\nthese downstairs so that I know I take them right before I go upstairs takes me\na while to like put on all my potions and get ready for bed and by then\nyou know had the red light on and I start getting a little bit sleepy. So\nthat's it those are my tips on getting a really good night's sleep prioritizing\nyour help by making sure that you're getting those 7 to 8 much-needed hours\nof sleep,  that's a really good way to live young and on that note, Good Night!", "MF5p6hFDAHY": "hey guys emulator can be kind of three items from Morgan Chris that took these students oh thank you very much I have to ha to you bytes one

so thank you exist the other regular ones nothing I take your word for it so thank you Maureen crucial services and we'll get you next time [Music]", "bwbZTN4fMGM": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'll be showing you how to infuse starbursts so delicious and surprisingly was one of the easiest edibles i've ever made and i feel like i'm going to make these many times in the future they turned out so well [Music] to make these starbursts here's what you're going to need some starburst candy i wish i could have had the all pink kind but we don't sell them in canada so i just got the original infuse coconut oil and optionally you can also use a concentrate or extract to make them extra strong and some lecithin to help with absorption first i have the top part of my double boiler and then i'm going to peel the wrapper off of some starbursts and place them in the bowl i use 30 pieces here but the amount you use doesn't matter too much the recipe is very forgiving then you're gonna heat up a pot to a light boil and place your double boiler container thing on top and then using the spatula you're going to use to mix everything together add a scoop of some lecithin and then mix that in they do take quite a while to melt so just keep an eye on them and for the first five minutes or so they probably won't melt that much so you can pretty much just leave them be but then after five minutes when they start to melt like this um just keep stirring them and watching them until they melt all the way down then once everything is pretty much melted like this we can add our coconut oil so i'm going to be adding one tablespoon of coconut oil but you can add for this amount of starburst up to three tablespoons of coconut oil and to make it stronger i'm also going to be adding some concentrate now we just have to mix everything together so i'm having some trouble getting the starburst and the oil to emulsify together you can see um the oil kind of just doesn't really blend into it at all so i'm going to grab a whisk and see if that'll help us emulsify a little bit better so using the whisk aggressively actually turned out very well everything mixed together and it worked better than i expected honestly now i'm just going to put my starburst mixture onto a baking pan that is covered in waxed paper and then i'm just going to place another sheet of wax paper on top and kind of roll it and shape it out to the thickness i want in the end i feel like i wish i would have made it a little bit thicker so it would have been the exact same thickness of actual starburst but next time i'll do that i guess and then i just use this sharp utensil to kind of just shape it so i could have nice corner edges and then i placed it in the fridge now while i'm waiting for it to cool in the fridge i'm going to heat up my double boiler again because um i don't want to waste any of the starburst and the coconut oil mixture that's left in the pot so i'm going to make a little drink out of it so i have a whole video on how to do this and to be honest that video is going to give you a much tastier result than this one because this is just like a little makeshift one i did and i'll post the link of how to make that drink below pretty much you're just going to add some water and heat it up so you can get all the mixture combined and then you're going to add a drink mix to it and then cool it and serve it over ice but check out the video i have on how to make an infused starburst drink because it's like literally one of the most delicious drinks i've ever had and you can put quite a bit of coconut oil in there and you can't taste it which is very surprising considering how much i put in it okay so now that our drink is made and our starburst has cooled down a bit i actually left mine in the fridge a little bit too long it was about a half an hour and i felt like it was a little bit too hard for me to cut easily so i just took it out of the fridge for five ten minutes until it was ready to be cut so i'm just going to start by cutting these little edges on the side which i'll probably just snap on while i'm cutting and then i'm going to cut all of these into squares after i cut them i realized that i feel like the size was not accurate to the size of a starburst so when i make these next time i'm going to actually place a starburst on there and measure it out now they're all done so i'm just going to throw them into their little container and that's it they are ready to eat [Music] these turned out so well i'm so so happy with them this is probably going to be my go-to instead of gummies now they just just everything is amazing thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thanks so much guys have a wonderful day [Music] you", "rvn0xep-EsY": "hey guys Shayna here so today I'm a bit of a different video I'm going to teach you how to make homemade hard candy I'm gonna making watermelon flavored umm I've tried this recipe or a similar recipe once before and I accidentally burnt it so I'm hoping this is going to turn out a bit better I got a candy thermometer for Christmas I love candy so I'm gonna try to make some and I'll show you how to do it for your ingredients you will need two cups of granulated sugar 1 cup of water 2/3 of a cup of light corn syrup you'll need one teaspoon or just one small container of candy oil I am using watermelon flavor you can use whatever you'd like and if you'd like I'm going to put a touch of red food coloring in it you're also going to need a saucepan a cookie sheet with parchment paper on it and a candy thermometer so we're going to start off by mixing in the water the sugar and the corn syrup you are going to put it on a medium heat in the saucepan once the sugar is completely stirred in and dissolve into the water then you're just going to let it sit no stirring and boil until it hits between 300 and 310 degrees Fahrenheit also make sure that you can zoom over to does not touch the bottom of the pan it has to be taking the temperature of the candy not the pan the mixture is just starting to boil but about 100 degrees to go make sure that you don't have it on too high of a temperature because you don't want to burn the sugar one thing with candy making is that you have to be quite patient it takes a while to boil if you have a gas stove that is better it's best to have constant heat on it it works on your ways but it does take a bit longer be patient we're now getting quite close to 300 degrees if your guys can do oil to make it flavored when you put it in be sure to keep your head away from the pan because it will send up some steam and it is a very very strong okay you have to be quite quick when you stir it together and make sure you take it off heat first that smells delicious drops are red that looks so good once everything is all mixed in you're going to have to pour it very carefully onto here you want it to be fairly thin you can also use lollipop molds if you have them I'm just going to make hard candy that we can snap later let's hope this works crazy color okay we are just going to let this sit now make sure it sits at room temperature you don't want put it in your fridge and afterwards we are going to break it apart and taste it looks like it looks so good and smells delicious well cuz stringy it is I don't know if you can see that what's quite hot still I've got such a nice flavor can't wait till that's hard one quick tip while this is cooling make sure your candy thermometer you clean it off completely so there's no like little chunks left because otherwise next time you make candy there's chunks you're going to get stuck and the candy will get stuck to the chunks it just it won't work properly so make sure you clean this very well hot water works good okay so the candy is hard now so you're going to peel it off and just break it to pieces and make sure you put it in a continuous a good seal on it comes off so nicely there you have it this is a very simple recipe maybe a bit finicky and it takes a while but how to make just an old-fashioned kind of standard hard candy uh I will leave the link down below where I found this recipe if you'd like to try to make it and yeah I will see you guys sometime soon thanks for watching watermelon I love candy you can replace sleep with exercise so his suggestion was sleep for six hours instead of eight and use those two hours to go for a run or bike ride get some exercise", "oJKnXFcpcUI": "tis I miss cannabis puree with more reviews for you today and today I've got these sublime products here elevated cannabis is a 10 milligram THC we've got this little sorrento cucumber cucumber Serrano and the desert citrus blossom sublime products I love sublime products I've talked about them numerous times again the reason being is that they're really consistent these are no different than anything else and they are low dosage again 10 milligrams can you see it there 10 milligram THC I've already taken this because I already know what they do again they're so consistent that it doesn't matter from batch to batch they're always the same and what I think is important to discuss here is how they work and why they work for me and then maybe you can decide how they're going to work for you and if they'll work for you I take these as a preemptive strike these little goodies never make me feel high I never get that I'm high from THC feeling what I do feel is a ease of anxiety so when I know I'm gonna be in a stressful situation I take these beforehand for instance I ride my bike a lot there's a lot of places out here or there is no bike lane you know people just don't care either you do not get that three feet that they are supposed to allow between you and their vehicle they don't care there's none of that so a lot of times there is no bike lane I've got like this you know what's supposed to be the shoulder but it's just kind of where the asphalt kind of trails off into gravel and that little area I have to write it as usually filled with debris and rocks and things that I have to avoid so while I look as cool as a cucumber while I seem to not be worried about anything if you were to look at my hand you would see that I would just Knight white-knuckling it you know I'm just gripping so hard but these help a lot with the anxiety and it's why I look as cool as a cucumber because these help with a lot with that I usually would take them excuse me like maybe an hour and have two hours before I knew I was gonna be in the situation and they just smooth out that edge so I'm not in a situation where I go from anxiety panic attack it is very scary riding your bike on the side of the road because people are insane anyone who rides their bike knows this and you don't have to have PTSD to have that anxiety so if you you know bright a lot like I do I'm not gonna allow my fear to stop me from living my life so these candy has helped so much with that all right so I'm done talking about how great they are this also helps a social anxiety by the way social anxiety again they won't make you feel high they won't interfere at all for me anyway because there are such a low dosage didn't they just help smooth the edges now let's talk about the flavor these two that I have I've had one before it this one I have not tried yet so I'll try here but this one if you are a fan of spicy stuff which I am I love spicy it's got a nice little heat to it it's not spicy enough for me so it's not like flaming hot level but there's a little heat you know you feel in the back of your throat as you're sucking on it and the cucumber is really nice and refreshing so this is a really good choice I have other flavors of this that I like but this one definitely is is a go-to if you like a little spice and you like a little heat definitely this one now this one I haven't had so I'm gonna try it and let you know what I think mmm they come packaged individually so whether you know this was a sample this was is what I got at 4:20 hey from Phoenix suspensory and my swag bag I was so happy that I got sublime goodies oh shoot I need my scissors hold on so I find it difficult I find it difficult to cut these open on my own I mean you can't with your teeth but there's so much easier just use some scissors you know use the tools available to you in life so such as blossom then my first thought was tangerines hmm like those little halo candies but now it's kind of devolved back into like lifesavers orange that's what it tastes like lifesavers orange so the initial yumminess in my mouth it's still good but the initial mmm tangerine kind of went to orange flavor it's good I like it I'm pretty sure something have the same effect I mean as everything else does that sublime makes yeah okay so anyway this is gonna be short one there's really nothing more for me to talk about sublime products the flavors of these candies are good they're not too sweet for a hard candy I think that's great I don't want too much sugar even though I love it and I know that's important for some of you would diabetes so not too sweet these are really great 10 milligram THC again cucumber Serrano and the desert citrus blossom both great helped a lot with anxiety if you want to get a high off of them I'd eat a bunch but keep in mind there's only five in a pack I got these for $8 I believe I eight dollars five and a five of these little candies so 50 milligram is basically for eight bucks which is not bad it's pretty much in line with everything else but again if you need the high feeling take more than one then then just figure out what your dosages for you as with everything else so I'm gonna enjoy the rest of this candy you all have a great day thanks for stopping by if you like my videos and you want to see more just subscribe to my page please maybe like the videos let me know you're watching say something every now and I feel like I'm talking to myself but I know I'm not cuz I see you guys are watching so I'm gonna say bye now because I've got more to do I got more things to talk about I'll be back in a few seconds but it won't be like that to you bye thank you", "dmFGGXRKRac": "[Music] and delight edibles thank you for joining me my name is Liz and today we are gonna be making chewy buttery caramels now this is a great recipe because it rme the recipe calls for one cup of butter so it's wonderful because you can use different amounts of cannabis cannabis butter depending on how strong you want to make it so for myself today I'm going to be using 1/4 cup um however you can go half a cup three quarters of a cup of can about this canna by no cannabutter and and then you just use regular butter to make up the difference so as I said today I'm gonna be doing a quarter cup of can of butter will do 3/4 a cup of regular butter and it's a really simple recipe and I'm looking forward to showing it to you as well as I'm going to show you how you can make turtles so you can just have the caramel pieces or you can turn them around you can make some turtles for for yourself or for the holiday season alright so we're just gonna get started and thanks for joining is a heavy a medium heavy saucepan and what it means by a heavy is it's got the heavy bottom this allows for even heat distribution to make sure that your candy cooks properly and evenly a rubber spatula or wooden spoon and a tray what I did is I just made a tray from a wooden frame and lined it with parchment paper obviously you can use any kind of baking tray line it with parchment paper a little trick that I do is to make sure to get it to fit in properly as I make a little slit into the corners and that way they can do it you just they're able to tuck in nicely you just tuck the corners in and that way it sits nice and flat and you'll also need a candy thermometer and so I'm gonna get into the ingredients and we're gonna start cooking you're gonna need 1/2 a cup of brown sugar packed 1/2 a cup of white sugar now I've used I said 1/4 cup of my can of butter and three coins three quarters of a cup of regular butter make sure get it all in there don't want to waste any and you're gonna need a one can of condensed sweetened milk not the regular milk not the regular evaporated milk it has to be the sweetened condensed milk you plop that in there and one cup of light corn syrup now you should be able to use the regular corn syrup I've never actually tried it with it I prefer the light corn syrup mainly for taste I don't really like the molasses taste in regular corn syrup but in this recipe I can't really see what difference is gonna make other than making it a bit darker as I said I haven't tried it so I'm not sure so you want it to start to mix all the ingredients mixed together here now is very important was doing this recipe is once you start cooking is that you never stop stirring you can't stop stirring for even just a minute or reduced even a couple of seconds because it will start to burn and you'll start to see little brown flecks appearing in it so you said the whole time you've got a stir so you're gonna be doing about a half hour of stirring time you're gonna turn your heat onto a medium and a medium or medium low and you're going to continue stirring until the bitter end so we're gonna be cooking this to a 234 to 240 so 234 is gonna give you a nice chewy but a very softer caramel the 240 is gonna give you that that chewy but really stiffer caramel so depending on what texture that you particularly like is the temperatures are gonna go to I'm gonna be cooking it to 237 because I wanted a little bit firmer than that really soft but I don't want that really really firm almost break yourteeth firm caramel so 237 is what I'm gonna be cooking it to and you're just gonna continue to stir clean off the sides of your pot and yeah enjoy put some tunes on and dance away so continue stirring until everything is nice and melted and there's no more lumps and everything is nice and smooth and at that point you can add your candy thermometer and then I said you're gonna cook it to between 230 to 34 to 240 and don't ever stop stirring so we've been cooking now for about 10-12 minutes and you're gonna see these candy the caramel is starting to darken up getting more caramel looking and it's also getting thicker you may not be able to see it but trust me by my arm it is getting a lot thicker and we're almost a temperature and so as I said continue stirring until you get to do your desired temperature alright so we're just coming up onto the 234 so at this point if you want that softer chewy caramel you would pull it at this point submerge the bottom of the pot in cold water that's what I've got sitting beside me there and to stop the cooking process right away otherwise so the heat will continue to rise for another moment a minute or two making it a little bit firmer than maybe what you'd like so if you want to stop the cooking process right away somewhere at the bottom of the pot in some cold water alright so my temperature now is 237 I am going to pull out the candy thermometer and submerge the bottom of the pot into cold water beside me to stop the cooking process so as I said you just want to stop put it in the cold water to stop the cooking cooking process and then you're going to immediately pour it into your pan that you've set up with your parchment paper earlier all right so for this I'm pouring half of my mixture into my pan there so that I can make caramel pieces and then I'm gonna be poor than the rest into a funnel so that we can make the pecan clusters or Turtles whatever you like to call them and I'll show you how to put those together now we're gonna put our turtle together so just get a whole pecan break it in half and that's gonna be the main body part and you take the other half break a piece in half and that's gonna be the front legs and then get another half break the break it in half and that's going to be the back legs and then you're just gonna take your caramel with the funnel and you're gonna plop some caramel right on top in the middle and you're gonna do that for for all of them or if you don't want to make the little turtle shape which I wouldn't really bother with because by the time he gets a caramel in the chocolate you don't really see that it's a turtle so I just make some pecan clusters and top it off with caramel and then we are going to coat them up with chocolate once the caramel sets so it's gonna take about 20 minutes half hour for the caramel to firm up enough so that we can coat them with the chocolate so at about the 10 minute mark while they're still warm what I like to do is to form them into into more of a ball because they flatten out when they're warm and you poured the caramel they're kind of flat so what I like to do is kind of push them together so that it creates more of a I'll be it more of a shape that you want more of a cluster instead of it just being flat so I've gone ahead and I've already melted out my chocolate I've got that ready I like to use the candy melts they're really simple to use and there I just call them pretty much idiot-proof you melt them you dip them they dry it's great so you just take your cluster and you dip it into your chocolate and use a fork to be able to get off the excess chocolate so you just want to tap it remove any of the excess chocolate and then you're gonna place it on to the wire rack and I'll let it dry and what you want to do is to put a piece of parchment paper underneath your drying rack to catch any of the excess chocolate that drips off so it's not dripping on to your counters [Music] [Music] I've taking my um Turtles out of the refrigerator after 20 minutes if they're a little bit stuck to the tray don't worry just use a flat knife there to pry them off or if you just let them cool warm up a little bit they'll come right off and there you've got it PK clusters or Turtles your friends and family are sure to love these for the holidays they make a great gift idea sark caramel now is completely cooled is about two hours and we're just gonna remove it from the parchment paper so just take it out of the pan and remove all your parchment paper from it comes away really easily and just remove any little tiny pieces that may be remaining now I had a little wet spot for some reason in my mold so I'm just gonna cut that out and what I like to use for cutting is I like to use a pizza cutter you can use you can use either scissors or a butcher knife is really handy as well now usually I use a ruler but I couldn't find it today so I'm just gonna eyeball it for us here it's not gonna be very accurate but it's gonna give you the idea and I'm using a piece of parchment here just to be able to hold on to the caramel while I'm cutting it cuz otherwise it's slippery and I don't want my handprints all in it so you just press down and firmly roll the blade through [Music] once you have them all cut up into pieces you can wrap them up in parchment paper or wax my backs paper I prefer wax paper I don't have any today so I'm using parchment paper as you can see it's not the easiest to work with but the caramels not going to stick to it so I kind of wrap it like a little present just tuck the ends in and if you want you could add attack a little piece of tape on but as I said if you use wax paper it's great it just wraps up really nicely [Music] [Music] [Music]", "wnHEErptRfc": "when I was a little girl I was\ncompletely obsessed with candy I remember constantly begging my dad for\na dollar so I could get on my bike race as fast as I could to our local\nconvenience store where I would purchase as much candy as I possibly could for\nthat dollar and at that time you really could buy a lot for a dollar so in\nmemory of my younger obsession I figured we would switch up a few things and\nwe would make some liquor lollipops in this video we are going to make some\nmargarita flavor so let's go spice things up so on medium heat I'm going\nto add 3 cups of sugar 1/2 a cup of corn syrup and now 3/4 cup of the tequila mix okay so now stir this until the sugar\nkind of dissolves and then to add a little bit of color and a little bit of\nflavor I'm going to add the strawberry syrup and then one more teaspoon and\nthen stir it real quick and as you see it has started to bubble so now that it\nstarted to bubble we will want to stop stirring this and just let it bubble up\nand you'll want to take your candy thermometer and just check the\ntemperature and once it reaches 320 degrees we can add the liquor okay so\nin the meantime while your mixture is reaching a high temperature you want to\nget like a pan and line it with parchment paper or you can get some\nsilicone molds and just spray them with some cooking spray because you are\ngonna have to work really fast and so you want everything prepared and then\nyou want to get some sucker sticks also you can use skewers if you want and just\ncut them down alright that's looking pretty good between 300 to 310 is the\nhard crack stage that's why you want it to reach 320 okay so for the last\ningredient so now that this has reached the hard crack stage now we are going to\nadd some tequila this is just cheap tequila it doesn't have to be anything\nfancy and you'll want to add 1/4 cup of tequila and then I'm just gonna give\nthat one last stir to mix the tequila in and then I'm gonna check the temperature\nreal quick and you want to make sure it reaches 310 again alright guys if you\ncan see it's pretty much there at the 310 mark and just in case you're\nwondering it is kind of a long process it does take a while for it to heat up\nto the hard crack stage and then once you put the alcohol in it takes a\nlittle bit for it to heat back up to the hard crack stage as well but once it\nreaches 310 you can go ahead and just turn your burner off and then this is\nwhen you will want to work really fast so that you get perfect little\nlollipops because it definitely hardens really\nfast so I'm just going to pour mine right into the measuring cup so it'll be\neasy to work with okay so we're going to try really fast to pour it into the mold and then for the parchment paper you can\njust go ahead and just try to make little circles and then I'm just going\nto take some margarita salt and just put it on the top makes it a little pretty\nand really gives it that margarita drink taste and then you can take your sucker\nstick and just put them just kind of twirl it around like this and make sure\nit really gets into your syrup and then I'm just gonna lay my sucker sticks like\nthis because obviously these aren't real sucker candy molds but you can always\nbuy those at the store they actually do sell sucker molds but the whole point is\njust showing you you can really use whatever works for you or if you just\nwant hard candy you don't even have to add the sucker sticks it can just be\nhard candy okay so you can just leave it on the counter for about 10 to 20\nminutes until they hardened or if you want it done faster you can just put it\nin the fridge for about 10 minutes Aiden what are you doing getting a piece\nof candy see my boys have my same addiction of when I was a little girl\nwith loving candy my boys have candy jars alright so I actually put these in the fridge\nfor 20 minutes just so that they'd be nice and hard and if you can see they\nare done cuz you can hear it's nice and hard and then these ones really turned\nout really cute too so a little circle one and a little star and then these ones\nturn into like little cute hard candies so they all turned out really well\nI'll show you again so you can hear it so they did harden nicely and so they are done I hope you guys enjoyed making this\nrecipe so let's give it a try this is my broken one mmm this is really\ngood and if you guys have a favorite candy\nyou can send it to me and my boys and I will open it in an upcoming video where\nwe will try out all your guys's favorite candy and you can find my address in the\ndescription box below and if you have any questions just\ncomment below and if you want to see more videos please remember to subscribe to\nthis channel thank you guys so much goodbye and see you in the next video and just a side note these would be great\nparty gifts or party favors for adults", "DuWDJEI1NZo": "this is Sofia because it's not the same thing as Facebook where they're just going to stream in I wonder if I can share this on my Facebook though but I really just want to do a video so I guess anybody who comes in and just pick up when they come in so I want to get this done all right I don't know if I'm gonna wait for any people to arrive I'm just gonna start doing what I'm doing and if someone comes in that's great okay I'm gonna be making Jolly Rancher edibles with canvas so what I'm gonna be using is tincture you can get from you dispenser re I made it myself if this is a THC Pro and chem dog what I do is I actually cook live plants I have an illness I have fibromyalgia so I cook with live plants and I cook cooked the plants for about 24 hours in palm palm leaf glycerin you can get it on Amazon or anything like that okay so we're going to be using the tensor that I made which is an indica indica for night time I usually I just got finished doing the day but I want one for the nighttime we're gonna use 45 Jolly Ranchers seems to be the best for the the molds that I have which are emoji I'll show you those so it's white die very just unwrap them when you unwrap them what's going to happen it's cool they're gonna go like this this is not gonna be the situation afterwards okay afterwards you're gonna wind up with you're gonna wind up it's gonna be a little bit more sticky so don't anticipate for them to be like this I keep the rapper's after I drop them so there's 45 of them I keep the rapper's I will show you afterwards they won't go in the same way like this they'll go in from the side and it's kind of like the same thing and I'll show you in the end how that's gonna work out now so I use 45 of these I use watermelon I get them from Amazon I love them then like my what about one's my favorite and Jolly Ranchers are by far my favorite and one of my fav one of my things was trying to get this recipe so that when I put in my liquid cannabis it stays more like a candy I must have gone through so many tries doing this and it winding up you can actually cook if you wanted to cook less of them you could get like a gummy candy but my fake teeth so I'm not using that I need to have a solid candy and be able to suck it all the way through and and you know what I don't really want to eat them like that because when you start to eat them like that though you can get a little bit carried away especially with like my Jolly Ranchers I like to have probably one every hour or so so I don't want if I said chewy candy I'll just chew it up but not with these teeth okay okay so 30 milligrams depending on what you want it's tin sure you can use the alcohol tin sure if you wanted to just the alcohol will burn off you could use I used cooking hash before and I would just throw it in and it almost didn't matter what how many how many Jolly Ranchers don't kind of glue up back up the same way okay so I'm also gonna add a Tama butter just to keep the facts rolling because cannabis stays glues itself just absolutely glues itself to any fatty substance that's why it's good for them to go into baked goods brownies and all that's fun stuff so okay we're gonna I'm gonna use my like nonstick pan just a little tiny pan it's not gonna take much the smaller almost the better because I mean really look I just this and it's gonna be on the bottom and you want to be able to keep control of this now this has been on D carved you need some decor of your cannabis most of the time if you're going to do almost any cooking with it except I cook fresh so what I do is I'm cooking it fresh for 24 hours which actually then activate the cannabis so that and furthermore I'm now gonna cook it again now if you do a cooking hatch or you're doing a concentrate it hasn't been activated yet so you need to make sure to stay in this pot for like 20 minutes and try to keep it on 300 for that 20 minutes if you do that you should be golden okay so we're gonna get started now and I'm gonna put it on on a very low I haven't looked at the stove so and I'm currently I have an electric stove with this I hate electric so I so much more prefer fire if I was cooking but now that I'm cooking cannabis I'm so glad to have a an electric stove okay so I'm gonna throw some butter in I'm gonna take my t-shirt here I'm taking in 30 gram 30 30 milliliters milligrams no I'm not exactly sure mm ml in grams okay so it is at 30 taking me a minute to get this going to make sure that it's the exact right consistency your marijuana after you're using it okay so here is gonna show you here is the what it looks like in the pan and then I'm gonna start to you see that yes so let's get this going and like I said it's on a medium very not even meet him he on like a three I have it on very very low I just want to get the butter into the tint tincture I don't suggest you use a I suggest using only plastic utensils with this because the candy when it when it becomes a solid again it's going to get into the wood it just the my wooden spoons are just not the greatest okay so now what I'm going to start to do is so now this is all ready now if you were gonna do this with a hash you would start with the butter and really make sure it's on low and then start to cook your Jolly Ranchers I'm shaking you guys like nuts I'm sorry alright let me hold this a little bit better see that looks good so like right now I can the marijuana smell is starting to come up into the house now it's not a heavy duty smell this is probably lighter than normal but if you are gonna have guests your house is gonna smell like marijuana you may not smell it but your guests will want to give my sister cookies in public she's always says that they smell this is just gonna take a minute but you gotta keep it going you got a he picky pick go in keep it go in and it's gonna be funny because it's going to once it gets totally liquid it's gonna be really easy to work with but it's gonna get not easy and fast go a little bit slower to and you can see that the water the texture is starting to get pink and I have one viewer on here hi how are you I hope you're enjoying this please share it I would okay even though I've had a ton of people asked me for this and now I can just point them in this direction and they will be able to go and make it I'm always being asked on my social media to do videos so now I am doing them I'm just doing them live I can't see any comments if there is any so we're getting there we're getting there were getting there once these get warmed up and get heated it's gonna like it gets very gooey very fast and then it gets really really easy to work with I was very surprised how easy it was for me to work with this once it got melted because I have I have fibromyalgia so my I incorporate cannabis into my life because I have fibromyalgia and I think just by far is the best medicine that I take I think it would definitely be the last one that I would allow them to take from me if I had the choice I still I'm all medicines and I'm really working hard to get the right dose going with the cannabis but the more I the more I I know the more that I eat it the better I feel so one of those I like to have a second candy so I wanted to make sure to have I actually had a company that I was buying from and they had something that was called Ranchers and it's by want to say baked it's the company but really nothing nothing for the amount that I was spending on them I could just cook it myself and be done with it I don't want to be bothered with having to put money in other people's pockets when I am gonna be leaving my own money in my pocket and being disabled I gotta keep as much money as possible all right we're starting to really Eric we're getting there we're getting there it's getting there it's getting there it's getting there but I like to show how it's going it entire time so that you understand what what it takes to and what it's going to look like and not just oh all of a sudden it looks like this no it's gonna take you a minute to stir it and start it start started started sir they still have these candies left to go so but as soon as this gets all liquidy I will be able to start throwing in more and they will liquefy much faster and of course I would normally use my other hand to hold this still which I'm holding the camera with just so you can see it right I should get a stand we are getting there see now look how easy it's getting to be worked with like this is just so much easier now and see how the the tincture is still like it's not mixed in all the way so if you were to do it like this you would really have to whip it and like if you wanted to do a smaller amount say I guess I took about half in there where you wanted to make it a chewy you would like really make sure that you whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it and then put it in your mold but I didn't really need to do that because I am going to be keeping it solid usually I like throw maybe in a couple at a time but they almost all fell in anyway so I might as well just take it from there all right yeah I'm having a hard time because I normally just stick in a couple of something and I just said that no I said it twice and that's what will happen when you smoke cab as you'll say things twice some talking all right well hello hello my second person watching I'm so excited I cannot see comments right now if you are commenting there I have to push on the thing I have gloves on so I'm not gonna be able to see anybody comments but um please share [Music] everybody always wants to know how to make cannabis candy it's so easy so easy just so ridiculously easy now if you wanted to you could go to your dispensary buy like want to say an ounce of some nice you know some nice weed and cannabis marijuana pot have you wanna call it and you're gonna bring that home you would take a full pound of butter and first you would put the the cannabis in in a tin in a tin pan and you would put tinfoil over the top and then you would cook it bake it on low for [Music] see then it's not the recipe I'm just giving you extra because this is taking a long time you were D carve it so you put it in the tappan you put it in the oven with the tinfoil on top and then you bake it at like 125 so like 150 for two and a half hours no no no no you know what look it up on the internet I'm pretty sure it's one no no I'm so sorry this is not my recipe right now because I don't cook this way I always to cook with my pictures I don't ever use anything else so the fact that I'm trying to come up but this is old and I headed that's its problem okay so if you'll go to the Internet it's kinda butter and it really is just bake it you have to I think the baking in the oven could be for 25 minutes or can a be an hour of 25 minutes or two hours and 45 minutes I can't quite remember like I said it's not my forte I am going to make some kind of butter and get it right and then put it on live as well let me just put this down so I can get this going just first live ever so sorry for my one person who was watching alright I just needed to get in here a little bit like this but it's it's a very sticky but then you're gonna put the cannon we after you cook after you D carve it in your oven you're going to you're going to melt the pound of butter in like a saucepan and then put the cannabis into the butter now you died I think you're gonna cook for an hour and a half to two and a half hours I'm not exactly sure and then you would use the butter right into here and it would probably like even out you only want to use the wood you would be using like one stick so like an ounce and now it's a butter and that would be comparable to the tensor and then it would in my mind it would definitely come out the same way I don't see any reason why it wouldn't come out the same way all right all right but my one person is watching I don't know who you are but thank you so much for watching okay so here we are I see I still have a little bit there's still a couple in there but this is primarily what it looks like so it's not going to be as see-through as its start first started because we're use that we used butter so it has just a small tint on there this is so easy so so so easy yeah almost there I should have thought about this in the first place goes right into my crook of my arm here and I'm a little turning now see it's very I mean better than you would think it is but is when you're holding it but it is very easy to work with I was very scared that it was not going to allow me that I was gonna go get so stiff on me now you're gonna lose like a little bit like on the sides and whatever it don't really worry about that most of you medicine is gonna be in here it's gonna be nicely mixed okay so that's evenly evenly through all of your candy it's gonna be even it's not gonna be like there's a piece here and this piece here and this piece here and this piece there it's not gonna be stronger in one spot then it is gonna be in another so now these are gonna turn out to be about five milligrams of THC this might be ten I'm going you know what I'm gonna say it might be 10 because the I used the THC Pro and I used the chem dog which are you know pretty strong indica breeds strains so this one could be stronger it's not really intended to make for me it's just about kind of making it through the day with my pain so if I can put it on myself a little at a time that is just so much better for me and being that this is something that I like to I try to have to incorporate it into something that I like to do because I'm actually like handstand medicine until I was sick but cannabis just was not a part of my life I didn't do any drugs I didn't drink I didn't do anything but cannabis has just made a whole world of difference whether it just be for me being my fibromyalgia or the fact that I'm gonna have an attitude with my family and you know we're getting in there that the world is changing so see how we're getting now with that so good I love these they taste just so amazing I brought to my door and she was like no I don't want to eat it she really really doesn't what she likes to smoke it but she doesn't like the taste of it in her food so she put this one in her mouth and she's like oh my gosh this is so good okay so now what I'm gonna do is super spoon okay now I'm going to just hold you up here get this as good as possible kind of far away but alright I might have to put you back here alright so now at this point so easy mix it up still um okay now this is the special part because you want to get it in to the molds and put to the side is kind of as quickly Funko's you're gonna take off the heat so we are gonna go ahead and take off the heat I'm gonna leave it there okay for this second do this on the stove it'll just be easier to wash off so you I have emojis can you see that yes see they're emojis they don't really come out looking like that though they they kind of do but not really so they're adorable but they're also like all the other ones had like edges and I had one that have hearts on them and then it has the edge and then it's in my mouth and I really frickin hate that so alright okay so now you're just gonna take your spoon and just go ahead and stop putting it into the molds and that's about it feels like one spoonful almost wonderful but was CMI you see how bad I shake oh my goodness okay look because I want to not like have candy everywhere and of course with my shaking of course I do and at this point with my fibromyalgia I'm trying I usually yelling at my husband to help at this point oh I'm in so much pain but because I'm on here talking and I know someone is watching that my Adrenaline's running so I'm not in pain but I'm still shaking that also could be my nerves too from doing my first life fill my [ __ ] person it takes more Muslims more time to get this in here now I should be able to pick one out once I get them into both molds I should be able to pick one out and show you what it's going to look like should be almost cool by then I think might be yeah all right so this has this mold has 24 and so I'm doing 48 candies though I'm getting it everywhere okay seriously last time I did this I did not get this like this this is horrible I'm gonna put him gonna want to put this in my freezer after this into mist you can see it's true see you know what you know why because the spoon that I used last time was a little spoon that was like perfect every scoop fill was perfect this one's a bit larger and you know what I'm short if you know how to cook candy you're probably looking at me going holy God what the hell is this person doing she's just making like an absolute mess of it but I will show you that it looks like right now I still have the other ones that go so there we go okay so yeah I did get it everywhere cuz that's just the way it is now at this point I really need to get moving because it's starting to get solid on me you see the strings coming out that's it getting solid I'm just gonna let some heat go on that so it's not so bad because this is a horrible mess but you know what I'm gonna do right after it's done I'm gonna eat the candy that smoke that's upbeats because it still will come out perfect it's just on the side it's not a big deal still candy see I didn't do that last time I had nice what a mess alright it's alright here we go heat back on it cuz it's just a mess right now well it's hilarious see that stringy stuff should not be happening see that won't happen if you use a smaller spoon and it drops right off and it's like perfect at the zone I use is old and gross and I really don't want to show that to you guys so I don't want to show you that that's what I'm using because you should be used to make sure that like everything that you're using is good because this is your mess and it is going into your body it's just an old spoon and it has like it's like it says 65 year old spoon so you could just imagine you but it's clean and it's usable but it doesn't look like it's used I'm gonna wind up with less than 48 I think and I just think that's because I got them on all the sides but don't worry whatever you get into the hole this will go down into that area like and you still will have a good candy and you can like spread it although it just seems to be sticking to me but I'm sure that you could [Applause] see now I'm a little a little bit more salad [Applause] it's stupid super-sticky when you let it go this long okay I should be done by now super super sticky so see that so once it goes kind of past you got you just sometimes you're better and just get it done really you could put it into I would assume that you I could probably put it into one of those cake things that squirt it out but I am bought one I don't really big all right I know it's my blog right but it's so good all right [Music] and my face but I have candy on them [Music] okay so stove off I'm a dumbass is what it is the first one was pretty much better they're heavy alright so this is what we have I don't remember which side we started off with so I'm just gonna pick us up I'm gonna pick this side because there's a little one in here now I was still little and it's not wrong it's not cold enough I should have put it in the freezer while I was taking care of that alone I'd see it's gonna come out looking if I pop it out now they're not ready they're still warm you know I don't have it open okay so just you really don't need to put them in the freezer see this comes right off it came right off oh yeah it was just wipe it down and it comes right off with the pan just put hot water into the pan don't forget to lick the spoon okay so that's my lollipop but like the next hour I let this dry chemical right action this is what I know because it is a decent amount that's been here I'm just like okay so this was what's left over in the pan and I usually they look that behind because I'm gonna eat this for the next like half hour or so because I'm a high dose er today I didn't have any but normally when I'm going to cook I always wind up running out unless my oldest daughter is here and she will my youngest daughter will cook for me as well I just hate asking her because she works so much but at the time I am cooking something that means like I have not had like I didn't have any candies today because I really needed to cook but I didn't get my approval to do my online my life until today so I just waited I don't know why I don't want to take the tension or just regular like in my cup or something but so this is like a big lollipop in the end so you can't take heed that's all but normally I would like to start off with a candy and then and then I would probably maybe have one every hour every couple of hours and if I haven't had something all day then I'm looking to have something more like 25 milligrams or above by the end of the day I usually hope to have a BMI system around a hundred and fifty milligrams which is just perfect for my body my [ __ ] body feels really really good at the end of the day I'm never actually stoned your body it doesn't edibles don't really work that what's in some edibles could really like send you into another space furthermore these edibles could also do that em it really depends on your tolerance it depends on how much them how long have you've been doing it you know someone actually could be there they're just even one thing just and you could smoke it and smoke and smoke it and then edibles will just not work for you so but for me they work really really good with my fiber males I really really really enjoy the fact that I have something that's more on the holistic side to working and that I can make any medicine so this was my video on how to make Jolly Ranchers go over real

cannabis cooking and confectionaries here's Jamie hi y'all we're gonna do THC infused strawberry starburst cannon shoes start with two and a half cups of sugar 3 tablespoons of cornstarch you mix those together well then add our light corn syrup or water as well as our unsalted butter teaspoon of lecithin and salt stir that bring it to a boil up to 250 degrees once temperatures reach we're going to turn the heat off put our product in vanilla extract and two packages of strawberry lemon-aid kool-aid once again get that stirred up pouring that into our prepared pan let that cool about 15 minutes until it's ready to handle [Music] then comes the time to pull our taffy [Music] Apryl the tapping about 15 minutes until I reach the color and consistency a designer [Music] these can be

delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you stopped by and for the rest of you guys welcome back thank you so much so somebody asked me a few weeks ago if I could do nerds ropes and to be perfectly honest had no idea what those work so I googled those little puppies and found out that they're a gummy candy covered in nerds who sew off my kitchen I went a little experimented little tickety-boo and look at what up I can make your it's ropes so I am going to bring this recipe to you so without any more in further babbling here let's jump right into those ingredients what we're going to need and then let's get these guys made alright so the ingredients that we're gonna need for our nerd candies so this recipe is basically my W candy recipe with the cooked syrup and the reason that we're using the Kochs syrup is is going to help with those candies to stick better than just using the gelatin one so with that set you're gonna need about three or four boxes of the large nerds or about seven or eight of those small ones that are the two flavored ones you're gonna want one to two boxes of cornstarch and don't worry you can reuse it we just sift it up and you can reuse it over and over and it doesn't go bad so not a problem plus it's not expensive you're going to want two boxes of the small gelatin the three amps or the 85 grams two of those want three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin or three or three packages of the Knox a quarter teaspoon of kaurav cannabutter and we're going to melt this 1/2 a cup of either kanna syrup corn syrup or you can use inverted syrup if you don't like invert sugar if you don't like corn syrup and we're going to split that quarter in our gelatin part quarter in our candy syrup we're going to need 1/2 a cup of we're going to need 1/2 a cup of liquid so I like to use the kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters ones because it gives it extra flavor than just using water and it's pretty much like using water so you don't have to worry about things going bad so these are great to use so I'm going to use use a half a cup of this to bloom our gelatin and a half a cup for our mixture then for additional flavoring I know I feel I know these could be a little bit difficult to get is I use two tablespoons of drink crystals so I get these at the bulk barn Jurek from spring onwards they have me during spring in the summer during the winter they don't carry them or other box stores the stores may carry them otherwise you can just use the Lorena's oils if you want to add some additional flavoring but it's not really required because of all the nerds on it so it's not that big of a deal and that's everything that we need for the gelatin part for our cooked syrup we need 1 K 1 cup of sugar and again if you've got candace sugar you can divide that up a quarter cup of can of sugar to three quarters of a cup of regular sugar as long as you equal one cup of sugar it doesn't matter a quarter cup of water and a quarter cup of our corn syrup and or kit canister that's it for our syrup oops sorry and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid goes into our cooked syrup as well then for the glue that they that they used to stick on top technically they're nerds the Nerds use confection confectioners glaze unfortunately being in Canada wasn't the easiest for me to get but an alternative for an edible glue and glaze is to use tylose tylose powder and water so I'm going to show you how to do that and this is what you're going to need to this stuff a day before but it's super easy it just happens that time to do whatever it needs to do but it works great if you can't get the confectioner's late and for and then to make our clear to make our edible glue we're also going to need one cup of water that is all the ingredients that we are going to need let's get into that equipment there so there's a little bit of equipment this time so let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made alright so the equipment that we're going to need is a double boiler if you don't have a quote double boiler you can always just use a metal bowl that will fit securely into the pot and has enough room on the bottom for water without touching you're gonna need another small or saucepan a small medium saucepan for our syrup point you need a candy thermometer digital or the one that you hang on doesn't matter a couple of spatulas gonna need you're gonna need a pastry brush and I'm gonna use a funnel for putting it into our molds you can get these candy funnels or if your pot has the little specks on it and that will work as well or you can always put it into a measuring cup or something with a spout anything to make it easier to pour cause we gotta pour into some skinny guys offset spatula is something to be able to smooth out our corn starch and you're going to want to get some dowels so I got these at the dollar store in the craft section they're 12-inch by just slightly under a half inch size dowel so you want about half inch sized dowel by about 12 inches as I said dollar store craft stores usually how these pre-cut like so otherwise you cannot just buy one of those read it on once and cut up your own so we need basically one if you can is many has many dowels as you want to make ropes now this recipe probably makes around 10 to 12 I'm only going to do part of that today and the rest of the stuff I'm just gonna make regular gummies and I'll explain why when we get to making them all so if you want a bunch of those dowels a cookie sheet or doing them on and you want to line it with parchment paper another pan that we can use to press down the cornstarch with or something flat that's that's kind of heavy a drying rack and then another pan or something that you can use and we're going to put Phillip put the skittles in to cover them up later on once we get the glue on them so it makes it easy if you've got some kind of pan like that so basically all our equipment you know me I always forget something but let's jump right in and let's get these made so if you go and I'm using the tylose powder as your glues your edible glue what you're going to want to do is to bring one cup of water to a boil once it's come to a boil turn the heat off and then we're going to add in three-quarters of a teaspoon into into our boil water you're gonna whisk that around and you're gonna see it's gonna lump up and it's not all gonna dissolve it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for it to fully dissolve all right so my water's come to a boil I'm going to turn off the heat gonna remove that oh remember that thing that I always tell you I forget yeah it was the whisk one whit so we're gonna add in three-quarters of a teaspoon these are quarter teaspoons you want to kind of story sprinkle it around like so and then you're gonna whisk it and it's gonna stay lumpy a little bluffing like that for a while and every couple every two three minutes you're gonna come back and whisk it around and you'll notice every time you come back more and more will be dissolved and as I said it takes about 15-20 minutes for it to fully dissolve once it has you're going to put it into the refrigerator sorry you're gonna let it cool first then put it into the refrigerator overnight and the next day you're good to go and it lasts for up to six months so you can use this over and over not as well as for your any other projects edible food products projects that you have that you need glue fork so I'm just gonna continue to do that to stir that I'll show you once it is clear and next we're gonna make up our starch molds alright so here's my tylose my edible glue all clear now and dissolved so just gonna pour it into a jar and once that's cool I'm gonna cover that up put it in the fridge overnight alright so now we're gonna make our starch folds and starch molds are what they use in candy manufacturing so there's not a whole bunch of people on the line pop and they've silicone molds they use these huge place with corn starch they stamp in the pattern fill up the molds once they set the plate opens all the candies fall in Iraq all the corn starch falls to the bottom and they reuse it so we're going to make our own makeshift version at home so as I said you need about one to two boxes depending how large betray your you see because you do want it almost look for sickness of your cookie sheet whatever lip on that so carefully pour it into your pan and you want to do it on parchment paper because it's going to make it a lot easier when you need to put this back into the box as well as to get it thin too sifting and again you want to be very careful otherwise it's going to look like Scarface's come through your kitchen this stuff it gets messy again you want to carefully move it an offset spatula works really well so that you can move it and spread it out around your pan evenly so I'm just moving it around here so that is all trying to get it relatively all even so that our moles will all be about the same size and you want to have enough room as I said to be able to make them a little bit deeper there and you don't want to be going all the way to the bottom so once you've got it relatively smooth out gonna Mimi and stuff everywhere so what we want to do is to take another little piece of parchment paper and you want it to be able to fit over top doesn't all stick to our pan place it down on top and then use your pan to press down don't press down too firmly but a little bit just to get that compressed and the parchment will stop of the cornstarch from sticking to the bottom of your pan in defeating the purpose of trying to make a flat surface carefully pick this up so we're good like that there so now you want to take your dowels and that's why I said you want to try and have as many as you as you were going to make because your we're gonna press it down so you take the one with a your dowel and you press one down and rock it back and forth so that it makes a little bit of a wider crevice here or so it makes a little wider it up a little bit wider of a trench and then just leave it and then use your next one just go over a little bit button in half an inch or an inch and again you're gonna do the same thing gently press and work it down so the reason you say you want to use multiple dowels is if I go and I take this out if I took it out and push the next one in it pushes some of the cornstarch into the one that we just made so the multiple dowels will help you from avoiding that problem so I'm just gonna pull the camera in over top here so you can actually see it up close all right so it's that you just go over a little bit here from the other one about an inch is good and just gently roll it into place now if you don't have as many inch you're going to like you can see like I'd oh I'm now gonna take my first one so grab it from end to end with your fingers like so so that you don't interrupt your Bowl and now I can move that one there without interrupting that one and then the same thing carefully take this one and here how're we gonna get one of our box the Nerds I've just put them into a bowl or something for you to make it easy we're gonna fill up our little trenches here with our nerd on here a bowl here no jar from a bowl today and just grab some with your fingers and gently drop them fill out the trench chair you just gonna drop them along the bottom don't fully fill it up we just want to line the bottom of it and then anywhere where there's naked spots that we miss don't worry cuz we're gonna glue glue bunch on afterwards so going along do that my trenches removing the dowels grab them use your fingertips in the end to gently pull them up then once you're done filling up your molds there with nerds you're going to carefully place the tray into your freezer so we're gonna make our mold nice and cold nice and cold so when we drop our candy syrup it's gonna start to solidify and grab onto those candies really quickly but you want to be very very gentle because it'll fall easily and yeah you don't want to do this all over again so first case scenario you make a mess him if you have to redo it just to sift out your cornstarch and your nerds and just redo the process so the first thing that we want to do is bloom our gelatin so I've got 1/2 cup of and this has got to be cold but liquid needs to be called 1/2 cup of our I use the kool-aid jammer and then you're gonna sprinkle evenly on your gelatin all over the top and this is to prevent clumping and then you want to mix it in until it's all dissolved and while you're mixing it'll start to bloom and it should call right automatically kind of go to the texture of applesauce if it doesn't your gelatin is not is not very good it's lost its Jo so you don't want to add a little more or get new stuff so we're just gonna set that off the side until we need it God needs about five at least five ten minutes to bloom so the next step is going to be our gelatin side that we're gonna do you're gonna turn your heat on to medium low you're gonna boil a half a cup of your liquid so I used a half a cup of the cooling water pour that in and you're gonna stir to dissolve your jello and then just note for your double boiler don't forget to put your water in and also you your water should never touch the bottom of your pot so I said you just gonna stir this up until that just starts to dissolve and if you're using flavor drink crystals I this is where all added in as well so it can dissolve at the same time I add about two tablespoons as I said if not you can use the Lorraine's oil and you add that more at the end so we just stir this until it's all dissolved until it until it starts to dissolve then I'm gonna add in our corn syrup and our citric acid now that my syrup is mostly the sugars not have mostly melted I'm gonna add in 1/4 cup of my can of syrup or as I said you can use corn syrup or inverted sugar and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and the citric acid and the syrup they are both for preventing crystallization well the can of syrups add a little extra but regularly corn syrup or the inverted sugar is to help prevent crystallization so again I'm gonna mix that stir that well until it's all combined and everything's melted together in the meantime make sure your can of butter is melted and you're going to get your hand blender ready to so we're gonna need that shortly and you're gorg um so now that our syrup our gelatin and that everything's dissolved now it's time to add in our can of butter and our corn gum so you're gonna take your melted can of butter throw her in mix that around just a little bit then we're going to use each ordered teaspoon of fargo and you're going to spread gently sprinkle it try and do sprinkle it evenly over the top please let it sit for just a moment get your hand blender and we're going to blender up [Music] so you're gonna let that blend that up for about probably about two minutes you want to make sure it's something it's a really wild ball supply then once you're done just let it sit for a couple of minutes for about a minute or two and see if any oil comes to the top raises to the surface and you'll be able to tell that the air the bubbles will start to dissipate and if there's any oil if it's not fully emulsified the oil will come up to the top and you will notice kind of little oil slicks if you do see any kind of little oil slicks just add a little bit more Gorica no more than about an eighth of a teaspoon and re blended with the hand blender until that's gone so you should have one uniform texture and then just turn off the heat on your gelatin mixture here there is enough warm water in in your pot here to keep your mixture liquefied now on to the candy side the candy syrup side so for our cooked syrup you're going to add in your one cup of sugar or I said or your mixture of sugar and can of sugar get add in a quarter cup of our can of syrup or corn syrup as I said use that inverted sugar and our quarter cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid mix those together and you can turn your heat on to high heat so you're just going to continue to mix stir this until it begins to boil once it starts to boil you're gonna stop stirring that and we're gonna cook it till two hundred and eighty degrees so now that it started boiling just do it's just start it just around the sides here I'm gonna stop stirring at this point and then I'm just gonna check my temperatures every once in a while till we hit two hundred and eighty degrees so I'm gonna need to check it right now because obviously we're not going to be there I'm gonna let it boil for a couple of minutes and then I'll check its temperature so I start my syrup has been boiling for a couple of minutes so I just want to see where it's sitting right now because we only use a quarter cup of water and we're cooking a high temperature it will get to the 280 very quickly so already at 270 almost there just after 2-3 minutes 280 once it hits your temperature pull it off and allow it to cool for until it hits about 240 so why I like to set it on a stone on natural stone like granite or any natural stone it helps to pull the heat out thicker or if you've got a trivet that helps as well so said just let that sit until it hits 240 all right so my temperature my syrup now is at the correct temperature it's down below just below 240 so now I'm going to and the reason you want to do that is if it's higher it's going to break your gelatin so we don't want to do that so now we are going to pour our gelatin syrup into our candy syrup if that well mixed well together and if you found that your candy syrup has solidified on the bottom or along the sides you can put it on to low heat just to melt that so you're just going to mix this for about a minute or two till they're both combined and make sure to get right on the sides it does like to harden up there see and once everything is all nice together and all melted well together we're going to treat our unflavored gelatin and I recommend kind of break it up into smaller pieces if you can plop her in there see this way again your syrup is not going to be too hot to break your gelatin and this way we get the gelatin all through everything kind of binds there both of those together so you're just going to gently stir that until the gelatin is completely melted so now here's a way that you can kind of give a kind of little pretest to know if your syrup is going to gel up well because on gummies were okay because we can always read about those but these a little harder having all the Nerds stuck to them so we want to get it right the first time just take your syrup take your spoon and allow it to drip off if it starts to solidify in midstream like it'll start to solidify and gel right up while it's dripping you're good to go if it continues to drip like mine is it's going to need more gelatin so what I'm going to do to make sure that that's going to work is I'm going to add another tablespoon of blooms gelatin so I'm just going to go bloom another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid let that bloom and then add that in and that will take care of that problem there all right so I added one tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of my cooling water and I bloom that for about five minutes and added it in and now you can see how much it's thicker and how it'll start to solidify find a mid stream and it'll it'll hold there that's how you should that's a kind of a quick test for you to be able to see if it's going to gel up correctly in your moles before you actually cast them so now we wait to pour it into my little funnel here well shoot and then just line up with your trench and you're just gonna fill up the trench I have to say this funnel makes it really really easy well I needs you then try to free pour it let's go just go along you fill up all your little trenches little cavities and then you take your Nerds actually found it's easier to pour and break from the box so don't bother putting them in a bowl it's just easier to pour them from the box just take off a little lip there so it doesn't get your way and just kind of squeeze it together so you have a little bit of control it'll all come flying out and then you just fill up the box alone and you just want to be gentle with it go easy because otherwise they'll come flying out and don't worry about all the excess that goes off into the cornstarch there we're gonna sift the cornstarch when we're done and we'll be able to retrieve all those I just give it a very very gentle pat you don't look like literally just feather touch it down there you go so we've got our ropes like that so you're gonna put them into the fridge for them to set up anywhere from about a half hour to two hours it can take for your gelatin to set now that our candies have set you're just gonna take them out of the starch mold here and just lay them on to a harsh line drying rack parchment paper drying rack and you're gonna set those out to dry overnight and I'm putting the start my topside is good with the amount of candies and stuff that are on it so I'm gonna I lay them with the starch side up and that's the main side that I'm gonna add any additional candies to that they need you the sec so I'm gonna let those set stay out overnight for them to dry before we apply our glaze all right so now why are candies for setting so you don't want to waste all that cornstarch and all those nerds that are stuck in there so you grab your um your corn starts with your parchment paper inches pull it up like so take a strainer take a strainer and pour it in a little neater than that and you're gonna slip your parchment paper paper back underneath and sift it back onto the parchment once you got all that all the cornstarch sifted through just drop your candies off into a hole here and then you can get your cornstarch box add your parchment again or back in the box and you're cute most of it and once your candies are dry take them off and just slip your parchment paper underneath it's just gonna catch the excess gonna catch the excess glaze so I've done this recipe a couple times using the tylose so I would recommend out of the two I would recommend going with the glaze and the reason is the tylose because we use water it makes them very well make sure candies very wet it does dry completely and that's not a problem but they are very wet they're very sly mean it makes them difficult to kind of work with and sticking the extra candies on so I think the glaze would be a lot better this you can definitely use if you can't get the glaze but I think they set the glaze would be better so a little bit so what you can do is you're going to grab your pastry brush dip her in and just kind of take off a bit of that access and you're going to go along and you're gonna dab it on your candies on your rope and you want to dab it you don't really want to brush because it will take the color off of the nerves their wallet water soluble so I think again using the glaze would help that with that issue once you get it get it blazed on you can fill in the little spots that are miss then just gently put them on and don't try and bustle it too much because I said it'll just kind of slip and slide off but just leave them like so and again we're just gonna dab that on and you don't get one they're wet you don't want to move them because if your ropes can fall apart they can break apart so but I said once they're dry they're really they're good so I know before I said okay we could use a pan to roll them in I found that method didn't work so well because I said after one or two it gets really wet and it makes it difficult to roll in so I found just pouring the freight from the box but is not the best method once you're happy with that that me and again you're gonna let those dry probably about 12 hours to overnight once they're dry they're good to go do not store your candies in ziplock baggies if it's especially for gummies it's not good you either want to store them in glass jars or in cell bags or the miler Ziploc bags those work really well so instead I'm gonna let those puppies dry overnight and I'll show you the finished product and here's our finished product so check them out look I hope they look just like the real things as I said we don't have live here so I don't hundred percent sure but looks like it from the pictures it looks like a lot of fun alright guys so I hope you enjoyed that recipe if you have any other questions or comments please don't hesitate to put them you know where and thank you so much for joining me today you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "5Sg7WP8ai_M": "today kevinator I have two different Jolly Rancher items to try for you they show the Jolly Rancher a misfits two-in-one gummies do you think it's really messed up on the print one Jolly Ranchers sour Serge hard candy with sour powder Center it sounds so good to me I had to get those I'm thinking Silvia was the first one to tell me about this she sent me a picture which I always appreciate the misfits were only a dollar for 3.15 ounces but the Andrews were a dollar ninety eight six and a half yeah so for these four sixty calories Mon five or ninety this one has pretty bad yeah we'll try these first standards because these are those are hard these are you get three different flavors you have green apple and cherry you have blue raspberry and watermelon they look cheap nice and you have strawberry and lemon so there's three different ones so which one do you want to try first they smell like it is no good that's the blue Wow okay those are soft revenge tequila I was expecting talk about pulling your braces off I break simplified yourself this first thing I think of okay I didn't mind the flavor that I liked the flavor of it and you didn't like it at all de Jong I was done left the application look horrible yeah I tasted a lot of the blue raspberry when I was chewing it but then you're right you're left with the watermelon they're very very very sticky down there if you want your child's tooth to come out yeah one of these seriously it might work okay what are we doing this to one of you to nachos ah picked green apple and cherry there's two bill like the one screaming for his life while the red one takes him over mm-hmm I like that one oh yeah that one's a lot better mm-hmm they give you the most of strawberry and lemon in this bag you get a lot of strawberry lemon I think if you were the longer these are set out they've got a little echo I feel mom I like that green apple and Jerry did you all like that no there's a chemical fire but women you really taste the lemon [Music] I like Samantha I don't bomb that one a them bear like it because it sticks around for often you keep I think my favorite look like a boat out like a gas I think my favorite was the blue rice very alarming but I really do like that green m1g Rian's I like to have fun cheering and ain't no which one did you like the best ball carrier the one I just had to grab 100 in the car all right green apple and cherry so I didn't think it immediately killed that limit and I think that would last you a long time because they are so chewy I think you can put it in your mouth and just leave it on your tongue for a little while without you know it enjoys me a long time because in the beginning those would get thrown away all right Eggar what flavors are in this but we should we have does it say on the back no it's gonna be probably a blue raspberry and chariot and apples lemon it's still like from ball okay I can't believe it doesn't have so I hadn't grapefruit you can't believe it Israel what like that puts wipers there there's a well there's a little cherry dude well then there's a watermelon Internet Sal is there two different creams mother to the Reds the Reds were there because they're pink and red hey yo he's not gonna read and there's it there is there's four yeah never had a rhythm so for okay so yes there are the the pink is gonna be your watermelon okay so which one do you want right now at you three no four I think that's a belly shirt for any candy oh oh well look that because that was ever say no energy and suave open voice you're Daniel okay so many got two years right double by H that which one do you want to party yeah okay whichever one oh yeah let's go for him dark for anything I better go I would've picked anyone I guess big first day over time mister it's like I just put that water color film yes hmm the only pattern much but the power is very sour now you see somehow mom was a letdown there was no powder it was all hard always doing it alone did you get like a photos like a little pocket in there is it how big is it it's really small I didn't get it mom oh I'm sure it was in there I don't know if it's hour at all then you got I didn't it wasn't most of you all probably have it ate these party what's the texture cycle there's a texture for the wall I would eat the sugar free Jolly Ranchers these are just like the sugar free Jolly Rancher same size room they're the same size same texture I think that the flavor of that is a little bit your labor but it's the same texture it's the sugar prince how did I'm not giving you guys cut I didn't get the power I didn't get the power but he got knocked out with this yeah I just think it's about the net cherry Viper was extremely sir I think it's funny that we're both hoping the pink one the pink one I like we subconsciously chose we all know the watermelon here we got watermelon warm up baby boy nice right what okay Wow [Applause] okay yeah I got the first off if you yeah I mean it exploded I love that very soft mmm I like that one more not even sure I do it's a very sticky dough mm-hmm well yeah let that explode up a pattern that person no no yeah wait until you see the picture of how much powder is in these that's a lot about oh I got one I mean you put it into a line right now you boy blue sure no you want to say black book reliance them wow I'm still like a mage that actually hit me like it did what's that was the first one here so strong normally you would take your calm it's very hard for me until I see one right after another it's so strong there's a guy called furious Pete mm-hmm has a really successful YouTube channel mmm-hmm look him up you want he's still up he's a bodybuilder you know competitive eaters uh-huh and he ate like a hundred warheads Oh everyone sitting his tongue was bleeding I'm sure from citric acid burn hooked why would he do that he does challenge it seems like powers of butter he just CD does challenges no do charm and he's like a whole pizza in like a minute I would you a friend money but I would have to have the money I'm not gonna do it without billions of views on YouTube channel so yeah so that's my the blue very very strong once again every single one of these have been very strong they'd be very very nice to you level soap on your tongue upsetting your tongue and melt a little bit oh yeah normally you would grab one of these and I would last your wife but since we said why you would just do

poultice stuff and I thought hey I'm just I'm just rolling around I have popped it yet I'm enjoying the flavor the flavor is really good I like the green before the song I hate what I just don't like it but it like that lemon was mixed with that song oh good man how funky yeah bill mmm-hmm it was fun when I was even just the outside just the hard part what are you doing I got no powder huh yes did

a video searching for Jolly Rancher I like the colours are very tiny candies what no normal candy sauce candy so okay I will start with unboxing each of them yeah I don't know how many flavours in total they have watermelon um I'm just reviewing this for now okay really sticky sticky like hell um I used to say you know the raspberry the blue one yeah sticky like hell on but nice colour extreme color yeah I've got no agreement list yeah I actually bought it in a real store but they you know this breaks apart once I didn't deliver the ingredients list I like the colors very much look at this very intense colors on say yeah and if you have found Jolly Rancher by searching for it arrr is this your favorite candy let me know um because I like to know a lot of things about my beers yeah okay

taste now the greatest kind of a thing reminds me on very bit wine wine soft drink mixes now blue raspberry yeah this is so so this to Apple so apple and watermelon get the win the very balanced it flavors also taste the steak taste like the real thing the other two grape and blue raspberry are also very intense but taste artificial so they I cannot make a reference to anything natural I ever

the video and the first video I posted about this edible a lot of people were telling me this isn't what they were getting so poor oh wow like the first five times I went to go purchase this in DC they came in a cube shape like this there was just like cubes and very chewy like they're just like a barian gummy type of edible now this is the first time so I've been purchasing these things for a couple of months now and this is the first time I'm actually getting the pack that people are talking about which look exactly like the original sour patch kids and they look like this okay so I'm just gonna eat one right now this is the first time I'm seeing them looking tasting and feeling like actual sour patch occasion I have to admit that when I tried these compared to the ones I had been getting before these the ones that look like sour patch is are less powerful less potent I got what I would eat like - I really wouldn't feel anything but these I would need like a half of one of a half of one of these squares and it would be good the texture is different as well so I really don't know what's going on according to both packages they both have the same ingredients they both say they are in compliance with the CA prop 215 SB 4 xx section blah blah blah I'm sure there's some type of DC law but I don't know um so yeah maybe I would have to eat more of the sour patch kids ones in order to feel something but the other ones we're buying like I am not sure why they're such a difference but yeah I just wanted to make it update to let you guys know that I did I finally know what you're talking about when you're saying oh my pad looks just like the sour patch cake okay I get it I know I know what you're talking talking about now but when I like I said like when I first started getting these for the first time they look like the squares like this this is like what I was introduced to when I was interested introduce this Tony fetch as a product so yeah I'm wonder with that Bell no idea everybody look it up anyway if you have any questions comment below and I will get back to you of course yeah and have a good one here", "J-CQhL5uCwk": "Hey number of you have asked me how I go about making these candies that I post on to Facebook so I thought I would spend a little time here and make a video of me making the latest batch of candy I'm making a Japanese pinwheel design and the flavor in this particular batch is pomegranate that you see me adding to the hot sugar the sugar is about 310 degrees so it's pretty warm it will burn you severely if you're not careful so you gotta be cautious you'll see that I awesome now adding citric acid bring helps bring out the flavor in the candy you don't taste a lot if you don't have some kind of a acidic additive into the sugar now I'm pouring out what looks like four equal pools of sugar the point here is that I want to make four different colors I'm dividing it all up of course they're all have the same flavor in it because I entered it before this step and you're gonna see me go ahead and start to make the colors and I'm gonna use in this particular design this is red adding a little yellow a little blue for my primary colors a little white that's going to be used for it's sort of to reflect and help enhance the colors I'm gonna mix them all here and you'll see that it's boiling a little bit or steaming and the purpose of that is to try to drive off any water water and hard candy is quite the enemy and you're always trying to avoid adding any water or working in humid conditions it turns out this is a nice cold day today so it's a nice day for making candy I mix in the white now it turns out you don't really have to add white coloring if you use white if you just take that amber sugar and pull it long enough it will turn white as it incorporates a bunch of air bubbles it to alecky do with a taffy machine and now what you're seeing is I'm slowly peeling up the sugar is it cools on the edges and moving it into the center of each puddle if you will and that helps even out the temperature and eventually will make it easier for me to mix the colors in throughout each each grouping here you'll notice I've sped this up quite a bit and it's just an effort to make this video go a little faster all in all it's only about 10 minutes or so still pretty darn hot probably up in the mid 200s so it's I am wearing gloves under the blue gloves to help with the heat and you'll see me occasionally just set my hands on the table and that's just to try to help them cool off a bit they get pretty warm you'll see people often wear a really heavy gloves like welders gloves it's tough when it's this hot but I can work pretty quick here and then don't need it now I'm mixing the colors I'm not going to pull them too much I want them to maintain a transparent quality to them and you'll see at the end why that is but you can pull them quite a bit and actually in this case a red weed almost turned pink it would pull enough white into it from from the air bubbles that's incorporated from pulling you see the folks we've worked with a lot of white color they put them on essentially a taffy puller and help drive out or to drive it air bubbles and really generate a nice bright white crisp color in this particular case I mean it'd be that overall bright but I do want to be nice and opaque enough to help reflect the colors I'm gonna use in the design so it turns I don't want just three colors I want six colors and the nice thing about making the three primaries here is if you remember in art school or in high school in art class you can mix your primary colors to get just about any color you want so I'm dividing these into fourths because I'm actually gonna make six colors I guess I'm gonna cut them up here and if you remember of course that when you mix your red and yellow you get orange when you miss your red and blue you get purple and your blue and yellow to get your green and that's what I'm doing right here again I'm just trying to pull it enough to mix the colors evenly you know it's hard to see but in front of me there is a it's actually a pancake griddle I use as a heat plate and that helps slow the cooling down a little bit helps me control temperature the whole art of working with with hard candy is to maintain temperature gives to hot of course it melts you can't do anything with it if it gets too cold it gets brittle and you're done so we work to keep that sort of clay texture or state now I'm going to take each color and I'm gonna make essentially a long a triangle each one a there's going to be a wheel of the pinwheel and on each edge I'll put a little white and that will help divide the colors up when you when you look at the candy of all assembled so I'm gonna go through each color and do this I use this little spatula to helps me make a little nicer cleaner as you just edges almost there you see me occasionally rotate the sugar or in this case I may be taking it off the heat plate because it's getting a little too warm and I'm starting to lose the structure of the triangle and so I can take them off the hot plate and cool them down this way a little bit right now I've got my six triangles I'm gonna start putting together my pinwheel by adding each of the colors together I will give you my design as long as I'm working with them with their hot like this they'll stick together pretty well even if they cool off a little bit you can just run a little bit of water like on a damp cloth across the side of it and it'll act like glue and piece them together but I'm tending to work pretty quick so they're they're still pretty we're pretty good at hue so quality to them all right so now I've got my master role together here and so I'm moving away from maintaining temperature to maintaining structure of the design and I want to keep this round cylinder and first thing I got to do though is make them sort of bite-sized and that's what I'm doing now by stretching the the cylinder out a little bit and that design will be maintained whether it was letters or colors or shape or whatever throughout that whole structure or throughout all those little rods that are being pulled out they're also hot and if they sit too long and they'll go flat so you'll see me constantly rolling two cylinders to keep them from are the rods to keep them from going flat and maintaining their circular structure and that's what I'm doing now this takes a little while because it's going from a pretty warm temperature to you got to get them to they're essentially cooled down so you can crack them lifting it up shows you they're still not quite ready yet cuz they're uh they're deform now I'm getting ready if you kind of cut it out there but I did that for about 20 minutes off and on so now they've pulled down quite a bit I'm going through the process of breaking them into bite-sized pieces you can make these at different sizes I like this size it's about a half an inch and it's a nice bite-sized piece you can of course stretch the cylinders out or the rods out longer and thinner and you get smaller pieces or you can make different sizes whatever you what do you pretty like but this seems to work pretty well and that pot table you did admit of course it's sat for 20 minutes so it's actually cooled down now but I need that hard starch surface to cut against so the pieces essentially crack off and smaller pieces [Music] I'm getting them nearly finished as you might guess the rods that are in the middle of the thing looked the best some of the ones on the end or a little more deformed one way or the other but they all taste great and so he just tend to mix him in and nobody seems to carry to worry too much about it if it was something important I guess she could weed them out but the more careful you are the more uniform your structure is throughout the whole the whole sample set I'm getting to the end we'll cut the rest of these out and I'll let them cool a little bit longer roll them around little bit to kick get any sharp edges off and then I'll pack them up and hand to my friends and family and hopefully they enjoy them and it is a nice flavor and they do seem pretty pretty popular getting towards the end here here is the finished product as they lay it on the table but I really like a bottom though is when you hold them up to the light they really pop have a nice color to them in the light you know hold them up to the Sun or what have you oh that's about it I hope you enjoyed it I hope you have a chance to get some of these they are good I hope you enjoy it let me know I know thanks bye", "lOtec2XO7Ts": "yeah variety seedless round pink color light pink yellowish yo foreign

the other B H oh but I think it's what it's called I can't remember this very moment yeah so no I overlay my favorite it was really really really chewy like it was a hard candy than a soft candy which I mentioned before is not my favorite which if you're into her candy she might be your thing but as some of us mentioned it even look kind of awkward when I was eating it like it was definitely a little big for my liking overall the medicated aspect of it I mean I didn't really get a lot out of it I don't know maybe if her candies are not my way to get medicated it seems that the brownie has been the only thing that's giving me a really good kick yeah I also have a really high tolerance I've noticed so that could be the other reason why but if you ever lower lower tolerance maybe these could be something that you could try and let me know if they work for you because they definitely didn't really work for me whatever reason but I'd love to hear your feedback on it and if someone else had a different experience maybe let me know I don't know very odd it's not even like I was eating a whole bunch before that they would maybe get absorbed I did also mention that I am on my period so that has been known to have a little bit of an effect with females well a lot of effect apparently because apparently we need to smoke a lot more and consume a lot more when it is her time of the month for whatever reason thank you mother nature but yeah overall they were bad I went about get them again no probably not um as I said I'm just all about the soft I just keep saying brownie I really wanted to be a brownie apparently it's the fudge I really really like the fudge so far that has been my favorite but yeah I have a few more things to try so stay tuned and hopefully I'll be able to get some more stuff and keep reviewing I also do have another exciting interview coming up possibly later on early next week I'm in the process of kind of putting together that review because it's a little bit longer and I'm kind of getting that one together but I'm first gonna do an unboxing of it yeah stay tuned and if you have any questions or any concerns or if you aren't sure of words or from it is on the announcements on the kanima means page if you aren't part of the group then you can only get the $25 off but members are eligible for $10 off of every purchase from bud Mills CA

you have a horror high story of that experience while you were high I'm sure yeah so I was in Jamaica and my friends there was like 15 of us got all guys we decided to take brownies one day and like the crew range from guys who smoked weed everyday to guys who had never smoked weed in their entire lives but everyone was no pun intended pot committed to taking these brownies they're like this big I took one we all went to the beach and then like all of us were hit with this ridiculous wave to where everybody was I can't even like astronomically high like I wa I couldn't even cross the street like I was trying to cross the street at this pizza place with my two friends and I couldn't I kept backing up and I can I finally sat down and got food and then we ordered buffalo chicken pizza and I was enjoying it and then my friend said like ma'am I've gotta get out of here like I think like the walls are like coming in and his friend was like a very like he was like the guy who would get so drunk and not feel it like he was like the big type of dude who wouldn't get freaked out and he got freaked out to freak me out then all of a sudden I just woke up and what happened was apparently I woke up on the ground with like ten Jamaicans standing over me and my friend said that my eyes started wrong in the back of my head they thought I was joking they slapped me in the face and I fell off and like I guess essentially having a mini seizure and since then I haven't taken edible it was the only time I've taken edibles and I just have I mean the ruined edibles for me I'm not doing it man it's crazy we went to bed at 4 p.m. that day it was a complete waste of a spring break danger you", "vlLo3VBV9X8": "hi everybody and welcome to Baker madness I'm chef Scott and this is a cannabis friendly cooking and baking show where we sometimes cook things and sometimes we no but at least once a week I eat some edibles from one of our Washington state dispensaries something that I wouldn't make in the house something that's probably more industrial then I might have the tools to do so we're gonna get started right away with today's friendly panda candies by hot sugar hot sugar is a subsidiary company of the fact and a company you need to go to their website fat Panda there that's fun I've already eaten a few of these these are our Panda candies these are the caramel apple flavor they have a bunch of flavors many many many not for kids this is THC infused tetrahydrocannabinol okay I'm not sure what the regulation is because this is a really new package as a matter of fact this package that you see is a redesign of the package WIC in the past I don't know six months but this is a new look whichever I like it's really aggressive in there I like that but this package doesn't have any of the nutritional values of anything whereas some of the other ones really do they have act it looks like you bought it at the grocery store it's got all the nutrition and the sodium and the all the stuff so I'm not really sure it must be a voluntary kind of a thing I wish cannabis companies are you listening please put the nutritional values on your products you see these words how tiny can you see the tiniest words ever so I wrote them down over here so he's sharing with you easier I'm gonna read some stuff here and you'll be able to tell from my face how I feel about any of it okay the following pesticides have been used to grow the cannabis that helped create this product Newcomb botan Agard max safer brand three-in-one liquid sulfur Zehra tall regalia PTO gannett role and as a guard which I think sounds like a place that Thor lives as a guard as a guard anyway that's one two three four five six seven eight different pesticides used on the cannabis on the flower the stem portion that's a lot of pesticides in Washington State you have to declare what pesticides are used if any so we have some other companies that we use a lot of flour from that are organic the cannabis was extracted using a proprietary blend of hydrocarbons winterized with ethanol and then molecularly distilled leaving no residual solvents I don't know what any of those words mean but it is forcing me to believe it sweetie okay all of these words are printed on that little half inch tall paragraph okay this is not necessary here are your ingredients today isomalt we're gonna talk about that in a minute pure cane sugar corn syrup vanilla beans cannabis can't can't cannabis oil propyl paraben artificial flavor with the brown color which is six colors like a [ __ ] Crayola box okay corn starch vegetable gum citric acid sodium benzoate potassium sorbate potassium sorbet really caramel flavor and a natto and a natto is just like a it's a vegetable color it's no problem isomalt let's talk about that that's the number one ingredient in this product isomalt is a sugar alcohol and if you're not a baker if you don't work in the food industry you may not know what it is if you go to Vegas or you go to some fancy place and they have those big gorgeous sugar sculptures and it's just tall and beautiful and sculptural and architectural that's made with isomalt sugar real sugar your table sugar that you guys are using right now is known as hydro scopic that means it pulls all of the water near it to it that's why if you leave should sometimes it'll get all mushy especially you live in Florida it'll get all I mean you can you know I mean I so melt on the other hand is not so in the pebbles candies they use pure sugar and corn syrup and those candies as they melt in your mouth they become pliable and kind of bendy isomalt does not these candies do not ever become bendy they get smaller smaller smaller smaller until I usually get bored with them and crunch them to death which is probably terrible for my teeth but I do it anyway because I have no control isomalt is really low on the glycemic index that means that it does not trigger an insulin response so it is not as sweet as real sugar but you can use it like real sugar it is granulated and it melts like sugar it acts exactly like sugar it is not hydroscopic so it's very firm that's why they use it you know to make stuff there is a national prohibition on cannabis so companies that operate in Washington state that also want to operate in other states or want to have their product in other states have to open separate companies separate facilities separate grow houses all separate if they want to for example fat Panda is the company that it originated here and it is also you can get it in count in Canada they have fat panda in Canada as well and here and I guess just recently in California what I but it's coming soon to Oregon Michigan Ohio West Virginia Florida Arizona Nevada and more to come caramel apple delicious first of all you get a sticker whose love a sticker [Music] all right I got this is what they look like this is ten milligrams of THC this is a caramel apple caramel apple flavor I like these because they're stupid packages really weak it's supposed to be childproof but clamp doesn't seem like it yeah [Music] but the flavor you guys super flavorful also the distillate that they're using is really front like I can really I can feel it on my tongue yeah it's really good hmm yeah yummy that was really nice okay I promise to set this one okay I promise chimera Lamia I will zoom it [ __ ] [Music] so the Panda can be worked I already know worked I didn't worked but it really works good so let's do a little let's do a little test now let's see I'm gonna mix these up these are some of my tarot cards I will do a little tarot card reading for you right now mmm tarot cards so special so maybe tippy do so magical oh so controversial pick a card any card to pick a card one pick it for you let's talk about this dope shall we oh my god yeah so these Panda candies I don't know what they're using how it works this the strength of the stuff if you call a few episodes ago I told you it's 10 milligrams per candy but they don't tell you what strain they've used or how strong that strain is so 10 milligrams of one kind of weed can be really much stronger than 10 milligrams of another kind of weed seriously the way they make these I feel them almost immediately this is one of the only candies is one of the few candies that really just I seriously I feel it within 30 minutes two or three of these are some kind of strong ass [ __ ] okay so on my scale let's give him four tastes an eight I'm gonna give him a 7 they have you can really taste the distillate and I mean the caramel apple flavor is good but you can still really it gets overpowered so a7 what I say think of it 7 and for efficacy a 9 and for price an 8 they were good plus no my Wizards discount love that ok so we've picked a card you picked a card - Jeff you picked a card this would be 10 of cups the 10 of cups now if you don't follow Tarot this is a great card oh gosh so family unit everybody's happy they got everything they need often the distance is their house it symbolizes family and stability and the river of emotions flowing through the promise from the divine through the the rainbow everything's gonna be fine so hold tight you guys find the people you love if you're not close to call them and it's gonna be fine we'll be fine see you next time on Baker madness [Music]", "dw-avRWzFV4": "welcome to lofty pursuits in public displays confection I'm Greg today I'm driving across country all the way up to Syracuse New York so you can finally hear hi I'm Craig at Hercules candy and we're gonna make hard candy there's so much to know about candy making no one person can know it all so I travel the country and I see other candy makers and I invite you to travel with Greg as we go to see Hercules candy in Syracuse New York [Music] Hercules candy is located in Syracuse New York and Steve and Terry and Craig who's off camera right now run the place and they make wonderful candy and during our Kickstarter campaign we said we'd make a joint video and we never thought we hit that level but this is the video folks and we went up there they know something about making hard candy but not about making image candy and I know absolutely nothing about making chocolate so we thought we'd trade skills I arrived in Syracuse and the GPS takes me up a lovely Street and it points me to a lovely residential house with a sign that says Hercules candy out front I guess I didn't know what to expect I'd seen their videos but I didn't realize it was in the basement of a residential house they're gonna move soon so I sort of feel lucky I got to see this old tradition where they've been making candy since the 1930s the basement is the factory the ground floor is the showroom and they live upstairs more they make the candy just like the Shemp such a mess confectionary I've never made image candy in a kitchen from the 30s so I had to figure out what they had they had a pot to cook it in a table to pour it on and let it cool a hook to pull it on and a heating hood to keep it warm it looks like they had everything but like all things this equipments gonna be different than what I'm used to so let's see what we can do we were both prepared to take notes Terry more than me she had her little notebook ready and I had my notes made for them already drawn out for this project I hope it made it a little easier before I go any further I have to state an element effect steve is a superhero superheroes have superpowers and Steve's is handling corn syrup I use ladles I use cups I transfer it in various ways and some of it always ends up on the floor he takes his bare hands plunges it into the bucket of corn syrup and moves it without dripping with his bare hands into the pot I have no idea how he does this take my word for it steve is a superhero [Music] this beautiful copper pot takes the sugar up to 310 degrees quickly and Steve and I talk about candy making and I discover we have a difference of experience for him making hard candy is not something you do in the summer it gets too sticky and for me I'm from Florida it's practically summer year-round if we hadn't figured out ways around making candy in the summer we wouldn't be in business Steve adds the flavor stirs it in and then the pot goes down to the marble candy cooling table a four inch thick marble table I never actually worked on marble before you can't control its temperature so it does what it wants to do unlike my candy cooling table and if it gets too hot it'll just stay that way until it cools down or until you ice it down to keep the mixing colors familiar to me I brought a whole stack of my little wooden spoons with me to mix the colors in oh it's cooler than in Florida the air temperature in this room might be 65 and I'm used to working at 75 everything's cooling off a lot faster than normal so I got to work fast to add the color into the candy and we do our three sections they're dark orange for the skin our light orange for the middle and our clear that will become the white for the pith of the orange this is the place I normally add citric acid Terri Steve and I decide not to you see citric acid can behave very badly when exposed to marble marble and citric acid can break down a produce carbon dioxide in fact dissolving marble dust or chips into sulfuric acid is how they made seltzer water or the carbonation for seltzer water back in the early days and you can find out more about that on our video about how to make an egg cream we don't want to damage this so we don't use the citric acid but that's okay it may be a bit sweeter than our normal orange but it's going to be delicious because we're flavoring it with pure orange oil just the way we do with lofty pursuits I cut the sugar into its three color blocks and Terry and Steve start flipping them over like experts I guess they are I know there have been jokes made by these guys about how tight the space is down there when there's only three of them well there are six today you can see four on camera and there are two more just coming to watch and to help out [Music] Steve starts the batch on the hook he's pulling it to fold and air bubbles you fold in air bubbles into candy like this it stops being amber and it starts becoming white that's because these little air bubbles reflect light beautifully we need a very white candy for the pith of the orange now what's surprising me here is that we actually made this work this room is so much colder than I'm used to not as cold as they're used to and I have to work much faster than normal for me we need to get this thing off the hook and still be warm enough to do the next couple of stages in the process at lofty I'm used to working with a heating table to keep the candy from cooling too fast but the traditional way to do it is a heating hood I never had that opportunity to work with one when I was learning because we didn't have a gas source in the building we were working with we had a deal with electrical heat a heating table is a very large area that has one temperature and it tapers off very quickly as he get off that area the heating hood has a gradual taper from the back where if the heat sources to the front whether you're working this posed some challenges for the type of image candy that I'm used to making but ends up being a huge advantage for ribbon candy and hopefully I'll show that to you in another video [Music] Terry and I start cutting the candy down the light orange is going to be the triangles in the center of the orange and we need six parts for the design that I do she takes three I take three we even them out and then we have to shape them into the triangles and cool them off and in this environment the cooling them off is not the problem [Music] Steve knows how the candy cools in his shop he comes over and starts flipping the candy I'm used to flipping it because the bottoms warm in the top skull but in this case the bottom and top on one side are cold and the bottom and top on the other side are hot and he's gotta flip it in a different way it's all different everybody's shop has its idiosyncrasies and Hercules candies is no different but I gotta say it's a lot of fun to play with the old equipment Steve earns his stripes by putting stripes in between the pith of the orange slices and we've put in the last slice on the first half and the first half of the image Candy's done the second half he assembles by himself and we are able to put both halves together and end up with the core of the orange [Music] Steve keeps the arms center Moving's that it won't go flat while I pull out the white candy into the outer layer of the pith and we wrap it around the orange slices we repeat the technique we did with the white candy on the orange rind and we end up with a beautiful outer layer then the log is rolled for a bit and we want to take the log in two rods and we pull it down we pinch it off and we stretch it out using gravity as AIRAID if you ever make it to tell a C please visit us at lofty pursuits we're right off i-10 here in Tallahassee and if you can't make it you can still buy our candy we made a batch of this orange and it's in our citrus mix and you can get that at our website www.jfn.co.jp/toho clips are amazing they're hard candies are wonderful and it's always good to have colleagues in the field that you like everybody's changing positions all the time so that everyone can have experience at each step of the process the log is being rolled to keep it round Steve is pulling it out into the lengths without distortion this is the hard part of this project and he's cutting it off in two rods Terry and other people and me at some point end up rolling the logs to keep them cool and round until they are heartened which once again he isn't very hard in this environment he can't tell a little jealous it's hot here in Florida [Music] the candy came out great sometimes if you over pull or under pull the candy or if there's too much stretching and twisting involved it becomes hard to cut but this Candy's cutting beautifully and I cut the first couple of rods and then Steve takes over and he starts learning the process like everybody who's ever learnt this technique has to it's not always as easy as it looks don't worry he'll get his revenge when he tries to teach me how to kill a chocolate mold and I thought that would have been easy I was wrong [Music] and look at how much faster he is after a few dozen rods to cut [Music] and Terry did a great job she picked this up in no time at all and then we were done and we headed upstairs and I went out towards my car with everyone else helping to carry my gear and there was somebody waiting outside apparently he'd seen the live stream he wanted to come by and get some of the hard candy the first person to try it thank you for watching this video we want to thank Hercules candies for their huge hospitality it was a wonderfully fun trip and we really enjoyed it and if you ever make it up to Syracuse please make sure you visit them their new store

we're doing all the time thank you again for watching see you with the next video [Music] you", "zYgVCXcyrcI": "hi welcome to dive into light edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and to the regular subscribers thank you so much and welcome back new subscribers thank you again for joining I'm so excited this channel is kind of weirdly taking on a life of its own it's it's really really exciting but a little overwhelming I'm not gonna lie it's kind of cool when there's like you know a couple thousand people seen it but now we're getting into some not large numbers for me um that I never expected and it's like what oh but it's super cool and thank you guys so much I couldn't do this obviously without you so today I know I've got another company recipes up there and I'm always working to refine and make things better so in this recipe this is good for regular gummy bears or regular gummy candies or the sweet and sour there's really only one difference in the change for that recipe whether you want to make regular or the sugar sugar-coated and so I wanted to go for that as well as a little bit a little bit of change in the method but any one of those recipes will work so kind of how I'm gonna how I would list it is the regular gummy bears that I put is more like a condensed jello realistically it's jell-o and gelatin and you harden it up that's condensed jello and then the other candy this the sour one with the the sugar-coated sour ones they're more like a real candy so I know also how the gummy that's more like a real candy versus just condensed gelatin and I will stop babbling on now and also I've got a recipe at the end there if you want to stay tuned on how to make inverted sugar which is a replacement for corn syrup so if Kourt lake corn syrup is difficult for you to get expensive just not available in your local grocery stores you can actually make your own at a fraction of the price and it's super easy to make however it is very very finicky but I go over all of that at the end there about the inverted sugar so I hope you stay tuned for that and and check that out and I think that's all I've got for us right now I'm gonna get in as I usually do get into my ingredients the utensils you're gonna need we'll put everything together and we'll get some candies made we're getting started what you want to do is to get a pot of either ice water or set up a pot of cold water and put it in your fridge or freezer about an hour before you want to start this very important you need the really cold water to start to stop the cooking process for the syrup so just get that set up ahead of time and now we'll get into your ingredients and the tools that you're going to need all right so I'm just gonna go over the ingredients now the ingredients for the gelatin side are exactly the same whether you want to do be regular or whether you want to do the sugar coated it's exactly the same the only difference is whether you're doing the sugar coated or the regular is in the candy syrup and the difference there is if you're doing sugar coated you're gonna use one cup of sugar actually I'll go over that when I get into the sugar part you never mind about that right now we'll start with the gelatin side so you're going to need a one box of jell-o three envelopes of gelatin or three tablespoons you are going to need a quarter cup of corn syrup or you can use what's called inverted syrup which is a substitution for corn syrup I have a video at the end of this to show you how to make your own inverted sugar which I use quite often which I'm actually using today I'm just showing you the bottle for what you've got what you need in the light corn syrup you will need a quarter cup of melted can of butter 1/2 teaspoon of gore gum a quarter cup of liquid now I tend to use the kool-aid jammers or the or the kool-aid waters they're great or the Hawaiian punches are great to use as well or you can just use water you're gonna want a half a cup of liquid again you can use your juice or your gelatin I'm sorry your juice or your water for the gelatin and for this you need it needs to be cold so for your gelatin it has to be very cold and for our jello portion we're actually going to boil that and the only other thing is if you want to add some additional color and additional flavor we can do that as well and I think Oh sorry and we also need a quarter tea store sorry a half a teaspoon of citric acid I apologize almost missed that our half teaspoon of citric acid that's everything that we're going to need for our gelatin side and now I'm just gonna when we start the syrup I'm going to go into the ingredients in that for the syrup side and then if previously I talked a little bit about clear gel for the regular gelatin gummies you can actually use this now for either one and again we're gonna do all the work on our gelatin side and add this in so with regards to the clear gel if you want to use it what you need to do beforehand is you take a cup of the clear gel and you mix it with a quarter cup of sugar and you keep that to a side mix it thoroughly so that the sugar and the starch are thoroughly mixed the reason for that the starch will clump if you do it on its own or doesn't have the sugar properly mixed these starts will clump up in your mixture so that is why we add the sugar then you are going to use two tablespoons for your gelatin for your gelatin mix now this is an option now what this does is it takes your candy to that next level that more professional candy like you get in the candy store so it's not as gelatin like it's more it's a little bit softer it's more of that gummy candy versus just like concentrated gelatin and I've been using this ever since I first since I tried it I used it in all my candy now it's I love it it's not that expensive you get a large container of it and it lasts quite a long time so if you do make candies more on a larger scale or on a professional level you might want to give that a try it's excellent it's a little pretty pain to work with but I'll go over all that adding that in so for the candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar okay laureate let me back up here if you are making the sugar-coated gummies you are gonna use one cup of sugar and a half a cup of corn syrup if you want to make regular gummies that are not sugar-coated you're going to switch that you're going to use one cup of corn syrup to a half a cup of sugar but it's to a half a cup of sugar so the recipe is exactly the same this is the only part that'll change regular gummies one cup of syrup to half a cup of sugar sugar-coated gummies one cup of sugar to half a cup of corn sort syrup and the water remains the same half a cup either way you go that's all you need for the candy syrup side temperature cooks to the exact same we're gonna cook it to 260 all right so the equipment that we are going to need is a double boiler you don't have one no problem just what I do use a metal bowl that fits into a pot you want to add water into the bottom to the pot you just don't want it to touch the bottom of the bowl you're gonna need a second pot for your syrup you would let you want to use a heavy bottom pot it works it's better for even the heat distribution for your syrup that way your syrup cooks evenly you don't have any hotter spots you're going to need a candy thermometer a hand blender a whisk a couple of spatulas and a strainer if you've got one handy and I think that's everything that we need for our equipment I usually end up finding something that Wow's that we need but this is generally the majority of the equipment that you're gonna need so next I'll get into the ingredients for putting our gelatin portion together and then we'll then we do the candy syrup and then we combine both of them alright so give me a moment to get everything together here and we'll get started all right so let's get started with our recipe so our very first step what we're gonna do is our quarter cup of liquid we're gonna heat up in the microwave for one minute we want that boiling then with our half a cup of cold liquid we're gonna bloom our gelatin so add that to a bowl and your gelatin you want to evenly spread it over your liquid and again water or the juice I'm actually using kool-aid jam or yes or sorry I'm using the kool-aid waters you know if you do use real juice with real fruit all you need to do is to add a mold inhibitor laureen's makes a makes one and that's what you need to use if you if you use anything with real fruit in it otherwise they will mold very quickly but if you use fruit jammers Hawaiian Punch they don't have anything real in the sugar content they don't go mouldy I literally have gummies that last for months I've never seen mold on them so with regards to your gelatin you want to sprinkle it evenly and then mix it up to make sure that there are no lumps and then you're gonna set it aside for five minutes to allow it to bloom and meanwhile I'm going to microwave this for one minute so you're gonna add your box of jell-o to the double boiler you're gonna set your temperature to low and we're just gonna wait for I'm just waiting for my liquid to boil all right so we're going to add our boiled liquid yeah it got very hot I'm gonna add that in and we're gonna stir that around let our gelatin let our jello get dissolved you might need to add a little bit more liquid to it if you find that it's not fully dissolving but it takes a few minutes anyway and you want to continue to scrape all the gelatin off the sides otherwise it will harden up and we're just gonna stir that and let our water get warm now it's really important with jell-o and gelatin is the heat jello and more gelatin sorry I apologize the our unflavored gelatin melts at just hot a hot water bath if it is too hot it breaks the gelatin and what will happen is your you'll notice it'll start to get very foamy if it starts foaming immediately remove your bowl from the heat and let it cool down you also may need to add about 1/2 a tbsp more of unflavored gelatin because you've kind of broken the the you broken the gelatin a bit so it may not be as sticky or it may not be sorry gel as well so you may I need to add in an additional half a tablespoon to compensate for that so I'm just gonna continue to stir this on the low heat until it is till it's pretty much fully melted until the sugars all fully melted so now that my gelatin is pretty much melted we're gonna add in our quarter cup of corn syrup and get that thoroughly stirred in and we're also gonna add in our half a teaspoon of citric acid we're gonna let that all mix in and melt together again try and keep the sides of your bowl as clean as possible so now that our jello is all melted we're going to add in our gelatin and your gelatin is bloomed when it is nice and spongy if it is squishy at all then either your gelatin is it's not strong enough because gelatinous do have different strengths or it's old and the gelatin is just broken so you want it to be nice and firm and just break it up into pieces and scoop it in and then we're just gonna stir that until that's melted and again remember you just want to warm hot water by at this point you don't want the water underneath boiling at all otherwise your jello your gelatin will break and again if you see it starting to foam up at all take it off immediately now once your gelatin is all melted and everything looks nice like so we're gonna add in our can of butter so you know it in a quarter to a third of a cup of can of butter I'm doing a quarter cup they have dogs and cats behind me [Music] cats trying to trip me up here and then I'd in the Gerber gun this is when you want to use the strainer throw it on there and you want to evenly sprinkle it all over the top and now we're going to get our handy dandy hand blender and so you're going to blend this until it is completely all one color one unit alt one texture and that you're not seeing any kind of oil separation [Music] all right so we've got that all what we called emulsifies so what Gord got gorg um is an emulsifier what an emulsifier does is it allows oil and water to come together essentially it creates a little bubble so when we use the blender it breaks the oil particles up into tiny little part into little pieces and the emulsifier acts as a bubble and holds the water and the oil together in little bubbles that's how it all comes together and your water and oil live happily together otherwise your butter is going to separate and come to the top if you don't use that now a lot of people have asked me if you can use zanza zantac xanthan gum no you cannot it is not an emulsifier it is only a thickening agent so geurim is an emulsifier it is also a thickening agent and a stabilizer that is the other you can use lecithin I prefer Gore gum because lecithin gives it a flavor that I really don't like and I find that the Gore gum works awesome with you don't need the lesser than now at this point if you want you can add in your some additional flavoring I add in about a cup and a half full and if you want to add in some additional color I do it on this side as well I use the no taste red if I'm doing red color so I'm doing raspberries so I use the no taste red reason for that a red die has red food coloring I mean has a tends to have a bitter flavor to it so I like the no taste rent the only downfall about it is you don't get quite as an intense red as the regular ones but I would for rather give up a little bit of the color for than the flavor so I'm gonna mix that in and I'm gonna use the hand blender again just to get it full all mixed together the color comes out much nicer when you use the hand blender [Music] and when you're riding a clear gel you're gonna want to have your whisk ready and coupes and we're going to add in a tablespoon at a time and you want to evenly spread it over the top like so and then use this too and then you're gonna have to whisk it for about a minute or minute or two you're gonna notice it start to thicken up it's just kinda like cornstarch you know when you're making gravy you have to keep mixing it a little while for it to up for it to thicken up and do its thing we're gonna do and you can see how it's starting to thicken up and now we're gonna add in the second tablespoon same thing evenly over the top whisk and you're gonna repeat the same thing we're going to whisk it for about a minute or two until it's all to look pick it up so you can see how it's thickening up here I said you want to continue whisking for about two minutes and it should look nice and smooth and again all one uniform texture and color alright that side is ready is finished now we're gonna do the candy syrup side alright so for our candy syrup side because I am doing sugar or sour coated ones I am going to be using one cup of sugar half a cup of corn syrup and a cup of water now remember if you want to make regular gummies our only difference is you're gonna use a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of regular sugar that is the only difference there you're gonna mix that together until it's up until it comes up together and your sugar begins to dissolve make sure to go all around the edges because the sugar likes to hide on the edges all right so and once your gonna have that all mixed up you're gonna turn your heat on to medium medium-high and you're going to continue to stir this until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you're not going to stir it all right the other one of the things I forgot is you want a pastry brush or a paintbrush clean paint brush so that you can clean off the sides of the pot to use a cup of hot hot water and that'll melt any sugar crystals that you've got and you want to get those off the side because any sugar crystals can cause your syrup to crystallize later on and just continue to stir it until it begins to boil Oh once your syrup begins to boil stop stirring and you're going to add in your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook this until 260 now if you want a firmer candy you can cook it to about 280 so anywhere between 260 280 you can experiment on your firmness if you want a softer candy cook it to 250 but I found 260 seemed to be a really good temperature for it and we're just gonna let that go until we hit the proper temperature now you also want to get your pot of cold water handy and the only thing that you'll do drink the cooking process is if you do see any sugar crystals form just wash them down and now while your candy while the candy syrup is cooking you just want to consider this because stir your jello side because the top part of its gonna start to solidify and the bottom is gonna be liquid because it's closer to the heat so you want to continue sure to mix that up and it all stays nice and smooth and keep it on keep it on low temperature so you have the low hot water bath keeping it melted all right so I've hit 260 take your pot and submerse it in cold ice water turn off your heat and you want to wait until the temperature begins to come down on your thermometer then you're going to place it on the counter until the temperature hits 240 well once your temperature reaches 240 you can remove your candy thermometer and we are now going to add in our gelatin or our jello and our gelatin mixture right so now we're gonna get our jello we're going to get that added in and then you're gonna very carefully stir this until it is fully mixed together your sugar the sugar syrup and the gelatin come together but be very careful because this is very hot you're going to pull it from the bottom and again make sure to get the edges and then it's this is up to you it's an optional step I do I like to use the hand blender on it and the reason I like to use the hand blender is just to make sure that everything is all mixed and blended thoroughly together [Music] [Applause] well see you like that be careful I'm gonna clean up my little mess here and then we're gonna get lit gonna let this sit let some of the air bubbles come out of it we you can work them out by just gently stirring it let it sit and then just look gently stir it again we need this to cool down a bit so you can do that and I'm just gonna clean up a little all right so my mixture is cooled down a bit and I'm going to pour it into my to my bottles my squeeze bottles that was one of the things I forgot in the utensils or tools you need is your squeeze bottles or eyedroppers and I use these squeeze bottles they're by sugar sweet sugar bowel and they've got their nice because they've got the piping tips for them which makes it really nice and easy as well as they have a wide bottle and a wider thread if you use bottles that have too thin of a thread if your syrup is hot or really thick it'll pop the top right off if after you filled your bottles if you still have syrup left just keep it on the lowest temperature just so that we can that you it'll stay so melted there otherwise it will solidify all right so now we're gonna get ready to put this into our moulds all right and then when you're filling up your mold you just want to fill them up just a little over halfway you don't want to go all the way to the top because that way it makes a rough edge on them and it makes your candies not very nice so you just want to try to make them as clean it's also you want to try not to get any jello on the edges there and you're just gonna fill up all of your molds and then once you've got them all filled you're gonna put them into the refrigerator for a minimum of four to six hours I found its best overnight so if after four hours or so II go to try to take about there knock coming out just leave them for overnight usually that usually works if they're still not going to come out of the mold you can put them in the freezer it means that you've got too much syrup the gelatin isn't working too well what you can do is put them into the freezer get them out of the molds remount them at about a tablespoon of gelatin and recast them and then if you find that you take out your candies and they're far too gummy too sticky you can remount them and add a little bit of liquid to it means that it has more too much gelatin you can add up I probably say about two or three tablespoons of liquid to it remelt it and just recast them and this recipe makes about sixty candies if you use smaller molds and if you use those little tiny bear molds you're gonna get about at least a hundred to 150 all right so these candies I had in the fridge overnight and I made lemon yesterday so you can see now I did I have found that they do stay there are better if you leave them overnight then just leaving them for a few hours and they'll come out and you pop them right into your sugar sour mix now your sugar sour mix should be one cup of sugar to a half a teaspoon of citric acid don't use any more make sure to thoroughly mix it in and that'll make a nice sugar sour mix if you just want sugar just use sugar what I usually do is for the sweet ones I will use a cup of sugar to about a quarter teaspoon of citric acid just a little bit because it brings out the fruit flavors so you just mix them into your sugar shake off the excess and lay them on a a rack with parchment paper to dry overnight now these guys also dry a lot quicker and then the other recipe and just pop them out now if you find that they're getting too sticky like this you can put them back into the fridge sometimes they do the when you leave them out they get too warm so as they get a little bit too sticky so what I usually do is take out one mold at a time and do them and that's it you'll continue doing that until they're all are all coated and just lay them out on the rack to dry overnight and those are your sugar or your sugar sour coated candies your sugar soda yeah cannabutter gummy and I just want to go for also a couple of things with regards to molds when you get brand news if you get brand-new silicone molds what I recommend to do is to cut to season them so I use a spray the spray cooking spray I spray it on let them sit for 20 minutes and then rinse them in hot water I don't use soap on them again but I want to rinse off all the excess cooking spray and then that kick that that cures them which is nice I found that red silicone mold do not work well for some reason they're thicker and I can never get anything out of them so I tend to stay away from red silicone molds I found the blues Browns and that work great but red mm-hmm does not work Oh to make inverted sugar replacement for corn syrup you need two cups of white sugar one cup of water and a quarter cup or sorry a quarter teaspoon of citric acid you're gonna need a pastry brush or a clean paintbrush brand new one will be better in a glass of hot hot water we're going to need a pot you want your pot to be super clean there cannot be even a speck of dust or dirt in your pot because it will cause your syrup to crystallize now you want a spatula and your candy thermometer that's pretty much all you need so to get started we're gonna get started in just one moment all right so we are gonna combine we're gonna put in our sugar or 1 cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're gonna stir that till the biggest sugar begins to dissolve and any sugar crystals that are on the side you want to make sure to wash down we'll do that in a minute and if I change you see anything in your sugar at all any dust or any little particles whatsoever make sure that they come out because I said anything at all in your sugar will cause it to crystallize and sometimes things happen you get little little dust or little pieces of stuff I said then wash down any sugar crystals off of the side and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high you want to make sure that your pot is always in the center of the burner so that you're getting proper even heat distribution not where your sugar is cooks prop evenly and so we're gonna continue to stir this until our syrup starts to boil the moment it begins to boil you're gonna stop stirring it stirring once it starts boiling will actually cause your syrup to crystallize and we need to avoid that at all costs so just continue stirring until it begins to boil and wash down and in between keep the washing down the sides of your pot for any sugar crystals whatsoever like literally one crystal will cause your your syrup to crystallize so although it's really easy to make it is very finicky when you're stirring it's also very important to take your spatula and go right around the edge of the pot the sugar likes to settle in on the edges so you want to make sure that nothing's sitting because otherwise if it sits to the bottom it will will stick and cause you problems so the reason why inverted sugar is so finicky and while any crib one single crystal or dust will cause it to crystallize because what we're making is a what's called a supersaturated solution so I don't know if you remember science class see that science stuff does come back to you if you you made saturated solutions and supersaturated solutions where you add a saturated solution is where you have water in salt you have us salt to its maximum saturation point in its water once you go one crystal beyond that it becomes what's called a supersaturated solution and that is what we're making here because we start out first of all with a saturated solution the two cups - 1 cup of water tea cups of sugar - 1 cup of water creates a super create a saturated solution by cooking off the water we are now gonna have more sugar content than your water which then creates your supersaturated solution there you go science for the day you've learned your something new you're done oh sorry one thing I did forget is you're going to need the lid for your pot mine as you can see this one is too big for it if you don't have the right lid no big deal just use them flipped over they work just as good so you definitely need the lid to your pot because once we stop cooking this we're gonna put the lid on it immediately now as soon as it starts to boiling you're gonna stop stirring it you're not going to stir it anymore from this point on you're going to add your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook the syrup to 230 for between 234 and 237 if you want a little bit of a looser syrup then 234 if you want it a little bit thicker than 237 but you're not gonna go beyond that and the only thing now that we're gonna do through the cooking process is wash down the sides of any sugar crystals form that it's the only thing you want to make sure that's equal that's it that we're going to do through the process so keep an eye on the thermometer goes fairly quickly don't walk away don't go be hitting the bong or anything silly like that and as I said as soon as it hits 234 you're gonna wash down any crystals that may be on the sides and then we remove it immediately from the heat place the lid on it and put it on your counter or a stone block and you're not going to touch it again until it's room temperature it is very important that it doesn't get agitated or moved in its cooling process because any agitation again can cause it to crystallize now if your sugar does start to crystallize at any point not a big not a huge deal put it on low heat re melted and it should be fine so as it's boiling while it's boiling into all the sugar melts the crystals can splash up onto the side so said just keep a very close eye and if you've got which imma call it screws here normally there's little bolts here on your pot where the handle make sure to clean around there because the sugar likes to hide in on those and the sugar also will gather behind the thermometer but I only tend to move that one time near the end of the cooking process because as I said you don't want to be agitating your sugar at all so when my syrup gets close to to 29 to 30 is when I will gently move the candy thermometer and wash the crystals off in and behind mat and then gently move it back all right so my temperatures now at 234 I like to actually let mine go to about 237 I like it a little bit thicker so at about 236 I'm gonna pull it because your sugar does still tend to and continue to increase once you pull it off the heat so we're at 235 236 I'm going to remove the candy thermometer turn off my burner remit place it over on my back burner here cuz it's nice and cool wash off any crystals that may be there for the last time be very careful and then you're gonna place your lid on it and you're not going to touch the syrup again until it reaches room temperature as soon as it reaches room temperature you can use it you can either store it on your counter or you can put it in the fridge for up to six months and the one thing is you can transfer it to another container however any time I've ever done that I have it ended up crystallizing I guess the agitation of moving it from one container to another so I just tend to leave it in the pot that I cook it in so I always recommend if you're gonna do that use a pot that it's not your favorite so that if your it's off to the side for a couple of months you're not gonna miss it so I basically designate one pot for my syrup so I'm not gonna miss that pot if I'm if I need it for in the next couple of months and that's it for inverted sugar making your own corn syrup so this said this is I use it quite often in place of my corn syrup it's great if you do not have access to a corn syrup easily or like places in the UK that you really don't have corn syrup you've got I think it's called a golden syrup I'm not sure but now you can easily make your own well I hope you enjoyed that little tutorial there on how to do your own inverted sugar thank you very much for watching you have a great so that's my little tutorial there on a regular gummies and sugar sour coated gummies I hope you enjoyed that as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments I'll get back to you as soon as they can I do apologize I do sometimes have a bit of a delay there I don't mean to but some life takes over sometimes but I do try to get back to everybody as I can and then here's our little of my little lemon and I did lemonade and or sorry kind of turned out like lemonade so there lemon and raspberry and these are there were little little puppies aren't they cute well good luck with your candy making and I'd love to hear how your how yours turned out and if you have any questions about the inverted sugar let me know and I hope you have an awesome rest of your day thank you so much for watching and if you're new here and you like the video I really do hope you subscribe take care have a wonderful awesome day [Music]", "u8wGR-88vrc": "hey gonna show you how to make cannabutter hard candy what you're gonna need is 3/4 cup of sugar 3/4 cup of cannabutter a box of jell-o and a half a cup of corn syrup what you want to do you want to add your sugar 3/4 cup add your corn syrup 1/2 a cup add 3/4 cup of can of butter to a pan put it in the pan started on medium heat put your candy thermometer in and sit here and stir the candy mixture until your candy thermometer reaches 275 when your candy thermometer reaches 275 you take it off the heat and quickly stir in your box of jell-o whatever kind of jello you want but work quick stir that in mix it really well and then you can pour it in your sprayed candy molds spray them really well or you can lay it on a cookie sheet and make it like rock candy just spray your cookie sheet down with nonstick cooking spray and then pour your candy on there when you're done let it cool crack it add powdered sugar so it don't stick together same thing with your candy molds when it's cool take it out of the candy mold sprinkle it with powdered sugar I got my candy going right now I'm gonna

"ARd8oVjSftc": "hey guys what's up and welcome back to nostalgia unboxings today i have an interesting item i ordered some handmade candies from the lofty pursuits website if you don't know what uh lofty pursuits is it is uh it is another youtube channel albeit one much bigger than mine currently is that uh they make candy essentially because uh i guess the guy his name is greg owns a little candy shop uh down in florida and he decided to start filming the candy making process and it's really cool i'm a big fan of the channel just uh i like watching it before i go to sleep kind of at night when they make a new episode although because of the uh current events they have not been able to make an episode recently since you know they can't open the shop because of uh corona i don't think so that kind of blows but yeah it's uh so he gives a whole rundown of like the whole candy making process he shows it from step one all the way until it's all nice and done in little candy form and it's really interesting like a lot of the history behind certain flavors certain candy shapes stuff like that it's all you know stuff you don't really think about and then you hear it and you go wow that's a lot more interesting than i expected it to be since we're just talking about like a congealed brick of sugar but yeah it's a pretty great channel they tape this thing up really well so uh i have three okay that definitely went through i have three different flavors here today inside this box or at least i should unless they mess something up there we go using my animal strength i have popped open the box whoa okay so uh i'm going to move the box out of the camera since there's a exposed slip with some information at the very bottom so these are the bags they're not too big i guess but it also depends on how fast you go through candy if you have some uh self-control then you could make these last for quite a while uh the total price was i think i paid like 25 bucks honestly like including shipping for all three of these bags which isn't terrible considering they're all you know nice handmade uh candies in small batches and the cool part is most of these you can actually go to their channel and watch it being made which is freaking cool like that's so cool to me i don't know it's not something you really ever get to see with any other food more or less i mean unless you're like the hibachi girl but this is candy so the three flavors i picked out um i went for the more kind of unique interesting stuff so we have these um these are the whorehound and marshmallow cough drops you see they have like it says cough right there uh these are a lot of the candies also he makes on like machines that are like 200 years old um from like back in the victorian era which is awesome and that includes these like cough drop actual um well you can't see it's on this side the cough drop stamps which is really really cool but we will start with these ones i will keep all the other flavors secret for when we actually get to them delightfully devilish so it pops open it's a nice receivable bag too which i gotta give them credit that's a really really nice touch i do have a little paper towel so i do not accidentally get any sticky candy on my uh on my little filming surface here which is also doubles as my bed so it says what is that dullen i think it says dahlin it's very hard to mullen there we go it says mullen i can see it now so that was the original company that owned the press that they're using now which is pretty cool oh sorry about that and then cough so i'm going to try this right now and let you know what i think of it oh okay so in the video he explained what hor hound actually tastes like i very much agree with what he said he said that it's a very licorice flavor and it is a very very licorice flavor if you're not a fan of licorice i would definitely not i'll not get the hounded marshmallow ones there's also no marshmallow flavor at all to them because um they're not actually flavoring it with marshmallow they're just using the actual marshmallow root from the plant that it's derived from and rather than giving flavor i guess what it does and what they used it for back in the day so they use basically an original recipe for this it was um it kind of moistens up your throat to help relieve your coughing and um yeah it works personally i am a fan of licorice so these are delicious [Applause] really like them um i'm sure you know your grandparents might enjoy these types of flavors more than a lot of the zoomers out there but these are good i'm really satisfied with these ones jump cut it took me took me just a little while to finish crunching up that uh candy so this video didn't take three hours next up we have pickle dill pickle flavored candy i'm a big um i love like dill pickle flavors being a a slav so to speak hailing from lithuania i am a huge fan of all these kinds of pickley things so i'm assuming i will actually enjoy this one even though the flavor does sound very weird pop the bag open we have little pickle itself kind of translucent no fancy um stamp on it or anything and now let's get right to it okay so it doesn't taste as much of like as the pickle itself if that makes sense it tastes more like kind of the brine what the pickle would be and you know in the jar very kind of vinegary acid flavor and honestly yeah i like it it's really good man i'm i'm pretty used to like super weird flavors i guess so maybe these don't phase me as much as they would someone else who you know grabs a piece of candy and wants it to taste like candy i guess the stereotypical candy flavor rather than pickle juice but yeah they're really good um i should also add that this video is in no way sponsored my lofty pursuits i'm just a fan of the channel and always wanted to you know try some of the candy that i watched them making and thought hey that made a good video i think so here we are i also show off their logo here this is a a caricature of greg himself the owner who provides all the voicing for the the videos on the channel seems like a great guy he has such a relaxing voice too so 10 out of 10 on that front but yeah lofty pursuits and you can buy these candies if you want um they are made pretty small batches so i can't guarantee that all these can these same flavors will be available when you guys go on there but they have like 50 flavors at any one time more or less so you should be fine finding something that will tickle your fancy so it'll be at www.pd.net and i'll link to that also in the description and stuff for sure the actual candy store i believe is called public displays of confection and it's in tallahassee florida as greg states in every video and a final jump cut hopefully we move on to the final flavor and what i think is gonna be the weirdest one because i actually don't even know exactly what the flavor is this is the um forbidden fruit candy is what they called it and it might be hard to see i will try to pull one out but these are actually these are based on tide pods uh hopefully not the actual flavor of tide pods because i can only imagine that going very bad but uh i guess they made their own flavor mixed something up in house that tasted very strange and unique and maybe what you would expect a tide pod to taste like given its colors and here we go it kind of looks like a berry i think used um a berry drop mold for this since they didn't they probably didn't have their own like special tide pod molds but they did swirl all the candy around with the color so you know it kind of gets the point across especially on this side and i'm kind of nervous because i really hope this actually tastes good and they didn't just like pull an epic prank on everyone here but uh oh them it's really tart it's like sour i did not expect that what are these other flavors it's definitely it's definitely berries some sort of berries i'm gonna go out on a limb and see maybe maybe like raspberry flavor but there's definitely like several things mixed in here but the tartness definitely makes me think of like blue raspberry maybe lemonade it's really good though it's super fruity and soury so if you're into any of those kinds of flavors just to be right up your alley it's really really good honestly out of all three of these this is my favorite one um i'll probably rank the pickle one last even though i did enjoy it but i did enjoy the other ones a bit better i really do like the licorice flavor of this one it's very like i don't know it kind of makes you relax when you're eating it it's just like on one of those like chill flavors i guess if that makes any sense i don't know maybe i'm just a really weird eater and can associate flavors with kind of feelings and stuff but um yeah this one is really good but this is definitely this definitely takes the cake because it's a very these are very simple flavors where it's like you know just kind of briny and acidy and this one's just pure licorice almost whereas this one has like it's really complex it's got all those weird fruit notes going around there like that lemonade blue raspberry vibe and then that citric acid the sourness it was really good ah here forbidden fruit two uh i guess they made a couple versions of this and um because the first one from what i understand what it said on the site was a limited run and but it was like so much that they're like you know we gotta make it again and then they made it again and we got this and it is good so it works and uh congratulations to pd.net and lofty pursuits aha see they don't tell us so it says artificial flavors natural and artificial colors make me just a coconut oil huh i don't think i've ever seen them actually put coconut oil into candy on the on the channel so i wonder if that's like maybe like a lubricant or something but yeah that's very good i will probably finish this candy this particular one off screen but that's about it for the video this really didn't come in handy at all i guess but uh thank you so much for watching i hope you enjoyed watching me test these kind of very strange and somewhat historic candy flavors i'm really thankful that they actually all ended up being good and i didn't like throw up on camera because that would be bad but yeah i hope you guys enjoyed and if you aren't a subscriber already i would really appreciate it if you hit that subscribe button like or disliked and dropped a comment you know telling me what you think do you think these candies are good have you tried them do you want to try them uh are you a fan of lofty pursuits in general stuff like that it would all be great to hear since my comments seem to have not been very active so far and i would like to just interact with people because i think it's fun to you know hear other people's opinions and whatnot so yeah uh see you guys make a new video every saturday so i hope to see you there next time everyone have a good one bye bye [Music] you", "aB_7ybNekGU": "as you know I'm an old man I'm getting up there in years you sir there's a lot of gray up here and in here not quite 60 yep I'm close but it occurred to me the other day that there are a lot of things that I've never done before and and one of them was make candy so that changes today well hello there old man Kelly you're Jeff to my friends in Utah me Jeff um let me tell you something about myself I don't cook I don't even barbecue I know take my man card away this guy doesn't barbecue men are supposed to barbecue so in an effort to broaden my horizons I thought what's something I've never done before and that's meat candy now was thing I was thinking back to when I was a kid we used to have these these flat hard candies that were about I don't know four or five inches by an inch and I'm really thin they were covered with plastic and you peel the plastic off they were delicious there was a cinnamon one that I used to always get at our local well it was a pharmacy that right down the road that sold candy and I'd get him there and they thought you've got to be able to make those at home right so I went on the internet I found four or five maybe six people who showed how they make rock-hard candy and I thought I could do that so I took these recipes from different people and sort of combined them and everybody had their own slight different way of doing it though it's all pretty much the same thing and so right now I'm gonna go through how I made some cinnamon rock-hard candy you need sugar I use two cups of sugar for this recipe light corn syrup you're gonna need about two thirds cup about 3/4 cup water is necessary and the flavoring I'm using the cinnamon oil that my wife got from somewhere and doing the powdered sugar for the very end a few other things you might need is a candy thermometer and parchment paper don't use wax paper the wax might melt parchment paper is better okay in my saucepan first I'll add the corn syrup that very thick sticky corn syrup follow that by the sugar that's 2 cups sure and the water with a food coloring just for style turn on to a high heat initially you want a high heat to really get this boiling quick but you have to keep stirring till everything's dissolved you don't want to stop stirring because you don't want it to start burning to the bottom of the pan remember you're a high heat once you get it to a good boil then you're ready to turn down the temperature of Bin's come out to a medium heat and now we're gonna let it simmer for about 30 to 40 minutes and this point we want to use our candy thermometer and now the goal or what we have to do here is get this concoction up to about 300 degrees that's called the hard crack temperature or something like that it's just a little over 300 degrees you can see our temperature's rising quickly but reality this took almost 40 minutes to get to the right temperature and of course a little coffee while we're waiting and our temperature continues to climb to get that's hard crack temperature and I'm not sure if you're supposed to but I kept stirring because I was afraid it would stick and burn and all that stuff and it didn't seem to hurt it we're almost there you can see it hard crack has been reached [Music] okay so we immediately removed from heat we can take up the thermometer this is where we add our flavoring my cinnamon oil I'm gonna add the whole bottle to this and almost immediately the whole house is filled with that cinnamon flavor you can smell it everywhere and you've got to stir it quick because this stuff gets thick and hard next we'll take a baking sheet covered with our parchment paper and we're gonna dump it right on there this thick gooey mess don't get any on you kids have your parents do this that kids don't try this at all because this is very dangerous very hot sticky mess 300 degrees and is too bright to your skin and burn you pretty bad if you're not careful and that's it now we've got to wait for hours before we can break this up and put the powdered sugar on and so we're done it's been four hours since I poured the concoction onto my pan and the nice part is it'll peel right up now look at this it's almost like a clear piece of glass right every so this you should just break it into chunks and look at that broke up nice and now what they say you have to do is cover baking powder because it's still sticky and though I actually like it like that the candy and remember it wasn't covered in baking powder but that had that plastic the plastic over it so I'll cover it with baking powder baking powder add some sweetness so I don't think it needs it and it'll get rid of the stickiness right and so you end up with chunks and all different shapes and sizes and now [Music] pretty tasty does remind me of those fire sticks I you see it as a kid and cinnamon always goes well with coffee so [Music] but it does plastic containers save it for later thank you for watching I hope you appreciated this I tried something new today and I sure enjoyed doing this maybe I'll do candy again in the future find another handy recipe if you've got a candy recipe you think I should try it let me know let's see if we can do it otherwise this is jeff saying so long okay [Music]", "MIQE7yE8Uiw": "today we're going to make a rare type of candy called snap stick candy here if public displays confection the machine we're using was made by Jay Gardner probably prior to 1855 somewhere around then he gave us company to his stepson Thomas Mills and the company name changed we're going to make three flavors peach plum and cherry and we're going to mix them with the colors on the table we pour the sugar on our candy cooling table this will drop the temperature dramatically and then we'll use our little wooden spoons and we'll stir in food coloring and flavoring boiling out the water that's in either of them because water makes candy sticky you this machine is a dual-purpose machine the side we're using make snap stick and the other side adds a texture that allows the candy to being robed so you can make chocolate covered toffee or something like that snaps two candies type of candy that you break off pieces from the stick has a texture on it that allows you to snap off little bits that you can pop into your mouth and our snap stick candy we've decided to flavor in the flavors of stone fruit peach plum and cherry if you ever end up in Tallahassee you've gotta this block to pursuits and see us in person we don't make candy every day but it's always a good show and lofty pursuits is a toy store with a soda fountain and a candy store inside so there's always a good reason to visit if you can't make the lofty pursuit you can always get our candies online at www.ppsd.com and now we've made the sticks candy all we have to do is size them to length to fit into bags we hope you liked

"ZqsIT_mGapI": "hi everybody my name is Sonny and you are in sunny days kitchen sorry for the shaky camera but I just had my silly cat max jump on my shoulder Oh Manny way we are going to show you how I make my canna chocolates I make it with my half a cup of can of oil and it's coconut oil infused with cannabis I make it myself and a cup of chocolate milk chocolate for flavouring this time around I'm going to use raspberry laron oils they're fabulous I use them all the time I make heart candies as well and I use these flavorings in them too so sorry I'm gonna stutter a little bit I'm a little nervous this is my first video I'm gonna put up on YouTube but anyway so and this is my little spoon that I use with I used two of these this is half a teaspoon of measuring with the oil and then in these is what I used as my moles so I'm gonna pause it so I can put my half a cup of kind of oil in to the chocolate and then I melt it that way melt it down slowly in the microwave some people use like a double boiler or whatever but I don't do that I do it slowly in the microwave it doesn't take too long especially if I'm pouring my kind of oil over top of that and it helps the mixture actually it's probably good to go but I just put it in there I'm gonna have to put it in the microwave just to melt it a little further but dying out and then I melt it down mix it together and we'll be right back okay so we're back I melted down the chocolate and it's just a little bit shy of one cup but I'm not too worried about that because um that amount right there will probably make 45 chocolates so I've set out my molds I have my small these are half a teaspoon each these are a full teaspoon so this is a full dose one of these is a full dose you'll have to take two of these depending on your tolerance level some take two three four depending on my pain level my tolerance level is quite high so I switched from smoking to edibles and back and forth so anyway this is what I do I take a full teaspoon of the raspberry flavoring I put it in there stir it around and because it's just me doing this I'm gonna have to pause it again sorry okay so we're back so I've got a tablespoon of the raspberry oil in there flavoring mine if you're wondering within my little box it's all my Laurent oils she's fabulous I loved her oils I use them all the time there's the raspberry but I've got because I make hard candies too I've got different flavoring in there I have a green apple caramel butterscotch root beer creme de menthe and orange I believe so anyway here we go this is pretty well good to go just scrape off the knife it's kind of hard to do when you're looking at it through the camera all right the whatever so then I take my little half a teaspoon and I just measure it out obviously you just take whatever because it's going in the mom like I said it takes two of these because they're half of teaspoons I just find that the smaller spoon goes better into the molds without making too much of a mess so here we go we're gonna go in one of the malls takes two it is to get it falling up as you can see it's pretty level oh don't have it so we just keep going and going and going and going you have no time lapse so I'm gonna pause it and I'm gonna get these done and then they go into the fridge and they sit in the fridge I don't know about 10-15 minutes you can check them after ten minutes because but because my molds are fairly thick molds I keep them in there probably about 15-20 minutes just to be sure that they're all solidified and they're not going to again max jumping on my shoulder on you jerk ball just to make sure that they're solid enough that I can pop them out of the molds and bag them and put them in the freezer so I am going to pause it and fill the molds and put them in the freezer so we'll just end it here but this is what we do and I will pull them out of the molds next okay so there are linear molds and I'm a little medicated because I went licking the spoon after I filled all the molds up it's very good taste yummy that's why they call them edibles because they're so good anyway I'm gonna put them in the fridge now and the next time you see them they'll be ready to be popped out of the malls so instead of waiting for the other ones to solidify cuz it'll take 15 minutes anyway so I'm just gonna cheat here anyway so these are ones that I already made that I put in the freezer and I find that these chocolates I've had them in the freezer not these particular ones but some of my edible chocolates in the freezer for just over a month and they still taste great so I've never pushed it any longer than like maybe five six weeks because sometimes they might get that freezer burn taste so just keep it to your personal preference anyway they might not even last that long but me I don't always eat edibles so I just make them and put them in the freezer so that they're there when I do want them anyway so this is all I do is just you just push on the back of these silicone molds and they just pop right out and then I put them in my bag ease I put about a dozen in each bag and then because they're little freezer baggies they don't hold a lot anyway and then I just seal them off right okay so I got everyone's in there these are crime to match and the ones are in the freezer they're our raspberry so that's it so I hope you enjoyed the video if you have any questions please put them down below and I'll try and answer them as as soon as I can I'll try and keep an eye on it I don't anticipate too many people watching it because I know there's a lot of videos about edibles on the internet but I just thought I'd try my hand on it and on my channel so again this is flower child and I hope you enjoyed the video if you have any questions please post them below and I'll try my hardest answer them okay smile have a great day be true be honest be respectful stay true and stay unique bye", "ElIInU2REZk": "so today is june 18th i ordered this on june 17th and it just came in the mail in a day this is amazing super fast shipping uh it's from east syracuse new york this is from hercules candies they have a youtube channel i found them on youtube a couple of days ago i'm not sure when this video will be posted but i ordered went around june 17th today on june 18th this is their uh magnet thing they sent in the mail but i've been watching their youtube videos the past couple days and i wanted to order a bunch of stuff and it was everything i wanted was sold out so i waited look at that yourself oh look at that they even sent me a pen oh it's so cool with the name oh that's so cool um so yeah i think we're sold out of stuff i wanted and i waited a day or so and then i had the stuff i wanted except i wanted to get chocolate covered potato chips but they were still sold out of that but i didn't manage to get everything else i wanted oh you got a bunch of packing peanuts let me grab a trash bag here now this is some candy and stuff i'm gonna do an unboxing and try it out right here i forget to make a video out of this because you know they got youtube videos i love their videos so do a video of me trying their stuff okay i think this whole box is filled with packing peanuts seems to be quite a bit in here and yeah i got the windows open summertime probably heard the noise yeah there's quite a bit in here okay so let's start off first with this i think this is the cold pack yep you can feel it's kind of the tape's a little wet it's cool yeah i wasn't sure i got these things about cold packs you water chocolate and if it's like hot outside but i didn't order any chocolate but i've got cold packs anyways just because it's going to be i wasn't sure how long it was going to take the ship here and the weather says it's going to be like in the 80s and 90s this week so i didn't want my candy to melt you know because it's sugar candy and yeah it's not sure how hot it was gonna be how long it was gonna take the let's start off first with peanut brittle pumpkins ooh this stuff here is candy peanut butter look at that i like peanut butter i'm gonna try this out hmm wow look at that that's good wow that's way better than any other like peanut butter you can find a store any of the brands of peanut butter that's way better that's good i'm going to finish this whole bag today so yeah this is this packing peanut butter in there now i originally planned on ordering these two flavors strawberry lemonade and watermelon and then i'm looking for the website just as i'm about to check out look into the website just to see what else i got i got cotton candy flavored i love cotton candy i love cotton candy flavored things i was so happy when i saw that i want to start off with the strawberry lemonade because i think this is their new flavor at least yeah it's the new flavor they got there all right so look at this the shore my lemonade hercules candy strawberry lemonade hard candy we have that little label on there all right one of these wow look at that hmm oh god wow wow don't really get them both at once it's like strawberry and then lemonade and then strawberry and then lemonade and keep switching back and forth and the flavor keeps switching in your mouth that noise is just hitting my teeth let me break it this is good wow i'm not a big fan of candy i was watching their videos and it just made me want to try this stuff so bad that was good this is really good candy not even a fan candy but like my stuff is good i'm eating this piece i'm gonna open up this cold pack these are reusable can you keep this this one has some cooled not super cold but oh i just squeezed it it kind of gets cold colder but it's probably just been in the package for a day it doesn't say we can reuse this because i mean i would throw it out but i mean if you're going to use them why not right keep them with this you go to the beach put it in your cord oh [Music] actually got the strawberry lemonade in my mouth but i was thinking and it's so cool they got this watermelon flavor made of watermelon lemonade that would be good oh dude i could eat the strawberry lemonade in the watermelon at the same time print your own flavors dude [Music] watermelon now what about these as they melt they still keep the flavor i can still taste it you know some candy it melts and the flavor kind of goes away you can still just take a long-lasting flavor with these okay now move on to the watermelon flavor look at that now it's not really focusing but all right whoa that's a burst of flavor right there that's good that's good the only thing about this one is just it's already it tastes like watermelon but oh no it's like a different coyote different type of watermelon flavor tastes good though that tastes good and these right here are eight ounce bags i think they're all the same size oh maybe give you a little date best buy that's so cool that's good for me because i don't eat candy a lot so i'll know which one i gotta eat these by these are good i definitely think next time i'm gonna order some chocolate not a big candy fan out of a chocolate fan but the sugar candy's good their peanut butter is really good i'm going to try chocolate next oh and i want to try the ribbon candy they make these ribbon candies i don't really know what it is but it looks like uh it looks like thin ribbons but you know the candy i wanna try those two people order from here again maybe a little bit maybe i'll do another video when i order it again too look at me what's cool about these is they're not all identical some of them got more pink some of them are a lot more green in them you know they're they're all different and their packages are very good too then wrap them in bubble wrap put them in packing peanuts they definitely fill the box too packing peanuts bubble wrap good packaging the only thing about these bangs is they're like these little plastic bags i'm not sure i don't think they're not resealed but i like the uh i like to use the resealable one for the peanut butter but oh you can just throw them in another bag a ziploc bag or whatever i just don't want to like put it somewhere and they spill out and maybe scoop them up because i'm not the brightest bulb and stuff i'll end up knocking the bag over and we'll go over there okay right here we got tie-dyed hard candy cotton candy flavor tie-dyed cotton candy look at that that is nice look at these oh they look so cool that cotton candy flavor look at this like pink and blue on one side then you flip it over and it's like got white in there pink and white hmm i feel like the flavor isn't as strong with this one can you taste the cotton candy i don't know it could have been the piece maybe that specific piece didn't have a lot of flavor in that piece but you can taste the cotton candy it's just i feel like the strawberry lemonade and the watermelon have like a stronger flavor with like stronger flavor but it's kind of like a creamy cotton candy not like straight up cotton candy but like i like cookies and cream it's got that creamy flavor this is like a creamy cotton candy i think it's good but it's good probably my favorite it's super good super good they're all good i don't know what's my loving this favorite butter i think i'll finish this

Jedi here it's been few days anyway since my last update it's gonna be a quick one I got clones I got a cutting stuff half a plant to trim still so but what I wanted to do is come out you guys Kelly stop your warning girl I'll let you in a minute stop this is my girl right here I'm a pup Kelly tsuyoi say I speak speak good girl anyway so I made these canna butter infused candies and I got the recipe from star Delta nines channel so for any of you who are not subscribed to her be sure to check her out she does a lot of different cooking recipes she has her own girl she's uh she's a wild chick that's for sure but anyway I wanted to do hard candies for the longest [ __ ] time and I just stumbled across this and that was about all four or five days ago and since I made these freakin candies guys I have been fried I have been met so medicated since these things are awesome they taste freakin great so without further ado these here are the lollipops I made them with orange jell-o flavored and they got some icing sugar on them quite a bit more than probably most people would put on them to be honest but I love it and then I made these little swirly candies a lot of it was because it you know it was my first time it's just for me a lot of it was just what's built out all over the cookie molds and stuff but these candies guys it calls for half a cup I believe of yeah half a cup of peanut butter and most recipes that I've been finding trying to find a cookie rest era candy recipe is with like tink stirs and oils and stuff so when I found this I was in my frigging glory and honestly guys they taste good the taste is really good they went raw card like they're rock candies man they're rock candies and if you look it's actually a mustache lollipop these ones are so that's pretty funny but yeah so I got these little molds small ones and I'm in Candy's boat here being a sec both this big so in my opinion if I'm eating candy this size right here it better be able to give me what I want you know I finally know one candy I want to make sure that I'm getting medicated from it and this stuff works great when I came to Cal no friggin way oh no hey so I just dropped this one on the ground so I'm gonna have to eat it no but yeah I wanted to show make a quick video just to let you guys know on both these candies and like I said the recipe is on stardoll tonight's channel so if you want the recipe you're gonna have to sub er up and you're gonna have to watch the video for yourself and get it yourself I was gonna post it on here for you guys but I thought you know I know put it on making you guys go and subscribe to her and that'll get her some more people and well [ __ ] she's got a hell of a lot more than I do I got like ten followers compared to hers again you know she's doing pretty well for herself she knows what she's doing she's got recipes for Jolly Ranchers on her website she's got recipes for chocolate bars oh I saw cupcakes on there that had the icing was infused as well like definitely a lot of crafts on her website and she grows as well she's got girl updates and everything so yup guys all right this is Jedi coming at you with a candy update peace out", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what

"3/4 cup sugar 1 cup corn syrup the moms are on make sure that it's on Fahrenheit stuff medium hot tincture boiled down beforehand approximately 20 minutes very low simmer till it's just barely juicy this is sat it's a little bit dry use a pot scraper to get it out candy trays lightly sprayed with Pam small packet of jell-o ready put some in the sugar as it's boiling not all of it just some pock scraper is very effective especially in the stride out state do not lose the pot scraper I have a rata added the first amount of tincture that I showed you the other amount is waiting just gonna do some bubbling and boiling you don't have to stir it constantly but it's a good idea to stir it regularly already at 2:26 this candy thermometer has a cover that has a guide on it candy on the right hard crack 302 Fahrenheit I was previously only going to 250 275 which got you somewhere between fall and soft crack the fall is going to be chewier the hard crack is going to be just like a hard candy it'll start looking a little bit frothy that's alright it's normal just keep doing the stirring a little bit we're already at 236 within a couple of minutes try to scrape the edges every once in a while to keep it all incorporated it's going to get a little bit thicker keep going we're almost 300 first put the teacher in still won't but it'll break down with stirring it turn down a little bit we got a little too hot out of jell-o try not to fling it around in the pot that's pretty much what you put on the sides you're not going to get off keep it on the heat you can lower the heat a little bit keep it on the heat so that you can keep stirring the jello in just be in the pot looks like like super sure to get all the edges and top bottom so you know you got all your jello and your team's you're mixing okay scoot over you did hurry to try and get as much of it out of the pot as you can before it starts doing the stringing crap nothing but once it's in the tray let it cool a little bit where you start spreading it other ways you get that so it's best to try and pour it across this mold as best you can so you don't have to mess with it a lot still a little warm spreading that as it gets cold or cooler it's easier to just push around where you want places where it slowly I'm just kind of try to get rid of the lines these are it's not a big deal for your personal use but if you're gonna sell it these are harder to deal with it's not square it's harder to make them all level just don't look as nice but if you're starting with this tray you will probably get closer to looking nicer like that rather than the partial pour where you don't really know how much fill of your mold you just on a poori so these are a little bit thick and sloppy looking you try and mash them down but as they get cooler they're just gonna snap off Chrome's like that", "mnr3f1UZuMU": "[Music] hi welcome to diamond delight animals my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and for the rest of you guys thank you so much and welcome back so I've I've been asked about chocolate in the past and I have never been able to successfully get it to set at room temperature using cannabutter then the other day when I was doing the truffle demonstration I was using the shortening to thin out our chocolate for decorating it dawned on me that shortening sets at room temperature in chocolate will stay set at room temperature so I made up a an infusion with shortening instead of butter and I do it just like the small infusion like all other ones I'll run a quick little thing for you here on it but if you want more detail on it you can check out the small infusion video so yeah so I get a small infusion of shortening and yeah I'll show you how much better that works and the reason being is butter has a melting point of fancy it's between 85 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit so basically a little room temperature a little bit warm it's going your chocolate is going to melt or sorry your butter is going to melt however shortenings melting point is 95 to 115 degrees fahrenheit so it's got a lot more stability so you know that if you've got shortening butter on the counter you notice you're shortening nice and solid where your butter might be a melted mess on all that hot day and and that's the reason is because of the higher melting point so I think that into our chocolate does not affect our chocolate and it allows it to stay set at room temperature now I'm doing this demonstration with candy melts if you want to do it with real chocolate that's not a problem but you will have to temper it I hate tempering chocolate one of these days I will do a video on how to do it exactly personally I hate it the candy melts taste great and they just work so easily so I'm going to show you that demonstration with it and so check this out so M here's our chocolate he's nice and snap and you can see it's not all melting and the squishy let's see if you can hear it hoping that came through on the micro on the thing and then for our peanut butter cups any time I am a peanut butter cups in the past all the recipes that I have I have looked up add anywhere between two to six cups of powdered sugar and I'm like that is disgusting one time I made it and it is it's so sweet all you get is sugar and with a hint of peanut butter and it still doesn't stay set at room temperature it still kind of oozes out and it just it's just not a proper peanut butter cup so off I go and do my research and stuff look up the actual ingredients in a rescreened a butter cup Wow I can make certain things work for us and I've managed to come up with this come up with this for us so check this out it's a peanut butter cup that I did a little earlier look at that Center there's no using or squishing out looks just like a peanut butter cups and they spin chocolate layers yeah that's alright I'm going to show you guys how to do this alright now with regards to doing this recipe it's really good because you have full control over how much sugar you want to use you can use just a little bit or a lot of the powdered sugar because we're going to use all-natural peanut butter and so this is great for people who are diabetic now if you can't use sugar what you can do is increase the tapioca search that we use and in a honey or maple syrup or I got I got syrup as your sweetener and yeah you can eliminate sugar as well that's because we're adding in our salt if you're on a salt reduced diet you can either eliminate it altogether or as little or as much as you like so this is really good for anybody who is restricted with diet as well as if you're a diabetic you can use the dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate use dark chocolate alright guys so let's jump into those ingredients of what we need to get started let's make some chocolate that material D car being in a smaller mason jar at two forty four forty minutes and then I've just got my shortening I've used one cup of shortening mine's yellow because I've used the butter flavor so I'm gonna be using the my shortening in place of butter for a lot of things so I decided to go with the butter flavor and a pot of water now you need the pot large enough deep enough but it is going to be able to cover your oil or your shortening once it's melted with the herb in it it's very important that your oil is always covered by water so I'm just gonna place this in here into the water and I'm gonna let that melt up just gonna boil that up and let that melt down while my herb is d carving and then we gotta cool it cool the deeds cool our herb yeah you can always use a French press instead of a mason jar it's nice because it already has the built in the screen for for helping when you have to now you can also use a French press for this I usually use the French press however I thought more people have a mason jar so I just go the mason jar method today alright so I have just added my plant material to my shortening and I've just given it a mix up there and they still mix up I'm gonna place there in the water and like I said the one thing is very important is that your water is above your shortening line you never want it to go below and the reason is is if you do your shortening is going to get hotter than what we want it to but keeping the water on the outside and completely surrounded maintains a constant temperature for what's inside if you allow that to go below your shortening will actually heat up a lot a lot higher and look and can burn your plant material which we don't want so I said I'm gonna let that go for two hours every once in a while I'm gonna come by and give her a shake up and if you're wondering I was using shake that's why I don't have any larger pieces in there and that's it and we're just gonna let I said go for two hours okay so you just want to have it on the mild simmer like that just where there's little tiny bubbles on the bottom of the pot but it is not boiling or vigorously boiling so what I said keep that temperature down a little bit patient is done put in and make sure that you strain it really well with a fine fine mesh strainer a cheesecloth or you can get one of these hold on you can get one of these bags from magical butter and it has the superfine it catches all the really fine sediment far as I said cheesecloth and that will work as well you put it into your stand mixer or if you're gonna use a hand mixer you're gonna be standing there for about 20 minutes we're gonna set this to low and we're gonna let this go for about 20 minutes as I said now if you used regular shortening yours is gonna be a lot lighter a very light light green and because I used the butter one is very yellow so mines it's gonna probably be darker than yours if you didn't use the butter but yeah just pour it into a container it will solidify and you can use it just like butter in most of your recipes all right so for our peanut butter cups what we're gonna need is about a hundred and fifty grams we're gonna make six large ones so we're gonna need about 150 grams of Hershey's chocolate if you want them to taste as close to the Rees peanut butter cup you want to use the Hershey's chocolate if you don't really care that much any milk chocolate will work and essentially what about 150 grams and for candidates about three of the small bars probably I think in the States it's like two or you can just use one large one in and around oh we got chocolate in my peanut butter oh all right we are going to need 1/2 a cup of peanut butter - the bar wrapper you're going to want an additional about quarter cup to a half cup we are going to want 1 cup of powdered or icing sugar a tablespoon of either can of butter or can of shortening now the shortening is going to give you a more solid product especially at room temperature because butter melts at a lower room temperature that'll be a little bit softer at room if you use the shortening they're going to stay firmer you're going to want a tablespoon of tapioca starch 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and about a teaspoon of milk doesn't matter what kind of milk and that's for our peanut butter cups for our chocolate bars you're gonna want either if you do not want to temper your chocolate then use the chocolate candy melts they taste great they work amazing they're pretty much idiot-proof if you do want to use real chocolate and you're experienced and you know how to temper go right ahead I've done tempering a few times I hate tempering so I'm going with the candy melts and you absolutely want to use the can of shortening not butter and as I said because you're shortening has a melting point of 95 to 115 so you are chocolates are going to stay set at room temperature that's all we need for the chocolate side so let's jump into our equipment and what we need and then we'll get this some of this stuff made up here all right so what we're going to need for our peanut butter cups are some cupcake liners either medium or large I've got the large here a cupcake pan to put these into to warm up gonna need pair of scissors and spatulas a bowl offset spatula and a spoon and your mixer with the blades for our for the peanut butter cup as well if you've got one of these is as a candy dispenser a chocolate dispenser these are great especially because we want to get these same amount and we want to do it quickly and easily now here's a little trick for you to create a whip when they normally come they don't have they're like this and you have to push them they're not automatic but you can create an automatic trigger by taking elastic just make a slip through it and then just put it across the bottom like so and now you've got an autumn trigger in that smart all right so that's it for our peanut butter cups for our chocolate we just need our mold pretty much now what you read I really do recommend getting the polycarbonate molds because they work so much you come out with a really professional-looking chocolate I don't recommend the silicone ones because one it's difficult to get your chocolate bars out of you have to peel them out quite often they break as well as you don't get quite the same shine as you do from the public cabinets or the plastic molds work really well as well so I think that's about it usually me you know I forget something I'll throw in there later but I think I've got the major stuff covered so let's jump into our making our peanut butter cups first alright so the very first thing we're gonna do is we got to cut our cups down to size so the easiest way to do this I'm gonna do six so I've got six of my liners here is fold them in half like so and then you want to cut about a half an inch or an inch off an inch off and you're just gonna go try and go evenly all the way around see now we have cups that are roughly the same size the weight side I just put them and get your tins and then the next thing we're going to do is we're going to get our chocolate our Hershey chocolate melted or your clean milk chocolate we're gonna get that melted now you can either my you can either melt it in the microwave I do mine at 30 second interval first then 20 then 15 then I finish it out at 10-second intervals until it is completely melted you can do it over a double boiler so any pot or a proper double boiler you can use or one of those candy melting pots any of those methods will work so it will work it just perfectly fine whoops I'm just gonna set that aside and if you want to if you've got if you are using the can of shortening you can add about a teaspoon or so a can of shortening to your chocolate if you'd like to but I'm just gonna get that melted up and then won't get everything put together alright so I've got my chocolate melted here it's all nice and smooth and like so so now you want to take a little bit about a teaspoon or so let's see you just drop it into the bottom we're gonna move it around now this is a little difficult to work with I find it's easier to take them out you can use the back of the spoon to go around the bottom and you want to bring it up around your edges and remember you just want to keep it a thin coat then you want to try and get as close to that top there as you can you just dip the back of the spoon in if you need a little bit more like so so I've got all the sides relatively evenly covered here drop it back into the mall and into the cake pile or the cupcake pan smack that down now if your bottom is not all filled just take a little bit more and just just lightly enough so that you just have that little light coating on the bottom so these are a bit of a pain to get doing even I'm just gonna do that again to all of them I find the offset works a lot better I'm just gonna finish the rest of these out and then we will get the peanut butter part going if you find this a little too much in the bottom you can just drop the excess all right so now that I got all the chocolate into my cups here just gonna clean off the top and then we're gonna set these aside let them set up while we make up our peanut butter filling all right so for peanut butter filling we're going to put in our half a cup of our all-natural peanut butter we are going to put in our our can of shortening but we do we want it melted and the reason that we want it melted is because if it's all if it's at room temperature and it's more than solid it may not evenly distribute all through your peanut butter it'll be little you can end up with little clumps of it so you definitely want to make sure to melt it get that in there and we are going to our to our Center we are going to add our powdered sugar our tapioca and our salt and we're going to sift that through and any hard chunks that don't go through just to start those and now we're going to need our mixer first of all so we don't end up with flying powder everywhere you just want to fold that in to your peanut butter and your can of shortening or your butter and we're going to add in our teaspoon of milk and we're just going to start our mixer on low now what will happen is it is all going to clump up like this it's gonna clump up like like this it's gonna kind of look like rinoa that's okay don't worry that's what we have the extra peanut butter for this is what we want it to do to start with so just continue to mix it until it's all broken down into little chunks like this and now we're gonna take our peanut butter with our mix and we're just going to drizzle something a little at a time until it starts to come together and form a nice mixture looks like I'm gonna need this might need a little bit more than that half cup we'll see actually I think I just used a quarter cup they're a little bit more big spoonful here just a little bit so the texture that we're looking for basically is like a peanut butter dough so we don't want it super stiff but we also don't want it really really some loose so we do want it basically like a dough like this so I do want it a little bit looser because that's a little too firm but that's the best is what we're working towards so I'm just gonna scoot it a little bit more peanut butter now so now if you've got it like this it's coming together so now we're just gonna knead it a little bit so I said it should be like dough you're just gonna need this up a little bit and then I'm just gonna take pieces of it and I'm just gonna kind of roll it trying to get it roll it into a rope here about the size of the bottom of my cup the diameter of my cups and then you're going to cut about quarter inch discs I only need sex we got a lot of dough here then we're going to take two of them and stock them together like so now if you used butter yours are going to be a little bit looser if you use the shortening they're going to be a lot firmer and that's because there's no water in shortening there is they go two to three percent of water in butter so we got those gonna get my cuffs well then we're gonna take two of those disks and squish them down your mold and then you can take your tray and you're gonna work them so you just want to make sure to fill in your cup until it's almost right to the top of the where your chocolate is cuz you know on the Reese cups it's a very very thin layer of chocolate over your top so you want the build up to almost the top you just want to leave just like a little millimeter or so of space for your chocolate topping and you want to try and make sure that's even as possible I said mine's a little bit stiffer yours if you use the butter will be smoother and they will flatten out nicely and evenly into your molds when you smack them down like so and for your extra peanut butter if you've got it you can just store it in a in any kind of airtight container and use at or at a later date trying to pop those into the fridge for about half hour now here is a peanut butter one the center that I made up earlier this I used with cannabutter so you can see it's a lot looser and more workable it's not as stiff as the one with the shortening and so this one as I said when you put it in to your mole into them into the complet cup and you smack them down they just spread out really nice so now for our chocolate bars what I've done is I added my my shortening I melted my shortening and I added it on into my chocolate and you're just gonna mix that around with it kind of all coated and we're gonna you're gonna about your chocolate in your preferred method alright so you've got your melted chocolate now it's really important to stir it well not vigorously because we don't want to create a ton of air bubbles but we want to make sure that it is well well stirred so that our shortening is properly incorporated into the chocolate and you'll know that by there will be no streaks it's going to be one uniform color and texture you won't see any kind of streaking now I've lined up just put a piece of parchment paper down so it can catch any of the excess that we scrape off so that none goes to waste and if you don't thoroughly stir it like so to make sure that the shortening is properly and well incorporated is you'll end up with streaks in your chocolate you don't want that you want to have that really pretty solid look to it okay once you're happy with your chocolate before we put it into the mold we're gonna top it out a little bit to get out some of those air bubbles so you're gonna shake it agitate it and there we go and they're just going to pour it into our molds now when you're pouring your molds again you want to do it nice and evenly fairly quickly and evenly so that you get that nice smooth if you do it in kind of sections pour a little bit shake it out you'll end up with different layer looks to it you don't want to have that basically oh look at that I calculated that pretty good and then you want to get a spatula spatula like that and you're gonna go hold it straight to the top OOP and just go straight along this will pull off your excess [Applause] off your edges I was gonna give this a final little shake and tap down any excess get out any of the excess uh uh access air bubbles want to make sure those sides are clean so you take out a nice even nice clean chocolate and once you're happy with your mold it's gonna go into the fridge for 20 for a minimum of 20 minute it needs that time to crystalline to crystalline crystallize something like that it's a technical term in chocolate to let it come back together so it needs at least I said 20 minutes in the fridge do not put it in the freezer to speed this up it needs to be the fridge so while our chocolate bars are setting we can put the tops on to our peanut butter cups so I just remounted my chocolate my the remainder of my Hershey's chocolate here and we are going to just add a little bit to the top and just smooth it out easier key spoon camera we just want a nice thin coating just seal up that top smack her down so you're just gonna smack them down until the tops are nice and even and then you're gonna pop these back into the fridge for 20 minutes to let that talk chocolates set and then we are gonna take everything out and see how everything looks all right so the chocolate bars are set now if you don't want to get fingerprints on your nice pretty chocolate you want to use latex or rubber gloves so you take them out of the refrigerator well let them sit for just about 30 seconds a minute and then we're gonna give them a good smoke whoops one broke not too hard and you need to flip them over and there we go beautiful chocolate bars and I'll show you once they get to room temperature that they will actually stay set it won't bring out the peanut butter cups and check those puppies out now here's one thing I want to show you you might see on some of the chocolate here there's some slight imperfections it's not completely smooth and clear it's nice and smooth and shiny that was because there was some my mold was not a hundred percent clean I thought it was your molds have to be really a hundred percent clean with hot soapy water and completely dry otherwise that will happen to your chocolate so well let's have a look at our peanut butter cups and we'll wrap this the puppy up oh sorry and then for your just for your chocolate or to keep them you want to use a thin some thin tin foil and just wrap them up like a little Christmas present I'm not very good at wrapping presents but there you got it and then you can always make your own wrappers just from you can print out on paper you can make your own paper wrappers for them all right so I got my peanut butter cup set now if there's any chocolate kind of stuck to the to your cupcake liner and the tin you just want to scrape that make sure that's loose and then you should be able to just take up there we got our peanut butter cups so let's have a look at one of these suckers there we go so what I do to avoid is for the edges what I would recommend them to do two rounds of coating the edges and that will help take care of that issue there and then have a look inside of them so you can see if you've made these before you would just open them up they would have squished all out and check out those insides looks just like a peanut butter cup isn't that cool and these taste so good with so much reduced sugar to all those other recipes out there and in a way that you can actually make them vegan or let's see vegan yeah if you use the vegetable shortening and you use the tapioca starch with the you can use powdered sugar I think that's not an issue but if you don't want to use powdered sugar you can increase the tapioca a little bit and use honey or maple syrup or a guard at not a car I got I got syrup one of those replacement syrups you can use that as a sweetener and avoid the sugar all together you just has a sin to have to increase that tapioca somewhat you just kind of have to work to get till you get to that text that consistency texture but other than that that's why demonstration there for you today if you have any questions at all as always please don't hesitate to ask and I gotta get this stuff off my fingers and and I hope you enjoyed that you guys have an awesome rest of your day thank you so much for watching [Music]", "d0ab5GPZD7M": "yeah keep going up cardstock you guys got a business card now you guys know that yeah how do you guys have a digital one good summer lesson yeah who's the bandit it looks like the outline of mom although I can't see her that well because she's hidden she's an outlaw yeah her choose one in 17 states what would you do mom yeah I can't tell you it had something to do with tie-dye but I can't tell you what it was Oh counterfeit tonight yeah oh you did such a good guest couldn't tell me and that I got it pretty quick in one somebody Facebook messaged me that there's a video where max adds the flavor it was cherry the champion cherry & epified video and flavouring form performs a perfect part well no it's a little lopsided but if it wasn't perfect I posted perfect but it was a heart issue so should me where it was like to get screenshot I don't know I'll put that on the facebook at some point yeah they're a regular old Walter White well that's not so good [Music] a sketch like that's a good grandparent flavor like that I don't have a bowl of water spout their house my grandparents kept their butter whether Scotch they kept that out of tune is locked up but it's hard as a brick part of butter right just trust me on that yeah I feel like there's people in this world that love cranberry sauce cakes cranberry sauce love coconut I hit coconut like a fan on the sleep or don't like a family sake and then there's your heart butter people versus yourself but who like start over very soon in the comments who is on team hard butter and enlighten us Oh your mom likes it too no no I'm just saying she probably was if you never talked about it yeah okay so our family is very into talking about our feelings dad you do watch her head I was very quiet for but we didn't put any hot water in the table for this correct oh yeah I felt the table this field decides with a little bit warmer than the other side but I guess it's because that's where the I just didn't know if you did it for Hardy I mean I know we do for tie-dyed for a couple just not I'll put it on the table so you just put it in leave it in there for a couple of batches that stays warm yeah it doesn't hurt enough money too quickly the other lie because this is a butterscotch so I'm not gonna add any citric acid sour butterscotch there's a flavor that nobody wants and you guys are still trying to get the citric acid amount still messing around with that we're gonna add more today because if it lemony should be kind of safflower then once we nail that I wouldn't be opposed to it you're trying a strawberry lemon-aid mmm I'm just gonna have teeny tiny bit which is gonna be tough for me to add a teeny tiny bit next does drop mmm next those drops was trying to say he said it so easy I thought it was a sick thicker you know what I thought it was - I haven't worked with a brown a heck of a lot oh I know I saying I wouldn't be opposed to I thought maybe strawberry lemon-aid you just did that would be okay I'm talking to somebody maybe talking to me just like everything to go okay that's right that was the point I think we're talking about how we would do that but we would do half a batch would have to do strawberry half of you lemonade insurance they're trying to blend them together and just because one might cover the others or mix using other where's that the Kings are side by side that might work I'll come back to that I just want to make sure people didn't miss the corns are being put in because this is so exciting isn't it yeah Wow one more problem good to pick tomorrow to work that way right hand where our sketch is an extra flavor yeah those where we get the food and friendly right and it's not further that off route but it is friendly as opposed to being punched in the face or something wait clove is a popular one we had a Christmas time there's quite a few people that want us to separate clothes really yeah I know it's hard never we make spiced candy other than maybe like cinnamon and anise and the clove wow yeah or even like the cinnamon I I don't much care for it but if some people doesn't love it you know quite what we were

gloves me candy shiny no but it works why don't you guys pour chocolate cotton coffee yeah that's it I dear you gonna do this one okay it goes nothing all right I don't know if I you know yeah isn't one so how are you not a Big Mac guy like a medium-sized max no it's my turn to turn the stove on you lost you Oh all right then I get to do this two in a row maybe next day oh you know as I said Oh your shoes thank you - what you're throwing mine no no those are just so like all in its power but all it's starchy and I can choose and there's fall apart the bottoms come with it yeah look at that they're all [Music] high school I had some old listen fella and so I'd like every stroke one greater self this I'm part of the European stick for a while and I just had more grippy shoes I would probably not had that injury all right it sounds crazy but like the best grip shoes that I've ever had were like super cheap Skechers boots like for real I wore them like in a kitchen during wintertime yeah and they were the best I could walk out mop floors like no worries I think the best answered one by hand before they were to choose for us they're like these croc type shoes but I really like no slim pretty great they're actually really comfortable he's very ugly like clogs when I worked at Panera they told us again no slips ooh yeah yeah it's like it goes with like some thought you taking too long pull it out don't get enough of it quick long strokes and you can get out of there soon well that is what we're even for I [Applause] [Music] just like watching you sweat Steve me I've never sweat in my life as we see now they do the longer your own that's neat tell me is that that's beautiful rope that's how you tell my beautiful this here's a smoky tree over teacher you know when you get things between your teeth Christmas trees no hero [Music] so max correct we're just talking about off-camera oh you're right yeah [Music] my opinion I think so as well yeah you guys are both saying it and last time we were all like do you guys agree that like when you think lemons you're thinking like your face puckers up but no it's super tangy and I don't know if it's just me but like sometimes it doesn't even have to be something sour but like when I eat something after a while it just like really gets me in the jaw muscles yeah yeah like yeah I mean lemony target right yeah definitely it's like lemon juice and sugar yeah so yes I fit every time the girl will just have to bump it up although I think we should pump it up we put we put 50% more in this one yeah I mean say we put in too much one bag you could even just call it like very sour lemonade that because people been asking for sour candies I think we could do like quite half a pub next time yeah but this time when they brought a quarter cup I won't have to okay yeah if I can convert teaspoons into cups that would probably help the 3 TSP 4 tablespoons and 4 tablespoons 2 1/4 cup the beach 2014 is going to convert yeah it is it's just kind of like the imperial system or whatever the Imperial I think that's all it is right the non metric system okay I guess I would say it's like Imperial it's like quarters you know threes and then borders and then it's it's it looks alright well there's no help being a foot and there's a feet in a yard and there's 5,280 feet a mile like what go on instead of like it's all making sense so far 1000 meters in a kilometer I just gotta think about it I'm super done I don't know if I should say this part on camera but we're just talking about there's no plans for us or anything but just like throwing the idea around of having like super sour candy if super spicy candy in and I may be calling it like that twelve trials of Hercules or really something it's like so sour it's like oh I don't know if I can finish yeah yeah I got a mystical challenge to finish it like warheads for foundry challenge when we were kids you know like yeah we got to tell you just talking about this and make my teeth definitely sour apple would be good yeah you said a challenge man I could be like joked chocolate yeah I'll give it give it some aegyo huh or you could just buy chocolate liqueur I think it's just someone every time that we use that stuff I try to get people eat it maybe I'll not eat it it tastes bad I like it yeah I want to get a video of you eating it and a spitting it out gun this is good all right could I stand what happened last time we had it out I tried to get here to eat half a piece and she ordered I ate a whole piece damn except in Islamic summer candy potentially spice it handy to be different types of brittle I can't wait that coconut brittle you guys it's great sometimes experimental season after Easter we got like two more months yeah the day after Easter all right we gotta do something experiment at home the numbering [Music] yeah can't sell it we could try samples I thought about making a hard candy hole a few times yeah we're going for it exactly on the floor very pour it into our baking pan if you just do a small batch [Music] nicely put you know some some muscle and amber yeah that'd be cool because you know I've been thinking about sour candy since I started people at home want to do it you can just do it and use a baking pin and then let it harden and then just take a little hammer to it and break it up I got it you made your own more you know all three guys in there's one more piece left over here uh-huh it's festive no way he's gotta be here with a heat up the candy panel corabeth there we go a lot faster we've been there Oh so they were all done with this and then they turn it on it's like why he they would get done it what - and he said yeah they'd be finished the hours and of course waste to me it's like I want to go home yeah yeah like making this stuff but yeah whenever we go to work felons that's why we do it you know what it's gonna sound weird but I think they taste like chocolate cheez-its what mm-hmm it does sound weird yep I just they have like a weird out like bacon cheddar quality to them almost is there any there's no animal products in there that's the 100% cocoa this anime content may contain their so chocolate liqueur presses up okay all right I'll try it on yep I'll see what I'll see it I swear it's like yeah can you be a camera person yeah it's very chocolatey at the end but I think it tastes like it's almost like baked cheddar or something in the beginning I haven't had this isn't bitter wedding 2013 the last time I had just pure luck or and I was like oh if I go to like it a neck roll like chocolate to your shop I'll always try there there hundred percent alright I'm just gonna stop sniffing for now be brave just get it over with Greg go suck on it I like to chew them up but if you chew it up it's gonna taste more like it taste so I assume you mean cheddar right which isn't as bad as I this isn't as bad as I remember maybe it's that one that you guys they're for the more better good the other one was strong okay this one's really not that bad it was like I remember yeah I had before like your hands I could spit I was so bitter this is this is a little milder it's definitely better a little strong I'm not a huge fan of it I kind of minds of like very chocolate baby hot cocoa that hasn't been sweetened ah yeah mm-hmm well that's what it is right yeah yeah so you get chocolate core just add some sugar I like it you know it's not bad I wouldn't seek it out but yeah goodbye let's see go regular chocolate either yeah I'm gonna try making that my in hot chocolate one of these days what's that I think it's just I think it's just that like cocoa liquor and hot water or something they didn't do sugar than the Mayans they just just use the beans and then they they may be diluted it with water possibly I don't know out of it I don't know coming read any Mike Mike Mayan that works lately yeah I'll let you get back to work alright we're hardly working [Music]", "0RmSHAHwIoM": "hello everyone today I gonna make some homemade taffy that uses kool-aid drink mix here we go [Music] so in a large saucepan start off with two and a half cups of white granulated sugar add to that three tablespoons of cornstarch and then whisk those two things together just to make sure that there aren't any lumps in your sugar or lumps in the cornstarch then add one cup of clear or light corn syrup you can use the golden kind as well it just may affect the final color of your candy add to that one in 1/3 cups of water at room temperature and two tablespoons of butter now turn your heat on to medium and begin to stir over medium heat until it starts to boil once it starts to boil you can stop stirring and you need to cook this mixture until it reaches 250 degrees Fahrenheit I broke my candy thermometer just moments before making this video so I was using my digital meat thermometer but either way just make sure you get up to 250 degrees Fahrenheit once you reach that temperature remove it from the heat now what I did is I divided this and poured half of the mixture into another saucepan because I wanted to make two flavors of taffy added in one quarter teaspoon of vanilla extract into each of the containers and then I added in a packet of kool-aid drink mix this is the unsweetened kind so I put one packet into one pot and it was orange and the other one I use cherry and Max is helping me out here in the stirring Department if you don't want to use two flavors use two packages of drink mix in one pot and a half a teaspoon of vanilla so once that's stirred in you're going to pour it onto a greased cookie sheet or in this case I'm using one that's been covered with a silicone mat you could spread it out a little bit and then just let it cool you need to let it cool so that you can handle it without burning your hands basically it's going to take about 15 minutes or so then butter your hands and generously because this stuff is sticky and pick up a portion and you're going to pull and this candy and you will see as you pull and stretch and pull and stretch the color of the candy will start to change from a dark red to a lighter kind of a pastel shade as you're adding air into there continue to pull the taffy and when you get a nice pale shade you're going to cut it up into portions using a buttered pair of scissors or a buttered knife or a buttered pizza cutter now just to show you the difference between pulled candy and one that's not pulled I'll show you two here you don't have to pull it if you don't want to the one on the Left hasn't been pulled and the one on the right has so you can see it's a real color change if you don't want to go through the pulling just cut that puddle of candy down the cookie sheet in two pieces and then wrap it in waxed paper wrap in a wax paper twist the ends and you have a nice little piece of taffy I was pretty happy with the way these turned out the flavor is very fruity and it is remarkably like a starburst candy if you've ever had one as a matter of fact it is so similar to a starburst candy I might even put it in the title as homemade starbursts the texture is a little bit softer than a starbursts taffy a little bit softer maybe just a tiny bit too soft could be that I because I was using a meat thermometer I didn't quite get it hot enough and actually formed one into a little square shape so you could see how you could package these like homemade starbursts overall very fruity nice little treat really sticky when you're trying to chew it just like a regular taffy hope you give them a try if you do let me know thanks for watching if you enjoy making your own candy why don't you give these a try homemade lemon gumdrops so go ahead and

actually wasn't sure that would work out but it worked out perfectly so I thought it would be cool to use a OS capsules to move Jolly Rancher I don't know ring pops you can cover I don't know what you want to call them cos ring pops so I bought a bag of Jolly Ranchers I have four different color cos capsules here so I'm gonna try to make green I guess green apple right there I matched up with the three EOS it will be delicious then we're gonna have watermelon blue raspberry and grape dee-licious so before you do anything you want to make sure you have your capsule ready because once you heat up and I use the microwave your candies it hardens very quickly you want to make sure that you snap it back and then I'll keep in okay and I used five or six candies you can probably get away with five maybe before if that's all you have but for sure it's better to use a little bit more than a little bit less obviously and then I put them in the microwave for 10 seconds at a time you could probably go over 20 the first time if you felt comfortable but just really really watch it because it does melt quite quickly actually maybe a total of 30 to 40 seconds so watch the ball might be hot here we have melted Jolly Rancher green apple flavor carefully carefully carefully pour it into your capsule and again it does hard it quite quickly the stuff in the bowl is already getting sticky it's hardening is you want to make sure you try to go as quick as possible if it does harden you can always microwave again and then put the remainder in your capsule so once you have that put it in the fridge or freezer and you should be good to go so when I went to go make the purple there was only three grapes my package which I tried to make work but it didn't so what I did is I melted the grapes so the three grapes that I had I poured it in and then you'll see that it actually melted two of the cherries because I had about 20 cherries that I wasn't using I guess Jolly Rancher things with everybody likes cherry I don't know so I put two extra cherries on top of the grape and then you'll see that I have to do that for the blue raspberry as well because they only gave me three blue ones so again I use some extra cherries and put them on top [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so I am so happy with how this turned out it's still the perfect POS shape just like hope for [Music] the feature the extra little plastic that came off supposed to be but that's fine just pops right off put it back on the lid and breathe out back here awesome a Jolly Rancher gos repot can you see their face [Music] thanks for coming to watch our video you guys this is super easy and it's really quite dummy at the end of it so I hope you guys can try it please come back to watch more of our videos make sure you subscribe like and share and if you leave a comment or get back to as fast as we can right [Music]", "nJalmWldHNI": "all right an entrepreneur has feared out yet another way for us to get high on marijuana and it definitely has nothing to do with why Noah's not here today hello dear friends it is me filling in for noah glutton who definitely isn't too high to be on camera right now I'm sure you guys have all heard of scissor and lean thanks in no small part to your favorite popular rap songs well there's a new scissor out there that replaces the codeine with THC for your health a company called active list has created grape scissor with cannabinoids which they first introduced via free samples to the public on 4/20 I'm not sure why they picked Hitler's birthday for their pot sauce premiere but let's move on active list is a pun on the company activists were the folks behind the original prescription codeine syrup that you've heard you know little Wayne or Miley Cyrus or you know just whoever rap talk about see activists is pulling their stuff from the market because people are keeping way way too [ __ ] up on it seriously man that should kill you so legs the state way so active list swooped in and created their own medicine which is supposed to be a lot safer than lean they're touting it as a healthy alternative like soy milk but it still has the same purple color and goopy consistency it's $45 for two ounces which is up to two doses although some people just down the whole thing in one go cuz they're rebels and they don't care it seems kind of pricey to me since the high is over in about ten hours do you have any idea how much meth you can get for that kind of money guys the gentlemanly asking now we can get this stuff here in LA because pot is basically legal here but they are working on a THC free version so it could be shipped across state lines I don't know what the point of a THC free version of this would be but hey why not knock yourselves out active list there's a pretty good chance the activists people might try to sue ACTA bliss for a copyright infringement or something but they haven't done it yet and active list is just hoping they won't while still preparing for the possibilities I'm not sure who I'd pick in a fight between someone stoned on codeine against someone stoned on weed but let me know where you put your money in the comments I michael truly subscribe to taste it where you can find out about all kinds of ways know a gluten is definitely not getting high right here on the food fear", "3mA2FaNRZ2A": "welcome to 420 rx cannabis cooking and confectionaries here's Jamie hi today I'm making THC infused watermelon lollipops using 1/2 cup of water 1/3 cup of corn syrup 1 full cup of sugar 1/2 teaspoon of lecithin and I'm going to bring that to a boil I'm going to use pink food coloring as well as white for my color I'll carefully place my candy thermometer and continue on a slow boil to 300 degrees once I reach 300 degrees I'll need to move quickly I'll remove from heat add my flavoring add my tincture and mix that well I'll transfer it into my plastic candy funnel and proceeded to fill my silicone mold as the candy cools it is going to start to harden it will set quickly in the molds now I being impatient went ahead and put my molds in the freezer for about 5 minutes once they were sturdy enough to move I'm bringing them out removing them from the molds they turned out perfect fifteen watermelon lollipops made with an alcohol-based tincture enjoy be sure to subscribe to this

This sh*t is crazy! What up, Internet? Corinne here, and you're watching Corinne vs The Galaxy! Yes! Today, I'm trying a project that's been suggested a gazillion times. The galaxy lollipops. \"Stuttering Noise\" Hold on. Let me fix this real quick. *Banging Noise* Phew! That should do it! Are you ready for blastoff? Let's get started, shall we? *Engine Noise* *Cartoonish Sound Effects with Darth Vader's Breathing* This video posted by 10 Minute Crafts, makes it look pretty easy. So, I'm gonna follow their instructions and dive right in. The first thing we have to do, is crush some Jolly Ranchers. F*** yes! This is a major stress reliever right here! *Clanging Noise* Actually, this is pretty damn hard. Some of these little suckers do not want to break. Oh, yes. A mallet. *laughs* This definitely works a lot better. This process alone took me more than thirty minutes. So you're a f***ing lie, 10 Minute Crafts. A lie! Also, what the f*** are these things? This is not Jolly Rancher. And it seems pretty important for the final outcome because of the white. No mention of this candy anywhere. What is this candy? Ugh, now I'm gonna have to go to the store, and find some stuff that will work. Yes! Candy melts! That's the ticket! Okay. Now we just separate our candies, into little sections on this lollipop mold thing. But, *laughs*, they're all stuck together now. Yeah, I just have to chisel it out here, I guess. Alright, now separating the candies into the lollipop mold thingy. And then adding some of the white candy melt pieces. Wait, does this go in the microwave or the oven? Rob said to try the microwave. Don't know why I'm listening to him, but we're gonna do it. Yeah, this doesn't really fit in here. The little spinny plate can't really spin. And only half of them are heating up. So, that's a no. Great, now we know. That's why this show exists. Isn't it awesome? Okay. Let's try the oven, then. Wait, maybe this is good? Maybe if I mix things around a little bit? Sure, okay. Yeah, I don't know. The candy melts seem a little curdlely? I guess that can represent some star clusters? Yes. We have to let those cool and prepare our sugar mixture. Just add in sugar, water and corn syrup. So now you're supposed to cook that until it reaches 300 degrees. To be honest, this takes a while. Once you reached burning stage, you're getting pretty close. Actually, I don't know. This kinda looks pretty yellow. But little things like that wouldn't stop God. Right? God? Are you out there? Can anyone hear me? Yeah, now you have to pour your melted sugar solution, into a measuring cup. And then pour that, into one side of a cake pop mold. Now we're supposed to sprinkle some edible glitter, on top of there. To create some cosmic star dust. Yeah, that's that star stuff. Maybe I'm God. *MWAHAHAHAH* The power's in my hands! Then you're supposed to place your colored piece, good side down. Into the melty sugar substance. Now if you're smart, you'll already know that this sh*t is really hot. And it's probably best that you don't try to touch it with your bare human flesh. F*cking dumb-dumb! This sh*t burnt my finger and it hurts like a mofo! F***! *Sigh* Okay, now we have to let this cool. Great. I guess they look okay? You know what, I still have faith. You just have to melt some grape Jolly Ranchers, in the cake pop mold, which is easy enough. And then add a lollipop stick to each one, like this. And place the other piece on top! This is a little bit of a messy process, so be patient. Um, okay. I think these are gonna work. But this, this is when the real magic is supposed to happen. Got my blow dryer and here we go. The big reveal. Yeah, this is definitely not what I was expecting. I mean, I guess if you want to keep things positive, it kind of looks like Mars? Which is in a galaxy, I guess? *SIGH* Okay, um, we obviously need to try this again. And I'm thinking we need this candy. Right here. Actually, you know what? It kinda looks like one of those candy sticks that the Cracker Barrel sells. Okay, Cracker Barrel, here we come. Ooh, I wanna play checkers. You go first. Random person: Oh. they're here. Fine, I'm gonna leave now. Bye. Ooh. *Laughs* Look, here's me. Triggered. Mhhhh. Rob: Oh, Jesus. Corinne: It's the peacock section. Do you need anything from the peacock section? \nRob: *laughs* There's no black and white ones but I think these should work. Sour green apple. That's a big bag. That's heavy. Can you get this for me? All righty. Here we go again. Luckily, I also got some of these peppermint because these ones are mostly white. And the sour apple ones are mostly green and that is not what we were going for. Why you gotta let me down, sour apple? I thought we were friends. The only problem I foresee is that the lollipop is gonna taste like peppermint now. But honestly, that doesn't really matter to me because I don't plan on letting anyone eat any of these. Yeah, okay, here we go. I'm just randomly adding all the different colors to my lollipop mold. And you know what? I'm feeling really good about this round. Into the oven, we go. These are already looking better. Not all curdlely and what not. Let me get them a little mixing. I think we got something here, kids. Now time to retry the sugar-water-corn syrup situation again. And I think this is also looking a lot better. Meanwhile..Yeah, um, my measuring cup is currently occupied. So I'm just gonna use this other little vessel here. And yeah, sure. Now we pour this into our cake pop mold again and let it cool for a bit. Now I'm just adding my cosmic star dust and my galaxy disks. And now we wait. For like six days or something. Let it marinate. Now that shit didn't take billions of years. It only took six days and only rest on the seventh. Yes. Alright, we're just gonna pop these suckers right out of there, and I'm thinking it's looking pretty good. Not as yellow as the other ones, so that's a good sign. Now we melt the grape again. Hehe. Add our lollipop sticks which I was much more organised about this time. And then just stick our other half in there. I think my grape was a little too hot. When I did it this time, because things started spreading out a little more than they did previously. Also, this made it a lot more clear without the need of the blow dryer. So I'm gonna go ahead and say this was intentional. They look pretty dang cool. I actually did hit them up with the blow dryer a little bit and this just brought them to a whole other level. It's honestly quite the process, though, so you want to be a little careful. Those people, they can shove their ten minutes right up their ass. Right down their black hole. No? Too far? Okay. To keep it 100 with you, I would probably rethink some of the color combos if I were ever to do this again, But since I'm planning to never, ever do this again, I think they look f***ing great. Really like this one, but this one is my favorite. I mean, all of them are pretty cool and kind of out of this world. From this moment on, you can now refer to me as the Galaxy Queen. I'll also respond to Guardian Of The Galaxies. Yes, here I am, your new galaxy queen! As the official galaxy queen, I control all existence, and am the knower of all things. For instance, here, in this galaxy, there's a planet called Catdor. Home to the giant fire-breathing cat dragons. There's not many a space traveler who had found their way here and lived to tell the tale. Except for Pete, Pete's a crazy motherf***er. And see this galaxy? This galaxy here actually contains the planet Earth. And you know Earth can be pretty cool? But, there's some f*cked up sh*t going on there right now. Actually, you know what? We're just gonna burn this sh*t to the ground and start all over again. Well, uh, I guess that's it for this video. Um, doesn't really matter if you subscribe or like it up and I probably won't see you next time. Computer, set a course for deep space nine. And computer, turn up the space jams. *lit af techno music*", "RcVOWaIsDes": "today I'm gonna be doing something really fun for children and this is my version of jell-o gummy bears so let me set up with all the ingredients that we need and I'll be back in a second so now that I've set up I'm gonna show you exactly what we need I have a silicon gummy bear mold a measuring cup for our water we're gonna be starting off with cold water but I'm gonna get to that step in just a second you're gonna need one tablespoon of gelatin that is equal to 15 milliliters and if you buy your gelatin in little pockets this is what it looks like it's a standard package and this holds one tablespoon or 15 milliliters and also a regular sized box of jell-o and this here is 85 grams so for our first step I'm gonna get my water ready and I'm gonna come back in one second for my first step I have added 1/2 a cup of cold water from my kitchen sink that is very important you need the water to be cold I am now gonna take that 1 tablespoon of gelatin and I'm just gonna sprinkle it over the top of the cold water and I'm gonna let this sit here for about 5 minutes because I want this to completely dissolve in that cold water you can already see that it's dissolving quite quickly so I'm just gonna let that go for a few more minutes and then I'll come back so this is 5 minutes later and I've just taken a fork and just stir this around everything is nicely dissolved and now I'm gonna take my last little bit of water 1/4 cup and dump that right in so in here we have a total of 3 quarters of a cup of water I am now gonna take this put this into the microwave and just microwave it for about a minute until it's hot so that was 1 minute on high and you can see now that it's much clearer that's because heat has been introduced into the gelatin and water and now we are ready to add in our actual jello mixture so I've opened up our little box of jell-o and now I'm gonna get that right in there and because the liquid is hot all of the jello mixture is gonna really just dissolve that much easier in there well I smells good too and I am using a cherry today I'm just gonna mix this around so you don't have to worry about the exact temperature that you heat this to in your microwave just make sure that it's hot does not have to be boiling just hot and that will help all the you know the actual package contents mix up in there really well and that's good and now we are ready to fill our mold so I've just put my mold on a little cutting board because this is very very flexible and if it's very hard to lift up when it's full so we're ready to pour it just give that a little bit of a stir just to make sure that all the contents are completely mixed but nothing has settled to the bottom and then I'm gonna start filling our little mold and that looks good just like that okay I'm just cleaning this up and now we are ready to pop this into the fridge so you want to put this in the fridge not the freezer just into your fridge and just let this chill down for about four hours and you're gonna have a really really nice gummy bears so I'm gonna pop this into my fridge and I'll come back much later on and I'm gonna show you the final product and they are really fun and they are full of flavor a few hours later once your jello has completely set you can just peel out your little gummy bears that's what's so nice about the silicone is that you can get right in there and just peel them right out so I'll continue doing this so I'll be back in a second and our last one and there we have them let's get them around the right way look at that really nice let me zoom in so I've zoomed in just a little bit to show you how nice these are and there we have it our jello gummy bears and look at how really gummy these are really really nice you can see that extra gelatin will really set these up really well and these here are super super fresh hmm a burst of flavor right in your mouth super super fresh hmm YUM I just zoomed in a little bit more because I think I heard some of you say zoom in a little bit more I want to see a little bit more detail in those gummy bears and here we have them aren't those cute made with jell-o and gelatin a little bit of water there we have them really fun really really delicious that's it for this video I hope you enjoyed it if you did please give me a thumbs up subscribe if you wish I really do appreciate that and that's it for today I'll see you next time you", "yWvNBBq1Av4": "hi everybody its flower child and I'm coming to you tonight to show you how I make my hard candies with cannabutter so in the pot here nonstick pot I have a quarter cup of cata butter it's probably medium strength medium to strong kinda sorta depending on your preference I like the stronger that way you don't need so many candies anyway I'm getting ahead of myself so here we go quarter cup of can of butter in the pot and melting yay so we wait for that to go down then you have half a cup of corn syrup I use be high so there's half a cup of corn syrup 3/4 cup of white sugar here are my molds that I will be using and I pour my hard candy mixture in here and plop it into the mold you'll see that as well so I'm just gonna show you again you will need a quarter cup of butter 1/2 a cup of beehive corn syrup or whatever corn syrup you're gonna use I prefer The Beehive you can use your cheaper brine it really doesn't matter and then 3/4 cup of white sugar so I'm gonna go ahead and pour in the corn syrup I wish I had an extra hand but I don't so do the corn syrup I'll scrape that out in a second and you're putting your 3/4 cup and I like to just sprinkle it over I don't like to plop it all in in one little flop like I just did so you stir it all in it looks so good smells yummy too nice and sweet so you stir that around make sure it's all mixed up and there's no clumps or anything it will melt down with the heat regardless anyway do that and we need a thermometer a candy thermometer we go up to 300 degrees and this thermometer which takes about 15 minutes on the stove I like to have my temperature at 4 degrees you don't want to have it the stove too hot cause you will burn it and I have done that before which it's a total waste of ingredients but anyway sorry the boys heard a noise and like all boys do they mouth off so anyway again you will need 1/2 a cup of corn syrup 3/4 cup of white sugar and you will need 1/4 cup of cannabutter so the all the mixture is in there the stove is on I'm gonna put in my thermometer my candy thermometer and we're gonna wait for that to go up to 300 degrees which is perfect for hard candy so I'm gonna pause it and let it go anyway this goes for anywhere 12 to 15 minutes and it'll be at 300 degrees and tonight we are going to make root beer yummy so I'm gonna pause it now ok friends see you soon hi I just want to show you how it's cooking and it does bubble a fair bit but you just let that go be careful again that it is on a low temperature that you are not going to burn your ingredients you do not want to do that you want to cook it slowly but at a high enough temperature that it is going to boil like this so your eyes just above 250 sorry I had to look at it if my glasses I need better glasses so anyway it's up to 50 you're gonna pause it again - you're almost ready to pull out the thermometer and shut the oven or the stove and at that moment I put in a teaspoon full teaspoon of the root beer flavoring I am NOT going to show you myself doing that I'm the only one doing this and this stuff is quite hot so I will show you once the mixture is ready I put in a tablespoon or teaspoon sorry of the root beer flavoring in the pot stir it around then I pour all the mixture into my funnel and then I drop little by little obviously to make sure I get it in there enough and not too much in forgive the left side of the sink I have a few dishes in there I did not finish yet but I figured once I'm done all this I'll have to finish the dishes anyway so we're going to do that I am going to pause it and do the mixture and put it in the final so that I can put it into the mold okay so I have put them all in the moles if you are a little overflowed but I'm not gonna test them I'm just gonna leave them the way they are so there we go usually they do if I write on my measurements out I normally fill them all out but I was a little generous and the other ones so it doesn't matter but now I stick them in the fridge for about um you know about 15 minutes 15 20 minutes and they should be all solidified and hard and ready to be bagged up and put in the freezer so there you have it and they look good can't wait to have any but I hope you enjoyed this little instruction instructional video on how I make my canna heart candies so enjoy your day folks hope you enjoyed the video take care love and honey's flower child signing off have a great day stay true

how these are they look like sour patches I better take the whole 350 milligrams the whole thing I'm about to take the whole thing while I'm out here cuz I got like an hour parking and I'm not trying to really wait I've been waiting to eat them at the house but we've been out all day so I'm even here look the different colors they're little squares they're not the little sour patch figures and I got about like 10 of them so they smell like candy I do smell a little bit different in between they don't taste different that all tastes the same no matter what color they were um first time I ever see these they look like the exotic cards for some reason but they're edible got a matter dispensary for $15 so why not I will be coming back they get an hour to to see what the fix were and let you know they were worth the $15 or not so for now just stay tuned and Cheers and stay hi hi guys I'm back as I breathing for 23 hours later after taking 350 milligram edible I did not feel anything guys I went to the observatory in LA and I was up there for like 2 3 hours and they did not even kick in I had my moon rock art and I think after like 2 hours that I waited to see if they kicked in I just started hitting on the moon rock art and I got me it got me high as hell but these they didn't do anything for 15 bucks I bought these at a dispensary in Compton and yeah these are not worth it at all guys definitely 15 bucks down the drain but you know you pay for what you get or you get you get what you pay for and these two out of 10 don't even try ever if you come to LA so let me know if you

Liz and this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular welcome back so today I am going to show you how to make these awesome Jolly Rancher gummies from actual Jolly Ranchers that's right so I make these with canister up you can also do them with the can of sugar if you want to know how to make those I do have videos they're made from textures there is a specific one can of sugar and then the other one for the can of syrup is can of flour powdered sugar and syrup not well show you how to make the syrup if you'd like so from the actual gummy art from Jolly Ranchers I've made these gummies and I'm going to show you just how to do that so it's usually I'm going to jump right into those ingredients and what we need to put that together and get it all put together for you so you can make these awesome candies well one thing I did I want to tell you so in the recipe I used three and a half tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I would recommend using four tablespoons of unflavored gelatin to the same three quarter cups of liquid so I I will put the correction in the ingredients in the comments I do sorry I'm they turned it a little bit softer than probably what I like so I would go with four tablespoons of the unflavored gelatin all right so now we'll jump into those ingredients and get right to her alrighty so for our Jolly Rancher gummies what we're going to need is about twenty of your preferred flavour of Jolly Ranchers so I'm going to use the blue raspberry and peeled of course take off graphics you're going to need a quarter cup of can of syrup that we're going to mix with this then for our candy syrup we are going to need one cup of white sugar regular sugar and 1/4 cup of can of syrup and a quarter cup of regular light corn syrup 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid and a quarter cup of water for syrup then we're going to need three and sorry three and a half tablespoons to four so if you've got the packages of the gelatin you can just use the four packets they got a little bit off one you'll be good and 3/4 of a cup of water for your gelatin cold it needs to be very cold and then for our equipment we are going to need a candy thermometer a double boiler if you don't have a double boiler just use a pot where another heat safe Bowl will fit on top and that will suffice another pot for your candy syrup a couple of spatulas and then your bottles if you've got the bottles for dispensing your syrup if you don't have these guys these are great things if not you just use your eye droppers you've got those and of course your molds and that's everything we need to get started so let's jump right in and get it going alright so our very first step we want to do is bloom our gelatin so you are going to take your three and a half tablespoons and you're going to sprinkle it over your liquid you want to kind of get it all mixed around and then you're gonna get that you're gonna mix this in your gelatin into your liquid so you don't have any lumps and while you're mixing this this is a good yet to know whether your gelatin is a good strength or that it's not too old while you're mixing this it should already start to gel and while you're mixing it it should how to get turns to about the consistency of applesauce and that's how you know your gelatin is good and then we're going to just put that aside to bloom or total ready to loot till we need it now we are going to melt our our Jolly Ranchers and our corn syrup so we are going to melt our Jolly Ranchers and a quarter cup of our corn syrup all on our double boil just don't forget to put water in your bottom of your double boiler I've done it how come I plug it in hold on alright so we're gonna turn our heat on to medium medium or medium-high and we're gonna get our candy put your Jolly Ranchers into the pot mine got a little stuck in the bowl here got a lot of humidity too don't want to give it up gotcha and we're gonna put in our quarter cup of corn syrup our can of corn syrup and that eats up everything will begin to melt the Jolly Ranchers will start to melt you just want to try and get the candies covered and covered in the syrup just start getting things moving around but just going to continue to stir and this until the until your candies though the Jolly Ranchers are completely melted so it does take a while for the candies for the Jolly Ranchers to melt just be patient it does get kind of goofy and glumpy don't you can see that but just be patient it will all nose what I do is I let it sit for about a minute or so let it get heated up and then I stir it around breaking trying to break it up mush it down you just don't want to really overwork it does that just continue to do that your lumpy mess will turn into a nice syrup will see very shortly all right so now my candy start my Jolly Ranchers are all melted so you can see that a little better so we're just gonna set this off to the side for about five minutes to let that cool down before we add in our gelatin because if we add in our gelatin now it'll be too hot and it can break through gelatin that's a lot of problems that happens with with it so the next stage I'm just gonna let that cool down and we'll add in our gelatin and get that melted in and then we'll make that by the candy syrup and get it all put together so now that my syrup is cooled down it's time to add in the gelatin and I like to just do this and cut it up into smaller pieces and then we'll just plop we're all in and get that melting now you'll find if it's not melting you can turn your heat on to low put it back on the double boiler auctioneers probably enough heat from the water still from the double boiler to to melt the gelatin if it's not hot enough right still Cece was started melting because we have the cold temperature and the warm you can kind of have a separation here but once everything comes to the same temperatures and everything will mix together so you may find that your candy is kind of is starting to solidify getting a little clumpy well the gelatin is not really is not fully melting if that's the case then turn your heat on to low or just want to gently heat the reheat that up you just have to be patient with this because it is gonna take a few about five or five minutes or so for everything to come together properly you might think oh no it's not working but don't worry be patient so you're going to continue to gently stir this over the low heat until everything your Jolly Ranchers and your gelatin of all melts together in one even uniform syrup and there's nothing sticking to the bottom of the pot yeah once everything is melted together and everything's one uniform texture and color and there's nothing sticking to the bottom and now if you find here you may want to add a little bit of additional food coloring because the blue with the green it's gonna muddle that blue a little bit so if you do want that with more intense blue like your Jolly Rancher go ahead and add a little bit more blue food coloring it's just exactly what I'm gonna do here so you took the one out of much just one drop will make one to two drops at the mouth you can see the difference there with one drop me get that mixed in so that's a much nicer blue how well you can see that so I skip it too much then it's gonna I'm gonna spill it and not like we haven't seen me see me do that before so we want to see what the color is gonna look like you just drop it onto something white there and I'll just see what it looks like so I'm happy with that color goody-goody I'm just gonna set this off to the side and we'll get our candy syrup started alright so for our candy syrup part portion we're gonna pour in our 1 cup of sugar our quarter cup of cannister up our quarter cup of light corn syrup and our quarter cup of our sorry our half a teaspoon of citric acid and our quarter cup of water and we're gonna get stirred together so you just want to get it mixed together so the water and Evert the sugar in the syrups are all incorporated and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high forever this pillar so we're going to continue to stir this until until it begins to boil then if you have any duty sugar sugar sugar sugar crystals are so acceptance I just want to scrape that off or get a pastry brush and hot water and just wash down the stop then as soon as your syrup begins to boil you're going to stop stirring and we're going to watch your candy thermometer and we're going to cook the syrup to 260 degrees Fahrenheit and that's it just the letter go now periodically don't forget about your jelly the gelatin and your candy syrup you want to go around and stir that because it we can do start to solidify around the edges if it's like to pull off too much solid once once go around and just make sure that it's all still doing good but don't worry it'll get remelted once it gets out we added into the hot candy syrup whose life my candy almost up to temperature once you hit 260 you want to remove it from your meat immediately keep the candy thermometer attached because you want to wait until the syrup comes down to about 240 before we add in our other mixture the best is that you have a stone or marble surface to put it on is the best thing it draws the heat out quickly and and it doesn't get the surface doesn't get hot at all if not just put it off to the side burner and wait until your heat comes down to 240 all right so now my temperatures come down remove your candy thermometer grab your can you stir up your gelatin and your Jolly Rancher syrup and now we're going to gently pour it into our candy pot candy syrup here it'll probably bubble up a little bit and then you want to gently mix this and and continue stirring until it's all combined and you want to try to stir it gently to incorporate as little air MIDI as little air bubbles as you can but we need to make sure everything gets stirred there we go and once you're all good with air we're gonna get this poured into our bottles or you're just gonna use your dispensers your little eye droppers so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to pour it through a little strainer this isn't necessary if you've got one great if not don't worry about it so because it gets so hot these gelatin may break a little bit you get that little bit of whiteness I can't really turn the pot that way for you but if you do you can run it through a strainer just so that doesn't get in and if not no worries it'll all kind of go up to the top I'm just gonna pour this in I don't want any left in here now one thing you can do is you can fill up if you want to know if your gelatin it's gonna set correctly is you can just set up one or two cavities in your in your candy mold put it in the fridge and it should start to solidify very fairly quickly within about five minutes or so it should start to set so you'll know if it's still really gooey and tacky then you may have difficult study let it leave it for twenty if after twenty minutes it's still not setting then the gelatin has gotten too hot or it is not it's not some notch Ellington's are all the same strength so it may not be strong enough you can remelt you can add that back into the pot and add in about another half a tablespoon more of gelatin so this way it saves you a lot of time and this has got to cool down anyway because it the bottles are too hot to handle even if I use the oven mitt you don't want to do it when it's super hot because what will happen is it'll warp your bottle and it'll screw them up so one of those will end up leaking on you so you don't want to do that so while my bottles are all that while I'm waiting for my syrup to call I threw a couple into the fridge so I'm gonna see how they're gonna set up now I wasn't setting you may find your bottles because the bubbles will start to come to the top and instead if any gelatinous broke them out White's gonna come to the top as well so what you can just do is get a little spoon and just scrape that tops kind of skin right off of there oh yeah that way it's not gonna end up into your candy and make it muddled want to have a nice clearer looking syrup all right so I did check my candies they are starting to set up nicely because the syrup is hotter it's taking them longer and I don't want to leave this get too cold so yeah so the velocity is really you just distribute it into the molds if it's still a little hot for your hands full you can use paper towels on it which is exactly what I'm gonna do cuz that's too small just hold up some paper towel to put around it I thought I don't go with the oven mitts because I find that they're heavy and clunky and that's it just disperse it into your molds and put them in the fridge for about two hours for them to fully set and I'll come back we'll pop these out to see what these bad boys looked and chase like I tasted the syrup and oh my god it's so good it tastes just like a jolly rancher now if you find that your candies don't set you put them in the fridge for two hours they come out and they're still sticky you can't get them out of the mold don't panic put them into the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours let me get good and frozen and then pop them out so I don't you have to do one mold at a time take them out one at a time pop them into a double boiler remelt it add another half a tablespoon to a tablespoon will be good enough bloom gelatin and that will fix that problem and the same thing if you you've gone you've made them set them up and they're just way too jelly they're very very jelly to sick you can still you remem and add in a little bit about a quarter of a cup of liquid and that should take care of that all right so I will be back when these are set and we'll pop them out and see how pretty they look all right so welcome back here so my gummies I have them sitting in the fridge just over two hours and now we're gonna take them out so as you see first it looks like they're gonna be sticky but you just got to pull around the sides and we'll start to pull away as long as they're doing that and you can pull them out you're good you're gonna slay them on your parchment paper or stand them up if you can some of your candies molds are able to stand up others won't so I bought these guys on their sides and then also when it's warm especially it's warm I only take out one or two molds at a time to take them out and leave the rest of the fridge so that they don't warm up too much if I don't have a hard time getting them out of the molds and then I'm just gonna let these little guys dry for 24 to 48 hours and they'll be good to go yeah if there is still a little bit sticky once you've dried them you can toss them in a little bit of cornstarch so you don't want to do too much usually what I'll do just coat my hands in them and then run my coat my hands and cornstarch and then just run my hands through the candy and just kind of get a very light coating on them the other thing is you could do the same thing with oil so if you want to just take some cooking water olive oil coat your hands to them rub it in and then just gently go over your candies look at a little bit of an oil that will help them to stop from sticking as well and there you've got it Jolly Rancher canna gummies look at that baby and these guys taste so good oh I tried one earlier I don't know if I'm gonna get these to drying time get them fully dried they're so good but anyway guys that's it for that tutorial I'll be back to say goodbye and yeah that's about it oh one thing is gonna tell you so if you tried taking them out of the molds and they weren't coming out they're too sticky as I said don't panic put them in the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours pop them out put them into a double boiler let them melt down again and then bloom a quarter or sorry a half a tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of liquid blue matte add that in and that will take care of that problem recast them and you should be good that's awesome thing we working with gelatin and the either if there is a mistake you can usually fix it as long as you haven't burnt it oh and remember that this version of the recipe is just for playing gummies we are not going to sugar or citric acid these if you do they're going to melt I will do another version of the Jolly Ranchers of the sour version for you okay so don't add your sugar and citric acid to this they will melt so that is my tutorial on a can of Jolly Rancher gummies I hope you enjoyed that and if you have any questions as always please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and as I said in the beginning of the video in case you just skipped right over it use four tablespoons of gelatin versus three and a half it'll make that little bit of difference or a little bit softer than I probably would have liked but if you like a softer gummy go the screen 1/2 but if you want that more firm gummy go with the four and you'll be good to go check out that baby's its see-through ish it's got that clear candy looking it tastes just like a jolly rancher it's so good so please let me know if you give this a try I'd love to hear from you on which flavor you prefer and once again thanks so much for watching you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "GfnZE-9cGGc": "they throwing up to Lamartine you serve papaya she would know when I was just late morning black doctor lately wait Pete try crow there you go give us a little bit different don't be taken against some edibles so that further ado come to the close-up and Pete that [Music] all right Burke up just most bird emoji flat from the comment section as we take a look at today's edible today we're looking at these I guess the watermelon pieces and this is from the cannabis candy company oh this is actually gonna be my first package of anything from now says this 300 milligrams of THC this is a tea but ain't you know that that's my favorite out of sativa indica because it's the more creative kind of uh hi um however when you take edibles it's a different experience than smoking we wanna do is you wanna get could eat out the pack see what these two mile I see if they smell like candy if they smell heavily we then will taste you wanna see oh if it tasted the same let's get these things out the pack I see they look like all right bear cub that was not the easiest package to open well we did get it open finally on these gummies have a nice sugary coating they don't really smell too much of a cannabis they kind of just smelled like Borden on candy I'm going to you gonna go ahead and see what they taste like huh man see you see if they got like the more cannabis or more of a candy flavor 300 milligrams I guess for this whole packet I don't know how strong it cannabis taste will be but let's find out all right Burke up about to uh try these edibles and see um how much of a cannabis tasted you know it doesn't smell like like smells like candy but not but there's a back layer smell on it makes them not like smell the most appetizing but my steak room temperature it's a nice texture I'm not really din I'm a deep Canada's taste I'm getting more like a bunch ill or a fish you watermelon flavor plus our to toss harbor and not really like I'm not tasting today like stepmama TV this is Joey do you in the Mitzvah the aftertaste ain't even a relief it would like like a lot of cannabis flavor they'll do intoxicating the fact that this product may be delayed by up to two hours oh so we have to taking these you might have to wait two hours maybe I I'm already hot because I've been smoking all day um I guess I guess we'll see if these in our pride take about two more that's like three pieces should give you know I mean a decent filling mum again not not strong cannabis taste our hair other edibles where you taste it read write and told me you just taste cannabis cannabis cannabis this is a tart watermelon this is kind of like the best way I can describe it but we'll see how they develop I'm with them to a more I'm out birkut flat flat [Music] [Music]", "sTfaooUIaXg": "hey everyone it's been a while hasn't it hope everybody staying safe and I apologize for not doing any recent videos a little bit preoccupied with Kovac stuff and you know everything going on around here and Minnesota with the the protesting and and all that stuff but just kind of been an emotional drain so I've been taking time out to deal with that and just really focus on keeping myself and my family in good spirits and yeah good spirits and just taking care of each other which hope everybody out there is doing as well but with that in mind the show must go on so I got a cool little thing here I'm going to try out today I'll tell you a little bit more about it here just a moment [Music] hello everybody Sam the foodie from Minnesota back finally with another taste testing video I hope everybody's doing okay yeah let's get right into it so today we have an item that I purchased a while ago so hopefully it won't affect the taste but I don't think it would so we have some more candies of course because I've got my sweet tooth so this is from a company called lofty pursuits these are they're called madness and it looks like what they are is just flavored candies these were recommended to me so yeah I decided to purchase them and want to kind of see what they're about I do not have any clue what they're gonna taste like or what the texture or anything is gonna be so I'm gonna open these up let's take a look nice little mylar bag here packaging is great so alright take a smell they've got oak the smell is kind of different I kind of smell like a hint of strawberry in it okay so let's take a look at it so I'm gonna give you guys a little close-up here it just looks like a yeah it's kind of weird yeah I mean a little strawberry but I don't see really yeah well let's give it a try whoa dem are crunchy okay this is still in my mouth a little bit but I'm just gonna kind of leave it there because it's gonna take me a while for it take it a while to this all and stuff so so yeah this is very crunchy definitely not something you chew it to the flavor kind of a strawberry flavor kind of lick it it's not too bad yeah very crunchy so they act remind me of the Hickory Farms strawberry bon bons that you like the meat packs very tasty the flavors great and yeah yeah okay so looking at it looks like serving sizes four pieces certains per container about five so you're looking at about 20 pieces in the mylar bag yeah um total carbs 5.9 grams for every four pieces so definitely carb friendly as

making candy sweet awesome simple easy candy so let's get to it that's right we are making candy some friends of mine at church said they really liked watching these silly videos we make up and and all the different desserts and and sweet things but they said also that they like watching Animalia videos too so I started thinking to myself how could we do this I came up with the perfect solution cooking with animals how about that we're going to cook up some candy with animals how crazy and fun is that going to be if you're wondering has he lost his marbles the answer is probably yes but we're going to still cook some candy ax it's awesome it's easy basically going to show you the ingredients we're going to do it fun easy cheap cheap cheap and you should be able to make it and you know it only takes like 10 minutes so this is awesome stuff okay so four ingredients as always or generally speaking I should say if it's a complicated recipe I generally don't make it and this one is very very basic you really only have four things that are going to make this candy up you've got two cups of granulated sugar 2/3 cup of light corn syrup 3/4 cup of water and then some kind of a flavoring I'm going to show you up close what I got here this is a raspberry flavoring but it's from my believe Lord and Lord and oils raspberry flavor and you can use whatever you want I've even seen people using essential oils and all kinds of other things but we use those because it's pre-made pre-measured out easy to do I think it costs like 50 cents or something really really small so there you go ok for tools its basic stuff you're basically going to need a saucepan a spatula and you're going to need a cookie sheet or whatever kind of form you want to pour it into if you're going to make lollipops you could get little forms for them or dinosaurs or even ape-like looking things that would be crazy candy candy apes but yeah anything whatever floats your boat you will also need a thermometer to monitor the temperature of your soon to be deliciousness in candy yay okay now that we've got our ingredients sorted we're going to heat up our saucepan and I'm going to need help from my lovely assistant David because it would be truly a silly thing for me to be cooking with a rabbit in my hand so here is my lovely assistant David ha the hammer the cannon DJ magic snappy pants whatever you want to call up so he's getting the saucepan ready and we've got our thermometer because basically all you're going to do is you're going to heat these ingredients up to 300 degrees they're going to boil then as it's cooling down you're going to stir in your lovely raspberry Ness for us it's raspberry nice it's whatever flavoring you want and that's it then you put it on your tray it'll spread itself out and as it cools down you cut it so here we go let's get it going over a medium-high heat so now as David's putting ingredients in I want to make a note there if you see that thermometers stick the sticky thermometer you basically don't want it touching the bottom or also will give you a false reading but you do want to make sure that's fully into your mixture here and in goes the water and now it's simply a waiting game as the temperatures coming up to 300 degrees you do want to make sure that you're stirring it regularly you're looking for a boil make sure that you're checking that temperature you don't want to get it too hot or you will burn it now you do want to keep stirring but when when you reach 260 degrees then you're going to stop stirring because it's going to continue to elevate in temperature that's already at a mass a critical mass critical critical mass and it's going to keep getting hotter so basically at 260 you stop and then it should start to clear up okay so we have just now crested the 260 degree mark so we will no longer be stirring we will still be waiting oh yes we will be waiting alright so now we're keeping an eye on the temperature like good little Scouts that we are but keep in mind that the last few degrees the last 10 15 degrees jumped quickly so you got to be ready to get this off the heat then you're going to stir it up again as you add your flavoring and then on to your form we just crested 300 degrees we've taken our goo off the heat we're adding our flavouring we're going to stir it up and pour it into what we're using for form is just our cookie sheet so we're going to take that thermometer off there be careful keep in mind this is 300 degrees stuff and if it sticks to you it will stick for a while it will burn the stew out of you be very careful so here we go now we're like I said we're just using a cookie sheet for our form because we're going to cut it into squares you just pour it on and it will spread out just like that now some of you might be saying yourself right now hey inner chubby guy why don't you lick the spoon that would be a terrible idea it might tear off your tongue it's very hot don't do it resist the urge all right let's see if this thing is cooled down it's been about 15 minutes what you do is you just take a regular little pizza cutter you're going to score this yeah like that into whatever size of shapes pieces you want now if it's not see that if it's not ready it'll just kind of blob back over itself and the idea is not you're not cutting it we're just trying to get it to a score so that when it actually does get completely hard then it will break apart very easily now if you let this go too long it will start to break right away so there's a sweet spot it's usually about 10 or 15 minutes oh so you look started to blob back together the edges are fine I got to wait so we'll wait another five now at this point it's all gridded up and it's not going to blob together anymore and if you were a normal person you would just let that sit there for a good 40 minutes or whatever but well let's just say I'm abnormal and I'm also not very patient so into the freezer you go baby all right so we very impatiently waited and reluctantly waited and waited and now it's done it's ready so basically you can just take and crack it bust it out of here however you need to do it I can sometimes get under here with a knife which was exactly one we'll do right now so now you have made candy delicious delicious candy one more step that we do is well actually take some powdered sugar and dust this stuff with it shake it around I mean this this little container is not big enough we'll do it in a bigger container but the reason for that is it helps it not stick together which is really nice so there you have it folks cheap easy delicious homemade candy it literally cost us maybe 50 cents for everything and in the great part is you know what you're getting you know there's no nasty weirdo chemicals no asbestos or fungal material well anyway I hope you liked the video and the animals so there you have it I'm Brad with big family homestead please pass the video around yes we're silly it's just silly here anyway have an amazing day that is one lazy dog one lazy dog indeed", "_KOeNa0kFLA": "hey guys i am making a challenge what spin the moon fire Jolly Ranchers I have long been on right now so yeah hey yeah chief eat my gosh go ahead full and I'm just trying to that's nice really hot go spit out but", "6FQlIslZYAM": "you're going to be surprised at just how simple it is to make your own rock candy today welcome to Todd's kitchen who doesn't love rock candy it's so simple yet delicious but let's put a little Christmas Ben on it so join me today as make my version of rock candy and also don't forget to check out Todd's kitchen com for my merchandise store now to start off with I have a pot on the stove on a high heat so today I'm going to add 3 and 3/4 cups of sugar then to that I'm going to add 1 cup of corn syrup or glucose syrup then 1 cup of water and finally a few drops or dissin out of red food coloring being a Christmas theme so it just can't - keep on stirring this over high heat until the sugar is dissolved and it comes up to a boil okay so once it's come up to a boil I'm going to turn it down to a medium heat now and just keep on stirring it just another minute or two just so it doesn't burn the bottom of the pot so basically at a medium temperature this is going to a simmer away for about 40 to 45 minutes you want a nice and slow you don't do it too fast and what I highly recommend is to use a candy thermometer now these are very cheap they're probably about 15 dollars and we want to go for the hard crack stage which is 300 degrees Fahrenheit or about 150 degrees Celsius so basically what it does it just sits on the side of the pot like so with a thermometer just inside and that will tell you the temperature that's that your sugar is currently acts so remember the low and slow is best because you want to make sure that all that water is evaporated and but give it a chance for that sugar to warm up nicely till we get to the hard crack stage so you want to add some peppermints for their Christmasy taste or we can add strawberry it's really up to you you can use any flavor that you'd like for this candy but being a Christmas version you want to try and keep it more Christmasy so I'm going to add some peppermint extracts and keep it as a red color so remember low-and-slow gonna should take about 40 to 45 minutes give or take okay so just got to the hard crack stage so I'll turn the heat off and I've also taken it straight off the heat you don't want to overdo it otherwise you can burn the mixture so what I have here is just a shallow baking dish and I'll just line with some baking paper so basically all we have to do now is just pour on our candy mixture on to our shallow dish now try and get as wide as you possibly can or as big as you possibly can possibly can so it's not overly thick and once there that's all you do it so it's simple as that just let that rest and sit there and cool down for a good two three hours and then it's ready you don't have to put it in the fridge or anything it is really that simple now as a tip with the pot just simply fill it with water and over the course of a few hours the water will simply dissolve all that leftover sugar and candy and you will be left with a perfectly clean pot so you won't have to worry about trying to scrape or break off any candy that's hardened on the pot okay so as you can see it is now completely set so you should another piece of baking paper here and I'm just going to place that just on top and just on the rolling pin basically just going to shut it see also start to break up like glass [Music] okay so I'm just got a bowl now I'm just going to put some powdered sugar icing sugar just going to place that into the base now because this is going to be very sticky so I got to coat it in the icing sugar so you see it just comes off the pot comes apart just like so and we just break it up and cover it in the icing sugar there's any really sharp pieces if you have kids around just make sure you just try and break those little bits off you can even eat the little bits if you like so this way I'll just prevent it from being all sticky so we have our candy and there we have our special Christmas edition rock candy no of course you can make this at any time of the year you can use any color that you like any flavor that you like for any season whatsoever because rock candy is so simple to make but it's also versatile so just by adding superb Mint and making a red for Christmas I've made it into a Christmas edition but the sky's the limit and rock candy is pure sugar so you do want to have it in moderation but honestly no matter what flavor that's use what color that you use rock candy always tastes simply delicious", "LKXcqp7bHWI": "99% of the gummy bear recipes the DIY how to out there that you will find videos or in text are gonna tell you basically to make jello jigglers it's not the same thing as gummy bears but I'm gonna give you some tips and tricks on how to make real gummy bears not just jello so stay tuned and now but I'm the one that has the culinary arts degree and does most of the baking and cooking in the kitchen anyway this is going to be a bit of a review and how-to video all in one I was given a free sample of this here bear mould and it is silicone it's machine washable and it makes 50 little gummy bears now it really only contains like for retail spoons with of liquid when I measured it out that's if you're just pouring water in there but we all realize you'll definitely need a recipe that has more than three tablespoons cuz trust me I tried to do like a micro recipe and it didn't get me very far but so far I really do love this mold I haven't had a spray it I haven't had any problems they just come right out so there's two main camps of homemade gummy bears there are people that are just making their own for the fun of it and they're gonna be using jell-o unflavored gelatin water then there's a camp that is usually doing it for the health benefit so they might have some kind of eye they will probably have juice and honey and unflavored gelatin most likely beef gelatin which is higher quality more health things to it so I that's what I'm trying for I don't have a special gelatin but I did try to do this with juice and honey and a couple of failed batches with double die vitamins but we'll get into that so this mold actually came with a pdf recipe book I really didn't find it very helpful but you can look around and find different recipes kind of experiment with what you like especially if you're doing a juice phase to go me what kind of juices do you like they do say to frown away from pineapple because the enzymes in it do not work well with gelatin just a heads up let me show you how I went about making some gummy bears myself so this is the ingredient list off of your store-bought gummy bears and you'll see here you know there's sugars there's gelatin but there are some extra waxes and that I just don't have in my kitchen I don't know about you but I'm going to give you two big tips on how to make this as close to legit gummy bears as possible less like just jigglers the recipe I have makes about 80 to 90 gummy bears and it calls for 1/3 cup of juice so I used some orange juice and lemon juice to top up that last little bit but it's primarily orange cuz that's my favorite and then it calls for two tablespoons of honey and 2 tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I did try grinding up some multivitamins it was foul and profusely disgusting so I haven't mastered that yet I'm going to show you how to do it without the vitamins take your juices and honey mix them together and then gently sprinkle your gelatin the unflavored gelatin on top and wait several minutes it'll kind of soak up like you see here and that's called blooming you don't want to add it directly into hot liquid or you'll have problems then I just slowly warm it up in a pan I'm warming up a larger pan to the side and then tip number one is boiling you are making a candy so with taffy with that sort of thing you have to boil the sugar and water to get basically a soft ball to get to the right consistency there at texture so since this is a really small batch I only did it for a couple minutes I was afraid of burning I think the consistency could have been nicer if I had done it longer but I was great so you can kind of experiment with how long you let it boil next I keep my smaller pot in side of that larger pot and just let them sit there with the spoon and dropper that they give you just so that they stay warm so they don't start setting that because then it becomes a real mess this little dropper that they give you with this set is awesome and yeah just fill them up one by one no big secret there try to fill them up as big as possible because they do shrink a little bit as you'll notice there are some bubbles you can try to skim off that before you put them in but I like them and then I put them in the fridge for just a few minutes or even the freezer and they pop right out didn't need to coat that with any oil or anything so here's the mold and I will say tip number one is to make sure and boil your sugar tip number two is to let your gummy bears sit let them dehydrate a little because in the factories where they make them they actually do put them in a drying room for a couple of days and so letting out a little bit more of that moisture should help them have a little bit more of a chewy consistency than just thick jello and here's the final product next to a Haribo Haribo gummy bear so it's a little smaller slightly different design but I like it I think it's adorable and I think it's tasty I hope that the video was helpful for you here are some of my orange lemon honey gummy bears you know they're not 100% like this stuff at the store I know they're gonna be healthier and they're cute and I still taste good so I'm gonna enjoy these snacks and if you don't want to take the time and effort for gummies even though these are awesome that you can make your own healthy version or custom flavors and colors if you don't want to do that you can also use this mold for chocolate bears make a little bag for your sweetheart for your kids throw it in their lunch a little bag of gummy or chocolate bears that says I love you very much I'm cheesy like that I would totally do that so all in all I definitely give this mold a 5 out of 5 recommendation I don't have any problems with it I really like it I love that it came with the dropper to help fill it up and if you follow my tips I think things should go smoothly let me know down

going to be making cinnamon rock candy it's actually a pretty easy thing to do except it takes a long time to do it about an hour but it doesn't have very many ingredients as long as you can babysit it for a while you're good to go it's actually a pretty easy thing to do so I have 3 and 3/4 cup sugar 1 more 1 and 1/4 cup of corn syrup 1 cup of water and you'll need a teaspoon of red food coloring and a teaspoon of cinnamon oil and you can get the cinnamon oil at a cake food store they don't normally sell it or you can buy it online now you're gonna dump your sugar in the corn syrup the water you'll do a teaspoon the red food coloring turn it on to medium-high heat and what you're going to do stir it in all together will start to melt together here but this will become very syrupy you're going to let this boil on medium high heat stirring occasionally and this process takes about 15 minutes to do to get it to boil ok so when it comes to a boil then I have to take a lid and stick that on there for three minutes okay so now my sugar crystals are all dissolved so I'm going to take the lid off and mature my fan on now and it's going to be nice so then I'm going to take now I'm going to take my candy thermometer stick it right on the edge just like that I'm gonna go up I need it to get to 300 degrees before I can call it good here so it'll just go up a little bit and this will process will probably take about 20 to 25 minutes depending on how high your so yours going to leave it you don't stir it you just let it go and you'll let it boil and come check it often okay so well that's just cooking we're going to prepare for our next part of this and you want to get like an ax I think this is 11 by 16 just a piece of tinfoil so it's got a wall on each side because you don't want your candy sticking to the pan at all for touching the pan so once you get that done you're gonna take either butter or margarine something doesn't matter and what I do I stick it on a napkin I know this is weird but I'm give it a good heavy coat because it is hard to get the candy off of this if it is not buttered it's just about done I'm going to dump a teaspoon of cinnamon oil in that and then I'm going to take it over here and I know this is a crazy setup but it really does work I've set a fan I'm going to open my window and all the steam from the sin roll because it's very potent is going to go out the window and not in my house and I'm going to dump it on my tray here that we've got buttered okay this is ready to go so I'm going to take this down I'm going to be very careful and you should too nuts you don't want to burn the inside of your nose and so I'm going to shut my heat off dump that in I'm going to turn my fountain it's not going to do anything until I stir it and then it's going to go crazy let me get out of the way make sure it's good and stir it in they're going down here is not open here we go now we're going to do this select your cow don't try to scoop it out or just whatever's in there they kind of rock it back a core just to make sure it's to the corners and there's your tray of silicon okay so once it's hardened for about 45 minutes I will go ahead and put a piece of wax paper over the top of it to keep it from getting stuff on it and so it's nice for you and you can keep it like this for overnight if you need to so next thing I'm going to do I'm going to leave this on here while I crack it so I've washed at the end of a hammer and I'm just going to take it and that's it so I got to do okay so the next part after you have hammered it you're going to flip it over and so the wax paper is now on the bottom and I've already peeled off all of the tinfoil so you just peel it off and put that aside so this is kind of what it looks like any next you're going to take some powdered sugar and I have a sifter and you can sprinkle it on but I feel like this does a pretty good job and what I do is just sift it over the candy and then once you're done you call it good then what you do you can get little gift bags like this I like to get them after Christmas every year because then they're super cheap not that they're already cheap but they're now they're super cheap and then you just take your little scooper here up with the bait down so you can see and I'm guessing I can do about ten ten bags worth per batch that I do but I don't seal them up until I know for sure that I have enough in each bag so that's it and what I'll do is just take a little tie tie it around and sometimes I'll even so there's your little cute bag of candy it's really fun sometimes they'll take ribbon and put it around - and tied someone's name on it but that's how you make cinnamon candy from start to finish um thanks for listening", "lMwucnCpb9E": "this is not good what are you doing Phil what kind of feel like throwing up okay so you bought some strong snus yes last time we did a video about a snooze cold bolt yeah and we got a lot of requests our followers who wanted us to test something stronger people wrote Siberia off-road thunder so they just you know yeah let's shoot that out yeah rap tried it here it goes I don't know if these news are available in your country if it is good for you it's not well for reference scale wise on how strong these are yeah Swedish match general has dinner voice yeah regular snows has 0.8 yeah and if it's an extra strong for example this one it's 1.8 okay and then there's the super strong which we tested the vault vault which is 2.6 yeah and that was thrown and then we have these extreme yeah they are in a different category so these are up to 4.5 my almost 5 times stronger than the regular snare yet and I'm already getting sweaty yeah so which one do we try it first I thought we should test the least strongest one yeah so there's a scale so yeah that's this is diggity now I bought I bought a lot of it so I guess I have to snooze this now so this is gonna be my regular snooze for what I don't know months ahead you know like a week a week ahead this is not good no ok so this is the least strong yes so this is called glove explosion white yep it's like a bomb explosion explosion explosion explosion explosion now I said it four times it was like a bone exploding it's a bomb exploding on the on the cover yeah it's almost it smells like whoa gingerbread oh yeah that's not good smell I got this okay so first one yeah 3.5 3.5 okay I'm starting to feel the burn it is strong yeah it is strong yeah it's definitely yeah it's you know my head is gonna warm I think it's pretty good yeah it's not bad snow definitely not about this and this smell I'm China starting to like it what is that yeah I would say it smells like torque and I think it smells like Christmas I guess we have different prisons as you and me tartar bread with our hand okay yeah it's a strong snus kind of kind of good oh it's okay okay next one is actually Siberia the strongest one is four point five and this is four point three is very little difference no that was three point five this is four point three yep it's a bit minty actually yeah yeah I can hear big old strong snooze here we go - eighty degrees Celsius on this one I don't know what that means but yeah I do know Oh because of the minty yep it feels like my upper lip is very cold right now yes the whole body is inside but my upper lip just went to you like Siberia yeah exactly and had a snooze really strong one and then came back in like holy freaking yes this is strong yeah and I got this much of this set up and I at home reference whoo I'm getting I guess this is weird feeling my body's like burning up but this limb smell is in Siberia I'm getting a bit of a hi-yah as focus wise you know it's like I got a think you know okay so now I'm looking there no no I'm looking over there and like aware of it you know I'm only I'm aware of this I'm just real hot cop contingent feeling on my on my upper lip and to refocus they're like dude you're not in focus the hell my eyes know it is wrong do again but I do not like the toothpaste II taste okay my safety because of the solution yeah you look shaky holy [ __ ] you're shaking how much can't even see I can't even look at my own hand yeah yeah strong so okay let's move on all these three are the same strength yep 4.5 watch right portion Thunder eggs it smells like a zoo [Laughter] whoa like a farm animal combined with mint yeah this one burns it's only Birds nothing else nothing else taste no smell get burned holy crap story I stopped thinking I was like reading and then not reading and then I was like think reading it backwards I was turning it this way I actually feel a bit lightheaded yeah I'm stupid like no I'll do it the other way around I don't really like this one no it's too strong too strong and and I think the pouch is too too flat but if you like strong snus it's it's good sness switch it okay so this is called arctic explorer or Froude X also 4.5 mm it's almost empty yeah this is mint not as much as the Siberia the instant burn this is wrong yes very strong now I understand what you mean that we have to focus some things yeah right no no cause I made this oh I'm holding it now we have to turn it ya have to think what I'm doing yeah exactly you gotta be very experienced to do this apparently we aren't nope but I guess it's good if you don't want to do like herring herring or crow yeah go over this and said it's cheaper and legal yep I'm like dozed off yeah me too I'm feeling hi yeah like after after smoking a blunt yeah I've never done it no of course we haven't but if you man oh yeah seeing people smoking and then be like I don't I don't like this one because of the pouches my thing is to to thing you like to feel that you

what should I do with all this these ones I will never use them [Music] this is not good what are you doing Phillip what kind of feel like throwing out", "dNfrNTZ5Sz8": "[Music] okay today we're here to review these uh three um they're kind of unusual jelly beans they're flavored like uh normal candies so this is jolly rancher uh jelly beans this one's sour patch kids jelly beans this one is nerds jelly beans let's try this one first this is jolly ranchers i'm not sure if they're the different foods will taste differently really for original flavors this is a purple one red pink orange green purple light blue i think nope i think they do taste all the flavors taste different i mean the colors taste like the flavors and they're all colored like the outsiders colors like the inside not quite as um um the flavors are not quite as prominent as like the jolly rancher flavors but they're pretty close [Applause] actually as you chewing more the flavor comes out more this one's supposed to have five flavors let's see one two three four five so there's red yellow orange green and blue blue raspberry you gotta get past the sugar first and then the sour comes in that one was a lime one that one wasn't as bad as the blue one was red one's pretty sour too that was red berry orange is not as bad [Applause] nothing's not as bad either no they're stuck twicky [Applause] okay these are nerds big chewy nerds let's see only three colors nope that's the same thing i think there's only three colors all right orange four cups these are crunchier on the outside i'm trying to remember what things did i used to eat them all the time what was that one the red one was a little sour yellow's a little sour too nerds are a little sour so yeah these are a little sour these are more sour because they are sour patch kids and then these are just kind of a normal rancher type flavors [Applause] and each of the colors are different flavors so it's not like i don't know you probably could just grab a handful and stick it in your mouth they're they're not that weird flavor is not like uh jelly bellies or sometimes you can get some weird flavors in there but yeah these are all good if you're kind of tired of all the the normal jelly beans where they all taste the same every color tastes the same try getting these instead because they're different and i bought these probably actually i think two of them i bought at uh five below i don't remember which two and then the other one i bought at i think target or something so if you find them they're probably only here for easter so get them all you can or wait till after easter and get them for 75 off so anyways let me take another break with this one i like the sour ones and i'll see you in the next one", "059ZsVUl-3A": "hi and welcome to kena basics today we learn how to make rosin lozenges rosin lozenges are cannabis infused honey lemon ginger hard candies or cough drops that can be used for a medicinal or recreational cannabis use they use rose and pressed wax Akif to infuse the cannabis it has only four ingredients it's all natural and healthy so let's get started here's what you need to make rosin lozenges first you need 1/2 a cup of honey you can use raw honey or regular store-bought honey you need 2 tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 teaspoon of freshly grated ginger root and 1 gram of cannabis rosin pressed wax or one to two grams of Keef I do not recommend using eh-oh or butane extracted hash oils for this or any other recipe because making hard candy can be a very time-sensitive endeavor you do need to make sure that you have all your ingredients ready to go so the first thing that we're going to do is go ahead and squeeze out our two tablespoons of fresh lemon juice make sure you strain out all the seeds and pulp and have that ready to go and also you want to go ahead and prepare your ginger again we're using fresh ginger and if you get organic that's even better but you want to go ahead and make sure that you peel off the skin and then use a grater and we're gonna grate finely grate about a teaspoon of the fresh ginger root and then it'll also be very helpful if you go ahead and pre measure out your half a cup of honey again I said you could use raw honey here or you can use just regular store-bought honey such as we're using here but you need a half a cup of honey and you have all your ingredients ready to go before we move on to the next step which is to put a small saucepan over medium-high heat and then we're going to combine in all of the honey as well as the lemon juice and the ginger and we're gonna bring that up over medium to medium-high heat and the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to sort of boil out the water and some of the other impurities and cook down the ginger so after we've combined all of our ingredients in our pan you want to go ahead and give that a little bit of a mix and let them combine together and then as the heat comes up we're also going to make sure that we have our candy thermometer available okay as the heat brings up a little bit you'll the honey will melt and you'll be able to come coorporate those ingredients together make sure that you have your candy thermometer ready and a candy thermometer you need to make sure that it's the kind of thermometer that goes up well over 300 degrees but you're going to want to make sure that you carefully monitor because what's gonna happen is and once you get up to about 212 degrees or boiling for water we're gonna start boiling out the water from the honey and there's also a water and the lemon juice that's going to boil it out and condense down the honey then honey and the lemon flavors both but what's what happens is a lot of foam occurs when this happens you need to be right beside it and make sure that you have a pan that has tall enough sides to accommodate at least triple um the depth and foam and then as the foam gets to the top of your pan you need to pull it off the heat and let the foam subside it just takes a few seconds for the phone to subside and then you can put it back on the heat but like I said just be there with it because this is going to occur several times but over time as the water boils out it's going to foam less and less and then you can bring your heat up to high and go to 295 degrees Fahrenheit and you would be very precise about that temperature leaving a little bit room there if it gets up to 300 degrees you're fine don't go over 300 degrees but 2 and 95 or 300 degrees Fahrenheit should be perfect if you don't have a candy thermometer you can also do this by having a cup of ice water available and take some of the candy when you think it's getting close and drop it in and let it harden and the high water if it hardens into a brittle hard candy then you've reached the right temperature and we're getting real close you can see it's really darkening till you don't want to go so far also that you earn and get a really better flavor so you want to be really careful you monitor your temperature and when it gets to 300 degrees or 295 degrees Fahrenheit pull it off the heat and immediately it's gonna start to cool once it's pulled off the heat so we're going to act fast make sure you still monitor the temperature when it gets to 250 degrees Fahrenheit we're gonna add in our rosin or our Keef what we're doing here is we're we're using that temperature so the one it'll melt into there and be easy to mix but also because we're decarboxylated are still activating the cannabis rosin pressed does use heat and pressure so it may possibly be decarboxylated but what we're using this heat just to make sure that we've activated our cannabis and if you're using Keef then that's gonna be necessary also to activate the cannabis so starting at 250 degrees and then as it cools over the next couple of hours we'll be decarboxylated them remaining cannabis well once you've added in and mixed in your cannabis you're going to now pour your candy into the candy molds the video always slows us down a little bit and so the candy is a little thicker than I would like for it to Bend when it poured in the molds here it would have poured a little more evenly if I had used it a little bit hotter but when I pour it into the molds but that's okay and those little drops that I put on parchment paper would also have kind of out a little bit more circular and nice so just make sure that you move fast enough when you're doing your candies but after about two hours and you don't need to put this in the fridge or anything just let this cool on the counter after about two hours your candy will harden into a hard rigid candy you'll be able to pop those out of the molds with no problem and this candy can be really sticky so you might want to coat it in powdered sugar which will help prevent them from sticking together and whatever storage container you put them in and if you don't have powdered sugar you can also use crystal sugar or you may want to anyway because it gives it a nice kind of a cool looking coating there and also adds some sweetness to the candy which can be a little bit better because of the lemon and the ginger but these are really good and they're the flavor of these is not so much like a sweet candy so much as more as like a lozenge and you get the the lingering numbness from the gingers are really good this episode is brought to you by the Rafah studio smoke shop selling raw rolling papers accessories much more

I'm Margie for Marjorie's candies and welcome to my kitchen today we're going to make old-fashioned butterscotch hard candy and what you'll need to get started is two cups of sugar a quarter of a cup of corn syrup 1/2 a cup of butter and I melt that before I get started 2 tablespoons of water and 2 tablespoons of vinegar and I have a little mold and I can pour some to make some little squares of butterscotch candies and then I have some sticks so I'm going to use for lollipops and you're going to want to put a little butter on that matter of fact I'll do that right now with my little knife what I have here is how can we help you in the end it is lollipops also take a little bit ok so I'm going to add this to my pot first of all that's the bottom of course I think it will just TSP and I took out and then I'm going to in here is two tablespoons of the water and two tablespoons of the vinegar then it's a quarter of a cup of corn syrup Eddie and the sugar that's two cups of sugar one of the little corn syrup that was stuck there okay with a spoon I'm just going to gently when I make candy I think I've mentioned this before I always stir from the outside and to keep the to keep the crystals of sugar from sticking to the side of the pot you really want this to come to a boil before and I'm sorry you want the sugar to melt before it comes to a boil whenever you're making candy sometimes when you have butter it's a little hard to tell but it could pick up your spoon you can usually see this see if there's a the butter color okay you have close and you see if you pick that up and look you don't really see any crystals in there and I don't suggest that you run your fingers through it and try to tell if you could feel them because this is pretty hot so now it's going to come to a boil we'll let it come to a boil and you're going to this this one's going to go up to 300 degrees so you want to get a candy thermometer so you know after that means that before it burns actually you'll be able to tell that made about 300 we don't get it off the stove it will burn so that as hot as your kid is ever going to get a lollipop okay now you want that little bulb that little red bulb will be under the water under this solution and if you don't think that it is that it pretty much is I'm just going to boil up a little bit still you can layer thermometer flat the other direction like this and just watch it every so often just pick it up this is reached 300 okay all right so we'll take this off I'm actually going to let it just rest for a few moments rather than pouring the opposite and when you pour it on it's a little bit thick if you don't wait if you wait a little while to get it looking a bit darker and it will pour better so I'll just let it cool okay so now we've waited a little while you see how it looks a little darker and it's nice and some looks nice and smooth so I'm going to pour this into the Train I really went over this the butter because it is very very very important that you butter it because it will if you have it if you have a straight I mean an offset spatula it works fantastic on these models okay you just want to make sure they're all filled up okay okay so that's very good so we can set that aside just to get cool it takes almost a half an hour really the coolant possibly and then I'm going to take lollipop spoons and we're just going to make actually I'm going to make a little if you hold it really still it'll just make a circle and you don't need it to be tremendous okay and you put your Spears stick and just give it a little a little twist there we go okay and you just keep doing that hold it real still and they will get see when you wait a little while for you can give it a little roll you wait a little while gets a little bit thicker so it just holds up a little better rather than spreading way out wait even longer just it gets even it gets even thicker I'll wait a moment for this and I'll show you some that it even thicker a little sick or even probably could spoon it out that might be a little bit better maybe not that will spread out some you know it looks pretty bad okay just take your two things in okay so thank you very much for watching me do this and you're pretty good let me know what you think about them", "FIvxTPO_x3A": "hi folks its flower child 1970 and as promised I am going to show you how to make homemade gummy bears the easy way this is the easy way there's so many ways on the internet I just this is what three ingredients four ingredients actually if you include the water okay so you are going to need Knox gelatin I'm gonna bring you up just so it's not crooked you will need Knox gelatin okay or brand name gelatin don't go I've tried to go the cheap route and just by no-name gelatin I'm telling you folks I don't know what these name brands stop having them but there is an extra ingredient or something that allows this to work so you will need Knox gelatin only two packets okay so I have my two packets of Knox gelatin you will also need half a cup of kind of oil which is kind of this oil or coconut oil infused with cannabis so this is kind of coconut oil a measuring cup because you need half a cup of hot water and whatever brand of jello you want to use today I am using grape okay so it's gonna get a little shaky I'm sorry so do not turn on your stove yet what you do first is put your dry ingredients in first so you're gonna add your jello I'm opening it up oh god I broke a nail okay so just put your jello in whatever flavor and use name-brand jell-o do not use no-name jello its I'm not sponsored by them or anything but it does make a difference folks okay you can try it doing in a cheaper way but I'm telling you it's not gonna work they won't set right though they'll separate that Kenoi 'el will separate from the jello and you'll get a two-tone candy gummy bear and it looks terrible and it tastes terrible so we put our gelatin in again you're doing the dry ingredients first grape jelly smells good my garbage aside and then you're gonna want to mix this really well so that you don't see the white crystals anywhere on top you can even do it this way just shake it about it works it either way of stirring it or just shifting it in the pot pan and I'm using a nonstick pot it's very important that you use a nonstick pot as well so I am going to add my half of cup of hot water I did boil it already and now it's okay to turn on the stove because you're putting in your water I have mine at medium art whoops terribly sorry about that just mix it around you're gonna want to make sure that the there's no clumps in here and all the grit is gone you don't want to feel great at the bottom of the pan you want to make sure it's smooth much like how you would make it when you make you jello so we're just going to stir this around for a little bit for a few minutes just to make sure everything's separated and something fell on my burner sorry so what you also need while that is it'll boil a little bit it's just on four but what you also need are molds okay and what I have here and you'll see it over on the other side once this mixture is ready and you will need one of these little plunger things but if you where did I buy these I think I bought these at bulk barn I think I bought them at bulk barn and when you buy them you get three of these trays which have 50 divots each they're little gummy bears 50 divots each so you get 150 total in three trays and you get two or three of these little plungers to suck up the stuff and the mixture and put it in here so you're not burning yourself or using a spoon or anything like that okay and because there's always overflow it makes more than 150 I have my other trusty Molde here with the emoji faces on them so yeah I mean it's pretty basic it only takes a few minutes what takes the longest in my opinion is having them solidify in the fridge so I think this is pretty well mixed yeah it's mixed so just because I'm going to rush it but don't rush it because of a mixture might not work out as well it's actually starting to bubble so I chose great because I find that you taste the can of oil I know it doesn't bother some people but I like to taste the sweetness and the sugar and stuff so I guess you could put it less than half a cup in there you could put a quarter cup in here depending on your tolerance but my tolerance is quite high I eat a fair bit of edibles and I do consume it by smoking it so throughout the day and so I use a half a cup of the can oil so it's pretty good right now I think I'm just going to add the can of oil okay so we're gonna add it slowly just make sure that it gets mixed in there's a lot of stirring involved in this it's just I mean I've watched different people do it online and I know some people just leave it be but I don't I prefer to keep stirring it because I find the more you're stirring it the more it's going to stay mixed together I find it separates a lot sometimes so just be careful of that be cautious and be aware because if they don't mix well when they're solidifying they separate and it gives you a two tone candy I don't like that I find the butter it just or the kind of oil separates from the gelatin and I don't know why that is so I prefer to do it mixing it a lot stir stir stir came and add the rest of it you know just see the gelatine ah oh no glad I noticed that it's a little hair there so you want to mix this once all the butter or the can oil sorry I keep saying butter and used to make it with butter instead of the coconut oil but it's just it's not butter it's coconut oil so I'm sorry if I keep saying butter I don't mean butter I mean it's kind of oil kind of as coconut oil so now it's starting to heat better and it's gonna boil up as you can see which is good you do want that but stir as it does that so you're gonna want to stir it for about five minutes you might have to turn your stove down like I'm going to do cuz I find that's bubbling too much I'm actually gonna lift it up off the stove and move you up I'm sorry my phone's getting a little hot I'm gonna move you over here okay you can still see hahaha sit in the bunk pot they're just silly to do that so yeah I'm oh five minutes four to five minutes you're going to want to keep stirring it as it's sitting on the stove on medium four or five degrees depending on how your stove how hot your stove gets but it's pretty well mixed even the stuff on the side is mixed into the pot I'm gonna lift it up just so I can see how well it's mixed and then it's all mixed and looking well together excuse me I'm sorry about that so I hope you guys enjoy this video I can't believe I've never showed you guys how to make gummies before but this is homemade gummies they're not gonna taste exactly like and the textures not going to be exactly like this way the way I'm showing you I mean they still taste gummy obviously because of the gelatin and this is the easy cheap way to make yourself some gummies you can use whatever mold you like but I prefer to use the little gummy bear molds and the emoji molds okay I'm gonna shut the heat or actually no I'm gonna keep the heat on low because the mixture kind of cools itself down when you're dispersing it into the mold so having it a heat source is a good thing because it helps keep it hot or warm depending on what temperature you're gonna keep it set at when you're putting it into the mold it's important not to have it too higher you're just gonna burn the mixture and it's not gonna work at all so I've got it on low because I'm going to get ready to put it into the molds and I move the pot back and forth but since I'm filming it I'm gonna put you in another spot yes so that looks really good it's mixed really well I don't see a lot of the remnants of the the cano around the rim which is nice that means I've been stirring enough and there it's gone off the spoon or the mixing spatula okay I'm gonna move you over here you're gonna see my broken picture on the floor I can't believe that happened to fell right off the wall and boom down to the ground it went and it smashed okay it's kind of crooked you guys are gonna be having crooked necks trying to watch this oops well I'm sorry for all the movement I'm just trying to get it so that I can film it set it like that then okay here we go you have our little little miniature turkey basters [Laughter] okay here we go so just take some up obviously you guys know how these little things work where are we start on this end okay and sometimes I noticed because it's so hot it'll squirt back out I'd yeah it's kind of hard to see that but just be careful this stuff is really hot so you just put it in squeeze it into your molds kind of at medium to fast pace because this whoops this stuff cools fairly quickly I notice when I'm doing them but you will get if you're using this small gummy bear molds about a hundred and fifty plus gummies yeah so you can once they are solidified I've noticed some people on the internet use sugar powder I can't remember confection powder sugar to sprinkle on them because they are a little oily from the kind of oil that's mixed with them but I don't do that I just keep them in the fridge and then if I want some because obviously the touched her when they're in the fridge constantly is a little harder than if you left them at room temperature once they are all solidified and ready to be eat so you just continue ba-ba-ba-ba-ba get them all in there squeezing as you go so yeah I just I couldn't believe I was looking through my videos going yeah indeed I've never shown anyone how to make the gummy bear so this is how you do it this is my way of doing it this is and I find the texture fine you just got to make sure that you're also doing this stirring it around because it does separate and putting it back on the stove is a nice idea to keep the temperature hot whoops making a bit of a mess but I mean I'm sure instead of using cannabis oil to make these like some type of edible or treat for the kids leave out the kind of oil obviously oops no there we go was a little raised up there we gotta have them even so they harden properly and they're all ready to go at the same time you know what I mean so I find this fun to do this I mean I love to bake especially when they're edibles we're almost done here folks I'm actually gonna put this back on the stove for a second be right back just noticed it was starting separate you don't want that to happen okay all right she didn't had the stove on hot so I might take a little longer for you guys if you have it on medium or low so obviously we're gonna get more than 150 there's 25 in each of those gummy bear sheets so we're just gonna fill these up now obviously the emoji the pink sheet that I'm doing right now is going to take longer to harden because they're deeper bigger so I won't be showing you those but I'm hoping that these little ones if I put them in the freezer will solidify really well and I'll be able to show you them in the video no guarantees because my phone's been really wacky lately and when I pause it it shuts off on my phone sometimes so we're getting to the very last of it and it will the last few gummies will be very mediciney because of the butter that stays behind that's really what I'm soaking up here I can just see the difference so I'm just gonna pour it in there okay okay so I am going to cheat and put them in the freezer alrighty and hopefully hey that looks see that that looks like the Mickey Mouse symbol you see that a little dollop right there two ears all righty so that's what we do so far so good okay got a bit of the counter in there that one was never used so I'm gonna put these in the freezer hopefully when I pause it it won't mess up but if it does I'm sorry and I'll show them to you in another short video so we're gonna pause it and put them in the freezer for about ten minutes okay see you soon folks and if not love and Huggies and I'll show you the finished product in another video if that's what happens okay so that's how you make gummy bears folks it's pretty simple it's pretty basic and it's really easy and quick it's quick nothing to it the longest it takes in my opinion is to solidify them in the fridge which is usually about 15 20 minutes but we're gonna cheat and use the freezer okay lemon honey see you soon right alrighty so it only took five minutes but here are some this is what they look like whoops it's just what they look like gonna eat one so yeah so there you go folks oh my gosh where's the camera here we go ha ha sorry so yeah they look like rug dummies they just taste a little different you know what I mean so there it is I'm actually gonna have a couple more and put them back in the fridge but there they are dummies ready to be eaten folks lovin Huggies stay true stay unique and enjoy I hope you enjoyed the video folks and I hope you give it a try and if you do please let me know how it turned out ok bye", "10yz_nItpJU": "[Music]

community cannabis review today i'm going to be doing a review on a cartridge i'll be doing a review on a select co2 oil cartridge the strain is cinex which i believe is a cross between cindy 99 and pineapple express so um i grabbed this one because this one looks really really nice you've seen it you can check my other videos if not but um check out the other co2 oil carts from them and they look like some standard co2 oil like fairly dark oil this one looks incredible same price same like batch as all the other co2 oils but it looked great so let me turn the camera around and show you then i'll take a couple puffs [Music] hmm [Applause] [Music] hey [Music] wow [Music] alrighty so let's get into this um first off i'll correct myself by saying it is actually a cross between cindy 99 or cinderella 99 and vortex i had not heard of vortex prior to this but seems like a good strain um very interested after just reading a quick leafly article about this strain seems like it's heavy on um less on the mirror scene in the cardiophiline which i get bored of seems like it's heavy on pinene and limonene potentially which i really like so first off trying to make more videos but struggling to find the time and motivation and also more so just not get greedy because i recently just bought like a gram of six star hash rosin that i was wanting to make a video on but i just got into it way too quick and didn't even take a picture prior to me opening it so i feel like that's not the best way to make a video so i'll buy another gram eventually and get a video on it and it was super great um but first let's start with what we have here cine cynix um so let's see it first off amazing for their co2 oil you normally don't get anything besides like that dark black oil basically which i'm not against for the price that it goes at it's pretty good stuff wow that's one of the best cards i've had in a good while um definitely has like a little base layer i always notice a heavier notes first a little bit of like that peppery taste but it is strong with the definitely taste a good bit of pinene in there and then maybe some like lemonade as well lemony is always light to me so if there's a lot i couldn't tell anyways that really really evens it out it's not it's always like such a standard boilerplate co2 oil taste which is a lot like whiskey or like there's usually a lot of humiliating in there this one it's got i mean it's got the slightest bit of that taste to it but it has so many other like terpenes going on that it overpowers that easily and that it's good it's uh it's very citrusy but it's like a heavy citrus it reminds me of grape with but it doesn't it's not like grape flavor it just reminds me of grapes grapes like a heavy fruity taste to me it's like um orange and mango is kind of mixed with like a peppery peppery main taste yeah so that's all i got on this one really but i mean that is a solid cart right there for their select co2 line highly highly um hats off to them because that's really really well done so thanks for watching i'm going to try and get more videos out especially some new brands not just the same old stuff but unfortunately there's not many new brands to work with so yeah i'll see what i can do but thanks for watching and grab one of these check it through the window of the cart first but even the dark ones look are pretty decent in my opinion but i mean if you see one like this go for it alright thanks for watching you'll have a great", "4MD06UCMUd8": "hey guys what's up this is recreational 420 and I know I'm really close but there's a reason for it I'm gonna do an edible review and this stuff is the fat Panda or hot sugar Panda candy green apple powered by you fuse and every other brand that they like to throw in there so this is what it looks like this is just a one single serving ten milligram candy kind of like a it's supposed to be a soft chew so I'm gonna go ahead and open it like I said single piece I didn't you know just a single package I didn't get like they're ten pack that they have but there we go I'm gonna go ahead and open it up this is what it looks like once you open it just a weird little looks like a little turd kind of so look at me getting all smart using scissors now so that's what it looks like it feels exactly like if you if you've ever been a child airheads that's exactly what this feels like it's got that same consistency whoo it's got that same smell like I said this is green apples so I'm just gonna shove this whole thing in my mouth and enjoy it oh my god so as far as the flavor goes you guys are gonna hear me too it's fun all right so the flavor is actually really good I have it on the top of my room I like my mouth right now I've gone so the flavor is amazing I'm gonna have the other one right here in a second this was just a 10 milligram candy and yeah I'm gonna see how this reacts and I'll be back with you guys in a couple days to let your w tomorrow and I'll let you know exactly how this one hey guys what's up so I went ahead and tried those watermelon candies as you guys know that obviously I ate it in the video so about an hour and a half to two hours later completely spaced the fact that I'd had an edible hadn't smoked yet and was sitting on the couch and I look over to my girlfriend I was like babe why do I feel so hot she looked at me and just started laughing and she was like oh yeah the watermelon candy you duh so yeah this thing even for just having had the 110 milligram candy it was enough to like send me into that edible hi I felt it I got tired I got a little bit of like the haziness and this was all by 5 o'clock so if if you're new to edibles this would be a great one because it's gonna give you like just enough of that like effect that you're gonna feel it and get you know the base knowledge of how it in edibles going to like a react in your body so all around I would and if you're more of like I guess a more seasoned user you can take 2 to 3 and have a great night either way these are awesome so with that I think that's it this has been recreational 4/20 if you guys have any questions or anything leave it down in the comment section if you like these videos go ahead and hit that sub button trying to get to a hundred before the end of this month and I'll be back again with you guys

upside down and click click the red button okay guys and hopefully you guys try some of this easter spring candy happy easter", "LMD5aAC9wAk": "hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is liz if this is the first time you're joining you're a regular subscriber welcome back thank you so much i really do appreciate your support i really do mean that i love you guys so today i'm going to show you how to do the sour version of a gummy uh gummy candy so this has got includes the gelatin and a cooked syrup candy syrup you combine them and we then apply the sugar sweet and sour sugar right afterwards so we don't have to wait for it uh to dry uh or to figure out when we need to add it we add it right afterwards and um all right so i'll just get right started we'll get into the ingredients the equipment that you're gonna need and then how to put everything together all right well thank you so much for joining and i hope you enjoy the video okay so this recipe is done in two stages well technically three because we cook in two different stages and then we combine everything so for the first gelatin for the jello half you're going to need three tablespoons or three envelopes of unflavored gelatin one box of your favorite jello flavor a quarter cup of light corn syrup a half a teaspoon of citric acid a half teaspoon of gour gum and a quarter of a cup to a third of a cup of your can of butter and for the liquid you're going to need um a quarter cup that we're going to heat up to boiling and then a half cup that we're going to be using to bloom our gelatin and you can use any liquids that you like i like to use these um kool-aid or the kool-aid jammers these ones are good because they're a water-based and they're clear so you don't have to contend with color and they're also half the sugar so again you're not going to it helps cut back on the sugar since we got a whole ton of it in it that totally up to you though you want to definitely stick to a clear type liquid those powerades if you like those type of things those vitamin waters if you like them i don't like them they do not add the greatest of taste but if you do add juices like with it have real fruit juice in it then you're going to want to use a mold inhibitor because mold will develop very quickly and if you want to add additional colors or flavors uh we can do that i'm going to be adding 2d fruity and so i'm going to kind of make it pink and purpley i don't know tutti frutti colors and if you want to have a nice solid uh background you're going to need white food coloring so that's for the gelatin part the jello side gelatin side for the cooked candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar a half a cup of light corn syrup and a half a cup of water so for the equipment that you're going to need you're going to need a double boiler so you can use any pot and metal bowl i like to try and use a thicker thicker metal so that it doesn't get too hot you're going to want something to disperse your candy i love using these bottles they work great and they've got the piping tip which makes it really nice or you can use an eyedropper now this recipe is a little bit thicker so i'm not sure how well an eyedropper is going to work with it you're also going to need an oops timber you're also going to need a smaller pot for your sugar syrup and a candy thermometer two spatulas you're also going to need a hand blender and if you're going to be splitting your syrup either by doing different colors or flavors you're going to need a measuring cup to split that out if you're just doing all one you don't need that or in in lieu of a hand blender you can use whisk in a very strong forearm so the first thing that we want to do is we are going to bloom our gelatin and we are going to heat up that other quarter cup um you may need a little bit more liquid if you do you can just add it in later on if needed so we're going to heat this up in the microwave for about a minute and 20 seconds and we're going to sprinkle three tablespoons of gelatin unflavored gelatin onto our half a cup of liquid you want to kind of evenly spread it and then you're going to mix it in so that it is thoroughly mixed and that there are no lumps so you want it to kind of look like light up you want to look like applesauce and then you're going to just set that aside for five minutes and we're gonna add our boiling liquid to our jello mix and you're gonna stir that oh and you're gonna start you're gonna put your heat on to the lowest setting we just want our water to get hot we don't want it boiling gelatin melts at just hot water so we just want a hot water bath and we're going to stir that in and we're going to add in our corn syrup that's our quarter cup of corn syrup and we're just going to stir oh sorry and we're going to add in our half teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to stir that i said until it's dissolved it takes about five five six minutes or so for all of that to melt and in order to get this stuck gelatin off the side you can use some very hot water and a brush and it'll just you can wash that off otherwise if you don't it won't it doesn't melt and then it you'll get bits and stuff in your jello then you also want to make sure when you're stirring is to rub your spatula across the bottom because the sugar and the gelatin can stick to it and you don't want that so you want to make sure you'll feel it you can feel it smooth on the bottom if there's stuff stuck you'll feel it kind of rough you just kind of want to work it off scrape it off then once your gelatin or sorry your jello is fully melted we're gonna add in the gelatin and what i do is i just kind of cut it up into smaller pieces just like this and just in she goes and you're just gonna gently stir that until it's melted and if your water is hot now if the um your pots nice and hot you can turn off the heat you don't gelatin required doesn't require much heat at all to melt and if it gets too hot the gelatin will break which means it's not going to have that it's not going to your candies aren't going to set that well and the sign that you'll know that it's too hot is if you start to see white foaming stuff white foamy stuff happening on the top of your mixture here on your syrup now that everything is melted we are going to add in the can of butter and our gour gum and the reason that we have to use gour gum is it is an emulsifier and it is going to allow your oil and your your water to come together as one as one liquid versus being oil and water you know don't mix together an emulsifier allows them to come together as one solid solidified unit in short it basically mushes the oil and the water together to live happily we're going to pour in the our can of butter and i've used a third of a cup so as you can see adding you're adding the can of butter or oil to our gelatin you can mix and mix and mix until the cows come home no matter what those two are never going to blend together now you might get the appearance if you kind of whisk really really quickly you have the appearance that it's combined right that kind of looks like that's all combined however if you go and you set that and if you want to set that up now all of the butter would raise to the top of the mold now if you've got one of these little strainers or a strainer it's great for doing the guru so we're going to use a half a teaspoon of gargum and you're going to gently sprinkle evenly sprinkle it over the top if you don't have a strainer you just want to make sure to try and get it evenly over the top there this will adhere to the oil and allow it to mix in with our with the jello and i'm going to let that sit for a minute and now we're going to get our trusty hand blender [Music] and you'll continue to mix that until it is completely all one color all one unified color you don't see any kind of streaking or any kind of any difference whatsoever that's when you know it it is fully blended and emulsified and you're gonna be how about that texture and once that's done we're just going to let that set to set aside and leave it on the hot water but turn off the heat and then we're going to do our candy syrup all right so for our candy syrup we're going so for the candy syrup you want one cup of sugar a half a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water you're gonna mix that together until it is blend till it's all mixed up and your sugar starting to dissolve and we're going to turn the heat on to medium-high and you're going to stir the syrup until it begins to boil so as soon as it starts to boil then you are going to stop stirring that's when we add the candy thermometer and we don't stir it again and then you're also going to want to grab a jar of hot water about whatever something of hot water and a brush so you can wash down the sugar crystals off of the side and that'll prevent your syrup from crystallizing once it begins to boil there we're going to add our candy thermometer i'm going to try to add the candy thermometer now if you ever wonder why i kind of have this weird looking thing the one that i have said it setting on it that thermometer doesn't always work for me it occasionally will fail um this i like the digital but the digital um doesn't have any way of holding on to it it's more meant for just kind of sticking it into checking a temperature and then i have to use the tin foil to protect the digital from the heat so that's why i kind of have this weird makeshift candy thermometer and we're going to cook this syrup to 208 280 degrees soft crack now you can go a little bit if you want your candies a little less chewy you can go a few degrees less you can go to about 275. if you want them a lot chewier then you can go to 300. i seem to find the 280 is perfect for it well for what my liking anyway so we're going to continue to cook that syrup until 280 degrees just remember to wash down any crystal any sugar crystals that may form on the sides just to let you know you're doing this at the medium high it will go fairly quickly so don't leave the kitchen normally you do the sugars at a lower temperature so you have a little bit of time this doing it at the higher temperature it will go very quickly so i'm traveling you don't leave your kitchen and then you also want to get a pot of just cold water or a bowl of cold cold water stand by uh we're gonna put the bottom of the pot in that to stop the syrup the cooking process so we're at 276 270 see how quickly it starts to go 278 279 280 leave the candy thermometer on because we want to bring this temperature down to 240. you can turn your heat off leave it in the water until the temperature starts coming down and then we're just going to set it on the side here until that temperature comes down to 240. so once your temperature comes down you can remove the candy thermometer and we're going to add in ow be careful the syrup is still very very hot you're going to get your gelatin mixture and you're going to have a look and you're going to make sure that you don't see any green or anybody butter separation now you might see a little bit of cut like see how that color there difference that suggests your jello that the air is coming out of so don't worry about that what you care is if you see any kind of green or oily looking so that's good we're going to pour this into this candy syrup and be very careful when you're stirring this now your gelatin is going to be a lot more liquidier than the liquid liquid ear i know i come up with my own words uh then the candy syrup is going to be thicker it's also going to start to solidify as you can see on the spoon that's why you're going to gently stir it and we're going to turn the heat on to bury it to the lowest temperature and you want to make sure to take your spatula and go all the way around the edges the syrup will has a tendency to stick along those edges see so i like to use the hand blender whoops to make sure that everything is fully uh mixed together and blended and emulsified [Music] and then you're just going to gently stir to make sure that it's all nicely mixed so now at this point is when we're going to add in our flavor and additional colors if you like or as i said if you want if you're not doing that you can just go ahead and put this into your bottles right now and get ready to distribute into the molds so i'm going to be adding one of my newest favorite flavors tutti frutti love this flavor i usually use about a cup and a half and again you just want to gently get that all mixed in now if you are going to be splitting uh if you want to do two different colors this is this point you're going to put it to the transferred over to your measuring cup and split it in half or if you wanted to do two different flavors then do that before split it in half add your different flavors but i'm just doing one flavor base two colors okay so i have got now whenever you look at a um a measuring cup always look at it straight on get down at the level and look at it straight on if you look at it from a down level you see you don't get an accurate reading that looks like two and a quarter cups however it's more like two and a third cups so for this one i'm going to do i'm gonna add some more red and i like to use the no taste red i hate the taste of red dye i can always taste it and everything so i like the no taste red the one thing about it however is it doesn't have quite the intensity of red that the regular does but i'd rather forsake a little bit of the intensity on the color versus the intensity on the flavor there we go that's a nice red and the other side i'm going to do purple i'm going to add in some pink i want a more pinky purple versus a dark purple and a couple drops of blue now mix that up see what we get now right now because we did i didn't add the white into it and it looks like it's a solid color it's actually it'll come out kind of still a little bit translucent so if you want to get a solid background and that it's not going to lighten up or get that kind of clear or translucent look you want that solid opaque then you need to add in the white so i'm going to add a couple drops into white on both sides so we have here when we add in the white it's going to dull down our color a little bit so that i'm just going to add in a little bit more of the red and add a little bit more to the purple purple i think i'm gonna leave i like that color but the red i wanna looks kind of orangey and see how much nicer that color is now it's a lot richer and gives you more that solid background makes it opaque versus having that translucent look to it and now i'm just going to get ready to pour it in the bottles and distribute it into the molds all right so now we're ready to distribute into the molds and you can go do half and halves now don't fill up your mold all the way to the top if you do it ends up leaving a sharp edge on your candy that dries out and it doesn't make your candies very pleasant so don't fill them all the way up to the top and it's also when you're trying to pour try and keep it to the middle and just let it distribute it out once you have your mold set up while all filled up you put it into the fridge for uh two hours sometimes it may take a little bit longer basically two hours or until they're set all right so it's been a couple of hours and our candies are ready to come out of the molds and we're gonna make up our sugar sour mix so you're going to add one cup of sugar and to that you're going to add a half a teaspoon of citric acid cut it and you want to make sure to thoroughly mix that in so you're going to get even citric acid on everything not just get like a big hunk of it on one candy that's kind of gross so you want to make sure to thoroughly mix it in now the nice thing with this recipe is as soon as we take them out of the molds we're going to put them right into the sugar this sugar mix you don't have to worry about waiting for them to dry or partially dry before we can add it and the reason for that is citric acid is water soluble so when you do the other gummy recipe when you just take them out they're still wet and gummy bears are essentially water and gelatin so as soon as there's any moisture on them the citric acid will begin will automatically begin to melt it doesn't do it on this because you have the sugar coating or the sugar candy syrup in there that helps protect the gelatin and that's why they don't melt as soon as you put it on and that's why this recipe is way better for doing sour or sugar coated candies now these guys are going to be a lot stickier than your regular gummy recipe so you just kind of pull it and they'll start to peel out and then you just work them out and then just pop them right into your sugar sour mix and as they warm up a bit uh they will start to get a little more tacky so no worries as long as you can pull them out of the molds they're good and they do stick to your fingers they do just kind of put it down into the sugar you can just kind of rub it in and it'll get them off that's nice once the your sugar or your sugar sour mix is on they no longer stick together see look at that and then you just put them on the rack to dry as per usual now what i like to do is i like to put holes in my parchment paper so that way you're getting air from both sides it helps with drying the other nice thing with this recipe is it doesn't take anywhere near as long for these to dry as the regular gummy recipes they're pretty much dry in a few hours to overnight now if they do start to get a little too warm and too hard to get out of the mold just put them back in the fridge for a little while if you actually keep a little bit of sugar on your fingers once they get a little bit sticky it'll help with them not sticking to your fingers a little aid with them coming off see if they stick they will fuse just pull them apart now if you're taking these out and they're just not coming out they're way too sticky um they're too gooey you can put them back in the fridge for a couple of hours or um and if you take them out and they're still not going to come out what you can do is uh put them in the freezer for about an hour take them out put them back in the double boiler on low re-melt them and add a half a tablespoon to one tablespoon of bloomed unflavored gelatin and that should add enough a little more gelatin there that'll fix that right up and if you find that they are too gummy oh sorry not if they're too gummy if they're too chewy they're like rubber bands again same thing just put them back on the double boiler on low remelt them and add a couple of tablespoons of um liquid to it and mix it all in until it's all melted recast them and that should take care of that problem if you've taken them out and there's um your butter is all risen to the back same thing just put them into the double boiler re-melt them add a little bit more gargum and re-emulsify make sure to use the hand blender or your whisk really really well like i showed you earlier so again if they're stuck like that uh check first to see just gently work around if they come away then you're good you can pull it out of the mold but if they're doing that they're not coming it's not coming away at all then they need to either go into the longer go into the fridge longer or to add some more gelatin to them they are a little bit more work but they are definitely worth it in texture and flavor in everything i've pretty much abandoned the other gummy bear recipe personally i just use this recipe now i'll just do either sugar coated or the sweet or the sugar and sour mix option is if um they are being really sticky um they are kind of coming out they're set but they're just really sticky um that can happen because it gets it picks up a little bit too much moisture in the refrigerator you can just let them sit in the molds for a couple of hours on the counter before taking them out that'll assist in drying that out a little bit now if you can stand your candies up it's a good idea some of them won't stand up though too small to whatever decides so if you can stand them up great if not you just want to flip them over every couple of hours until they're dry and as i said before this recipe and the drying time is it's a lot less time and that's it for them so just leave them out and enjoy some awesome sweet and sour gummy candies so that's my tutorial on sweet and sour gummy candies these are the little bad boys they haven't dried yet but you can see they're really nice they're little that little squishy now because they're still wet tastes awesome so i hope you give this recipe a try whether you want to do just sugar coated or the sugar sour it's a great recipe i'm sure that you'll love it if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to put them in the comments i'll always get back to you and i think that's everything i've got for you today well thank you so much for joining time diamond delight edibles wish i could get that straight um thank you for joining diamond delight edibles it's been a pleasure have a wonderful day [Music] you", "cil7w-094aw": "what's good everybody oh welcome to my channel i hope everybody's doing good just wanted to do a real quick review on um this canyon sour liquid 50 milligram thc lollipop now if you only got a wreck if you're only a wreck user you can only get these in 10 milligrams if you got a medical card you can get them in 50 milligrams so it is 150 milligram pop i like how they do uh their little thing right there um they they do it like ski slopes like the recreational ones they're actually they're 2.5 milligrams the gummies they make they have a green circle then they have um then they have uh a blue square which is when they're like 5 to 10 milligrams and then they got the black diamonds for ones that are like 20 to 50 milligrams i've got uh these little hard candies too which are really good the canyon suckets um they're tight they're tiny little hard candies i'm really a big fan of these let me show you how small these things are right here they're tiny me see just a little tiny hard candy and that's a little thin and that's 20 that's 20 milligrams right there and it's good very good i got one of those left i'm gonna save it for um movie i'm about to watch i went ahead and bought that uh that new wrong turn this is supposed to be [ __ ] crazy it's supposed to be about a cult um they're changing it up a little bit it's not necessarily a remake it's like a it's like a new wrong turn so hopefully that's gonna be [ __ ] good i'm gonna say my last little second to uh chew during the movie and uh i'm also gonna eat me a lollipop um these are good man i've had them before i'm not gonna lick this right now because i have a uh hard candy in my mouth but you see it's nice and sour it's got the thc uh diamond right there on it [Applause] and uh you know what's cool is your colorado they're thc dot it's a diamond um that's totally from from ski culture um it's the reason why they made a diamond like black black diamonds um and uh it's just great because you know washington's got a different center symbol california's got a different symbol um now this actually most of these you know they're usually about 50 milligrams this one has 45.5 milligrams cbd it has close to three milligrams of cbd 2.56 milligrams two and a half milligrams of cbd um so yeah man it's a good product canyon i like them um they use a really good what they call cannabis essential oil which is a co2 oil and um you know i like the hashier edibles the more like full spectrum edibles definitely with the oil they use is um has a has a tiny bit of a hashy flavor but it doesn't betray the whole thing it's not distillate it's a co2 um cannabis oil which it has other things in there like the terpenes and the um you know it's the full it's a full spectrum oil it's not just a not just a clear distillate but like i said these these are very good um so yeah i suggest you try one um i've tried them before it's got a good very good sour grape flavor i'm not even a huge fan of the of uh grape but i like it i like it a lot and um i always tell you the the this batch is made with box sativa hybrid they always make it with a bulk uh hybrid or indica hybrid usually um this one right here you see it's just uh made with just bulk hybrids so sure they get like a whole bunch of untrimmed um good good bud to make their oil out of but yeah man canyon good good company and um they also have gummies too their gummies are uh tiny like these and usually they're only 2.5 to 5 milligrams they're small doses but they're little so you eat a bunch of them at a time anyway thank you guys for watching my channel um i hope y'all have a good rest of the evening i'm gonna watch my movie get do a few dabs and uh eat a cannabis lollipop so take care peace", "MxPBmxnLivM": "[Music] two wheats the marijuana animal review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and today we are talking about krispity krunch II no I'm just joshing with you we're not talking about Peter Barnes but I'm on camera one because they're good too because they're high in fat and three because we're actually reviewing a hundred million gummy bears what's correct we are reviewing the ED of your 100 milligram Getti gummy bears today looking at in another this is another in this series if that appeared that we're going to be reviewing smaller dose to the last time we took these if history is going to repeat them itself these will taste awful and won't get me that high I'm hoping against hope that both of those things aren't true but there are no guarantees so the peanut butter minims just that just bad to help me get some of this as the best part of this th e so that's why I'm eating news those are gonna taste so much better than these I have a feeling alright let's open it up here oh man I thought last time this packaging was easy to open but now it's not looking so good balls all right I'm gonna have to grow grab some scissors technical difficulties back that's a negative anytime you have to go for the scissors she'd never have to do that finally finally let's give it a sniff oh man Oh smells like gummy bears with weed here we go that is awful oh and it gets worse it's got that harsh aftertaste oh oh they're so bad oh why would you do this to yourself and get gummies guys why why candies and goes-- why I don't understand it I really don't but I'm willing to keep doing it for you guys just because you seem to like them I I I'm not sure I get it so the head of pure 100 milligram gummies guys I'm going to finish these bad boys off not looking forward to it and I will see you in two hours to let you know how they are feeling and let's hope against hope one last time that they are the exception to the rule and I am coming to you blazed in two hours but not too optimistic see you two hours peace it has been two hours since I had the head of your gummy bears 100 milligrams and nothing really I can't say nothing I little high it's sort of as equivalent if I had maybe smoked a small bowl recently so on about in line with what I thought not a good value proposition at ten dollars not at all they tasted awful tasted really really bad and I'm not very high there isn't really a lot to say about the etta pure gummy bears and then they taste terrible and they really don't get you that high I have a few more and appears to review and I hope things turn around for them and again I want to I do want to say that I think these are more potent than like the infused creations that I've had so take that as you will but you know just gummies and candies just don't do it for me they may do it for you edibles you know can everybody experiences them a little bit differently maybe they just don't seem to work but I'm willing to give ed up here a fair shake in the future reviews guys

since I have to go to the hospital later in the week that we can make a nice edible to take with me I've decided for this edible on using a Cresco RSO a nice sativa blend you know can't go wrong has some cbgc BC THC so what's next what do we do with it after trying lots of different ways to try to make different edibles and doing baking I really wanted to make some hard candies I don't want to get a candy thermometer I don't want to boil sugar and corn syrup so I found something about melting down Jolly Ranchers and then just pouring them into a mold and doesn't that kind of sound fantastic if it works hooey you already kind of know it works as I showed you so you want to see how we did it we just bought Samara so and I have a ton of Jolly Ranchers 22 and we're gonna try to make some melted down Jolly Ranchers and add the RSO and these levels this is gonna be real time-consuming taking them all apart separating them crushing them up and then hopefully make it easier to melt the fam well it's we're gonna use strawberry and pineapple watch this like now let's crush it up [Music] so we're probably going to double triple quadruple bag these ranchers before we smash it off with a hammer [Music] I don't have any three years of thanks are being so quiet she's terrible [Music] empty out we're emptying the contents of the crushed-up Jolly Ranchers into a pot and we're gonna put out on the stove yeah she looks all innocent this girl's been Barkin the whole time I'm gonna make sure some little butter in there just to give the heart so something to stick to so look a little sour - hey Zeus all this butter over here jacked up with candy on it just keep stirring just keep stirring [Music] it's kind of the consistency of like previously chewed bubblegum yeah accurate it looks like that too yeah it's five minutes away from giving in and becoming a liquid and you how long do you think we've been like stirring this on low oh my gosh at least 10 15 minutes okay not there yet it wasn't really doing much so we turn the heat up just a little bit it's like number two or three right in between there like a little past three but now it's really starting to melt down and I think we're almost ready to squeeze the RSO in there we have to heat up a tower so a little bit we're gonna fit the RSO in there for a couple minutes let it soften up so it doesn't break that click container so and we're gonna squeeze about half of this into that mixture if you could only smell this right now remember it was pink mmm no it's dank I'm gonna just pour it into the mold but it's to meet you hard to film that so I'll show you the aftermath here's the aftermath the pan came pretty clean only burned a couple fingers definitely a whole bunch of edibles I'm working on cheeping my own it's a little edible to be [Music] yeah I was just told that people don't keep confectioners sugar in the fridge comment below and know where do you keep it [Music] yellow like it was definitely worth making him this way but it seems like definitely a team effort yeah if I was alone I would have been really stressed out there's a audibles calculator online if you go to how to add a bowls calm and you type in the amount of product you use and the amount of THC that's in that product so you can use or so you can use distillates you can use your own can of butter and it tells you how much each of your edibles is when you divide it by the amount of edibles you make out of it so I'm not a math person it makes me real stress to even think about it the how-to edibles calculator is a lightsaber doing the math on our half gram of our so that we added and and we made oh I forget how many pieces but we had done the math the other day so the larger pieces that we made around 14 to 15 milligrams and the smaller heart pieces that we made were around 7 so I'm not mad at it I tried on the other day it was good it didn't last as long as people claim that their edibles last but if I get a couple hours of relief it's worth it for me and you know just keep eating them like you would a gummy bear so it's nice to have like a hard sucker so medical Mary approved", "JzUBuzE4qQ4": "hey guys it's

part two so we're gonna eat three um we'll eat lemon and like part three so okay um yeah so that's it subscribe subscribe like and yeah till then peace", "UfrwAQbhHC4": "[Music] hello and welcome to lofty pursuits and public displays a confection in Tallahassee Florida I'm Greg today's candy is gonna be continuation on a project of making candy out of beer like we did with the chocolate stout but this time we're gonna make it out of Corona Jake comes with a hot pot of sugar it's just hot sugar in Corona at this point and it's gonna go on the table the cooling table here was made about a hundred years ago and it's gonna drop the temperature of this candy dramatically it's gonna take it from its 310 degrees and lose about a hundred degrees so we can manipulate it and sculpt it today we're gonna put a crown on every piece of candy because Corona of course means crown we've started to experiment with alcohol in candies to use it as a flavor in this case we used bottles of Corona in other cases we did chocolate stout for our st. Patrick's Day mix vanilla whiskey for it as well and those are up for sale on our site we've also done in the past tiki drinks we had a lot of fun with different series of this and we thought what could be better than Corona mind you we were thinking about doing this for Cinco DeMayo this year but why wait we actually wanted to make this last year but time just flew by but the way this contains no alcohol alcohol is a much lower boiling point than water and we boil off all the water and the alcohol goes first there's even water in the food coloring and shake and I by stirring it in boil off all the water in the food coloring we just use the hot candy as their heat source the cooling table has cooled the candy and it's now ready to cut into our pallet we have a clearish yellow section a blue section and of course the gold for the crown [Music] the part of the candy that touched the table cooled down much faster than the rest leaving a liquid pool in the center by dripping off the hot candy we're able to even out the temperature and to help turn candy into something that feels more like clay we have yellow candy we have blue candy and we sort of a transparent amber candy now we want to have white candy instead of amber so we're gonna transform this candy from amber to white naturally without adding any food colorings we do this by putting this on a machine called a sugar puller but some people call it a taffy puller it's a mechanical machine that will fold air bubbles millions and millions of them into the candy each air bubble will reflect the light and that reflection will be white and make the candy appear white so it's an illusion of white in amber candy it's doing the same thing the head of a glass of Corona beer does when you pour a glass you have bubbles on it and the bubbles are white but the beer is amber what it's doing is these round bubbles are reflecting light and making it white we're just taking the head of a glass of beer and trapping it in time which is so appropriate for Corona flavored candy if you want to try this candy or any of our other candies for yourself we ship worldwide you can just go to our website which is www.hyken.com at Thomasville Road about five minutes away and we'd love to see you Corona means crown and we're gonna build a crown on this candy they have their own crown but we haven't asked for permission to make it so we're gonna make our own crown and I'm gonna build this crown carefully because my mother used to warn me she'd say Gregory you stop that you're gonna fall and break your crown instead I'm gonna cut all these little crowns into neat pieces [Music] we're gonna start by building the crown and building the crown is gonna be easy because it's gonna be made out of four identical parts just switching directions this will allow us to make just one part and duplicate it using candy multiplication if you think of a crown you can sort of do vertical lines between each of the points and you can see they're triangles going out of the direction the center point can be cut in half - and that'll leave you with four identical shapes so what we're gonna do is we're gonna do one of the shapes out of this yellow gold we're gonna shape it with the point and then we're gonna add some white to it to squirt back off to a rectangle rectangles are easier to deal with the one pointed candy with the white hidden inside it it's been stretched and we're gonna cut it into four pieces then the trick is to line up these seams precisely and we sort of roll one piece of candy onto the other to do our best and lining up the bottom of the points now we're gonna use that pulled white we've been saving and we're gonna use it to wrap around the crown and provide a nice spacer and of course the air bubbles on the white don't just serve to reflect light they also provide more surface area for the flavor and we want the flavor to come through because this is a weird flavor we're putting sweet in with beer and it's come out great and it's got this weird delay you take the candy and you taste sweet but the beer flavor comes after by several seconds it's wonderful and a little disconcerting we decided to do the outer stripes and colors blue and gold reminiscent of the corona beer that went into this candy and once again we're gonna use candy multiplication we're gonna make one set of stripes stretch it cut it and we'll end up with three stripes for the final product we just have to size the candy down and we do that by pinching off one end this end gets sold in the store under the name unicorn droppings and no we don't sell them by mail order we only sell them in the store so there's a reason to come I mean it's a reason to come besides just saying hi to me I like people to say hi to me we now have a giant log of candy and that's not gonna do any good as much as many people would like to eat it especially being Corona flavored it needs to be sized down into about 5000 individual bite size pieces and we start this process on our batch roller this hundred-year-old machine spins the log of candy and keeps it warm so we can taper it down into individual rods the rods then will cool and be cut up if you liked this video we have lots of others and you can also subscribe to us here on YouTube please just ring the button that says you want to get alerts

course we also have Facebook Instagram and Twitter if you want to subscribe Jake is pulling all these out it takes a lot of practice to master the skill and Jake's been working eighteen months and I gotta say he's got it at this point good work Jake Jake has kept the logs rolling until they've almost completely cooled down and we take the round logs we move them over to a candy cooling table for them to cool even further and then we make them into bite-sized pieces using our candle and if you got this far I think I can ask you for a favor spread the link to this video everywhere because we want this video to become really popular because this is a video that really should go viral and here's the final product we're very happy with it and of course you can't have Corona by itself so every bag of Corona will be partially filled with a lion candy it occurs to me you may not know why people put limes in the top of bottles of Corona it wasn't originally for the flavor it was originally to keep flies out thank you for watching you can get our candy at wwp d net be good folks be safe and keep things in perspective it's not like we made candy type odds here you know it does occur to me that cough drops are part of the hard candy history they made it with wonderful materials like slippery elm bark honey and marshmallow root what do you think of me making those", "Fr6J93uzIwI": "yo guys and welcome to commander cassius video cactus and today we're going to be trying these sour patch kid um candies um let's get the first one this one's a little bit blue it's sour no it's sweet this dries fine i've already tried tried these two i don't like them okay next one i like the pink ones or the blue ones um i'll try these ones like orange that's good this is a good i like this one that should be strawberry um pink lemonade um bubble gum there it is let's eat it oh my god this is really good they're kind of like those candy necklaces they're all the bad ones that that's horrible keep these and that's my challenge for all of you guys to do you have to go to the store and try to get these and see how sour they are try the flavors and use hashtag sour patch kids oh wait hold up go get the box okay hashtag sarah put hashtag sour patch kids sour then sweet hearts candy that's what we're gonna be doing and use that hashtag i don't think these are in the store anymore but i uploaded this i'm i'm making this on valentine's day did i upload this i don't think it will be it but don't know when i'm gonna upload this because i don't know see you guys later", "348s5l3DjQo": "[Music] hello and welcome to lofty pursuits and public displays of confection in tallahassee florida i'm greg this is our first video of 2021 and i don't know what your plans are but nothing is going to stop me from making 2021 a great year for lofty pursuits and i hope that means it's going to be a great year for you too we're going to capture the flavor of chocolate covered strawberries chocolate-covered strawberries are kind of unique because we know exactly who invented them lorraine larusso and she did it in the 1960s and we'll get to that at the end as i mentioned this will be part of our image candy assortment for valentine's day it's available at www.pd.net and here's the full 2021 assortment what we're going to do now is add the food coloring and if you take a look as i stir it in you're going to see the steam start coming off you know that's because the food coloring is water-based and the candy may look like a liquid but has no water in it and this is how we're going to build their palettes we're going to have a red section which is of course going to be the strawberry and in this case also the outside wrap we're also going to have a little bit of trouble today it's a cold day in tallahassee and i know those of you up north are going to think florida coal well the inside of the store right now is about 67 degrees and that's giving us some trouble the candy's cooling faster than i'd like it to so this is going to be a bit of a rush the entire time we're going to see how that goes and yellow is going to be used for the background fortunately yellow a little yellow goes a very long way we always use yellow for the background because it also lets us use it for the yellow seeds of the strawberry we're going to the brown which we're also going to use on the wrap don't need very much of that you'll notice the top layer of candy is getting a little hard it's getting a little hard to work but it's still boiling out and we're still getting a lot of steam it's been a long time since i made a batch of candy just by myself this should be interesting candy's just the right temperature i didn't wait too long there you go now i'm going to cut our candy into it the palace the stop light of color here we've got the brown and this part over here cooled a little bit much so rather than fight it and take most of it off put it in here it'll reheat there i can do the same thing with the green maybe i can save a bit of the edge of this now i got too much green on the edge i'll just use it all now to go for the red if i got the temperature right it won't stick too badly to the table well that's just perfect i can keep everything apart but i didn't succeed on everything apparently came apart good so this green can do the same thing let's see how fast everything's cooling i'm not getting the drips i normally do which i kind of have to do i'm doing this on a hot summer day it's the only way to aerate the candy enough to cool it off now that the sugar is evening out there's no real cold places that i can find to put the sugar or put my hands on so i don't get burned [Music] [Music] if you'd like to try this candy for yourself please visit our website at www.bd.net [Music] [Music] so every time i pull this and fold it over i'm trapping air bubbles into the candy this is really useful for me because it's like setting up little mirrors inside the candy and every time i do that it reflects more light that means it's going to bounce the light out of the red and it's going to make it look a little more jewel-like and that's the goal here to make this more jewel-like and it also creates more surface area in the candy and uh that means that the candy dissolves a little which is good because it makes the flavor more intense [Music] the first thing i'm going to do i'm going to make the strawberry frond the strawberry friend's gonna be sort of like half of a citrus if you've seen our citrus video three i think i'm gonna have four little green prawns so this is my heating table and different parts are heated to different amounts so i'm moving it around so let it cool off but not cool off too much got to make sure that the green edges touch each other [Music] [Music] and that'll be the top of the strawberry bread we need some more yellow we're going to need less yellow than the red by a substantial amount because these are going to be the seeds i don't even need less than that this area is going to be the wrap for the seeds and the body of the strawberry and normally i make 10 little strawberry cells and i'm going to make fewer this time [Music] because i'm making fewer because i'm going to be making the i'm going to be making pewter because i'm making the chocolate bit too and will be part of the same triangle so i'm going to end up doing seven of these little things so this will end up being four and that'll end up being three two three four the center of each of these is going to be yellow giving that little strawberry seed and this will be in thirds i'll do one two three i'll get the brown and i'll start pulling cylinders off this lots of leftover brown i guess it doesn't really have to be a cylinder but it definitely lets me measure the amount of candy in my head better there we go just like that one of the problems with the green is i always have to make too much so i'm not going to use nearly all of this the patron is never as wide as a strawberry but don't worry much of this can be saved and used for the stripe the noise you just heard with me turning on the batch roller it's a little squeaky today gonna have to lube it after all this is done a little bit of red isn't going to be a problem because we're going to put it right against the red from the strawberry or the brown and it's not ever going to be noticed [Music] there we go now all we have to do is do the outer wrap and in the meantime i'm going to put this on the batch roller let it spin for a few minutes but i don't let it go flat so now we get to see how soft these things still are they're plenty soft so we're going to be able to use these as stripes and you may wonder why we don't do much audio here live audio here the noises like that squeaking is definitely part of it also the noises from the customers are part of it because we can't use that audio according to youtube but today it's raining and we have no customers so we're not going to have that problem [Music] yeah approximately approximated the size very very close now i've got my log chocolate covered strawberry [Music] and off to the batch roller so so [Music] if you think about it chocolate covered strawberries are different than other chocolate covered fruits chocolate-covered orange peels are preserved orange peels chocolate-covered cherries are preserved too but chocolate-covered strawberries are fresh and they trace their roots back to the imagination of lorraine larusso a candy maker from a candy maker's family in chicago who was working at a grocery store that had a large candy section the cool thing about this story is i don't have to tell it to you even though lorraine passed away in 2014 she can tell her own story the produce department was right next to my candy department and ralph who was a manager used to get these driscoll strawberries from california i said you know i got a good idea we'll set up a display and we'll dip strawberries for mother's day and it became such a success and 25 hours is selling with an investment of only 700. i had a return of over 3 dollars we took the lag of candy and we drew it down into rods of candy and now we have to cut them into individual bite-sized pieces for the final assortment and we do that on our canvas if you're interested in hearing more about lofty pursuits please check out our other videos we also have a weekly or roughly weekly podcast that you can get wherever podcasts are available or off our website www.pd.net it's very different from the videos because i don't limit myself to candy do and now to see how our chocolate covered strawberry came out i really wish we could put the smells across on youtube too the smell of this candy being made was so much like a chocolate covered strawberry you could almost imagine biting into it in juice running down your fingers thank you for watching we appreciate it if you want to try this candy for yourself please go to www.pd.net you can get the candy there you can also follow us on facebook twitter and instagram and remember to subscribe to us here on youtube and to ring the bell so that you get notifications if you ever come to tallahassee we're right up the thomasville exit off i-10 we make the candy in the front of the store and we make

"We're Adam and Joanne from inspiredtaste.net and welcome to our kitchen.  We're making our soft salted caramels recipe.  These salted caramels are soft, chewy and perfectly melt away in your mouth.  Before making our salted caramels... we always make sure we have our equipment ready... and all ingredients measured out. Here's a loaf pan, we are going to lightly oil it... then we're going to cut a piece of parchment paper, lightly oil that... then insert that inside the loaf pan... which makes our lives a lot easier for when we want to unmold the caramels when we're done. Next for the ingredients, we need to measure a half cup of... heavy whipping cream... then grab one stick of butter, which is also a half cup... and cut that into eight... equally sized pieces.  Add that to a bowl... then add the cream... and place it into the microwave... then cook for about a minute... until the butter has melted and the cream is hot... set that aside... then measure out a quarter cup of light corn syrup... and one cup of granulated white sugar... now grab a small saucepan... add three tablespoons of water to the saucepan... grab the corn syrup that you just\nmeasured out and add that to the saucepan. Next for the sugar... add it but try your best not to splatter the sugar up the sides of the pan.  Then use a spoon... or spatula... to stir the sugar... into the water and corn syrup.  Heat to medium and bring to boil. Now once it as a boil you might to make sure there aren't any sugar crystals on the sides of the pan...  since this can cause something called crystallization... which can make your caramels grainy and really ruin the texture... to help with this... cover with a lid for about one minute. Remove the lid and attach a candy thermometer... you will want to cook the sugar until it reaches 320 degrees F.  At this temperature the sugar will take on a light amber color... now we are ready to add the butter and cream mixture from before... add it in small batches... then use the candy thermometer... to stir it into the sugar mixture.  As you do this... the caramel will bubble violently... so you really want to do this slowly and carefully... so nothing bubbles over. Place the candy thermometer back onto the side of the pan... and cook the caramel... until 240 degrees F... this will create a soft caramel... if you want harder caramels... cook to 245 degrees F.  Now pour the caramel... into your prepared loaf pan... and let it sit for about fifteen to twenty minutes... while you wait it's best to clean your\npot and candy thermometer... fill the pot with water, place the candy thermometer into the water... and bring the water to a boil... this will melt away all the caramel... and make clean up really easy. After about twenty minutes you can salt the top of the salted caramels... then let it sit... for three to four hours... until firmed up.  Then your done... unmold the caramel... and cut into whatever shape and size you like. Enjoy!", "vm6lR4ZFaZM": "been unsuccessful you know I'm talking to hey I got two viewers already one like this went on and went away I guess I'm not like hello hello this is Greg had lofty pursuits where we make hard candy Jessica is making a batch and I'm videotaping it so we're gonna see here we've already poured the hot sugar we're making strawberry so please remember that and tell everyone else who logs on and that's what we're making and we got the taffy machine going somebody just said this is the best thing to wake up to in the morning what yeah it's a stretching machine we can do it on the hook with the larger batches like this it easier to do on the machine and the number of poles you have to do depends on how long you can pull it and I'm afraid that one garden Jessica I keep on suggesting when we get a rack and she keeps on talking about me part contacting OSHA the ribs here watching us make candy my folks you can wave [Music] so we pulled the yellow background for the strawberry no it's hard candy w.b.t East X guys you gotta have nicer handles than this or I can't read them online so is this coming across okay did you hear me okay we make great part candy we're actually going to do a video on grape hard candy sometime soon and reintroduce it you just heard somebody listening to me on a video on a livestream on a video it's extremely meta so here we go jessica is now making a yellow triangle a bunch of them actually this will be leapfrog for the top of a strawberry I bet you guys didn't know it was called the Frog at the top now did it I made that up no it's called the sprout I'm just we still do nectar candy there are patterns in the candy of there will be there isn't yet so this green is going to be the green top to the strawberry [Music] hello Bianca welcome here from Australia we have some people here from Melbourne Melbourne Florida how long will I be streaming I suspect until either my battery runs out or I run out of Meg's of our gigs of upload bandwidth I've been told that since I have t-mobile t-mobile will give me binge watching for uploads - because it doesn't know the difference so we're actually testing this today if I have any bandulus levant when I'm done with this for the rest of the month I'll be a little surprised but I'll be happy it is strawberry-flavored yes just like that strawberry emoticon lick your screen check it out I've seen Willy Wonka guy in London I don't care what you say the London is not as hot and sticky as Tallahassee just because you don't have air-conditioning hi Debra we're in Brooklyn are you from if you could teleport not only could you be here but I tell you what I needed you to pick up on the way this is interesting when you have 370 s Watchers right now so that over there is the fron at the top of the strawberry this over here is the background color jessica is probably making the center of the strawberry berries or seeds would you want to put a hairnet on that hair it would be destroying fine art it's a hard question whether there's a cooling time difference between fold and unfold candy when you pull the candy you bring in air so it's colder to begin with no matter what you do Wyatt the Gryffindor why don't we sell unicorn droppings online because this is our current stock of unicorn droppings they sell out locally faster than we do these shelves are bare because too many of you came to visit and bought our unicorn droppings we don't make a lot of them and they sell too fast they're also annoying to ship they don't fit in the boxes our website is www.miamikettlebell.com they're named correctly so just because now I'm making each little seed of the strawberry individually and she's using candy multiplication and here's somebody who just bought a unicorn dropping and a thinks of generic silly putty that's really cool silly putty can be sawed off your play it at home kit I know it's dangerous but we perform without a net I hope your ancestor who is executed in the Salem witch trials as he just posted was executed after he had children not before we're making strawberry image candy right now Jessica is building the strawberry we've done plenty of live streams I just don't tend to put them up for public view after this live stream is over welcome to lofty pursuits where we make hard candy if you're not aware you can go to WWE and get

way to get a uniform temple like that so here it goes getting rapped at it's yellow blanket of goodness this is Greg there behind the camera and Jessica's in front of the camera please check out our web site at www.movinon.com [Music] sometimes you want the candy sticky so while she's working on the outter app she's throwing it on our batch roller to keep it moving this machine's cast-iron weighs about 500 pounds judging from having to have lifted this with about six other people and with me it's somewhere between 1895 and 1910 oh it will twist it it just doesn't matter at this point so this is going to be the outer wrap Patrick of course we make government candy check out our website WWE do I just got back from my trip today from visiting Hercules candies and I haven't had a chance to even look at the footage hopefully I'll get enough to put it down PD stands for public displays a confection of course we do International shipping I have not done a live stream for Towell day here goes Jessica making it work but you might want that you push in that little hole yo hole or you fix it already [Music] I'll give you a tour of the store after this how do we look just because I'm loud and obnoxious doesn't mean that all my employees are some of them are quiet severe in taste and then there's justice so what she's doing now is she's scaling it down you cut off the next piece can you hold it up to the end up to the camera show us what the edge looks like can you see that folks yeah it's a strawberry out-of-focus strawberry but there we go can you see that good she's got to put it down in the some candy it's not gonna work out it's got to be kept moving see we already got a little bunching going on there we go now we got a video of somebody videoing us video candy tastes better when it's meta can you repeat your question about two hours from starting the path to finishing a batch maybe a little bit more the banana video you said the banana candies to die for what about our dice flavor candy we have made candy in the shape of dice within candy that looks like dice we're to die for not bananas that's not that's confusing [Music] probably not gonna make the tide pot candy again that jokes been done I also got a very polite phone call from the head of consumer safety of Procter & Gamble Mike was a very nice guy I'm not making any more right now because he asked me so nicely he didn't even threaten or anything who came to us very simple agreement I was reading a candy that looked like a poison he was making a poison that looked like a candy that was really how the conversation what now anyone out here have any questions because you probably mirror the questions of the people online we're streaming right now by the way you can take up to 18 months to get fully mastered maybe a little bit more Jessica's been here since October and she's just about got letters going and she's possibly my fastest student ever so you know it really takes a good few months before you can even solo so it takes a very long marg commitment and time and labor by the way I am planning on making vial of candy sometime soon I got some sample flavors to test so how are you doing you came here your your your mom asked if I was we're gonna make candy today and we are and you may end up on the video do you think that's cool [Music] I'll be injecting on pull you got a picture of her peach candy up there it's good candy it tastes fuzzy it does Jessica should use anything to say Jessica there you go thank you Steinberg I really do think actually that's time to have you said that thank you jack glad you liked our malts I didn't very proud of them it's hard to get more power that good thank you we really like the black burnt flavor ourselves you know that flavor

doing stay away from the darker side I know you've never heard that before of course we met custom candy Anna yeah the act shape candy is still available I [Music] learned so much at Hercules candy those guys are great ok folks it's time to take it bye bye Jessica", "vu1RKWQtN-M": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today I have a very exciting video that's been highly requested and I'm sorry it was taking so long I'm going to be showing you guys how I make my extra strong green dragon picture this photo has one cup of liquid and 10 grams of wheat and then I reduced it to 1/3 of a cup meaning that now there is 5 tablespoons in 1/3 of a cup so every tablespoon is 2 grams of wheat you're gonna need the carbs wheat for this recipe and I'll post a link of how to do that below here's what you're gonna need alcohol that is 95% alcohol or higher some coffee filters or cheesecloth a funnel some mason jars and 10 grams of the carb to read the first step is to freeze your Dakkar bleed for at least 24 hours I have already done that and now that it's been over 24 hours I'm going to pour in 2/3 of a cup of vodka that has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours the instructions for this can still be followed even if you're not using the same amount of wheat that I am which is 10 grams all you have to do is pour enough vodka to fill just to the top of the weed now you're going to shake it aggressively for 5 minutes then you'll put it in the freezer for at least 2 hours I ended up leaving mine in the freezer for about 20 hours there's no need to leave it for long within 2 hours I did that simply because I ran at a time now I'm placing a funnel into my mason jar and I'm going to poke some holes into my coffee filter so that it flows through a little bit quicker if you don't have any coffee filters you can also use cheesecloth then place that into the funnel now you can take your weed and vodka mixture out of the freezer and shake it aggressively for another 5 minutes pour your mixture into the filter and try to avoid spilling it over the edge like I do here then wait for it to filter through this can take a while sometimes even up to a half an hour you can see how slowly it comes out of the bottom and then once almost all of the liquid has gone through I'll move the weed around to try and facilitate more of the liquid to be filtered through I put some gloves on because if your fingers are touching the weed and vodka it can absorb some of the THC and we obviously don't want that because that would be a waste now that all the vodka has gone through the filter I'm going to scoop back the weed into the jar you can see how much weed is left in the funnel because I spilled it when I poured it in so again try to avoid doing that if you can [Music] now I'm going to pour in 1/3 of a cup of vodka that again has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours and then I'm going to pour it into my jar weed that I had already filtered once now again if you're using different proportions just use enough to just cover the weed you can just pour it straight into the jar I'm just using the funnel so I can try and get some of that weed that's stuck to it the first time now once again I'm going to shake that jar aggressively for five minutes now using that same jar and same filter that I'd use the first time I am going to pour in the mixture that we had just shaken into the jar that we first used [Music] now this step is optional but I'm going to pour in a little bit of that very cold flash-frozen vodka to get the remnants out of my jar again you don't have to do this but I don't want to waste anything so every little scrap I can get I'm gonna take now once again we're going to let that filter through and it is going to take a long time just like the first round did [Music] once that's all dripped through we're going to place a clean funnel into a clean measuring cup or mason jar as well as a new clean coffee filter and we are not going to poke any holes now we're going to pour it in and we're going to wait for this to drip through this step is not necessary but I like mine very clear so I like to filter out any imperfections if you like you can do this step twice but it does take a long time so I only do it once and I find that the one time is sufficient to get it very pure and clean I'm also going to take the filter with the weed that has been filtered already and press it out as much as I can of course make sure you're wearing a rubber glove so that your skin is not absorbing at all yeah and just try and squish oh as much as you can and then that little bit of leftover that is on the parchment paper there I mean if you're just using this for yourself you could just lick it up I don't know if you don't want to waste it anything works yeah so just squeeze out as much as you possibly can it's been about a half an hour and almost everything has filtered through and we have a total of about a little bit under a cup of liquid because some of that vodka is lost in the extraction process [Music] now we need to reduce our tincture to a smaller amount and we're going to use that by using a double boiler thing which I don't have so I'm making my own version and I'm just using my instant pot so that I can do it in the living room where I have better lighting so I am wrapping some tinfoil around it so I can contain the heat as much as possible and I'm just going to put my measuring cup on to the side of it and then wrap the tinfoil kind of around it that way not too much water and heat is evaporating all you want to make sure is that your bottom of your mason jar or your measuring cup like I'm using is not touching the water so same concept as a double boiler so I both to put it in there but I just have to show off how beautiful it looks it's so clear so golden absolutely beautiful I hope you guys appreciate how wonderful it looks because a lot of my friends and family don't really feel the same way as I do so I just love being able to share this stuff with you guys online please make sure you do this any well-ventilated area so I have all windows and doors in my house opened as well as if your dreams on the stove have your hood fan on there is no smell at all so unfortunately my instant pot broke part way through I don't know what happened so I moved it to the kitchen and I made this sort of contraption thing because I could not put the measuring cup on the edge of the pot because I don't have anything deep enough where the bottom of the measuring cup wouldn't touch the water so I just put a metal strainer on top and then created some insulation with the tin foil kind of like how I did it the instant pot so while you're watching it when it's bubbling a lot like this that's a little bit too much so turn your heat down a little bit you do want a little bit of movement but not that aggressively now I reduced it down to one third of a cup and that took me about an hour and a half I believe you can reduce it more or reduce it less it just depends on how strong you want it to be now it's ready to pour into a jar to save you can use this with a dropper or you can put into your gummies or into your drinks there's so many different ways to use it hopefully you guys will check out some of my gummy videos and try it out in one of those recipes and here's the finished product which is absolutely beautiful thank you so much for watching with the measuring cup I didn't want to waste any possible tincture so I heard some iced coffee into there and now I'm drinking that so that's a good way to make sure you're not wasting anything if you guys enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe and please let me know if there's any videos you would like to see me record because I would be happy to do that thank you guys so much for watching have a great day [Music]", "8OJ6v23ah6w": "good morning guys I wanted to quickly go over how to calculate milligrams of THC and explain what it is exactly I think this is one worth knowing since milligrams of THC is quickly becoming the new dominant unit of measurement when it comes to trying to discuss dosages just like it's the dominant unit of measurement with prescription medication and a lot of other substances also in legal jurisdictions it's becoming increasingly the standard way to label the dosage up on marijuana edibles and drinkables when we talk about weed traditionally it was always done by weight grams ounces pounds and so on which was very broad and also very standard and in the last 15 years we also started using percent THC to be more precise which describes the THC content of a particular strain per gram and thus its potency per gram but that figure was always expressed as a percentage for example this strain is 12% THC but now we've gone one step further to the milligrams that milligram figure is not as confusing as it seems if you have one gram of weed also known as 1000 milligrams and it's a strain that's 12% THC that means there's 120 milligrams of THC in that single gram why do we need to take things to milligrams because one standard dosage especially when it comes to edibles has been defined as 10 milligrams 10 milligrams of THC is the amount of THC that a relative novice consumer would need to consume in order to feel mild of cannabis effects a mild high so if you buy a marijuana chocolate bar and it states that the whole chocolate bar contains a hundred and sixty milligrams that means that's that chocolate bar has 16 of those standard doses and they're most likely divided into the little chocolate squares in that bar now that doesn't mean that to the average marijuana consumer they'll be able to get decently stoned off of ten milligrams as I said in my episode on tolerance just like with alcohol marijuana tolerance Rises 10 milligrams is really just a measurement for novices for myself I need at least 25 to 30 milligrams and my tolerance is above average but it's nothing special I know super heavy marijuana users who don't feel much of anything until they get to about 50 milligrams but if you're just starting out with edibles 10 milligrams should be your first trial run obviously to control dosage on such like with such precision you have to live in a legal weed jurisdiction because that's the only way you're gonna see the percent THC or the milligram THC vigor expressed in a reliable way on the package so there you go now you know what milligrams THC is and how it might apply to you hope you enjoyed the show if you found it useful be sure to subscribe and hit that like button see you next time", "YmpPGpPUw0Q": "[Music] hi guys welcome to Diamond delight edibles if this is the first time you're joining my name is Liz and all-you-can regular guys welcome back thank you so much for your support I just popped that 10,000 market oh my god think you could not have done any of that without your support guys I really really appreciate it it just means the world to me you like me you really really like me sorry just being an ass having some fun alright so today what I'm gonna do now that I showed you how to do canna candy sugar & Canas syrup we can now make our gummies without using butter and the Gerber is an emulsifier however if you want to make them super super strong absolutely go ahead and stuff the butter back in there but this gives you far more control over how strong or weak that you would like to make them now you guys are always asking me how much milligrams etc something is and I don't generally tend to answer that very often because it is all dependent upon what you make how you make it once you're starting THC is etc so what I've done is in the description there I've included a link for the calculator that I use it's a free signup it's a little course you're more than welcome to have a look take a look at it listen to her she's really interesting and lots of information but the calculator you can use for free and that's what I use so then you can go ahead and you can make your calculations and figure out how strong etc that you want to make your candies and with this it gives you a lots of versatility so you can go all can of sugar and syrup or half-and-half which is what I'm gonna do in the recipe so I will stop babbling on now and I'm gonna get into the ingredients of course and of course what we need and then we'll put all that stuff together and make some awesome gummies there we go alright guys all right so for our new gelatin for our new gummy version here you're gonna use one box of your paper flavored jello I three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin a half a cup of water for blooming your gelatin or what I use are these kool-aid waters so they're just flavored water so I now use these in place of water they're great because they add more flavour to it or you can kind of combine some flavors which is really cool to do so I use those things are nice they're lighter and sugar and said just adding more flavor now another thing you can do for adding flavor is juice crystals now I get these at the bulk bar and you can only get them during the summer time but I get these in all different flavors and I've got two tablespoons of those again enhancing the flavor that way if you don't want to use or have these flavors artificial flavors you can go use those which work great the other thing you're going to need is a quarter cup of your can of syrup and a quarter cup of water for our jello and then for our candy side our candy version so it's going to be like the other one where we do the cook you're going to need a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar or again you can use a full can of sorry a full cup of your can of sugar same thing with your syrup I'm using a quarter cup of canned syrup and a quarter cup of light corn syrup again you can go and use as much or as little of either of those as you like I like to do the half-and-half mainly for taste and not to kill people so that's my kind of my you I don't want anybody rendered completely useless and then we are going to need 1/2 a cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and then as well if you want to add additional colors or flavors you can add those optionally as well and as I said if you want to add your butter as well it really makes them super duper you can do that you're just going to follow exactly the same thing except the previous steps from the previous version with regards to adding the butter and the Goregaon to emulsify it now something else I wanted to say and the same thing now in this version I'm not using the clear gel however you can use the clear gel exactly the same way as you do in the previous recipe of the regular and sour gummy recipe that's a good one to follow it's the most up-to-date and gives you both those versions that you can use and that's all we need for our ingredients and now we'll get into our equipment and then we will get the best part go and we'll get all this stuff put together alright so the equipment that you're going to need just like the other recipes a double boiler I just do a makeshift I get a bowl that will make sure that your water does not touch the bottom of your bowl you will need a smaller saucepan for our candy syrup two spatulas you will need your candy thermometer and you will need a larger pot that your bought is that your saucepan small saucepan will fit into ice water water with ice in it but a little tongue-tied today and obviously your candy molds now a lot of you ask me how many candy is gum you will get out of a batch now it's all depending obviously on the size molds that you use if you use about this large size I got these from Michaels you will get about sixty if you use of this size gummy which is kind of a little bit larger than those big ones you're going to get it probably about 75 to 100 and if you use the little teeny tiny ones then you're going to get about 150 to 200 of them so that's approximately what that recipe will break down to you for you and now d'leh before we get started there is something very important that I found out from my other recipe when I started this is and I don't do this in the other recipes but when we're working with the can of sugar and the can of syrups it is a must that we oil down the sides and the insides of our pot for the candy syrup reason being when it heats up and starts boiling the oil THC oil starts to separate and it sticks to the smiths of the metal of the pot you might have noticed that if you did that with a can of syrup which is why I redid the video for that specific reason so we're going to do things a little bit differently than we do for the regular candy recipe but I'll show you all those details once we get into it but the very first thing and don't really don't want to forget is we're going to lightly grease our saucepan and hold on just couldn't dribble a little bit of oil into it and then make sure to work it all the way around make sure to get it right into the corners because anywhere that this oil is not where there's no oil your THC will sit the only thing that dissolves THC oil is oil because it is oil soluble by doing this we're going to be able to scrape anything that sticks to the sides off much much easier then seeing all your products that they're going oh what happened so you said you want to lightly grease that you don't want to have any excess oil so make sure to do that up as well as your spatulas you want to lightly oil your spatulas for the same reason when we scrape it off the sides if these are not oiled it sticks to it and it doesn't come off so you want to make sure anything that is going to be touching the THC the syrup you want to make sure that you all and that's it I'm gonna get into putting our ingredients together and get this started oh one other thing I wanted to cover is with your moles I don't spray my moles beforehand but I have found sometimes that they do stick but so what I do is I care them so I will spray them or oil them down lightly let it sit for 20 minutes in the mold and then wash them out so it still leaves that oily feel but it's not gonna leave your Piquet knees all greasy and makes it far easier for them to come as well as you only have to cure them once every few once every five or six batches or so so it lasts a long time by doing it that way all right so now I promise we'll get into the ingredients in our candy all righty so the very first thing that we are going to do is we are going to microwave our quarter cup of liquid for about 50 seconds till it's boiling and we're going to bloom our unflavored gelatin all right so you're going to evenly sprinkle your gelatin over the top of your liquid whether you use water or the kool-aid water and then you are going to stir it in now a lot of punches I explained in about whether that your gummies did not are not that they're too sticky but they're not gelatin enough that can depend a lot of power on your gelatin I just bought a batch of gelatin because I buy a bulb that didn't it wasn't blooming at the strength of it or something was not working well I did two batches and I had almost double the gelatin so a lot of it is dependent upon your gelatin now one test that I do is when I put in the three tablespoons and mix it in it should start very quickly to get the texture of apple sausage and clicking up pretty quickly now this is not so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add in another half a tablespoon of gelatin yes I've just sprinkled on another half a tablespoon and I'm gonna stir that in and now I'm getting that texture of applesauce can you kind of see what I mean that's how you know you're probably are at the great strength for your gelatin starting off if your gelatin is not right from the beginning if it's mushy I'll show you when we go to put this in but that's the texture it should be once you once we've got it mixed in now we're gonna set that aside for five minutes or so to let that bloom now meanwhile we will add our box of jell-o I'm giving the blueberries well berry blue and we are going to add in our boiling water and stir that around and get it dissolving see was it and then just keep scraping because the jello will cause the sides of the bowl are cool it's good to just kind of stick to it so just keep scraping the sides down as you go and turn your heat on to low so again we only want to melt our gelatin over a hot water bath we don't want it hot at boiling at all that's what breaks our gelatin a lot of the time is you don't even think that you've got it too hot but really past hot water probably by 150 degrees it is that's about all you need so that's that's a big mistake that a lot of people make myself included so I'm just going to continue to stir that gently until the gelatin is dissolved and then we will add in our corn syrup and our other stuff and once your gelatin and that has started to melt the sugar takes longer because the sugar melts at a higher at a bit of a higher heat so it just takes a little bit longer but once your gelatin and that is melted you can add in your corn syrup and your flavor crystals if you're wanting to add so you saw your canister your quarter cup of Kanna syrup and then your flavored juice crystals if you want to add those in as additional flavoring and again just stir that until it all starts gets incorporated and now for you guys asking for those clear gummies how do I get my gummies clear this well you can now you could have perfectly clear gummies so I'm gonna kick it continue to stir this and just gently mix it together until everything is melted and combined I'd you notice I got my nails done so for all of you those wishing that I get them done they're done and to those of you commented there you go I know I looked at the videos and thought make and those are ratty looking hands so I do apologize hopefully it'll be better from now on in the future I hope you like these a little bit better do you got a look at them for quite a long time so why not make them a little bit more attractive and also just remember to continually scrape down the sides of your bowl so that the gelatin is not sticking to the sides and just to show you this is just how hot your water should be there shouldn't be any boiling just a little bit of steam coming off of that that's as how that's as hard as you want to get it otherwise any hotter than that it's gonna break your gelatin alright so now that everything's pretty much dissolved I'm going to add in our gelatin now here's another thing if your gelatin is after 5 minutes or so blooming is mushy when you touch it then your gelatin is not strong enough so whether it's old and it's weakened or there are different gelatin with different strengths if it is nice and firm to the touch and no mushy you're good to go so I just split this up into pieces slap her in and you're just gonna let that you're just gonna gently again stir that until it completely melts and again if you start to see any kind of foaming may take it off your heat immediately it's getting too hot so I'm just gonna let them set them going to continue to stir that until my gelatin is fully melted well once your gelatin is melted and everything looks good and it is nice and translucent just set it off to the side and now we're going to start our candy syrup alright for our candy syrup in goes our half a cup of white sugar our half a cup of Candace Canon sugar our Candace syrup quarter cup a can of syrup like I said before you're more than welcome to play around with your different measurements on that as long as it equals 1/2 a cup either way it doesn't matter and our quarter cup of light corn syrup our half a cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to gently stir that till ever - your syrup till your sugar and water and everything's just combined and then once you're combined here turn your heat on to medium Cline to start and then we're going to drop it down to medium once it begins to boil and you're just going to continue stirring this make sure to get all around the edges because the sugar likes to sit there and so we're going to continue to stir this until it starts to boil now all of my and all the other candy recipes I say as soon as we start boiling we're gonna stop stirring and use our brush not in this recipe and I'll show you once it starts boiling as I said the oils yeah I got a little syrup on the burner there so the oils start to separate out with the heat and until it gets all to the same kind of temperature it will they will stick to the side so we're going to have to continually work the sides of the pot but you're going to want to be very very gentle because we don't want to spit dirt into the syrup so as I said I'll show that all to you once it gets there now you'll start to notice as as it's starting to heat up if you scrape the sides of your pot see all that that's your oil and that's what we want to make sure it gets back into our syrup so I usually have to use the two you want as I said you have to grease both spatulas here and work it off get it back into the syrup and we're gonna have to do this continuously through the whole cooking process so at anytime that you see any darkness starting to form on the side make sure to scrape it down and as your syrup gets hotter you can just put your spatula in it'll just melt it off and also make sure when you are scraping the sides of your pot hold on to the handle firmly I've done it before I wasn't paying attention and whoops and the last thing you want is molten lava being poured anywhere other keeping it in the pot so when your syrup begins to bubble starts boiling you're gonna touch your candy thermometer and remember this is normally where I say we stop stirring not this time so we're not actually going to stir it what we're gonna do is just to continually scrape around the sides of the pot but don't go deep into the syrup we just want to stay around the bubble area and you just want to keep pulling this in so this is the alcohol of the excess alcohol and stuff burning off and any impurities that are in it so see how it's gathering up on the sides that's what we want to make sure get them back into our syrup whatever is supposed to cook off will cook off whatever is good will stay in so again just gently don't go into the stirs syrup just gently keep going around the sides and you'll do behind the candy thermometer towards the end and we are going to cook our syrup - if you want a soft candy you're gonna cook it to 260 if you want a firm candy you can go as high as 280 280 is soft crack I'm gonna go to just before that I'm going to take this to 275 but you see what I mean about the oils how they just continue they'll keep going to the sides of the pot as it heats up and gets up to temperature it will it will the oils will get incorporated and once your syrup is boiling in that you want to just turn your heat down to medium just medium a little above medium I said then don't forget to get behind in behind the thermometer because it will hide in behind there I love the smell of this syrup cooking it's oh it smells so awesome oh and just as a tip for safety always have a fan either an overhead fan I've got one going or the if you've got an overhead on your stove regardless when you're ever working with tinctures even though you've working them in a dehydrated yeah most of it's cooked off some of them may not be and you just want on the safety side always have a fan going and leave don't be sparking anything up in the in the general area so you've had your gelatin sitting over on the side and you have a look and you've noticed that there's all this white inky foam stuff and you're sure positive that you didn't do it high on high heat the heat didn't get too hot that'll happen so nice if the gelatin is old and it's starting to break down so if you do see that in order to compensate for that bloom another tablespoon of unflavored gelatin and we're going to add it into the candy mixture at the end that's gonna help us compensate for the gelatin that's broken in our mixture here so that will help it so anytime that your candies come out super sticky and you can't get them out of the mold the reason is is because the gelatin is not gelling properly so there's a really handy tip there for you guys now in order to get that out because I don't want that in to go my syrup I'm gonna run this through a strainer before we put it into our syrup so now I might actually my syrup while I was babbling away there is getting close to temperature I've got my ice water ready to go and as soon as it hits temperature I'm gonna drop the bottom into the pot and once the temperature starts coming down and the cooking process is stopped I'm gonna set it to the side until the temperature comes down to 240 before we add our gelatin in just watch your thermometer till until the temperature starts coming down and your bubbles start stop bubbling and then just set it to the side and said until your temperature comes down to 240 all right so now my syrup is cooled and then it's say because I don't want that white foamy stuff into my syrup I'm going to use a strainer to pour it through that way it'll catch all the chunks of jell-o gelatin and being bad and I'm going to mix that in now I also what I did was I bloomed another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid and we're going to add that in a little bit in a little bit so right now you're going to stir your jello and your candy syrup until it is all combined and if you find that your syrup is a little too sticky and it's solidified you can put your heat on to minimum you just want to heat the bottom to get the syrup off the bottom now you can make sure that you do so that you scrape the sides and if you said if you find that it's too hard coming off turn your heat on and it'll eventually start to melt so you just want to want to keep doing that until everything is completely melted in all the same temperature all right so now that everything is all melted together and nicely mixed now this is a test that I do to determine whether my syrup is did a job correctly if I pull it up and you see how it just goes in a nice smooth syrup it doesn't really seem to start gelling or anything it stays in a fine line so that's kind of telling me that this is gonna turn out way too sticky it's gonna come out what's it like you can't get it out of the mold it's more candy than the gelatin that's what I said about my gelatin breaking there that I knew that was gonna happen so I've added it I'm gonna add in the additional gelatin that I bloomed and I'm just gonna stir that until it's completely dissolved so now if you want your syrup just translucent that nice clear there you go you've got it you can go ahead and put it into your bottles your squirt bottles or use the little eye droppers for dispensing into your molds but however I never like to keep things plain so I'm gonna do half-and-half or I've got translucent and solid and also just to give you a look to see how to go about doing that all right so now when after adding the additional gelatin in now when I do my test you'll see it's thicker and it'll start to split up and almost solidify in midair so that's how you know it's likely going to set correctly I still had to not do things correctly that's occasionally but that is a very good indication that you're safe and good to go so if you wanted translucent go ahead and put it into your bottles at this point or use your eye dropper dispensers or whatever it is that you get it into your moles however I of course need to always get fancy so I'm gonna split this into two colors so I've got half of it translucent and half of it of the solid blue whoops all right so I'm just gonna eyeball this here if you want to be exact you can pour it into a measuring cup and split it exactly however I've been doing this from this pot for quite a while so I'm pretty good at it sometimes so because I mix the blue with the green because obviously the green from our can of syrup and our sugar so it's turned out a little bit greenish and I actually want this to be blue so I'm going to add in a little bit of blue color and then on 1/2 I'm going to add in white so this one I'm mixing in a few drops of blue you can use any kind of food coloring the gel base oil-based water base for this for this particular candy recipe does not matter so we're just gonna get that stirred in oh that's a pretty color you see it on the white that's nice that's a nice kind of teal color then in my other half I'm gonna pour in some of the blue the same kind of teal but this is gonna give me the solid background as the white now if you guys have white on hand make sure that you shake it really really well if it's hot it sitting for a while it does separate and you will find that if you pour it in you're gonna get a little tiny white it doesn't go well you get little white lumps or something like that it just doesn't blend really nicely so make sure to shake it really really well you can almost hear it come back together it's like you can almost hear the water at the top and then all kind of comes together and sounds a little bit thicker so I'm gonna pour a little bit of that in isn't that pretty so again you're just gonna thoroughly mix that in until it is one complete uniform color and once I've got that i'll get it into my bottles and we'll get this into the mold there's a little trick i learned the other day find it by Occident that's on most things happen so I'm if you want to have a half and half candy where you've got the clear on the bottom and the solid on the top what you can do to easily make that happen is use your hand blender on this we whip a bunch of air into it and once you put them together the air is all I'm automatically gonna bring the solid color up to the top or if you want to do that with the if you want it the other way around then air Rach you're clear but you're gonna have to wait a while for the bubbles to come out because that's gonna make it not so clear so I recommend just putting the solid on the back you can do that it's just a quick way of doing it otherwise you have to pour one layer let it set a little bit and then pour your second layer well aren't I just a cesspool of useless information today I'm just gonna pour this into my squirt bottle this should make a full almost a full bottle or a little bit more see bang almost right on now if you guys have to haven't seen these before these are the best squirt bottles ever they just make putting it into the mould so much easier especially if you want to blend colors absolutely highly recommend these I've got there's a link for them in the description there for you to make it easy if you'd like to order them and I'm just gonna do my clear and we'll get this going all right so I said I always do two colors I always like doing that so I did combination I'll either just whoosh or if you want to happen half you can do it that way you can go this way freestyle whatever you like and that's it get them all into your mold and you're gonna put them in the fridge for a minimum of two to four hours sometimes they've got to go overnight now if you let them go overnight and they're still sticking you can't get them out of the mold put them into the freezer for a few hours let them freeze up take one mold out of it I'd add out at a time and pop them out as quickly as possible if they still if there's still stop the first you'll come out if it starts to stick throw it back in the freezer work on another mold put them into a double boiler melt them down on low heat and add another tablespoon of gelatin melt it and recast them and that will fix that problem for you and that's it enough I'll come back low will pop these out so you can have a look at them and I'll show you how to sugarcoat them not that sugarcoating is that difficult but you can coat them with the can of sugar and just show you an easy way of doing it and that'll be it will say goodbye candies upset and you can do this in a bowl or I found that doing them in a large plastic bag worked a lot easier so in this I put a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar and I put a quarter part about a quarter cup of the flavored drink crystals that I used in my recipe again the drink crystals are totally optional for you just adds that little bit extra flavor and then I added about a half a teaspoon of citric acid because I wanted these to be a little bit more on this our side if you just want to have just a little bit of a tick bite but not really sour at all I add a quarter teaspoon so I'll do those two my sweet ones and then to the sour I use a 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid I don't recommend using much more than that one it's not going to the sour flavor isn't that great and it can also melt your candies because citric acid acid is water soluble so simple enough you can actually see it oh and I also have sorry a wire a wire rack with parts line o parchment paper line line on top of it for them to dry so I just pop them out these guys are popping out nicely and I get and what I do is I do one mold at a time so I leave the rest of them in the fridge because otherwise they start to warm up and they can makes it difficult sometimes for them to come out of the mall so I just think about one at a time and once I get them on the bag I go a little bit there and I just fish them out and shake off the excess sugar and we just lay them out to dry here just like all our other candies this is just a slightly smaller mold that I use same thing now see sometimes you'll do that and you'll see you think oh no they're not gonna come out they're stuck just pull the edges away and then they just they'll just come right out now if you do that and it doesn't come out that's when you would put them into the freezer so again you see that just around the edges to pull it away and they're good to go and that's about it I'm just gonna go through and sugarcoat the rest of these guys and then I'll be back to say goodbye well guys that's my little demo there on your cannon Candace Eric and sugar gummy bears I hope you enjoyed the demo as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to ask and thank you guys so much again for your support and let's get to the 50,000 whoo all right so you have an awesome rest of your day and

here we actually made it to the bottom [Applause] [Music]", "jue061V45HI": "so we have another candy that goes back quite a way i don't have much of a history on it but anyways i remember when i was a kid i used to have um this kind of type of uh thing it is popeye candy sticks so these are now called candy sticks when i was a kid these are called candy cigarettes and growing up in the 80s we still had candy cigarettes now the candy cigarettes i thought were weird because the reason why i thought they were weird was simply because i couldn't figure out well i knew it was a candy cigarette but did they really have to put the paper on around the chocolate do i really have to unwrap every single cigarette to get to the chocolate i thought it was annoying i like the chocolate but i didn't want to unwrap it to get to the chocolate a couple times i tried to eat the paper and i thought well this is dumb you know i don't want to do that there were these like cigarettes that kind of resembled camel cigarette packaging with like i don't know palm trees on this stuff i forget what they were called and i thought this is too much trouble you know i'm not gonna get candy cigarettes for the sake of chocolate i'll just get a chocolate bar or a bag of chips or something and that's what i did but anyways there was also the popeye candy cigarettes and they were common around halloween and we used to get those in our halloween bags as well we were okay with that they weren't chocolate or anything we would pretend we were smoking and all that kind of stuff and and then of course at school we would hear about the dangers of smoking i'm not a smoker i never took up the habit i tried it once and i choked on like i'm not gonna do it [Music] oop i pour the bag that's okay reach into the bag pull out one [Music] i see the packaging has never changed [Music] i'm going to open this up and have a little trip down memory lane i feel like i'm again walking to school and [Music] here is your candy stick it looks like a lollipop stick except you can eat it so yeah here is your candy stick it kind of looks like a hand roll cigarette but it doesn't have the the lit end anymore because now it's just the candy stick so anyways let's have some [Music] that's still as snappy crunchy as usual tastes like sugar not much to it what kind of flavor is this it's a nothing flavor it's just a sweet artificial flavors you know what it tastes like it just tastes like a stick of sugar oh yeah still a snappy as usual maybe these candy sticks can be like retired finally maybe the time of this candy cigarette stuff it's done so anyways do i recommend this as a candy and not really thank you for watching another artificially flavored video and i'll see you next time [Music] you", "NAb7z78N2UA": "[Music] hi everyone well welcome to diamond delight animals if this is the first time you're joining my name is Liz and the rest of subscribers guys welcome back and thank you so much I just passed the 10,000 market oh my god I am so excited I can't believe it you like me you really really like me just kidding anyway guys couldn't have done any of that without you I really do appreciate your support and all your awesome comments and everything I really do from the bottom of my heart absolutely love you so for our today what I'm going to show you guys is quite a few things that you can do with your tincture and as well as I'm going to show you a couple of different ways that we are going to do kin of flowers so you can do can of flower with your plant material or you can do it with tincture and the and other than that I'm going to show you some different ways of doing it so tincture like I said I kind of avoided it for a really long time for one how long it takes to make however with the magic butter machine four hours giddyup so I've kind of switched over to using that because I absolutely love it because you can make do so much with it so for example like the can of sugar that weed that I had in my previous video that I did that I showed you but how to do that well you can do that with almost any of your baking and baking and cooking products so I'm going to show you like I said today how we're gonna do flour you can do it with texture or with but I'll show you both ways to do that you can also would tincture the same way that we're going to do the dehydrated version you can do powdered sugar the other way you can do powdered sugar is from your can of sugar and I'll explain that to you when I get to the powdered sugar section you can do things like infuse your drink crystals your cocoa or your hot chocolate mix your cocoa for baking you could also do if you box recipes you could do your cake or your brownies or any of your cookie things like that you could pre infuse them there with your tincture and just dehydrate it and then you've got it right in there as well you can calculate your dosing a lot better I've put a link in for put a link in the description there for you guys of the calculator that I use I find it really good it is a free subscription to sign up you don't have to pay anything at all and as I said that's what I use so that's what you can use and you can figure out exactly how strong or how weak you want to make things as well as being able to do this you can now make have a combination of your products so you can use I can sugar can't syrup that's what I'm going to show you to how to do Candice Candice syrup I'm redoing that for one particular reason I'll get into the details that when I when we get to the can of syrup also how to do simple syrup which is the same pretty much the same as your can of syrup and yeah so I'm gonna go over all those things if there's only one particular thing that you're interested in I'm gonna have up for you those spots on the video so that you could just easily skip to that if you'd like and to those who wished I've got my nails done and to those of you commented yes I got my nails done and I know they looked really ratty I'd look at the video and like oh my god they look terrible so yeah they're done so what I'm gonna do is I'm we're first part we're going to get into the different ingredients that we need for the different recipes we're going to do the equipment that we're going to need and then put all this kind of stuff together so now with our can of flour with texture what I'm going to using is 2 cups of flour 1/4 cup of my tincture and you are going to need what I found is work best is a nonstick oven tray or baking cookie sheet works perks better I found that the gloss even though if I use oil I still found that a lot of the stuff is sticking a lot of your teach these stuff is sticking to it and very very difficult to get off so I've experimented with a few different things and this has worked best you will need a non not nonstick cooking spray or you could just use regular olive oil or any type of cooking oil we're just going to very lightly grease this pan and that's all you need for the for our tincture version and want to pre-heat your oven to 200 degrees Fahrenheit so you want to get that started and we will get our flowers going all right so the very first thing we're going to do is to grease our pan and we just said we're going to very lightly do this and the reason being is the oil the THC oil does separate out can separate out and when it does is it will automatically stick to the metal and once it does that it doesn't come away unless you use another oil because THC is oil soluble so the only way to get it away is to use another oil so that's why I found lining the pans works great so I'm not going to give it a light spray anyway back down or the other if you're using oil just give it a very light drizzle couple little drops like so and just make sure to get it all over the pan make sure to get it up the sides and in the corners cause anywhere that you don't have it'll stick but we just want to set the pan just very lightly coated because we don't want oil in that in our in our base product so we've got that ready to go my oven is preheating so we're just going to add our texture into our flour like so and you're just going to stir it in until it all gets mixed together and you might need to use your hands that's what I like to do I just like to get my hands in here and just work it through and you'll just continue to do that until your tincture is all nicely worked through your flour once you've got it mixed in there just put it in in your pan or your cookie sheet I like using a pan better so because you got to keep kind of moving in and around and on the cookie sheet I find you lot flights off out of the bottom and it's just more mess you got to clean up and I'm all about not cleaning up messes I'm really good at making them I don't really like cleaning them then once you've got your flour in the pan you just want to score it so you can either just use your spatula or if you've got a straight edge scraper you can just use that so you want to make these little lines through it why I'm doing this as it helps the air the hot air go through it helps it hydrate a little bit quicker and a little more even so once you've got that done you're going to pop it it o really important thing you come let me say really important thing you want to run a fan either a handstand fan or if you've got a ceiling fan get that running again because you got you've got alcohol that's gonna be evaporating and don't don't light up anything in the kitchen okay safety first there we go got my fan going my ovens preheated of course I've got something alright then you're just gonna pop it in the oven on the middle shelf or the top rock doesn't really matter and you're going to leave the oven door ajar so if your oven door up doors will close stay open - they're great if not put something in there to keep the oven door open because you want the air to circulate it's gonna help dry out help your dehydrating process as well as the fumes not accumulating all in your oven which could cause a boom and we don't want that alright so get your faith make sure your fan is always going and we'll check on this about every 10-15 minutes we're going to move it around to make sure that it all dries evenly all right now while that's dehydrating we'll get into the can of flour with the herb now for our can of flour with our herb very first thing you're going to do is we're going to grind up our herb super super fine so that herb brothers work the best and when you want to take out the stem so just remove your plant material from the stem take the stems out reason being is because they won't they don't grind up really fine and we want to make this legal we want to make this a flower and that's all flour is superfine ground-up wheat so we're just gonna do the same thing with this [Music] wow that's some superfine grind there there you go so you're gonna dump this into your flower get a brush to get all the x-ray I don't have one right now have you got a brush handy grab a brush I thought my brush they want to make sure to get all of that out and now because we want to get our plant material evenly distributed through our flower this is why we're going to we need the sifter or the fine strainer so you're going to put this drop your flower in the plant material into your strainer or your strainer and just gently work it through and you're just going to continue to do that until all of that goes through if you're having trouble you can always just use a spatula and work it through just keep moving it around eventually it'll all go through and you're gonna do this at least two or three times this way we'll make sure that everything is well mixed together and kind of evenly distributed all right so I switched out my strainer because my other one was a little too fine mesh the flower was having too hard of a time going through I love the one that had a little bit of a wider mesh oh that was my first run this is gonna be my second run that comes through a lot better wait here I'm gonna go and there you have it have a look at your flower and you'll you'll see make sure that it just looks all nice and even that you don't see kind of any patches of anything once that all looks good you can go ahead and store your flower in a glass mason jar or any airtight container and use it as you will for your baking recipes just bigger quantities would be exactly the same now you've got your you've got now your infused flower as well as you can also use your butters and can oils so again you can it gives you far more flexibility on how strong or how weak you want to make your products alright so now we're going to check in on our our tincture flower so it is starting to dehydrate it's kind of sticking together there not a problem you're gonna get your scraper or your spatula and you're just going to move that around and break it up and that's it just keep doing that until we are completely dry so this will take anywhere depending on how much you're doing probably both up to an hour forty minutes to an hour to a couple of hours I've set depending on how much you're making so you just keep doing that to keep checking on it everybody every 20 minutes or so keep breaking it up mixing it up and continue doing that until it's fully dried and back to the other all right so you take your flower out you think it's dry you moved it around feels pretty good but there's lots of little lots of little balls a little chunks that aren't breaking down so what we want to do is we want to make sure that those get broken down and evenly mixed in there so what we're going to do is we're going to put our flour in through our strainer and you're going to sift it through and we're going to catch all those hard little balls does that just continue to sift that through until the flour gets through and the little balls and stuff get caught up here at the top and then what we're going to do is we're going to put them into our blender or ninja or magic bullet or whatever that you've got as a grinding machine and we're going to grind those all up without them in and then we're gonna put this back in the oven because I'm finished drying because those little balls will be holding on to moisture all right so see you there I got all those they're left I'm going to throw those into my this model until the Magic Bullet container or thingamajigger flower I'm just gonna pop the lid on and run them through the Magic Bullet until it's till they're all flying I ended up or grinded up my little flower there and I'm gonna sip that through again any other hard balls we're gonna pull out and wreak right down just keep doing that until you don't have any any of those any more and we'll finish dehydrating that all right so I'm just gonna put it back into my can put it back in the oven and fit it and complete do you finish dehydrating that so probably another 20 minutes 15 minutes or so I don't know until it's dry how does that sound whoa check it out turn the camera around now you can actually see me and what I'm doing only 30 some-odd videos took me to figure that one out not sometimes cute but not too bright anyhow once your flower is completely dried you can run it through your grinder for one final one final go but if it feels all nice and perfectly nice and silky smooth and then you're good to go you can store it in however you like to store your flower or is a pluck baggie or any type of airtight container you're good to go all right now next we're icing sugar alright so for icing sugar you've got two ways that you can do this your one way is the dehydrating the exact same method as you just did the flour with the texture now for the for the powdered sugar what I did was one cup of one cup of powdered sugar to two tablespoons of tincture and I added one tablespoon at a time mixed it thoroughly with my hands just like I did in the flour and then I did the second tablespoon you can try to maybe out a third but I'd be careful cuz it's gonna get a little bit pasty and just gonna have to dry it out longer but you can probably do more I'm just gonna go with the two tablespoons right now you're gonna pop it in the oven and I'm gonna say drop this about a little bit lower do it to 175 and the exact same method every 10 and 20 minutes move it around and break up any big chunks and continue until that's completely dry now the other method that way you can do it is take a cup of your rate of the candidate sugar that you've made use 1 cup add it to a grinder a coffee grinder or your herb grinder would work the best that's going to give us you give you your finest grind I found like the ninjas or the the blender type thingies that make smoothies there they don't give you quite as fine of a grind and I don't have a coffee grinder so I'm not actually going to do the whole demonstration for you but it is one cup of your can of sugar to one tablespoon of cornstarch that's it put it in the grinder and still look super super flying like your powdered sugar and store again a ziploc or airtight container alright so last but not least and we're going to do our simple syrup and Arkana syrup and your simple syrup you would use in in alcoholic drinks or smoothies milkshakes anything like that you can also use it for making fruit salad a whole bunch of things anything that would call for simple syrup you can you can use that in and the other is your can of syrup which is glucose syrup also known as inverted sugar and it is a direct replacement for like corn syrup so I'm going to show you how to make that now your simple the your simple and the regular syrup is exactly the same the only difference is temperatures that you're cooking so there are two types of simple syrup there is the type that you kind of you're probably used to at the bar it's very watery it seems very watery that is a one to one ratio meaning one cup of sugar - 1 cup of water now the other type that I'm going to be doing is a two-to-one ratio and that is a two cups of your sugar - 1 cup of water and for my candor recipe I'm going to use 1 cup of canned sugar and 1 cup of regular sugar - 1 cup of water and 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid and as I said the only difference is in what you how you cook it simple syrup you're just going to bring it to a boil once everything is dissolved you're gonna pull it from the heat we'll let it cool to room temperature the cannister of you are going to cook to 234 degrees and and that's going to give us a much thicker syrup and the longer that you cook it the thicker it's going to get however you do not want to go over to 40 otherwise you're gonna have syrup that you cannot work with all right so I'm just going to quickly get into our equipment and tools that we need and we'll get started all right so we are going to need if you're doing the two cups you're gonna need a medium saucepan if you're doing one cup then you just use a smaller saucepan you're going to need your candy thermometer if you're making the glucose syrup you do not need it if you are making the simple syrup you're going to need a spatula and the lid for your pot that fits if you can't find the lids up its find one that's slightly bit bigger and just turn it upside down that works too alright that's it for what we need let's get started all righty so the reason I decided to I'm redoing the cannister up if you may have seen the other one if there was one very important step that I did not initially do because I didn't realize I needed to so when I was making it I noticed that as it heated up the THC oil would be separating and it started to stick around the sides of the pot and it wasn't coming off and I'm like oh that's an awful lot of product being stuck there that you can't get off so what is THC soluble with oil that's right so it is very important that we oil line our pan you just want to make it very light coating and cover the entire pan as well as your spatula or any tools that you are going to be using with your syrup so you don't want to leave any excess oil or anything in there you just want the pan lightly coated all over like so I'm gonna do the same with my spatula same thing when we're getting me um oil off the sides there it will stick to the spatula but then it won't come off the spatula so again we want to oil anything that's going to come in contact with with our syrup now we are going to add in our one cup of can of syrup or one cup of white sugar or half a teaspoon of citric acid or a cup of water and we are going to mix this together and then we are going to put it on our stove on medium high I'm going to turn my heat there on so as I said medium-high and I'm going to continue stirring this now now usually my candy syrups you guys I always say as soon as it starts boiling to stop stirring however we're going to have to do this a little bit differently like I said as it heats up the THC oil starts to separate and sticks to the sides of pot and we don't want that so in order to prevent that or to make sure that it actually gets into our syrup is we're gonna have to constantly be gently scraping the side all the way around the side of our pot so see that that's come off we want that in our syrup that's the good stuff so just get it take it off the sides and just melt it into the syrup and we're going to continue to do this pretty much all the way through the cooking process now towards the end of it it does kind of settle down and kind of go in but I said you'll see the whole process here so see all that to get stuck to the side so that's why I wanted to redo this redo this particular video for that reason it was like oh my gosh that is not good so I'm going to continue to stir that and clean down the sides until it starts boiling again just keep continually well not continually but every couple minute or so scrape the side gently now as it begins to boil you're gonna you're gonna happen add on your candy thermometer and now because we're making an inverted sugar which is a saturated solution I don't know if you remember your science class however it is very delicate so we are not supposed to stir this once it starts boiling however we do have to continue to kind of work those sides so what you're gonna do is just very gently right kind of at the top of the bubble line just work it from there you don't really want to get your spoon into the syrup and you're just going to gently continue to work like that and pull the stuff in and any impurities will quill will cook off and will leave all our yummy stuff but again like I said it will continue to stick to the sides for a while until it gets to temperature and then it all starts to blend in nicely and like I said we're gonna cook this to 234 degrees Fahrenheit and sorry and once it sorry like once it also starts boiling turn your heat down to medium just a little bit about to the higher side so if you got numbers it would be around the six mark I don't like saying it so medium yeah you know what I'm talking about so it's that I'm gonna continue to very gently just at the top of the syrup line and the reason I said is you don't want to cause any kind of major agitation because that can cause your syrup to crystallize then also don't forget behind the thermometer very gently pick it up move it get to cleaning very gently again behind it see how much stuff was there and move it back and just try working very very gently I'm kind of we're kind of going against the rules of doing inverted sugar here by doing this now sorry if you were doing simple syrup it's that kind of said this before you would have pulled it a while ago so once it was boiling and started to get clear you would pull it you could actually at this point pull it so say about 208 210 degrees or so you can pull off that that would be your simple syrup and just you would put the pan on the back of the burner and just let it sit there until it reaches room temperature once it reaches room temperature it is ready to go you can transfer it to a bottle or another container or just leave it in the pot alright so I'm almost that's a 234 so I'm just gonna make sure to do my final click scrape down here minute I hit 234 I'm going to remove the candy thermometer put the lid on it and put it on the back burner until it reaches room temperature and I'm not gonna touch it again put the lid on it and that's it so as I said it's very important not to touch it until it hits temperature all right so you're just gonna let your symbols odd not your simple syrup your can of syrup and your simple syrup if you did both of them you're gonna let them sit until they get to room temperature once I said to get rid to room temperature you can go ahead and use them right away if you want to transfer them to another container storage container and then make sure that it is very well washed sterilized any particle dust particle hair anything at all will can crystallize your can of syrup the simple syrup not as much it's not as delicate but your can is syrup absolutely I don't generally recommend using plastic containers however if you do want to use plastic try to use a brand new one that you've never used obviously that's brand new such a don't be sometimes but yeah so just don't use one that's brand new and that way you won't have to worry about any kind of cross-contamination but other than that I'm gonna show you the syrup once it's cooled and I'll be back to say goodbye and here is our corn syrup so I'm just going to transfer it over to this bowl you want to be very gentle do not use a metal spoon a wooden spoon or rubber spatula only and said the reason that you want to be very gentle is because if you educate it too much or too rough with it it will crystallize so guys that was my demonstration for Ken flowers simple syrup canna syrup and your powdered sugar I hope you enjoyed that a lot of information there for you but it's all along the same lines and now it's great because now you've got all of the bases for your baking and cooking so you not just stuck now with butter you've got a variety of being able to use base ingredients right in your cooking and baking so now it's really easy for you to take your own favorite recipes that you like to do maybe you've got a grandma's chocolate chip cookie recipe now he's very easy go ahead use your can of flour and your butter sugar as usual and yeah let me know how your recipes turn out I'd love I love hearing when things turn out I definitely of hearing when you do have a problem as well so that I could try and help you fix that and I think that is all I have for you today I do hope that you subscribe there's going to be tons more stuff coming in the future and yeah that's about all I got to say for you today thanks again for watching I really appreciate it have an awesome day [Music]", "DG5uZ0zxXBs": "when you bring it edible back from vegas and your whole arm and body just feel heavy and when you hearing [ __ ] in your ear don't ever underestimate don't ever ask me edible", "DjAMkUTokwg": "[Music] hi guys welcome to dime delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you stopped by and for the rest of you guys welcome back thank you so much I really appreciate all your support and everything and because you guys are so awesome and subscribe to my channel I'm able to reach out to companies and request things that they would like me to demonstrate and review their products and well low and behold they're saying yes so today I'm going to be demonstrating for you the butter brewer and this is something machine that you may not have heard of before because it's um you name is not really you don't see it much out there so that's one thing where I think the company likes is this name should be being able to should be seen and being talked about a lot more than what it is so the couple nice features with this with this machine is that it does do larger quantities than most machines it does one to eight cups which is really nice the method or the technology and what it uses is a gentle stir and you can set your intervals and times of your stirring you can customize that I get more into the details about that but it is a nice gentle stir so you are not pulverizing your plant material releasing a whole bunch of chlorophyll and the yucky stuff that makes your butter not taste so nice so this is supposed to give you a much nicer pure cleaner infusion so we'll find out alright so that's about really all I'm gonna say about that let's jump right into our demonstration and then you get to hear my overall results alright guys thanks so much for joining all right guys so you ready to check out this machine me so here's the machine itself it is fairly large however it does do up to eight cups so it doesn't need to be larger and it does a minimum of one cup which is nice so that's great versatility one to eight cups I like that comes with the blade now this is not a sharp plate it is just a stirring blade so it is not going to polymerize your plant material releasing all that chlorophyll comes with a rubber spatula today and it comes with a very large well look at that and it comes with a very large strainer bag so it's it's quite large it is in comparison to the ones that you get with a lot of the other machines in bousley see and the mesh on it also looks a lot finer and then it also comes with the with a little instruction manual here that gives you all your basic instructions on on how to use the Machine your machine function default to temperatures for your butter oil and glycerin or a sort of tincture and when they talk about t-shirt they're talking about glycerin not alcohol and yes you can use alcohol in this machine I did check with the makers however if you do please make sure that you are in a very you have a fan going in it is very well then to nated okay so but other than that unfortunately there are no recipes or anything in the book I mean either it does give you again your basic recipes for your oil your butter and your texture but other than that there's not a whole lot of additional information available in the book or anything else that it comes with and that's everything that actually comes with the machine now you can purchase additional bags of these and an additional stainless steel pot if you like so again if you do things on large quantity might be something you want to consider so you can de carb\u00f3n have one cooling D carb or starting your other one whatever kind of nice having that off having two pots and for the machine itself I'm gonna bring the camera in here a little bit closer to have a closer look all right hold it's gonna come up clear in the video for you hope it's big enough so here's your on and off button you've got your temperature and your time button wow whether you want to do butter t-shirt oil oil or DIY so what's super nice about this is everything is customizable even your mixing intervals and you're mixing duration so there are presets for your butter your tincture in your oil you can adjust those up or down any way you want you can also change your mixing and you're mixing intervals and how long it will mix during your infusion so you have 100% full customizing which is really really nice and then these are your two buttons that you are for changing so for example if I wanted to select butter it gives me a preset of two hours for the temperature for the time and for the temperature it gives me a preset of 160 so if I wanted to change that temperature whatever five degrees oh I'm going down so it goes up in 5 degree into intervals which I would kind of like to prefer to see individual increments but 5s are not too bad anyway so that goes that and as well if you want to change your temperature or sort of your time if you want to make it longer longer shorter yeah if you want to if you want on now the nice thing also is you can D card and do your infusion in the same in the same machine which is really sweet so for doing D carb the iy you would select your time and your temperature and your mixing duration and the intervals but I'm going to show you exactly what that is because we're gonna make a batch of butter and then the lid you've got the lid that comes up pot that comes out it's a stainless steel sorry this is a nonstick pot the one that you can purchase additionally as a stainless steel that sits in there and then the blade which I seem to have lost up there it is and then your blade just slides in and twist and there you go close up your machine and the blade does sit really close close to the bottom which is nice so you can easily do that one cup of butter without any problems and then while your machine is in use your handle should be to one side or the other because there is a steam outlet here which is nice so it lets out steam so you don't have condensation building up inside your pot with the heat releasing more chlorophyll and and then there is this little plastic thing back here which doesn't tell me in the instructions what it's for but so I'm not exactly sure I guess we'll find out I'm guessing some kind of Oliver fill or sometimes a collecting thing for cleaning and then for cleaning these are hand wash and the only thing that you got put into the dishwasher would be your silicon spatula and your bed you can put those into the dishwasher so that's everything they're both the machine that I can think of here oh and it also it's got the on and off and it does also have your start and cancel button so you can cancel if you selected something wrong there we go okay so the first step that we're going to do is 2d carbon material so I'm doing about one and a half cups of butter I've got 10 grams of my plant material and here is about what it's going to equal out in milligrams since you guys always ask here it is I've got the tallies for you so the first thing that you want to do is you want to break up your material and you don't want it you don't have to go crazy but you do just want to break it up somewhat so there we go goes in close DIY so a standard D carving is 240 is 240 at 40 minutes however in the instruction manual it gives it gives us a key card suggestion of 235 for 30 minutes so I'm actually going to go with that the standard usually is 240 at 40 minutes but that's in a large oven and all that other space this is a smaller plus you're going to have the blade that's going to be stirring in a ram giving it a far more better heat distribution for our herbs for activating so I am going to set this to DIY which I think I said I did already so going it to temperature first I'm going to go to 235 and my time I'm going for 35 minutes and I owe the intervals mix intervals let me just sorry quickly see what it says for that I forgot mix duration of 1 minute and mix intervals set to 5 minutes so mix intervals 5 and mix duration 1 ok and then we hit start so it's starting up here and the blade is going round and round I'm going to actually bring the camera so you can see it so you can see the blade gently stirs it around while it's doing its d card all right so well while we're d carving i am going to clarify my butter and what clarifying your butter is is removing the milk fats the less of things so we're gonna get us alright so while we're de carb\u00f3n i am going to clarify our butter and why it's really important to do this step is for the following reasons when you clarify your butter you're removing all the milk fats and the impurities in the lecithin etc leaving yourself a pure butter oil this is going to increase the THC absorption as well as giving you a cleaner nicer taste and as well as it increases the smoke point of your butter and what that means is it can go to a higher temperature if so it actually increases it by a hundred degrees so if you've not sure what that means if you've ever taken a frying pan to make eggs got a little hot put the butter in and it pretty much instantly burns that's because butter has a very low smoke point by clarifying it you increase it by a hundred degrees again you're not gonna burn your butter and things like that when you're cooking so that's why it's important to take that step to do the clarifying so what we do is you just put your butter chop it up put it into a pot set your heat to medium-low and you always want to do this on medium on low medium low you don't want it to boil we just want it to simmer so it cooks the stuff off you'll see so I'm just gonna let that sit there and stare every once in a while and just wait till that completely melts and you're gonna want a small strainer you don't have a small string or a large what we do doesn't matter Fung Jim strainer and a bowl or something that you can next throw out the excess the icky stuff we're gonna throw into the bowl over here well my butter is just melting away here all right so see this is the color of our butter is it's all melted it's like a solid it's opaque is not a fancy word so it's a little bit it's okay moving board so it's opaque and so what's gonna happen now has it closed on the heat all of that stuff is going to rise up to the top and we're gonna skim that off as it does it does that I just gently stir you can just let it simmer for a few minutes on check on it don't don't just walk away and forget about it the whole process does take about 25 to 40 minutes depending on how much better you are clarifying and so so we're just gonna let this go for a couple of minutes and then I'll show you about the skimming good let's give it an 8 step off so as the stuff right on cooks off and rises to the top here take your strainer and scoop it off straighten out your butter oil that we can leave and scoop out the icky stuff all right so what you can do is once you initial take you initial if you stopped off it you can just let it go for about 2500 cent 25 to 30 minutes but you want to come back and check it periodically just give it a little stir if you get more build up on the top just scoop it off but pretty much now is just going to cook off those on the milk solids and whatever else is in butter the lecithin and cetera and we're going to be left with a completely clear butter oil that's how you know it's done all right once your butter oil now is completely clear you'll stop a little bit foamies on top here not a big deal and there's gonna be some milk fat stuck to the bottom of the pan again not a big deal you don't want to disturb those because that's the stuff coming up at the top here so now we're just going to use our strainer and strain or off here we go and so this is what's kind of hard to be left on the bottom of your pan those are the milk solids you don't want to make sure not to go too long because you're gonna roast your butter and you don't really want to do that unless you want ghee and now looking through our butter that beautiful nice and clear ready to go and our D curve is almost done five minutes to go on that those of you who want to know if there is smell while activating yes there is so one thing that you can always do is smell it's an issue for you one thing don't ever put them outside especially machines like these or any machine that has a temperature in it because if you put it outside and it's cold outside what will happen is your machine will never get to proper temperature because it's gonna be too cold cuz they're automatic thermometers so what happens is is I will just continue to heat up and heat up heat up heat up one is gonna break your machine as well it's going to burn your product and nobody wants that second of all so the way that your easy way that you can cover up the smell if that is an issue or you fry some bacon and onions that will cover it up for a good couple hours no problem all right so we'll get this we all come when this is done here in four minutes and we'll cool her off and then will Allah make our infusion alright Rd carving is almost done so once your cycles done it does give you a beep to let you know and it's not a real annoying beeper goes on for any length of time so now I am going to lift my lid and I'm going to tool just cover it up with tinfoil now the one thing I would have liked to have seen this come with is a lid so while we're cooling for its price you really can't okay so the inside pod is really hot be careful I'm just gonna cover that up I am going to let that completely cool because you should always let your d card completely cool and you can put it into the fridge to speed up the process and I'll be back and start our infusion ba-ba-boom all right so my my herb is nice and cool I'm gonna put the pot back in here a dinner look at in my clarified butter that's what I'm adding about one and a half cups you can do as little as one cup to a maximum of eight cups and 4-d carving you candy cart up to about four ounces so that is quite a lot more than your than the other machines out there alright close the lid alright so my butter and everything's in there I'm gonna turn the machine on I'm gonna select butter so the time that it has the preset for the butter is two hours the temperature is set to 160 so again if I wanted to adjust either of those I can do that right now and the mix duration it's gonna go for one minute each time alright so I'm happy with I'm going to stick with the presets to try that out and I'm gonna hit start and noise why's there is virtually zero noise can you hear anything no that's nice and so let's have a closer look so you can see what it's doing I do apologize for the reflections and stuff in my kitchen so you can see how gently moves it around just stirring so that the oil is just able to move nicely through your herbs and things and not extracting all that chlorophyll so we should end up with a really nice clean infusion so one thing that I can't do which would be nice to see maybe in a future model was is you cannot adjust the time and temperature once you've started your process so if you decided you want it to increase the temperature or to decrease it you would have to stop it and start again calculate your time or whatever and you can easily just do that but you can't change it whilst in process alright so we'll be back in just about two hours here and we'll check out how infusion comes out oh and one thing I know that pretty much all the recipes for doing butter regardless of the machine that you use or if you do with crock pot or whatever all say to put lecithin in whilst you're doing it I however do not recommend doing that and the reason is lecithin as we know is an emulsifier which will bind your water to your oil so one if you're doing the crock-pot method and you're using water you're actually gonna end up with a waterlogged a little bit of butter infusion there because it is going to trap it hold on to some of that water as well as in the end machines again if as well as in machines as they heat up the moisture condensation builds up and moisture and again that can get trapped into your butter and you don't really want that so if you do want to use lecithin I recommend putting it in after your infusion is done and then use a hand blender to really emulsify it nicely that way like as I said you're not going to be trapping in anything that you don't want to mealy water so our infusion is almost done one minute to go okay apparently not so our infusion is done here looks good smells good okay so what I just did here just to make things easier to the bag I use a strainer set it on my bowl and then set the bag into the strainer so that way you've got something to hold on to while you're pouring pick up the hand only be helpful scooter although now what I just usually uses a potato masher just to squish it out there we have it it is a nice looking into confusion not that you can see it in the bowl so I'm gonna pour it into this cup here and check this out look how nice that is so as you can see very little chlorophyll gets into your infusion smells really good again no Clark no way no heavy plant or chlorophyll smell all in all so unfortunately said without having a test getting having a test kit I'm actually going to write to a couple of companies to see if maybe I can get some can we actually test the infusions to see which machine gives us the best infusion but all in all from what I can see here it does a really beautiful job it's really nice and clean and again the no chlorophyll I always like that and the chlorophyll as I said is that heavy flavor that most people don't like and that kind of gives you your animals and things up taste alright guys so here's my final review of the butter brute Brewer overall I would give this product definitely a thumbs up being able to do between one to eight cups is great there's really no other machine out there that can do large quantities also being able to decon up to four ounces is really nice too again there's nothing out there that I know of that can D carve off that kind of amount so anybody do just large infusions this is definitely something you want to look at the one I also do love is being able to adjust your time and temperatures or being able to completely create your own recipe via to your DIY there You've by setting your mixing in your intervals again being fully customizable is wonderful I love the infusion that it makes pulls very little chlorophyll into your infusion which is going to make a much nicer and tastier infusion especially for your cooking so the oh and actually in those four who do which McCall who do and this is the really good machine for those who do make their own lotions and potions one because of the capacity size that you can do as well as being able to customize those temperatures so I know like your shea butter and cocoa butters they require much lower temperatures so you can customize that very easily as well as the gentle stir is not going to damage or hurt any of your delicate type of things that may be in your infusions so that is a really nice feature as well about so beyond about really the only negatives I have to say about the machine is once you do start your infusion you can't adjust your times or temperatures or anything you would have to stop it make your adjustment to a subtractor time and then and just reset it so it would be nice if you could adjust your your times and temperatures etc and jury without it resetting so but the only other negative really is their lack of a presence on social media on Google the only way that I actually came across some was when I was originally researching different machines etc was I came across the video on YouTube but when I went to try and further research it there's very little information that will come up so again and even the website so it gives you all your basics but there's no blog or journal it would be really nice to see something like that so that you can have recipes up there lots of different recipes engaging on your customers as well as having them being able to submit recipes about how the recipes that they use with your machine it'd be really nice to see there so one thing to you guys to the guys of butter Brewer honestly invest in an SEO or whatever those people are they make you seen out there you really got to get out there even after doing a search on Google I would expect to see your ads or something in Facebook or Instagram like everything else it's not a little scary you do a search then BAM there it is over it over and over but buddy brewer doesn't come up so guys so you just need to

gummies uh this is a vegan gummy from wanna coming in at 20 bucks from my dispensary so this puts this at the uh highest end of the gummy um edibles at my dispensary so a bit of a premium for the wanna gummies um but nothing else too fancy here pretty basic packaging from wanna with their hybrid watermelon gummies we're gonna do it nice and short and quick here so that we don't upset the j-man we're going to pinch here as it says open it up and there are our wanna weed watermelon gummies manufactured by high life farms we've got our wonderful lab testing results and all of our stuff my cameraman is currently being uh pulled away by the dogs at this moment but that's okay here we go here is our watermelon gummy looking really nice and square how wonderful watermelon sugar weed aftertaste not bad pretty good well i am now my own cameraman again um and these wanna weed gummies well if you've had a weed gummy before you know what to expect um a lot of sugar to mask the taste and a pretty hefty cannabis aftertaste but i have certainly had worse uh and haven't had too many that are quite a bit better in terms of taste but it's not about how it tastes about how it makes you feel and for that guys i'm gonna come back to you in about two hours after i finish another whole hell a lot of a hell of a lot of these gummies and once i do i'll come back and i will let you know if

earth or what was it called jesus's cameraman do you remember desert christ park welcome back to wheats guys i'm back from desert christ park or something like that the place with all the jesuses uh where we first tried the wanna cannabis infused watermelon hybrid gummies and these are pretty good gummies uh i'm not a hundred percent sure they're worth the 20 premium uh they are uh sort of better quality than the cheapest gummies for sure uh but whether they're the uh sort of eight dollar premium i'm not a hundred percent but they are definitely good quality and if you are concerned about um healthiness in your gummies excuse me guys there's a dog who's really just insistent go get them get out of my face um so if you're really concerned about your uh health and all that these are vegan uh and they are all natural flavors and colors nothing artificial here so uh they also claim to be artisan quality whatever that means anyways uh good quality stuff still pretty high from these uh it's been about three hours since i had my last one and still i am quite high so that is a pretty good endorsement right there and then anytime we have a product we like this much i'll take that camera person she's driving us all crazy go get just get out of our face just just just kid it's it's going to make it worse anytime we have a product we like this much i like to give a little cherry on top a little something extra that's not weed related so i'm out here in the middle of nowhere in the middle of uh god's country and anytime i'm out in the desert i think you know area 51 ufos sci-fi and we've been doing board games recently so i'm going to give you one of my favorite board games of all time one very cosmic and theme and that's cosmic encounters plays like five six seven

cosmic encounters and you have a group that is willing to um do something different give cosmic encounters a try don't even remember who designed it right now that's because of wanna gummies and these wanna i was gonna make another one a pun but i'm too high so just you know uh know that that is an endorsement and that's going to be endorsement as well for cosmic encounters on your local board game store or online in some way i guess we're still in the middle of a pandemic board games are a weird thing to endorse but um they're an optimistic one and i'm rambling thanks guys it's been a it's been

soon", "BzE0YPXhj3Y": "so if you click this video it's probably because you want to learn how to make some edibles and you want to make some really easy to do recipes at home edibles which is a good thing because that's what we're gonna do in this video I'm going to teach you the five most easiest things to make at home with edibles and cannabis my name is Judy Shekar and you're watching puff puff toast let's start off with number one cannabutter one of the most common things to make with cannabis it's super easy to make all you need to do is melt some butter and as you're melting the butter you add a gram of ground cannabis into that butter and you keep melting it melting and melting it until it's nicely infused with the cannabis and voila you have cannabutter super easy super simple and a lot of people use it the second thing that you can make at home is cannabis tea using the can of butter which is interesting because I actually wouldn't expect putting butter in teeth but a lot of people do and apparently this tastes really good so all you do is brew your favorite tea and a teaspoon of that can of butter into your tea and it's this blend of something really delicious warm and nice the third thing that we're going to talk about on how to do our Keith's cookies so Keith is basically the extra powder that comes off of the cannabis bud or when you ground cannabis any leftover powder that happens all of that can actually be used to make keep cookies and and they're really easy to make all you do is you get that left over ground Keith add in some cookie dough bake it and boom you've got Keith's cookie super easy super simple very very delicious apparently number four is I want to tell you how to make pot brownies okay so super easy again but one thing that you want to make sure that you want to have is a brownie mix that uses foil because what you're gonna do is you're gonna heat the oil up and as you're heating oil you're gonna add the ground cannabis to it and then you're gonna mix that oil into a brownie mix and then you basically bake it and you have pot brownies the last thing that I want to teach you how to make is called a firecracker very very very easy all you need are graham crackers peanut butter and cannabis powder so ground cannabis call you to as you spread some peanut butter on the ground cracker add some of the ground cannabis on top of it slap on another peanut butter spread ground cracker on top to make a sandwich cover it in foil put it in the oven for 30 minutes and then you've got this amazing sort of peanut butter brownie cracker sandwich with cannabis so those are the top five really easy ways to make cannabis edibles at home however I'm sure there's more out there and if there is let us know in the comments below let us know what do you make it home with cannabis that's all for me my name is Trudy Shekar and you're watching puff-puff post", "7kGOtSncMhg": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "BzmZ_sb5dZk": "Cannabidiol -- also known as CBD -- is so\nhot right now. It\u2019s sold in pills, as an oil, in gummies,\nas a cream, a vape liquid, and even in bath bombs. CBD is one member of a group over 100 chemicals\ncalled cannabinoids that are produced by the marijuana plant. Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is another,\nmuch more famous one. It\u2019s the reason weed gets people high. So THC and CBD are produced by the same plant\nand their structures look really similar. Which raises the question: could you fail\na drug test by using CBD? Even though the structures of THC and CBD\nlook very similar, they act quite differently in your body. So far, the evidence suggests that CBD does\nnot get you high, nor does it produce any of the other classic THC symptoms: hunger,\ndizziness, hunger, difficulty concentrating, hunger, nausea, hunger, elevated heart rate,\nhunger, dry mouth, hunger, hunger, and the munchies. And what about drug tests? Urine marijuana drug screens test for one\nspecific metabolite of THC. They don\u2019t test for CBD. But there\u2019s two pieces of maybe bad news. First, because the structure of CBD and THC\nare so similar, some scientists were concerned that CBD might be converted to THC by your\nstomach acid. It\u2019s not too crazy of a hypothesis. Acids catalyze ring closures every day of\nthe week. And a few years ago, some researchers did\nin fact use a delicious sounding mixture called \u201csimulated gastric fluid,\u201d which is basically\nacid, table salt, and a few other things, to convert CBD to THC. But they did this reaction in a test tube. Or a beaker. Or maybe an Erlenmeyer flask. The point is, it wasn\u2019t in a person. A few studies since then have fed people pretty\nhigh doses of CBD and tested for THC in their blood and stomach contents, finding none. But CBD isn\u2019t out of the woods yet. The bigger problem is that, because over-the-counter\nCBD products are not regulated by the FDA, there\u2019s no guarantee that you\u2019re getting\nwhat the label says you\u2019re getting. Back in 2017, doctors at UPenn analyzed the\nCBD and THC concentrations of 84 CBD oils, tinctures, and vape liquids, and found measurable\nlevels of THC in 18 of the samples -- that\u2019s more than 1 in 5. The levels were generally low -- but possibly\nhigh enough to set off a drug test. By the way, in that same study, only 26 of\nthe samples had CBD levels within 90-110% of what was on the label. If you\u2019re in the market for CBD, make sure\nyou look at that specific product\u2019s certificate of analysis first -- this a test performed\nby an independent lab to make sure the label is accurate. Make sure that the lab checked for THC, too\n-- sometimes you\u2019ll see relatively high levels of THC, right there in the fine print. You should also know that CBD has not been\nFDA approved for concentration, anxiety, stress, depression, pain, or almost any of the other\nthings it\u2019s being advertised for. As of right now, there\u2019s only one FDA-approved\ndrug containing CBD, for hard to treat seizures. So, could you fail a drug test by taking CBD? We gotta remind you that we\u2019re a YouTube\nchannel, and not a doctor, but our conclusion is: if you\u2019re 100% sure that your product\ncontains CBD and nothing else, you\u2019re extremely unlikely to fail a drug test for marijuana. But, given how often CBD products are not\naccurately labeled and how often THC was detected in them, it actually seems plausible that\nyou might fail a drug test because of a mislabeled or poorly analyzed CBD product. So in the end, your mom is probably right. Better safe than sorry. Have you ever had any unexpected CBD experiences? Let us know in the comments, and we\u2019ll see\nyou next week.", "JqhDejT6d5M": "I'm not really an edible person but I have to tell you whatever they put in this thing they've done a good job I [Music] bought a couple of quarters at a dispensary the other day and they offered you know a freebie and so I decided to go with the edible that they were offering and it happened to be a kirova Saturday morning cookie sample and took it home tried it out and I got to tell you I really really like this brand I really like this I mean I'm not familiar with edibles you might have a particular brand you like I came across these and whatever they're putting inside this thing I got to tell you it works really well for me I think these things are awesome you might have other brands that you particularly care for but I highly highly recommend you try the kirova I am not affiliated with them in any ways and just you know came across them at random and I really really like this cookie plus it's only 150 milligrams so I would maybe recommend to kind of start with these if you're just getting into edibles as far as dosing goes it's a good idea to start small now like I said this is 150 milligrams and you know other cookies and other things in other bars and other products they have you know 250 500 I've seen it even a thousand milligrams which is for me is it's too much you know I can't quite do that type of a thing but this packaging here says that it's got 15 servings per package so if you do the math it's like 10 milligrams per serving so if you're able to divide the cookie up as evenly as possible you can kind of figure out your dosage from there and I would probably you know I would say start with 20 milligrams these things can you know come across you anywhere from 10 minutes to you know 45 minutes to an hour depending on your metabolism and kind of like what's going on with your body and stuff like that so I always like to pass along the information which is kind of the thing with edibles because you know dosing is such a it's such a gray area definitely be careful with this don't eat a whole one for the first time if you're just starting out because you probably would have not such a great experience and you might not you know you might not come back to pick up some more this is about the size of a dose that I would do probably if you're just starting out I might do something around that size but since I've tried this a few times I'm adding this much more but I would try about that much in size even if you're a beginner start with twenty milligrams you know and see see where you go give yourself a little bit of time wait for about half an hour or so and see how you're feeling you know if you go on to maybe an hour hour and a half and you're still you know you're feeling good but maybe you want to feel a little bit better maybe try another ten twenty milligrams and then just call it good and see where you end up there some people will just you know eat something go I don't feel anything and eat some more I don't feel anything and all of a sudden they're just they're just blitzed it's the first time for them that would be that would be a shame because they wouldn't receive the benefits of the Saturday morning cookie so you know if you're just starting out that's what I would recommend for you to do dosing wise hopefully you found the information in this video useful if you did please comment like and subscribe I'm Enzo truffle with bud symbol calm and the kirova Saturday morning cookie thanks for watching [Music]", "3vrcTHZakaw": "yes yes brothers and sisters out there how are we doing how are we doing yes yes it's me it's me it's the it's justin how are we doing out there we've got a little bit of a review for you people today it's a special one um the ninja's been out and about and um she's managed to get me one of these um i did take one of these on one of my earlier reviews it wasn't like this it was somebody's homemade one that they did um it didn't look like this at all the one i had was flat so obviously let me just show you a bit closer so this is obviously uh the millions rope or rope s milligrams okay so it's quite a high dosage um it's certainly the highest dosage i've had in a sweet up till now there's warnings all over it which is really good so you know the packaging is fantastic it is just like a normal commercial suite you'd have to be careful with this obviously if you had children in the ace or anything like that you'd have to make sure this was really really away from them it does say 18 plus on it it is quite clear that there's cannabis in it let me just read it for you so you know so for um medicinal use only or medical use only keep out a reach of children and and animals so yeah if you've got a dog or a cat they might eat it so yeah it says tear and share uk net weight 52 grams um this is the strawberry flavor so very very nice ingredients organic cane sugar corn syrup gelatin citric acid calories extract full strength that's what i was looking for um color red yellow yellow white beeswax and vegetable oil so yeah there's nothing in there which really sort of alarms me to be fair see all seems pretty kosher um g magic sweet so there you go guys if you've seen them well you must have seen them because at the minute um we get sort of offered more sweets than anything um it's obviously overtaking the market quite a bit at the minute and i would say looking at these products now would tell you that you are getting really really really close to legalization now just look at it look at how it's packaged like say you would not know that or distinguish that from a normal suite right you just wouldn't right so that to me tells me that the cogs are moving they're in movement right first of all i think we're better on [ __ ] bombs right so cheers people one laugh um i'm gonna be obviously making this video which will be the eating video the taste test we'll call it so we'll do the taste test on this video and then obviously after about 60 minutes it says 60 minutes on there which i know that's about right um obviously we'll have a look at the effects and see what it does so um it says there's eight there's eight um servings there um obviously i've got quite a high tolerance so i'm going to take about six servings all in one day all right cheers which would literally be the most of my i've taken in a suite although i took the fifo the other day which is fight a thousand milligrams that's a different catch [Music] [Music] still on the cheese don't judge me for it it's the only flavor i can get in a minute we have had a bit of star dog as well so um but yeah it is it's going a little bit scarce in a minute let's say we're getting more sweets than anything so which is good i'm fine with that give the lungs a little break for a little while right then we'll pop that out for a minute but as you guys know cheers right i think it's about time to uh crack this sweet open that okay so 800 milligrams here we go let's have a look at it first what's it look like can you get it out just [Music] i assume the millions aren't medicated oh rocky now look so basically in a nutshell it's just squishy obviously what's medicated is the jelly in the middle by the look of it so yeah well then let's just stop [ __ ] about josh let's just get it down here it says it's strawberry but it's green [Music] but you can taste the cannabis huh [Music] oh my god we really taste the calorie [Music] stuff i didn't get that taste from the other it's strawberry because there's millions yeah if you see millions if a strawberry but the strawberry's masking oh i can taste it now [Music] you know when you get cannabis in your mouth like fecal or calories oil it burns your mind for a little bit you know i'm getting that almost at the back of my mouth [Music] i mean i wonder if there is an accurate dose [Music] cheers [ __ ] struggling this is breakfast [Music] [Music] [Music] a little bit [Music] i mean what i like about it more than anything is a lot of these sweets they actually mask the taste of the cannabis so it's like has it got anything in it hasn't it got anything i know damn well this has got something in it because i could taste it it's very very strong [Music] oh mate [Music] you're not having it's mine [Music] people [Applause] we'll see how strong this really is i mean i think the peach rings that i did a review on i think they were 400 milligrams and the other edible ones like the the um sour bright crawlers they were 300 milligrams in a packet so 600 milligrams i should really if i had a whole one i think i'd probably be on my back but maybe i'll do a whole one next time we'll see well 600 milligrams [Music] oh dear it's very very strong tasting i did not expect it to taste um as strong as it does in cannabis and it's um it's really really overpowering like i say the other one i had did not i can taste the fika or whatever it is cannabis oil in this it's right in the back of my mouth and it's overpowering but that's good because i know that it's [ __ ] loaded it knows it's loaded [Music] that much a little bit [Music] [Music] wow [Music] that's the only thing with these reviews [Music] looked completely different than the last one i had well the last one i was more flat out it was more like a belt it was more like a belt basically whereas that was like a rope um well it is like a rope you can see it quite clearly it's like a rope so but yeah six doses in one go [ __ ] hardcore you know me and i say if i get a good effect off here i'll get a whole one i'll do a hole in one go one night and see what that's like so oh really it's burning it's burning i know that's not a good advertisement for it but it just it has to if it's got cannabis in it it's gonna have some sort of effect when you eat it you've got to be able to taste it like that it's very very strong what's in that so i would say just i know you can't go by it but just by the taste alone i would say that that was probably a pretty accurate dose either that or they've got some serious cannabis [ __ ] flavoring put into it to make it taste like that which i doubt very very very much so i mean it says it takes um 60 minutes on there we know that edibles can take anywhere from like you know i mean 45 minutes to hour and after it's for the effect so the time is now five past 11 of the so we'll call it 11 o'clock as i started eating it probably five minutes ago because i was chewing it like [ __ ] as you saw um so yeah we'll go from there really we'll see what happens at five past twelve and see what i'm like i'll probably be hunting burgers down by that type well yeah let's get another pipe on the go people so yeah i hope you're all well hope everyone's in a good positive mood love the lovers [ __ ] the haters people yes yes one love here we go [ __ ] cheers fun time please join me smoke up choke up roll up you know where we go from here no mess of the bay we just smoke weed and we get [ __ ] higher yes yes let's do it cheers nice nice people nice nice chest [Music] [Music] hey cheers people peace one love to all of you and have a fantastic day you'll see me really soon anyway because i'll be making another video in an hour's time so um yeah i'll see you really really soon i hope you get a good [ __ ] giggle out of what's going to be coming next because i do tend to go off a little bit while i've added some edibles so peace of my love guys see you really really soon one love

TO THE LEAK MARINE  COLLAGEN YOU SEE IN THE  US COME FROM BEEF, OR  PORK AND THINGS LIKE THAT  AND ASSESS MY MIND  DOESN'T HAVE THE SCIENCE  IN THE RESEARCH OF IN TH  OWNING IT THE MARINE  COLLAGEN IS THE BEST  CHOICE, BUT THE MARINE  COLLAGEN WAS A DESIGN CO  AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS  (...) THEY WERE (...) TH  FLAVORING IN SWEETENERS,  ALL SORTS OF CRAZY ALL S  THINGS I REGRET THEY DO  NOT DO THAT TO THE  PRODUCT.  SO WE FORCE PR  THE LEADING MAKER OF  MARINE COLLAGEN IN THE  WORLD AND JAPAN.  WE  FORCE THEM TO GO BACK TO  THE DRAWING BOARD AND  FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE  WEARING COLLAGEN THAT WE  HAS NO FISHY TASTE, AND  AT THE LEVEL OF PURITY  THAT WE REQUIRE, AND THA  ALSO SOLUBLE.  BECAUSE,  COLLAGEN TECHNICALLY  SHOULD NOT BE SOLUBLE.   WHAT WE'RE GONNA SICKEN  US ABOUT 10 YEARS WE US   WENT FROM ORIGINAL  REVIEWS ON THIS PRODUCT  TO A COUPLE OF SCOOPS  THIS IS FOR ME I DO NOT  DO MY MARINE COLLAGEN DO  YET TODAY.  WHAT WE HAVE  ACCOMPLISHED HERE WE NOW  HAVE A PRODUCT THAT HAS  NO FISHY TASTE.  A  PRODUCT THAT STARTED I  SAY THIS OFTEN ALL OF SA  OUR PRODUCTS ARE OUR PRO  CUSTOMER PICKS.  THEY DO  NOT ALL START OFF AS  CUSTOMER PICKS.  THIS IS  A PRODUCT THAT STARTED  OFF AT ABOUT 2 STARS, WE  WENT BACK TO THE DRAWING  BOARD WE READ YOUR  REVIEWS, AND I SAY YOUR  REVIEWS READ MY  TESTIMONIES.  THOSE  REVIEWS READ THE  CRITICISMS OR CRITIQUES.   SO WE WENT BACK TO THE  DRAWING BOARD, AND WE  CREATED, AND PROTECTED  MEMORY AND COLLAGEN IF I  LET IT SIT HERE WHICH I  DO FOR THE MOMENT IT DO   WILL FULLY DISSOLVED  WHICH IS A REMARKABLE  ATTRIBUTE OF WEARING  COLLAGEN IT IS LIKE  FIBER, IT SHOULD BE  ILLEGAL IN THE SOLUTION  THAT ONE WENT TO THE  SOLUTION I STIRRED IT SO  FOR 2 OR 3 SECOND SOLACE  SLOWLY DISSOLVE.  MARINE  COLLAGEN, COLLAGEN IS A  PROTEIN MATRIX IN OUR  BODY THAT ALL OF THE  CRITICAL TISSUES WOULD  THINK ABOUT IN OUR BODY  THAT MOST OF THEM ARE  WEATHERS ARE ORGANS, THE  SYSTEMS, THE VASCULAR  TISSUE THAT PROTEIN TISS  THERE IS A POACHER--  PROTEIN MAJORS THE  COLLEGE TEEN--COLLAGE  MATRIX WITH IT IS ERROR  HEART, OUR BOWS, ARE  CONNECTED TISSUE YOU'RE  MIXING THIS UP AS WELL.   [LAUGHTER] >>GUEST:  SO EVEN IF WE  THINK ABOUT THE VANITY  STANDPOINT ARE SKIN, WE  ALL NOTICE THE COLLAGEN  MATRIX THAT UNDERLIES MA  OUR SKIN.

CELLULITE IS A DUMPLING  OF HER SKIN THAT ISN'T  CAUSED BY HER SKIN, IT C  IS CAUSED BY THE FACT  THAT IS UNDER OUR SKIN.   BUT BETWEEN THE FAT AND  THAT SKIN IS A LAYER OF  COLLAGEN.  AND TO EXPECT  THAT LAYER COLLAGEN IT T  IS ORGANIZED, AND THEN  YOU HAVE THIS RESEARCH Y  IS SHOWN.  YOU SHOW FROM  THE BOTTOM UP YOU CAN  ALREADY SEE 2 SECONDS OF  STARING YOU ALREADY SEE  THE COLLAGEN IN THE  SOLUTION.  AND THEN YOU  HAVE THIS WITH THE  SOLUTION OF THE MOMMY SO  CAN DRINK IT JUST AS IS  GETTING ALL THE BENEFITS  OF THE COLLAGEN OF  COURSE!  >>HOST: EXCUSES FOR A  SECOND!  >>GUEST: THERE WE GO!

WHAT  THE COLLAGEN PEPTIDES DO  IS CALL THE SIGNALING  EFFECT, DELIVERS THE  SIGNATURE BODY TO GET  THAT WORK MANAGING,  MAINTAINING AND THE  COLLAGEN PROTEIN. >>HOST: SO, THIS IS A  REASON WHY I HAVE MY PEN  AND NOTEPAD I HEAR YOU  HEARD ANDREW SAY HELPING  TO POSTPONE WRINKLES.

IF YOU DO  THAT I WOULD APPRECIATE  IT.  >>GUEST: I, IN FACT I  WILL MAKE SURE IF I  HAVEN'T UNRAVELED TO  AGAIN I THINK WE MIGHT  HAVE NL HAVE YOU TAKE A  LOOK I'VE MIGHT HAVE LOO  DONE JUST THAT SOMEHOW A  VIDEO POSTING SOMEWHERE  AND MAYBE ON A  SYSTEM.COM, AND MAYBE ON  OUR WEBSITE AT THING I  DID DO THAT.  JUST DID D  ANSWER THE QUESTION  QUICKLY, OTHER THAN  THINGS LIKE LESS TO CARE  OR CHOCONUVO WAS TO TAKE  WITH THE MEAL SO YOU  LOWER THE CHOLESTEROL  FROM THAT MEAL, WHAT WE  (...) WHAT I BASICALLY  SAY AS I TAKE THE  VITAMINS OF THE WORKS  BEST FOR YOU.  ONE OF BE  FUN THINGS YOU JUST  EDITING ABOUT 17 EDITING  PRODUCTS IN THE MORNING.   IF THAT ISN'T A  TESTAMENT OF HOW MILD TE  OUR PRODUCTS ARE YOU CAN  TAKE 17 VITAMINS BECAUSE,  AS HE SAID WITH A  AS H  LITTLE BIT OF BREAKFAST  THAT'S HOW-- A TESTAMENT  OF HOW MILD THEIR.  BIT  WE WILL TAKE THE VIDEO I  WILL PROMISE I WILL  RECORD ONE THAT IS AN  INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT  QUESTION, WHICH AS HE  SAID MANY PEOPLE LOVE TO  TAKE CALCIUM AND I  BECAUSE IT'S INSIDIOUS  EVENING, RELAXING MINERAL  THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.  HE OTHER PRODUCTS CAN BE  TAKEN VIRTUALLY ANYTIME  THE OTHER THING I WOULD  NOT TAKE AT THE END OF  THE DAY IS OUR COFFEE  SECURE BECAUSE IT COULD  HAVE A LITTLE CAFFEINE.   EVEN A GREEN TREE--TEA  EXTRACT HAS A LITTLE  TRACES OF CAFFEINE OR  CHOCONUVO ONLY TRACES OF  CAFFEINE YOU DO NOT TO  WORRY ABOUT THAT.  I  TYPICALLY DIVIDE MY  VITAMINS BETWEEN  BREAKFAST AND LUNCH IS  HOW I DO IT.  AND AGAIN,  YOU WANT TO DO IT AT THE  TIME THAT WORKS BEST TIM  WHEN IT COMES TO THINGS  LIKE COQ10, ALWAYS LIKE   PRETTY TAKEN WITH FOOD  BECAUSE IS BETTER  ABSORBED, WERE TAKEN ABS  WITH YOUR OMEGA THREES  BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE  ABSORBED TO BE EVEN  BETTER.  IT SOUNDS LIKE  ERA DENIGRATES OUT, BUT   I WILL MAKE SURE SILLAGE  SECESSION PORTEN  FREQUENTLY ASKED FREQUEN  QUESTION IF WE DO NOT  HAVE A VIDEO, I WILL  RECORD ONE IF YOU JUST  SAT OKAY?  >>HOST: TAKE YOU SO MUCH  SHEILA!  WE APPRECIATE  YOU TAKING THE TIME YOU   WE'LL HEAD OVER THIS WAY  ONE THING THAT ANDREW  LESSMAN BROUGHT UP WAS  COQ10 I'M THOROUGHLY COQ  TALK ABOUT THIS FOR A  MOMENT ORDERED TO.  WE  LIVE VERY SPECIAL LIVES,  WE ARE VERY BUSY ALWAYS  DOING SOMETHING AND IT'S  EASY TO FEEL TIRED,  FATIGUED. >>GUEST:   WELL I THINK  IT'S PART OF THE HUMAN  CONDITION THAT, ENERGY  WHETHER IT'S A SOCIETAL  LEVEL, ENERGY IS ONE OF  THE MOST COSTLY THINGS  THAT WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON,  THE SAME AMOUNT HUMAN  OIL THAT ENERGY LEVEL IS  SOMETHING WE FREQUENTLY  STRUGGLE AND HAVE  ADVOCATE-- ADEQUATE  AMOUNTS MOST OF US WE  REFER THE STIMULANT REFE  WHICH IS IN THE MOST  (...) MIC MUCH THE MOST  OBVIOUS THING TO DO BUT  IT IS IN THE MOST  INTELLIGENT THING TO DO.   WHENEVER WE REACH IN  W  AND GRAB A STIMULANT, WE  ARE GOING TO LEAVE  OURSELVES A LITTLE BIT O  OF A HOLE THERE AFTER  THAT WE HAD TO CLIMB OUT  OF.  AND THEN WE HAVE  THIS THE MOST THIS THE M  INTELLIGENT WAY TO GIVE  OURSELVES MORE ENERGY IS  TO REALLY LOOK AT HOW TO  OUR BODY PRODUCES ENERGY  AND A CELLULAR LEVEL.   BECAUSE OUR EXPERIENCE B  OF ENERGY, OR ARE ITS  VARIOUS A FATIGUE IS  BASICALLY THE BYPRODUCT  OF THE EXPERIENCE OF  TRILLIONS OF CELLS.  THE  BYPRODUCT OF THE IT'S BY  THE AREA'S MANY PRODUCTS  IN OUR CARDIOVASCULAR  SYSTEM TO OUR NERVOUS  SYSTEM.  SO WHAT WE WANT  TO DO, IS WE WANT TO TO   MAKE SURE EACH OF THESE  CELLS IN OUR BODY, GET  THE KEY SYSTEMS OF HER  BODY THE MOST IMPORTANT  TOOL IN SIDEWAYS TALK  ABOUT SORT OF THE RATE  LIMITING OPPONENT THAT  THING THAT HAS A  PRODUCTION OF ENERGY AS  WE GET OLDER, IN TERMS W  OF AVAILABLE RAW OF AVAI  MATERIAL IS IN FUEL.  MA  THE FUEL WE HAVE PLENTY  AND CALORIES MOST OF US  HAVE ABUNDANT FAT IN OUR  BODIES, WHERE ABUNDANT  GLYCOGEN STORED IN OUR  MUSCLES AND LIVER WHAT  LIMITS US IS REALLY THE  MACHINERY OF DOING THE  MACHINE ENERGY IS GILDER  AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS  THE B12, THERE'S NO  MOLECULE THAT'S MORE  CRITICAL AND SOCIAL  ESSENTIAL WITH ALL THE  CELLS OF HER BODY THAT  BECOMES LIMITED IS GILDER GILDER--OLDER AND WE GIL  HAVE A STRESS CINEMATIC  COQ10 AND THEN WE NOW  MAKE COQ10 INCREDIBLY,  INCREDIBLY AFFORDABLE.   YEARS AGO THE LARGE SIZE  OF THE PRODUCT COST OF T  ABOUT $500 IN THAT WAY  COST A SMALL FRACTION  THAT WHAT PRODUCTS DO WE  KNOW THAT THE PRODUCTS  ARE 80% LESS IS VISIT  TODAY THAN THEY WERE 30  YEARS AGO?  TWO DECADES  BEFORE ANYONE ELSE  DISCOVERED IT. >>HOST:   AND THEN YOU  HAVE THIS IS A 3700  REVIEWS IN TOTAL.  OTHER  3700 TOTAL REVIEWS 3125  OF THEM, THAT IS 84% ARE  PERFECT FIVE STARS.  I  MEAN AGAIN, YOU TOOK A  SOPHISTICATED PRODUCT,  THE WORLD'S FINEST,  PUREST SOURCE TO COQ10  THERE IT IS RIGHT HERE  THERE IS NO COQ10 IN THE  MARKET, (...)  >>HOST:  >>GUEST: THIS IS OUR >>G  BEST PRICE IN ANY YEAR  OTHER THAN A TODAY'S  SPECIAL ARE TODAY'S  SPECIAL'S NOT UNTIL THE  VERY BEGINNING-- END OF  THE YEAR DESERVING THOSE  ARE TODAY'S SPECIAL IS A  AT THE END OF THE YEAR.   ARE COQ10 WHEN YOU LOOK  THE COQ10 PRODUCT  TYPICALLY LOOK AT THEM T  AS THIS IS A SUPPLEMENT  ON THE MARKET OR AS I  SAID BEFORE THE LARGE  SIZE OF THIS WOULD  BASICALLY BE TWO DOLLARS  TO CAPSULE FOR 200 MG A  COQ10.  PLUS WITH OUR  COQ10 WE GIVE YOU THE  FULL BE COMPLEX OR EVEN  SPECIAL B12, WE ALSO SPE  GIVE YOU VITAMIN C.   VITAMIN C AND COQ10 HAVE  A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR  BODY.  SO, THIS IS AN  OPPORTUNITY TO GET THE  MOST EFFECTIVE, THE MOST  COMPREHENSIVE COQ10 ON  THE MARKET.  WHEN IT  COMES GIVING YOUR BODY  THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO  SUPPORT OPTIMUM AND  FUNCTIONING OF ALL THE  KEY ORGANS.  AND THEN KE  YOU HAVE THIS AT THE  SCIENCE AND RELATIONS  TALK ABOUT THIS THE KEY  ATTRIBUTES AND THE  OTTOMAN FUNCTION OF THE  KEY ASSISTANCE IN THE  ORGANS OF YOUR BODY IS  BASICALLY THE  AVAILABILITY OF ENERGY.   AND THEN YOU GET THIS AN  AND MAKE IT WHERE YOU  NEED TO MAKE A OTTOMAN  LATE-- OPTIMUM ONLY  FUNCTION.--  OPTIMALLY  ONLY TALK ABOUT OUR  ABILITY TO FUNCTION.   [LAUGHTER] THEY ARE  BARKING AT THE  POSTPRODUCTION.  THEY  JUST, LIKE MARCEL JUST  DISCOVERED I.  >>HOST: WHO ARE THESE  PEOPLE WHAT ARE THEY  DOING HERE?  >>GUEST: CAN YOU SAY?  AN YOU DO A ROUNDER?  YES  MARCEL FOR NINE MONTHS  OLD HE IS LEARNING.  NO  MORE MARCEL GO GET NIKKI! NIKKI!--LINKY  HE IS NOT  WHITE LINK HE YET.--LINKY   HE DID WELL, BUT  COENZYME Q 10 IT IS AN  INGREDIENT THAT WE  INTRODUCED BACK IN 1984,  I GO TO JAPAN TO FIND IT,  AN INGREDIENT THAT  WASN'T YET AVAILABLE IN  THE UNITED STATES TO  SPEAK OF AT ALL.  AND I  BELIEVE JESSICA DIOSMIN  WE TALKED ABOUT THE VEIN  SUPPORT THE PROPERTIES  ARE MAKING THIS  INGREDIENT VELLUM BACK I  IN 1984.  AND THEN YOU  HAVE THIS THE COMPANIES  THAT ARE FOR THE LONGEST  TIME I 30 MM COQ10 WAS  ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO GET  COQ10.  TODAY ON COQ10.   SIEWERT, 200 MG A COQ10  THE 30 MM COQ10 BACK IN  THE 80S COST MORE PER  CAPSULE, THEN THE 200 MG  COQ10 CAPSULE TODAY. >>HOST:   AND ISN'T IT  THE CASE THAT AS WE AGE,  WE DEFINITELY NEED TO  SUPPLEMENT MORE COQ10?   AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS A  AS WE AGE WE DEFTLY NEED  MORE TO SUPPLEMENT MORE.   AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS  AGE LESSEN OUR BODY AND  THEN ARE YOU GOING TO BE  SATISFIED BY HAVING LESS  COQ10, COQ10 IS REALLY C  AS I SAID ONE OF THOSE  FACTORS TO KEY FACTOR  WHEN IT COMES TO  PRODUCING ENERGY IN HER  BODY, IT IS SORT OF  INTERESTING THAT THING  ABOUT IT THIS WAY.  WITH  A LOT BURNING FUEL IN A   HER BODY WHETHER WE AS  SUGAR, CARBOHYDRATE OR  OXIDIZE FAT IN HER BODY.   LILY BURN THOSE FUEL  SURFACES IS NOT WE BRING  THEM FROM A FIRE THEM FR  ANYTHING LIKE THAT.   BASICALLY BREAKING THEM  DOWN ON THE MOLECULAR  LEVEL, IT PROVIDES US AN  ENERGY IS A MOVEMENT TO  TRANSPORT THE ELECTRONS.   IT IS THAT MOVEMENT  IT  WITH THE ELECTRICAL  POTENTIAL WITH THE  ENERGETIC EXPERIENCE OF  THE CELLS IN OUR BODY  THAT GETS TRANSFERRED  THROUGHOUT USING THE  ENERGY-- THE HIGH-ENERGY  PHOSPHATE SEDITIOUS  BAZAAR TO THINK IT IS  JESSE'S HUMAN BEINGS  HAVING THIS HUMAN  EXPERIENCE THEIR  BASICALLY LIVING FROM  THIS ENTIRE THIS ENTIRE  BIOCHEMICALLY DRIVEN  MACHINE.  IS PRETTY  FASCINATING ON A FASCINA  CELLULAR LEVEL IT'S A  MOVEMENT OF ELECTRONS  THESE THINGS WE NEVER,  EVER SEE IT IS THE  ELECTRONS THAT GIVES US  ENERGY TO HAVE ALL OF EN  THE THOUGHTS, AND DO  EVERYTHING THAT WE DO  OVER THE COURSE OF OUR  LIFETIME.  THE ESSENTIAL  MOLECULE ALLOWING AND  PERMITTING THE COQ10 AND  THEN YOU HAVE THIS WITH  THE UBIQUINOL AND THEN  YOU HAVE THIS WITH THE  ELECTRONS AND LOSES  ELECTRONS THAT ALLOWS US  TO CREATE A TRY ENERGY  PHOSPHATES THAT ALLOWS P  US TO HIS VARIANCE LIFE  AS WE KNOW IT. >>HOST: APPEAL A >>HOST:  COMEBACK IN BIOLOGY COME  CLASS AT SCHOOL AGAIN.  >>GUEST: I ALWAYS  COMPLAIN I DO NOT HAVE C  MY OWN LAB COAT BUT IT'S  OKAY.  I'M FINE!  I  ACTUALLY LET THE BLAZER  YOU'RE WEARING TONIGHT.   IS A VERY NICE BLAZER!    I LIKE TO COMPLEMENT YOU  ON THAT.  >>HOST: I WILL CONFLICT  COMPLEMENT YOU ON THE  BLUE THING THAT'S HER  FAVORITE COLOR.  >>GUEST: IT IS MY  FAVORITE COLOR I LEARNED  A LONG TIME AGO FROM A  NEWSCASTER (...) I FEEL  WAS TOM BROKAW.  HE SAID  ALONG TIME AGO, THAT BLUE  WAS THE COLOR THAT TV  CAMERAS AND TELEVISION  SETS PRODUCE BEST.  SO,  IT'S A GREAT COLOR WEAR  ON TELEVISION BECAUSE  GIVEN THE ELECTRONICS OF  THE LENSES IN WHATEVER  REPRODUCTION THE COLOR,  BLUE HAPPENS TO BLUE HAP  REPRODUCE BEST.  SO, I  FIGURE I MIGHT AS WELL  WEAR A COLOR THAT MAKES  ME LOOK GOOD, IT WILL  MAKE ME LOOK BETTER!   [LAUGHTER]  >>HOST: TRUST ME I DO!   AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS  AND WILL DO THIS WITH  THE. >>GUEST: WILL TAKE A  LITTLE STROLL AROUND THE  FACILITY.  AS HE CAN SEE  WE GO SO FAR WITH THE  WALLS HERE THEIR ANGLE,  THEIR ANGLE TO ELIMINATE  REFLECTION ON THE SIDE  AND THEN ELIMINATE THE  REFLECTION ON THE  OUTSIDE.  ALSO, AND THEN  YOU HAVE THIS DELICIOUS  ETHALINE INSIDE.  AND  THEN YOU HAVE THIS RIGHT  THERE'S COMPLETELY THERE  SILENT SO THAT'S  SOMETHING THAT WE DID IT  IS VERY THICK, AND THEN  VERY THICK.  ALSO UP  THERE, AND THEN YOU CAN  SEE THERE'S A LOT OF SEE  GEAR FOR THE BROADCAST.   BUT THAT IS PART OF OUR  FACILITY WHERE THINGS FA  ARE EXITING OUR FACILITY,  THEY EXIT FROM OUTSIDE.   YET TO REALIZE OUR  FACILITY IS A CASSETTE  WHICH COULD NOT WE HAVE  WAREHOUSES AND OFFICES W  ON THAT SIDE, WE HAVE  WAREHOUSES AND OFFICES W  ON THE FAR SIDE AND IN  THE MIDDLE WE HAVE OUR  PRODUCTION AND THEN YOU  HAVE THIS WHERE YOU NEED  AND THE RAW MATERIAL ON  THE OTHER SIDE WHERE  THINGS ARE ENTERING, SO  ALL THE PRODUCTION TASTE  LAZY OR SAVE FOR THOSE L  OF THE CIRCLE EXITS  THERE, AND THEN YOU DO  THIS AT HSN YOU GET THIS  FROM HERE AND THEN FROM   THINGS INTO THE FACILITY  HERE.  SONATAS IS SORT H  OF A TRANSPORT THAT  ALLOWS A 2 WAREHOUSES  COMMUNICATE WITH ONE  ANOTHER AND ALLOWS US TO  MOVE THINGS BETWEEN THE  PRODUCTION AREAS BECAUSE,  UPSTAIRS WE ALSO DO  PRODUCTION.  UPSTAIRS WE  DO OUR OMEGA THREES AND  ARE SOFT PRODUCTION.  WE  MAKE ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS  HERE, SO HERE IS A HERE,  COUPLE OF THINGS.  I COU  WILL SAY ON THE WAY OUT  WILL SHOW YOU THE TEA  AREA.  THERE IS A AREA.   MACHINE WHERE YOU MAKE  YOUR PACKETS WE DO NOT Y  DO VERY OFTEN BECAUSE I  RATHER HAVE THIS IN A  BOOK FORM IT'S MUCH MORE  AFFORDABLE BECAUSE THE  PACKETS ARE EXPENSIVE  MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE, MU  AND THEN YOU GET THIS  WITH THE ENVIRONMENT  THAT'S HOW WE DO IT WITH  THE PACKETS.  HERE ARE  THE THREE BLENDERS WE  HAVE 2 OTHER BLENDERS AS  WELL, AS YOU CAN SEE WEL  HERE THE OTHER SIDE OF  THIS HALLWAY WILL BE  THERE IN A FEW MOMENTS  AND THAT'S WHERE THE  CANCELLATION TAKES PLACE  IN THAT HALLWAY  EVERYTHING TAKES PLACE  DOWN THERE THE  ENCAPSULATION ROOM WHERE  THE POWDERS BUTTON  CAPSULES CALLED ON BY THE  HOLIDAYS TO THEM DOWN  FARMER THERE?  I WILL  STAND IN FRONT OF THERE  IN THE MOMENT AND SEE IN  THE MACHINES THAT I USE  TO USE.  THESE ARE THE  SMALLER BLENDER, AND A  SMALL AND THEN YOU HAVE  THIS IN THE FOOT IT IS T  75 FT. THAT IS ACTUALLY  SUBMIT WITH THE LARGER  THEN THE PEOPLE IN THEIR  WE SAT THAT WAS ONLY WE   LIKE A DEFY AND FLAT.  L  WE KNOW THE NEW BLENDERS  WILL SHOW YOU IN THE  MOMENT INCREASE OUR  PRODUCTION CAPACITY  DRAMATICALLY, AND IT  INCREASED OUR EFFICIENCY.   HAS ONE SEMI-OF OUR  PRODUCT COST, AND HAS  GONE DOWN OVER TIME.  HAT WE WILL SHOW YOU QUICKLY  AS YOU CAN SEE THE AS YO  REASON WHY WE BUILT A  BUILDING NEXT DOOR WE DO  NOT HAVE ENOUGH ROOM FOR  A LOT OF OUR THINGS.  HIS IS THE PACKAGING VEILS I  OF THE COMMON THESE ARE  EMPTY BOTTLES LARGE EMPT  EMPTY WHITE BOTTLES FOR  RECYCLING EVERYTHING WE  USES FOR RECYCLED  MATERIALS.  SO THIS MATE  COURT IS IN THERE AS  WELL, ALL THE MATERIALS  CONTAINERS AS WELL.  CON  IT'S ABOUT 45 FEET TALL!   SO, AS WE MOVE ALONG  HERE AS YOU CAN SEE WE  ACCUSE EVERY SQUARE INCH.   THAT'S WHY HAD TO   TH  BUILD A BUILDING NEXT  DOOR.  WHAT WE HAVE HERE  WE HAVE A 300 FT., AND W  A 150 FT. BLENDER WHICH  BASICALLY ARE ENORMOUS  BLENDERS!  WHAT IS  REMARKABLE ABOUT THE  SPLENDOR, IS A HOLD  THOUSANDS, AND THOUSANDS  THOUSANDS, AND THOUSANDS  OF POUNDS OF MATERIAL.   AND IF YOU WATCH IT MOVE  IT WILL MOVE WITHIN A  FRACTION OF AN INCH OF  THE SURFACES OF THE VERY  TOP.  SO, IT LITERALLY  HAD TO BUILD THE ROOM OR  A MISS, AND IF YOU LOOK  AT HOW THIS IS BUILT IT  SUPPORTED ON THE  STRUCTURE OF THE WALLS.   IF YOU LOOK AT THE  FOOTINGS WE HAD TO POUR  IN THE GROUND, WE KIND I  OF DID A HOLE THAT WAS O  10 FEET DEEP TO POUR THE  CONCRETE FOOTINGS TO  SECURE THAT UNDER.  YOU  SEE HERE A 150 FT.  BLENDER AND THEN YOU GET  THIS SCALE IN THE GROUND  THAT ADVICE AT THEIR IMU  IS OVER WHEN THE BLENDER  IS DONE DOING THIS BLEND,  AND THEN YOU DROP THE  SUPER SACK UNDERNEATH,  HAVING THE SUPER SACK IS  THERE.  THE SUPER SACK  WILL THEN RECEIVE THE  CONTENTS OF SCALE IS  RIGHT THERE SO YOU CAN  GET EVERYTHING.  SO WE  CAN ACCOUNT FOR EVERY  GRAM OF MATERIAL ON THIS  PRODUCT.  AND THEN YOU  HAVE THIS VERY RELIABLE  APART FROM HUMAN ERROR  THEY ARE VERY RELIABLE.   THE COMPUTERS.  IS THERE  INCREDIBLY RELIABLE ONE  THING BECAUSE THE  BLENDING TECHNOLOGY HAS  STAYED THE SAME AND THE  PATTERNS THEY GET THE  BENEFIT OF THESE MACHINES  THAT HAVE MOTORS THAT  ARE JUST THAT CAN BE ON  AIRPLANES THAT RUN FOR  THOUSANDS, AND THOUSANDS  THOUSANDS, AND THOUSANDS  OF HOURS THAT DO NOT OF   NEED TO BE SERVICE SO  IT'S INCREDIBLE!  AND  THIS IS OUR POWDER  FILLING LINE.  SO WE ARE  FILLING MARINE COLLAGEN  JUST AS WE TALKED ABOUT.   THE FUNNY THING ABOUT  THIS, OR NOT FUNNY THAT  THIS PRODUCT IF WE PUT A  LITTLE MARK ON IT I  GUARANTEE SOMEONE WILL  SEE THAT IN THE HOME 2 S  OR THREE WEEKS.  THAT'S  OUT YOU NEED THIS SET AT  HSN AND THEN THIS IS  RIGHT HERE FOR CHOCONUVO,  AND THEN YOU HAVE  AND   MISSED ITS MONTHLY  CHOCOLATE, THIS IS OUR  CHOCONUVO A SPECIAL COOL  AREA, AND THEN AS YOU SAY  WE TAKE SPECIAL CARE CARE--EXTRA OF ALL THE  PRODUCTS IN THE KNEE PRO  GIVE THIS DUDE TOO.  AND  HE GET THIS AND THEN YOU  HAVE THIS ACCU BC 20  YEARS AGO I WENT TO HSN  22 YEARS AGO THEY BOTH  CHANGE THEIR WAREHOUSES  TO CHANGE THE TO CHANGE   TEMPERATURE IN THE  WAREHOUSE FOR US BECAUSE,  THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE  UNTIL YOU GET THE PRODUCT  IS PERFECTLY CARED FOR  THIS INCREDIBLE. >>GUEST:   AND THEN YOU  HAVE THIS THE CHOCONUVO  THE BEST CHOCOLATE AND  THE WORLD WILL TALK THE   ABOUT THAT IN A MOMENT  BELOW HIS CHOLESTEROL,  AND THEN HE GET THIS IN  THE BLOOD AND SUGAR.  IN  ANY MIXTURE IT IS THE  POSSIBLE.  AND THEN YOU  HAVE THIS THEN YOU  PROBABLY SPEND ON  THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS  OF MACHINE ON HERE, AND  THEN YOU GET THE THEN YO  CAPSULES THAT COME INTO  PIECES THEY GET SHIPPED  WITH US TOGETHER.  THEIR  EMPTY RIGHT?  SO THE  FIRST THING THEY GET THE  EMPTY CAPSULES AND HERE  YOU GET THEIR RECTIFIER  AND THEN YOU GET THIS IN  TERMS OF ALL THE SAME  DIRECTION THEY GETS YOU  INTO THE HOLES AND HERE.   WE GET THIS IN THE  WE   HOLES AND THEN YOU  BASICALLY DO YOU GET  THESE JUST LIKE THESE  THEY ARE BASICALLY  SEPARATED.  AND THEN YOU  PUT THEM IN HOUSTON I  HAVE HER CAPSULES IN  HERE, AND YOU MOVE THIS  TOPPER OVER, AND THEN TO  YOU HAVE THIS OF THE  POWDER AND THERE'S A  MONITOR MOVING THE MONIT  POWDER DOWN THE FRESH PO  AND IT GIVES A FULLER AN  WAY YOU MEASURE THAT CAN  DIAL IT DOWN SO THIS DIA  WILL PULL AROUND WITH THE  EXPERIENCE, THE POWDER  GOES ALL THE WAY YEAH GO  THE OTHER HALF OF THE  CAPSULE RINGS HERE YOU  THEN MASH THEM UP  BASICALLY.  YOU MATCHES  UP TOGETHER HERE IT IS  EVERY GO.  YOU MASH THEM  UP, AND ANY GOING TO UP,  HEAR AND THEN THIS IS  WHERE YOU WANT TO GO WHE  DOWN HERE, AND THEN YOU  GET THE CAPSULES, AND  THEN YOU WILL DO THIS  RIGHT HERE IN THE  CAPSULES.  THE VERY  SIMPLE OPERATION YOU  RECTIFY THEM, YOU FILL  THEM, YOU PUT THEM BACK  TOGETHER.  >>HOST: WAS A  SELF-TAUGHT?  OR DID YOU  HAVE A TEACHER?   [LAUGHTER] >>GUEST: HAD NOT COME >>  OUT THE WINDOW AND YET  THE MAKE CAPSULES.  ICE  ALSO BEEN DOING THIS FOR  50 YEARS AGO TO LEARN  FROM THE VERY BEST.  THE  SOCIETY MAKE CAPSULES  WITHOUT ADDITIVES WE WIT  MAKE THE CAPSULES MAKE T  WITHOUT ADDITIVES.  THE  ONLY CONSOLATION THEY ON  GET RIGHT HERE SO THAT  WAS WHAT WE'RE POINTING  OUT.  THIS LITTLE AISLE  IS PROBABLY WHY?  20  YEARS-- YARDS.  THESE  MACAROONS ON EITHER SIDE  HALLWAY.  AND THEN YOU  HAVE THIS OUT IS THE  YELLOW THE MACHINES WITH  ALL THE MACHINES WHEN AL  YOU NEED A SEPARATE AREA  TO DO CLEANUP.  EVERY  TIME HE DO THE PRODUCT  YOU BREAK DOWN THE  MACHINE COMPLETELY AND  THEN YOU DO THIS AND  START A NEW.  IS WHAT  THIS AREAS FOR, AND THEN >>HOST:  WILL DO A  QUESTION HOW LONG DOES Q  IT TAKE TO CLEAN THE  MACHINE?  >>GUEST: ON ONE OF OUR  HIGH-SPEED MACHINES ARE  TO BE THE BETTER PART OF  A DAY TO DO CLEANUP ON  THE SMALLER MACHINES I  WAS DOING THERE  RELATIVELY EASY TO DO  THAT 2 OR THREE HOURS.   YOU TAKE THE COMPONENTS  ON A LARGER MACHINE YOU  TAKE THIS INTO HER ROOM  LIKE THIS, THIS IS A LIK  ROOM WHERE YOU HOST  THINGS DOWN.  THE  ISOLATED ROOM IN THE  WATER PRESSURE AND AIR  PRESSURE YOU TO CLEAN  THINGS OFF.  SO  EVERYTHING YOU SEE HERE  IS ALL STAINLESS STEEL,  AND IF WE (...) IF WE  WANTED TO MANUFACTURE  DRUGS UNDER THE MOST  RIGOROUS CONDITIONS, ALL  YOU HAVE TO DO IS REFILE  WHAT WE DO BECAUSE, THIS  IS ALL THE EMPIRE MENTAL  CONDITIONS YOU'RE ALL CO  THE THINGS WE'VE DONE  HERE ARE EXACTLY THOSE  KIND OF STANCE.  >>HOST: IS PRISTINE, IT  REALLY IS!  >>GUEST: ONLY COME OUT  THIS IS OUR PASSION THIS  TERRY HERE, WE SEE THIS  ON THAT IS BEING STAGED.   AND WE'RE ACTUALLY  AND  GOING TO BE CHANGING OUR  BOTTLE LINE HERE, OUR  SECOND BOTTLE LINE HERE,  AND ANY OF THE MAIN  VOLUME LINE INCREASING  THE SPEED.  SO WE'LL THE  MAKE SOME CHANGES  BECAUSE, THERE'S ALWAYS  ONE MACHINE ON THE LINE  WHETHER IT'S A CAPPER,  THE FILLER, THERE IS  ALWAYS A MACHINE THAT'S  THE SLOWER MACHINE.  AND  THEN YOU MAKE THAT IT IS  THE SPEED OF THE ENTIRE  LINE.  THIS IS WHAT WE L  DO THE PACKAGING HEAR, D  WE HAVE THIS YEAR.  OF  ALL THE PACKETS, AND ALL  THEN YOU HAVE THIS AT TH  THE MULTIVITAMIN.  YEAH  SO THIS IS THE MACHINE  THAT THAT COMES OUT OF.   HERE IS THE FILM IN HERE,  AND THEN IT GOES DOWN    IN THE BACK AND ANY OF I  US ONE STEP THAT MAKES A  FREE LITTLE SLOT AND YOU  THINK IT GOES. >>GUEST:   THE REASON >>  WHY WE MAKE IT AS MOST  PEOPLE DO NOT CARE ABOUT  THE RADIATION SO THEY TH  USE A CLEAR PACKET.  WE  USE THE FOIL PACKETS: TO  VISUALLY INSPECT OUR  PACKETS SO, WHEN DO A  GREAT DEAL OF WORK TO  FIND THE COLOR THAT KEPT  OTHER UV LIGHT ANIMATED  DANCE OF THE COLORED  NUTRIENTS THAT PURPLE  FILM FUNCTION JUST AS  WELL AS FOIL. >>HOST:   INCREDIBLY  EFFECTIVE LOOK AT THIS  WELCOME RIGHT HERE.  I  LOVE THESE GUYS!  HEY  BUDDIES!  HEY YOU GUYS!   HATED YOU MISS US?  I  KNOW! >>GUEST:   LINCOLN HAS >  TO LET MARCEL DO HIS  THING MARCEL IS THE THIN  PUPPY AND LINCOLNS VERY  TOLERANT A MARCEL.  >>HOST: SO EXCITED TO >>  SEE YOU!  WILL THAT WAS  IMPRESSIVE! >>HOST:   WILL ANSWER >>  WAS ALWAYS A THRILL TO  SEE IT IN ACTION, CLI.  F I TOOK ABOUT THE TRAVELS  RIGHT NOW WE WENT TO THE  CHOCONUVO RUMORS ARE  WHEREWITH THE BAGEL  CHOCOLATE FACTORY. >>GUEST:  WHAT I  ORIGINALLY WANTED TO DO  WITH MAKE A STANDARDIZED  EXTRACT OF CHOCOLATE  WITHIN THE CAPSULE, BUT  THAT WHAT I DISCOVERED  DARK CHOCOLATE IS  BASICALLY A STANDARDIZED  EXTRACT OF CHOCOLATE  ESPECIALLY IN 91 OR 74%  EXTRACT. IT'S ALMOST EXT  PURE CHOCOLATE SO I  FIGURED IF I COULD DO  THAT, MAKE IT TASTE  LUCIUS, THEN I REALIZED  OH. MOST AMERICANS HATE  DARK CHOCOLATE--DELICIOUS CHOCOLATE--DELICIOUS. >>HOST: RIGHT. >>GUEST:  SO I HAD A BIT  OF A PROBLEM, BUT THAT I  FIGURED AS AN INGREDIENT  WE HAD NOT USED FOR 20  YEARS AND PRETTY MUCH  EVERYWHERE THE DOG EVERY  EATING IN ABOUT 20 YEARS  AGO. IT WAS A LIQUID AGO  FORM OF PLANT STEROLS. F  IT WAS ACTUALLY THIS. IT  LIKE A WAXY, LIQUID FORM  OF PLANT STEROLS, SO OF   IT'S KIND OF BACK TO THE  FUTURE. I THOUGHT FUTURE  BECAUSE I LOOKS AND  BEHAVES LIKE THAT--FAT I  THOUGHT PERHAPS I COULD  ADD THAT TO DARK  CHOCOLATE AND JUST AS  MILK CHOCOLATE, JUST AS  MILK FAT MAKES MILK  CHOCOLATE MILDER AND  CREAMIER, MAYBE THIS  CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING  INGREDIENT TO DO THE ING  SAME THING TO DARK  CHOCOLATE. I THOUGHT IT  MIGHT WORK. IT DID NOT  MIGHT WORK. >>HOST: [LAUGHTER]  >>GUEST:  IT DID  REMARKABLY WORK, AND OUR  (...) I STARTED OF (...)  COURSE WITH THE BEST  CHOCOLATE I COULD FIND.   I HAD TASTED HUNDREDS I   AND HUNDREDS OF AND HUND  VARIETIES OF 66, 74, VAR  ALDO PREVENTATIVES, 91,  AND THE 3 DIFFERENT  LEVELS OF DARK LEVELS OF  CHOCOLATE, 66 BASICALLY  EMULATES MILK CHOCOLATE,  74% FOR A TRUE DARK  CHOCOLATE EXPERIENCE, 91  FOCHOCOLATE EXPERIENCE, %  A SERIOUS DARK  CHOCOLATE. TYPICAL DARK  CHOCOLATE IS DRY. CHOCOL  TYPICAL DARK CHOCOLATE T  IS KIND OF CHALKY AND  KIND OF BITTER, KIND OF  GRAINY. ARE DARK  CHOCOLATE--OUR, HAS THE  CREAMY TEXTURE OF MILK  CHOCOLATE. IN SO  BASICALLY YOU MIGHT SAY  HE'S NOT A CANDY  MANUFACTURER. YC MAKING  THIS DARK CHOCOLATE FOR?  THIS IS NOT CANDY.--ALL  THOSE PRESER PERCENTAGES  IS HE. THIS IS A SERIOUS  EXTRACT OF DARK  CHOCOLATE, CITIES, 74,  91, YOUR CHOICE.--606. I  LOOKED AT 74 AND 91. IF  YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT YOU  YOUR DARK CHOCOLATE  YOU'LL FALL IN LOVE WITH  66 BUT IT IS STILL DARK  CHOCOLATE. USUALLY DOES  CUT UP OUR DARK CUT UP O  CHOCOLATE IS 66%. WHAT C  IS MOST IMPORTANT, NOT  ONLY DO YOU HAVE A ONLY   SQUARE CUT THIS FOR EACH  MEAL OR TWO OF YOUR  LARGEST MEAL. IT WILL  LOWER YOUR CHOLESTEROL,  10, 15, 20% MORE  ESPECIALLY IF YOU MAKE  CHANGES IN YOUR DIET, CH  ADD MORE FIBER, REDUCE  YOUR SATURATION AND TAKE.  YOU CAN EXPECT  DOUBLE-DIGIT REELECTION--  REDUCTION IN LDL BAD  CHOLESTEROL.--INTAKE.  WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO  NOTICE, BECAUSE WE  APPROACHED THIS AS APPRO  REALLY A STANDARDIZED  EXTRACT, CHOCOLATE WHEN  YOU LOOK AT THE SUGAR  LEVELS, EACH OF THE  SQUARES, WHICHEVER ONE  YOU CHOOSE, 66, 74, 91  THEY ARE ALL 26 CAL. >>HOST: RIGHT. >>GUEST:  'S ONLY 26 >>G  CAL. WHAT I WANT  EVERYBODY TO KNOW MACIS   THAT THIS IS THE SUGAR  AMOUNTED EACH OF THEM. >>HOST: RIGHT. >>GUEST:  IN THE CITY  SUCCESS 1.8 G OF SUGAR.  RENUMBER A TEASPOON IS  ABOUT 5 G SO THERE IS  BASICALLY WONDERED IF IT  TEASPOON AND THE 66.--6 . THERE IS.--REMEMBER.  THERE IS LESS, QUARTER T  OF A TEASPOON IN 74,  THERE'S ABOUT A 10TH OF   A TEASPOON AND 91. SO  THAT IF THE LEVEL OF  SUGARS AND 26 CAL OF MY  CHOCOLATE PER SQUARE.  THAT IS THE LEVEL OF  SUGAR IN 26 CAL OF SUGAR  GRAPES OR PEACHES, PLUMS, [READING] >>GUEST:  AS WE CAN SEE  SOMETHING WE CONSIDER  LOGAN SUGAR, CERTAINLY I  DO, BLUEBERRY AND KIWIS  YOU WOULD BE AT .544 G Y  OR 26 CAL. YOU ARE MORE  THAN DOUBLED, ALMOST  TRIPLE THE LEVEL OF  CERTAIN(...) --4.5 OR 4.  TRIPLE THE LEVEL OF THE  74. ABOUT 10 TIMES MORE  THAN 91. WHAT'S TRULY  AMAZING, WHY THIS IS AMA  VERY LIKE A STANDARDIZED  EXTRACT OF CHOCOLATE, EX  NOT A CANDY, IT IS  DELICIOUS. I MEAN YOU  WILL NOT FIND A BETTER  TAKING DARK CHOCOLATE,  CREAMIER DARK CHOCOLATE  IN THE WORLD. BUT IF YOU  LOOK AT IT VERSUS  VEGETABLES, SUGAR COTTON  THROW 26 CAL OF  EVERYTHING FROM TOMATOES  DOWN THE DOWN THE  CAULIFLOWER--LOW IN. >>HOST: RIGHT. >>GUEST:  EVEN  CAULIFLOWER, 2 G OF  CAULIFLOWER, 2 G OF CAUL  SUGAR IN 26 CAL OF  CAULIFLOWER IS AGAINST  ONLY ONE HALF A GRAM GRAM--AGAIN, OR 1.8 G IN  THE CITY 6%, SO JUST TO  GIVE AN EVEN GREATER  SENSE OF HOW ABSOLUTELY  UNIQUE OUR CHOCOLATE IS, IS,--66%, OUR DARK  CHOCOLATE IS, THE BEST  PART OF ALL IS FIRST OF  AUGUST WENT TO BE THE  BEST TASTING CHOCOLATE,  DARK CHOCOLATE YOU'VE  EVER HAD, AND THEN ON EV  THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE  ONE OR TWO SQUARES WITH  YOUR(...)  I WAS A ONE  SQUARE WITH YOUR 2  LARGEST MEAL OF THE DAY,  ONE SQUARE EACH MEAL YOU  WILL DOUBLE-- EXPECTED  DOUBLE-DIGIT REDUCTION IN  TOTAL CHOLESTEROL AND  LDL CHOLESTEROL, AND  ACTIVE INGREDIENT THAT  HAS BEEN PROVED BY US  FOOD AND DRUG  ADMINISTRATION. SO IT'S  INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY I  TO ENJOY THE MOST  DELICIOUS CHOCOLATE AND  WITHOUT QUESTION THE WIT  MOST PART HAVE THE  CHOCOLATE IN THE WORLD. >>HOST: --HEART HEALTHY.  FROM EATING CHOCOLATE, I  MEAN THAT IS, IT TAKES A  SECOND TO SINK IN SECOND  BECAUSE WE'RE HEARING  THINGS WE THOUGHT WERE  ONLY THE STUFF OF ONLY T  DREAMS. I MEAN REALLY  CHOCOLATE THAT IS GOING  TO BE SO GOOD FOR YOU, T  IT CAN HELP TO LOWER  CHOLESTEROL LIKE THAT?  YOU HAVE TO TRY IT THOUGH THOUGH. IF SOMEONE DOES  NOT LIKE DARKER NOT LIKE  CHOCOLATE GO FOR THE CHO  MORE WILD ONE. THAT IS  THE ONE I LOVE. WE ENJOY  AT HOME. ANDREW LESSMAN  STOPS ANY FACTORING IT  BECAUSE OF THE HEAT AND  SHIPPING AND EVERYTHING,  SO NOW IS A GREAT TIME S  TO DO IT. MOVE ON. MANY  OF YOU WHO HAVE OF YOU W  CRANBERRY JUICE IS  MORNING?

CRANBERRY HAS MANY, MANY  WONDERFUL BENEFITS AND W  IT HAS BEEN KNOWN AS(...) FOR YOU KNOW, LONG, LONG  TIME. ANDREW LESSMAN'S  CRANBERRY PRODUCTS IS  GOING TO HELP REPLACE  THIS. THIS BOTTLE OVER  HERE THAT LOOK SO  FAMILIAR TO MANY OF US,  ANDREW LESSMAN A LOOK SO  INNOCENT. IT LOOKS SO  GOOD BUT IT HIDES A DARK  SECRET. >>GUEST:  WELL IT IS A  REALLY DELICIOUS SECRET. >>HOST: [LAUGHTER]  >>GUEST:  IT IS JUST >>G  FULL OF SUGAR BECAUSE  INHERENTLY CRANBERRIES  ARE BITTER, AND IN FACT  WHAT I WILL DO SOME TIME  THAT WHEN MY TEA, I BUY  THESE ULTRA, ULTRA  CONCENTRATE OF FRUIT. >>HOST: RIGHT. >>GUEST:  THEY ARE >>GUE  ALMOST LIKE SYRUPS. ALMO  FRANZ XAVIER THE SILVER  EXTRACTS. I WILL PUT A  TEASPOON OR TABLESPOON  INTO MY TEA, AND THE ONE  THING I PUT A TEASPOON T  OF SAY CRANBERRY JUICE  EXTRACT INTO MY TEA, I  ALSO PUT A TABLESPOON OR  TEASPOON OF ANOTHER TEAS  JUICE EXTRACT(...)  >>HOST: RIGHT. >>GUEST:  SPECIFICALLY  BECAUSE CRANBERRY IS BEC  JUST SO BITTER. IT'S JUS  JUST THE WAY IT IS.  UNFORTUNATELY. SO IF WE  PLAN ON ENJOYING  CRANBERRY JUICE TO GET  THE BENEFITS OF THIS  PRODUCT YOU'RE GOING TO  END UP CONSUMING END UP   HUNDREDS OF CALORIES OF  CRANBERRY JUICE WHICH  MEANS YOU ARE CONSUMING  DOZENS OF CALORIES, OR  DOZENS OF GRAMS, 50, 60,  70 G OF MORE OF SUGAR  WHICH IS THE LAST THING  ANY OF US WANT TO DO. AS  MUCH AS CRANBERRY IS  HEALTHY FOR OUR BLADDER  AND URINARY TRACT AND AN  ITS FUNCTION, THE LAST  THING WE WANT TO BE THIN  DOING IS STARTING TO  DRASTICALLY INCREASE OUR  SUGAR CONSUMPTION, A  CALORIC CONSUMPTION SO  AGAIN THIS IS A VERY  SIMPLE ANSWER, VERY  SIMPLE SOLUTION. THEY SI  ARE SMALL CAPSULES, EASY  TO SWALLOW CAPSULES AS  YOU CAN SEE THERE. AND  I'M JUST GOING TO OPEN  THE CAPSULE, AND YOU CAN  SEE ALL YOU ARE LOOKING  AT IS THE EXTRACT. >>HOST:  THE COLOR OF  COURSE. >>GUEST:  OF CRANBERRY  FRUIT AND IT IS THE  PURPLE COLOR OF  CRANBERRIES SO THOSE  LITTLE BERRIES YOU SEE L  ON THE BOTTLE, BUT WE  HAVE DONE IS SIMPLY WE  REMOVE THE THINGS WE DO  NOT WANT. THERE IS NO  NEED FOR US TO BE  CONSUMING CALORIES WITH  THIS PRODUCT, AND IT IS   A SIMPLE, A SIMPLE,  STRAIGHTFORWARD PRODUCT.  THE BEST TESTAMENT TO  THIS PRODUCT IS, IS THE  SCIENCE ABOUT CRANBERRY.  OF COURSE CRANBERRY HAD  BEEN VIEWED POSITIVELY  TRADITIONALLY FOR  CENTURIES, BUT IT IS ONE  OF THOSE THINGS THAT  SCIENCE HAS REDISCOVERED  THE TRADITIONAL  PHYSICIANS AND  TRADITIONAL TRADITIONAL  PRACTITIONERS KNEW WHAT  THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT  WHEN IT COMES TO  CRANBERRY, AND ACTUALLY  THE SCIENTISTS,  PHYSICIANS NOW KNOW  EXACTLY HOW CRANBERRY  GOES ABOUT DELIVERING GO  ITS REMARKABLE BENEFITS  TO US. AND WHAT IS TO US  REALLY INCREDIBLE ABOUT  THIS PRODUCT, OF COURSE  WE WENT OUT AND SOUGHT A  CRANBERRY EXTRACT THAT  JUST DID NOT GET IN THE  WAY OF DELIVERING WHEN  MOTHER NATURE HAS TO  DELIVER, PROMISE OF  CRANBERRY, SO WE GOT THE  MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD  PRODUCT DELIVERING  INGREDIENTS NECESSARY IN  FOR THE BENEFITS. AND FO  THE REVIEWS BACK US UP.  IF YOU LOOK AT THE  REVIEWS ON THIS PRODUCT   I THINK IT'S GOT AT I TH  LEAST SEVERAL HUNDRED  REVIEWS AND OF THOSE  REVIEWS I THINK ABOUT RE  90% ARE FIVE STAR  REVIEWS. I'M NOT SURE RE  HOW MANY. >>HOST:  547 TOTAL, AN  87% OF THOSE. >>GUEST:  ARE FIVE STARS,  SO UPWARDS OF 97, 98%  ARE FIVE STAR REVIEWS. >>HOST: RIGHT. >>GUEST:  WHAT I ALWAYS  SAY, IT IS NICE TO HAVE  THE SCIENCE ON OUR SIDE,  AND THEN INGREDIENTS WE  PUT TOGETHER, THE WAY WE  ASSEMBLE THE PRODUCT IS  NOT TO GET IN THE WAY OF  THE SCIENCE, IN THIS THE  CASE NOT GET AN WAY  MOTHER NATURE, AND THAT  IF WE DO A GOOD JOB THE  ULTIMATE VALIDATION OF  THAT JOB WOULD BE THE  REVIEWS WHICH IS THE REV  CASE WITH PRETTY MUCH CA  ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS. >>HOST:  LET ME TAKE YOU  THROUGH THE PRESENT ON  THIS ONE BECAUSE I WAS  ADVISED AGAIN THAT THIS  IS THAT MARKED SPECIAL  SAVINGS.--MARCH.  >>GUEST: THAT IS RIGHT!  THIS IS OUR MONTHLY  SPECIAL, MARGIN ADVANCED. ADVANCED.--MARCH. SO AS  BASICALLY A TODAY'S  SPECIAL PRICE AND. >>HOST: THIS IS >>HOST:   SOMETHING WE'VE NOT BEEN  ABLE TO DO BEFORE, BUT  THIS IS NOT GOAL  OFFICIALLY LIVE BACK IN   A COUPLE OF DAYS.--GO. A  WE ARE GOING TO HONOR IT  AND I FIGURE GOING TO AN  GET THE BIGGEST SAVINGS  OF THE ENTIRE YEAR ON  CRANBERRY. YOU'RE GOING  TO BE ABLE TO GET A TO B  FIRST TO TAKE YOU FIRST   THROUGH THOSE OPTIONS. T  IF YOU LIKE TO TRY WE  HAVE A 30 CAPS, NORMALLY  PRICED VERY AFFORDABLY P  AT $14.90. JUST DID A  $10.90. [READING] >>HOST:  TONIGHT AND FOR  THE MONTH OF MARCH IS ON  $39.90, SAVES A 25. >>GUEST:  ON A GENERAL  LEVEL I TAKE ONE CAPSULE  DAILY. MURIEL DOES THE  EXACT SAME THING. SOME  PEOPLE DEPENDING WHAT  THEIR DOCTOR MIGHT  RECOMMEND MY TAKE MORE  THAN ONE, BUT IT IS A  PRODUCT THAT ON A DAILY  BASIS WENT TO CAPSULES  DAILY(...)  WHEN YOU DAI  LOOK AT THE PRICING IS  MORE THAN A DIME CAPSULE  TODAY SO THE INCREDIBLY  AFFORDABLE PRODUCT, AND   I ENCOURAGE YOU TO READ  THE REVIEWS. I COULD THE  READ SOME OF THE READ SO  REVIEWS. MAYBE I WILL  JUST GRAB A COUPLE JUST   CHARTS FROM THE VERY TOP  EAR. THEN WE WILL JUST  READ THESE.--HERE. BUT  HERE WE GO. -- A LITTLE  BIT BIT MORE THAN A DIM.  [READING] >>GUEST:  AND AGAIN IT >  IS NOT DRUG, NOT A  MEDICINE. IT JUST  PROMOTES A HEALTHY  ENVIRONMENT IN OUR  BLADDER, KIDNEYS, BLADDE  URINARY TRACT. [READING] >>HOST:  RIGHT. >>GUEST: [READING] [READING] >>GUEST:  AND I >>GUEST:  RECOMMEND YOU READ THE  REVIEWS. IT IS NOT JUST  PART OF THE AGING  PROCESS. YES THINGS  CHANGE, BUT AS MUCH AS  THERE IS THINGS THAT THE  SORT OF NATURALLY AGE,  UM, THAT IS ALSO SOME  NATURAL TOOLS WE HAVE AT  OUR DISPOSAL TO HELP US  CONTENTS MORE GRACEFULLY  WITH THE AGING PROCESS. >>HOST:  WE ARE GOING TO  HEAD OVER THIS WAY. I  KNOW WE HAVE CINNAMON KN  AND BERBERINE. AND WE'VE  GOT [INAUDIBLE]  ON THE  PHONE AS WELL. >>GUEST:  MONTHLY >>GUES  SPECIAL THROUGHOUT THEIR  MONTH OF MARCH. >>HOST:  CINNAMON AS  WELL! >>GUEST:  WE WILL CUTELY  GO THROUGH PRODUCTS PRODUCTS--QUICKLY, GO  THROUGH 4 PRODUCTS. I'M  NOT HERE AT MARCH. I NOT  HSN AT MARCH. ARE NOT  BACK TO THE MIDDLE OF  APRIL 2 I'M GONE A APRIL  COUPLE OF MONTHS SO WE  WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAD  SOME FUN PRODUCTS  AVAILABLE AT MS-- AVAILA  MONTHLY SPECIALS. I  RECORDED VIDEO THAT  DISCUSSED THEM AT LENGTH  SOA. THEN WE WILL TALK  ABOUT BERBERINE. PO >>HOST:  I KNOW DANIELA  STANDING BY. WE WILL BE  WITH YOU IN A MINUTE AND  A HALF. LET'S JUST  INTRODUCE CINNAMON  BECAUSE IT'S NOT NORMAL  REGULAR CINNAMON. >>GUEST:  WELL YOU CAN  USE IT ON YOUR CEREAL IS  OFTEN DO. LIKE CINNAMON  YOU CAN WRINKLE IN YOUR  PANCAKE BATTER WAFFLER  THINGS LIKE THAT OR PUT  IT IN YOUR YOGURT WAS  MOVIE BECAUSE IT JUST  TAKES--TASTE LIKE  CINNAMON BUT IT IS  PRODUCED ENTIRELY  DIFFERENTLY MEANING WE  START WITH THE SAME  MATERIAL, THE BARK OF MA  THE CINNAMON PLANT, BUT  IN THIS CASE WE  SPECIFICALLY EXTRACT IT  FOR CERTAIN PROTECTIVE  COMPOUNDS AGAIN THAT THE  SCIENCE HAS TOLD US HAVE  CERTAIN BENEFITS. SO WE  HAVE FOLLOW THE SCIENCE  AND SO DOING DELIVER THE  PRODUCT THAT IS INTENDED  TO SUPPORT OUR BLOOD  SUGAR METABOLISM AND  SUPPORTER INSULIN  METABOLISM. AND  UNFORTUNATELY WITH THE  SORT OF EPIDEMIC WE  SUFFER FROM AN AMERICAN  FROM OVERWEIGHT AND  OBESITY WITH THAT COMES  CHANGES AND HOW WELL WE  METABOLIZE OUR BLOOD  SUGAR AND HOW WELL SUGAR  REALLY OUR SENSITIVITY R  TO INSULIN, BASICALLY OR  IN SEPTEMBER THETY TO  INSULIN, SO IT IS  IMPORTANT FOR US TO  FOLLOW OUR DOCTORS  RECOMMENDATIONS. IS  IMPORTANT IF WE CAN TO  LOSE WEIGHT, FOCUS ON  EATING THE RIGHT FOODS,  AND TO EXTEND WE WANT A  NATURAL TOOL THAT HELPS  SUPPORT THE PROCESS AS  WELL IN TERMS OF HELPING  US SUPPORT HEALTHY BLOOD  SUGAR LEVEL, THEN THIS S  IS A GREAT OPTION. I IS   HAVE BEEN ASKED ABOUT A  PRODUCT LIKE THIS FOR  DECADES, AND UNTIL THE  SCIENCE CAME OUT ON  CINNAMON BARK EXTRACT, C  IN A MOMENT WE'LL TALK  ABOUT BERBERINE EXTRACT,  THERE WAS NOTHING  AVAILABLE TO DO THAT  APART FROM SAYING REALLY  FOCUSING ON DIET, FOCUS  ON EXERCISE. >>HOST:  OF THE FLOOR >>  AND SAY GOOD EVENING TO  DANIELLE. DANIELLE,  WELCOME TO THE MONDAY  NIGHT SHOW. YOU'RE ON NI  AIR WITH ADAM FREEMAN.  SAY HI TO ANDREW LESSMAN.   >>CALLER: ANDREW  LESSMAN HOW ARE YOU? >>GUEST: I'M GREAT,  DANIELLE. HOW WHAT YOU? >>CALLER: GREAT, GREAT,  THANK YOU. THANK FOR  TAKING MY CALL. MY  QUESTION IS(...)   >>GUEST: MY PLEASURE. >>CALLER:  I USE SEVERAL  OF YOUR PRODUCTS, AND  RECENTLY [INAUDIBLE]   MARINE COLLAGEN AND HE  LIKED THE GLUCOSAMINE. I  WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS THE  DIFFERENCE [INAUDIBLE]  N THE JOINTS.  >>GUEST: GREAT QUESTION.  IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR IF Y  JOINT TISSUE GLUCOSE--  GLUCOSAMINE AND  CHONDROITIN THE MOLECULES MOLECULES, CIMINO GLYCAN  OR GLUCOSE [LAUGHTER]   BEER SODA A MOLECULE BEE  WITH A MOUTHFUL OF A NAME NAME. >>HOST: [LAUGHTER]  >>GUEST:  BUT WHAT THEY  ARE, THEY ARE THE  STRUCTURAL MOLECULE THAT  IS PART OF THE  LUBRICATING SYSTEM OF LU  OUR SYNOVIAL FLUID, PART  OF THE ACTUAL STRUCTURE  OF OUR TENDONS AND OUR  LIGAMENTS, CARTILAGE.  THEY ARE OFTEN REFERRED  TO AS SORT OF THE BRICKS  AND MORTAR OF OUR AND MO  JOINTS. SO THAT IS A JOI  GOOD WAY TO LOOK AT  GLUCOSAMINE AND  CHONDROITIN, STRUCTURAL  MOLECULE, INPARTING  ELASTIC PROPERTIES TO EL  OUR JOINT TISSUE, KARIN  COLLAGEN ON THE OTHER  HAND(...) --MARINE,  BEFORE I WAS TALKING  ABOUT THE MOST COMMON,  THOUGH PREDOMINANT  PROTEIN IN OUR BODY, THE  PROUD DOMINANT PROTEIN P  IN OUR BODY IS COLLAGEN  PROTEIN, AND COLLAGEN  PROTEIN IT'S ROLE IS PRO  SORT OF AS AN SORT OF AS  INTEGRATING PROTEIN. IT  KIND OF FORMS A MATRIX  AROUND TISSUES OR AS ARO  PART OF TISSUES SO EVEN  OUR JOINTS, THOSE LIKE  CASINO GLYCAN,  GLUCOSAMINE AND  CHONDROITIN THAT MAKE UP  THE BRICKS AND MORTAR OF  OUR JOINTS, THEY STILL  RELY LIKE OTHER TISSUES  ON OUR BODY ON HAVING  THIS INTEGRATING PROTEIN  THAT SORT OF THE IF YOU  LOOK AT AGAIN BRICKS AND  MORTAR OF GLUCOSAMINE MO  AND CHONDROITIN, IF YOU  STILL BUILT A HOUSE OF  BRICKS AND MORTAR YOU  STILL HAVE A STRUCTURE  FOR THAT HOUSE. YOU FOR   STILL HAVE SAY THE WOOD,  TO BUY FOR, BEAMS,  STRUCTURE OF THAT HOUSE. HOUSE.--4 X 5. THAT IS  REALLY WHAT THE COLLAGEN  PEPTIDES ARE. THAT'S PEP  WHAT THE COLLAGEN WHAT T  PROTEIN IN OUR BODY IS,  SO ONE OF THE SO ONE OF   INGREDIENTS IS DEALING  WITH THE ACTUAL  STRUCTURAL TISSUE THAT  MAKES THE JOINTS IN OUR  BODY THIS UNIQUE TISSUE  THAT'S UNIQUELY FLEXIBLE  BUT UNIQUELY STRONG. BUT  THEN THAT INTEGRATING  PROTEIN THAT KEEPS IT PR  ALL TOGETHER, KEEP THAT  STRUCTURE ALTOGETHER STR  THAT IS THE COLLAGEN  PEPTIDES AND THAT'S WHY  THE 2 WORKED PERFECTLY  HAND-IN-HAND. ONE IS  BRICKS AND MORTAR, ONE B  IS SORT OF THE IS SORT O  UNDERLYING OR OVERLYING  STRUCTURE THAT THE JOINT  TISSUE RELIES ON, LIKE  ANY GENERIC BODY WHETHER  MUSCLE TISSUE, OUR BONES,  THAT IS COLLAGEN  THAT   PEPTIDE AND COLLAGEN  PROTEIN THAT IS  ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL FOR  THE STRUCTURE OF OUR  BONES, STRUCTURAL(...)   ESSENTIAL FOR ART  STRUCTURE OF ARTERIES ST  AND VEINS,--OUR, AND  OBVIOUSLY ESSENTIAL FOR  THIS SKIN AS WELL. THIS   POLITO MADE SENSE.  >>CALLER: YES, THANK YOU  VERY MUCH. >>GUEST:  DANIELLE? >>CALLER: YES. >>GUEST:  IT MADE SENSE  HOPEFULLY, GOOD. >>HOST: --HOPEFULLY THAT.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  THE QUESTION, DANIELLE.  WE APPRECIATE IT AND  APPRECIATE YOU. IF YOU  GOT A QUESTION FOR GOT A  ANDREW LESSMAN(...)  >>GUEST:  SOMETIMES WE  GET A LITTLE WORDY IN MY  INSERT. >>HOST: [LAUGHTER]  >>GUEST: --I. BUT YOU  KNOW I TRY TO BE. >>HOST: THEY ARE VERY  THOROUGH. >>GUEST:  THOROUGH,  DESCRIPTIVE AS POSSIBLE,  BUT THEY ARE BOTH PART B  OF THAT, THAT SAME  STRUCTURE BECAUSE  REMEMBER OUR JOINTS,  CERTAINLY THE CONNECTIVE  TISSUE LASER ROLE--PLAYS  A, IN OUR JOINTS BEING  STRONG AND BEING HELD IN  PLACE THE SAME TIME PLAC  BEING INCREDIBLY FLEXIBLE FLEXIBLE. BUT THEN LIKE  ALL THE TISSUES IN OUR  BODY THAT REQUIRES AN  INTEGRATING STRUCTURE AS  WELL THAT THEY DEPEND ON  THE COLLAGEN PEPTIDES TH  AND INTEGRATE THEIR  STRUCTURE TO GRADE THE  STABLE JOINTS WE ENJOYED. >>HOST:  IF YOU GOT A  QUESTION 1-866-376-8255.  ONLY ABOUT 60 SECONDS OR  90 SECONDS LEFT ON THE  MONTHLY SPECIAL. AGAIN M  AN EARLY ACCESS TO OUR  MARCH MONTHLY SPECIAL OF  CINNAMON, AND EVEN TO  THIS DAY MCMENAMIN--  ANDREW LESSMAN CINNAMON  PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE  IN CHINESE MEDICINE. >>GUEST:  AT THE  BERBERINE, TURMERIC AND  GINGER, BUT CINNAMON IS  SOMETHING--AS DOES, THAT  MORE FASCINATING TODAY  THAT IT'S ROLE IN THAT I  CHINESE MEDICINE, EVEN C  IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK,  GO BACK 1000 YEARS, YOU  START LOOKING AT THE  TRADE GOING ON BETWEEN  EUROPE AND ASIA THAT LED  THE DISCOVERY OF NORTH  AMERICA, THE SECOND  DISCOVERY OF NORTH  AMERICA'S SAY BY COLUMBSS THAT SECOND DISCOVERY TH  WAS DRIVEN BY A DESIRE W  TO FIND AN EASIER WAY TO  GET AN ACCESS THOSE  PSEUDO-SPICE ROOTS, AND  CINNAMON WAS ONE OF THOSE  ORIGINAL SPICES. IT'S  TREASURED FOR ITS FLAVOR  AND CULINARY PROPERTIES  BACK THEM. JUST AS BACK   CHANCE AND-- CHINESE  MEDICINE AND AYURVEDIC  MEDICINE APPRECIATE IT  FOR CENTURIES, CINNAMON  HAS OTHER ROLLBACK HAS O  WITHIN OUR BODY, AND THE  ROLE WE APPRECIATE IS  HELPING TO SUPPORT OUR  HEALTHY BLOOD SUGAR  METABOLISM AND HEALTHY  BLOOD INSULIN METABOLISM. >>HOST: RIGHT. >>GUEST:  AND BERBERINE,  BERBERINE IS IN THE  OTHER(...) ! ITS BEAUTIF  COLOR, CLOSELY RELATED C  TO TURMERIC. AND TO TURM  TURMERIC IS SORT OF A  BRIGHT ORANGE. BERBERINE,  BARBARY EXTRACT IS  BRIGHT YELLOW. AND YOU  GET TO(...)  AND WHOEVER  WOULD NEED ARTIFICIAL  COLORS WHEN YOU HAVE  NATURAL BOTANICALS WITH  THAT KIND OF BEAUTIFUL  COLOR? >>HOST: WHY? >>GUEST:  AND WITHOUT  GETTING INTO THE MORE  COMPLICATED SCIENCE IN  OUR BODY, AND NOW THEY  UNDERSTAND EXACTLY ON A  CELLULAR LEVEL WHAT  BERBERINE ACTUALLY DOES  IN TERMS OF THE  BIOCHEMISTRY OF BIOCHEMI  OURSELVES M--OUR CELLS B  BERBERINE ALSO HAS A BER  WIDE RANGE OF BENEFITS,  BUT WHAT'S MOST EXCITING  ENDOCRINE SCIENCE IS END  IT'S ROLE ALSO LIKE  CINNAMON IN SUPPORTING  HEALTHY BLOOD SUGAR  METABOLISM, HELPING  SUPPORT HEALTHY INSULIN  METABOLISM, BUT IT ALSO  BENEFITS US IN TERMS OF  LIPID METABOLISM AS LIPI  WELL, CHOLESTEROL AND  LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN  CHOLESTEROL. BUT WHAT'S  INTERESTING ABOUT  BERBERINE, CINNAMON YOU  CAN TAKE ONE OR TWO  CAPSULES DAILY. WITH THE  BERBERINE IF YOU REALLY  WANT TO EMBRACE THE  SCIENCE ON BERBERINE YOU  NEED TO TAKE ONE OR TWO  CAPSULES WITH EACH MEAL  MEANING 3 TO 6 CAPSULES  DAILY SO TAKING A MORE  SIGNIFICANT DOSE OF  BERBERINE, AND THAT'S  EXACTLY WHY YOU READ TO  720 CAPSULE SUPPLY  BECAUSE IF YOU'RE TAKING  ABOUT THREE CAPSULES  DAILY THAT IS GOING TO D  BE ABOUT AN EIGHT MONTH  SUPPLY. SIX CAPSULES  DAILY, 4 MONTH SUPPLY.  BUT BERBERINE IS  SOMETHING THAT IF YOU DO  A LITTLE RESEARCH ONLINE  YOU ARE GOING TO BE JUST  ASTOUNDED BY THE RECENT  FINDINGS IN RESEARCH ON  BERBERINE. SOMETHING WE  HAVE ONLY BEEN MAKING HA  FOR A FEW YEARS BECAUSE  WE REALLY NEEDED TO  VALIDATE AS I ALWAYS DO.  EVEN IF WE COULD  INTRODUCE A PRODUCT THAT  WOULD-- IT WOULD BE VERY  POPULAR I WOULDN'T--WON'T  DO THAT UNTIL WE  COMPLETELY VALIDATE THE  PRODUCT, THE INGREDIENT,  AND THE BENEFIT AND  THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE DONE  WITH THIS PRODUCT NOW. >>HOST:  WE HAD A FEW  PEOPLE CALL AND ASK PEOP  ABOUT A CERTIFICATE OF  AUTHENTICITY. WE ARE  SCHEDULED TO DO A  PRESENTATION OFF THAT  INTENT TO 50 MIN. TIME.  -- 10-15 MIN.-- ACETYL  L-CARNITINE. AS WE WERE  WALKING AROUND I SAW YOU  GUYS WERE BODILY GUYS WE  PROVIDER AND ANGELS. FOR  ANYONE WHO'S NEVER SEEN  ANDREW LESSMAN, THE ANDR  WHOLE EXPERIENCE IS A  IMPORTANT. >>GUEST: WHAT IS A LOT >  IF COMPANIES THAT TRY TO  DO THINGS--OF, THAT ARE  SOCIALLY ORIENTED,  SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE,  BETTER CHARITABLE, AND A  NUMBER YEARS AGO(...)   I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SOMEONE  WHO MY PARENTS TAUGHT ME  THE IDEA TO DONATE TO  CHARITIES, BUT I WANTED  TO DO SOMETHING MORE TO   THAN DONATING. I REALLY  WANTED TO CREATE  SOMETHING THAT MADE A  MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCE,  AND FORTUNATELY I KNEW A  GENTLEMAN WHO HAD A  CHARITY COVENANT ANGELS  THAT DONATED CHILDREN'S  VITAMINS THROUGHOUT THE  WORLD. AND I KNEW THAT  THE SCIENCE OF PRENATAL  VITAMINS WAS THE MOST  COMPELLING SCIENCE WITH  ANY SUPPLEMENTATION  IMAGINABLE, AND  UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS NO  ONE IN THE WORLD ONE IN   DONATING PRENATAL  VITAMINS. BUT HOWARD'S  VITAMIN ANGELS--HOWARD  AT, WAS KIND ENOUGH TO  SAY THAT I WOULD MAKE  PRENATAL VITAMINS, HE  WOULD GET THEM INTO THE  HANDS OF MILLIONS OF  MOTHERS AROUND THE WORLD  AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT  THIS WONDERFUL GENTLEMAN  DID SO WE HAVE TOGETHER  GOTTEN OVER 1 BILLION  VITAMINS, ALMOST  1,000,000,000 VITAMINS 1  AS RIGHT NOW, OVER 1  BILLION IN JUST A FEW  MONTHS TO MANY--NEEDY  MOTHERS AROUND THE MOTHE  WORLD. IT JUST CHANGES  THE HELP OF AN ENTIRE  COMMUNITIES, CHANGES CHANGES--HEALTH, THE  ECONOMIC HEALTH OF THOSE  COMMUNITIES BECAUSE A  CHILD. PRENATAL IS GOOD  TO BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE  BETTER TO ITS, ITS  COMMUNITY THERE AFTER, C  SO IT IS UNEXCITING  WONDERFUL THING WE GET W  TO DO. AS I HAVE SAID WE  ARE PEOPLE--AN EXCITING,  HAVE OFTEN ASKED WHY DID  I MOVE COMPANY OUTSIDE  THE US? IT WOULD BE LIKE  SO MANY COMPANIES IT  WOULD BE EASIER TO MAKE  PRODUCTS OVERSEAS, BUT  WE'RE AN AMERICAN  COMPANY. WE ARE AN  AMERICAN. EVERYONE WHO  ENJOYS MY PRODUCTS IF  AMERICAN,--IS, SO IT  MAKES SENSE FOR US TO  STAY HERE, AND THE ONE  THING WE DO EXPORT IS  SORT OF THE KINDNESS OF  OUR PRODUCTS. AND BY THE  WAY ABOUT ONE FOURTH OF  THE PRENATAL VITAMINS WE  DONATE OUR IN THE US SO  IT'S REALLY FIRST COME,  FIRST SERVE IN THE US,  THAT ALL THE REST OF THEM  WE OFFER OVERSEAS,  WE   SHARE WITH THOSE WHO  AREN'T AS PRIVILEGED AS  WE ARE HERE IN THE US. >>HOST:  IT IS A  WONDERFUL THING. YOU WON  FIND DIVIDED IN-- FINEST  VITAMINS FOR YOU AND VIT  YOUR FAMILY, AND IN  RETURN YOU ARE BUYING  SOMETHING THAT IS SOMETH  HELPING SOMEBODY ELSE. ELSE.--BUYING. WE LIVED  TO SAY SO INTO THE MIX T  OF THIS IS ALL BEING  MANUFACTURED WITH THAT  ALL SOLAR POWERED  FACILITY. I MEAN ANDREW  LESSMAN, EVEN THAT ALONE  HOW MANY PLACES ARE HOW   THERE TODAY IN THE WORLD  THAT ARE ALSO EMPOWERED? >>GUEST: --ALL SOLAR  POWERED? WELL PROBABLY P  AS FAR AS THE PRIVATE  COMPANIES, PROBABLY  NOT. >>HOST: THAT IT'S  CRAZY. >>GUEST: WE WERE TALKING  TO FACILITIES THAT ARE  HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF  THOUSANDS OF WHERE THE  AND WOULD REQUIRE H--SQUE FFEET, ENORMOUS AMOUNT O  ENERGY TO FUEL THE  PROCESS, LIGHTING,  COOLING, AND THE COOLING  IN THE SUMMER HERE  OBVIOUSLY IS A 1500\u00b0. OB  AND IN THE WINTER, BUT  ABSOLUTELY NO ENERGY, NO  FOSSIL FUEL. WE ARE  ENTIRELY SORT OF A  STAND-ALONE POWER SOURCE  HERE, SO WE ARE ASK(...)  RESPONSIBLE AS WE ARE IN  TRYING TO MAKE AN  SUCCEEDING IN MAKING THE  MOST UNIQUE SUPPLEMENTS  IN THE WORLD THAT IN THE  DELIVER BENEFITS I THINK  RIGHT NOW WE PROBABLY  HAVE BEEN APPROACHING 50  OR 60,000 TOTAL REVIEWS  AT HSN.COM AVERAGING  ABOUT 4.7 STARS ALMOST A  SO WE DO A GOOD JOB IN  YOUR EYES. WE ALSO WANT  TO, I WANT TO LEAVE THIS  PLACE DOME HEAD DID A  GOOD JOB IN SOMEONE  ELSE'S EYES. AND ALSO IT  IS NICE TO KNOW MY  PARENTS ARE PROUD OF HOW  I GO ABOUT DOING WHAT I  DO BECAUSE WHATEVER THEY  DID WHEN I WAS THE KID(.. KID(...)  >>HOST: [LAUGHTER]  >>CALLER:  THEY CONFUSED  IN ME THE IDEA THAT IT I  IS NOT JUST GOOD ENOUGH  TO MAKE A PRODUCT. YOU  HAVE TO MAKE THE BEST  PRODUCT AND YOU TO GO  ABOUT MAKING IT  RESPONSIBLY, AND WE DO R  SO ENVIRONMENTALLY,  SOCIALLY, IN TERMS OF  QUALITY. >>HOST:  IT IS FUNNY I  SAY IT, BUT KNOWING  ANDREW LESSMAN AS I DO  AND YOU DO,--INFUSED,  ANYTHING THAT THIS  GENTLEMAN BROUGHT TO  MARKET I WOULD BUY  KNOWING THAT HE PUTS KNO  INTO IT NOTHING BUT THE  BEST. IT'S RIGHT! >>GUEST: WELL IF YOU'RE  GOING TO DO SOMETHING I  THINK IT WAS MAYBE  BROUGHT ALTHOUGH EMERSON  WHO SAID THIS IS ALWAYS  ONE RIGHT WAY TO DO  EVERYTHING-- RALPH WALDO  EMERSON. THAT RIGHT WAY,  IT'S A CONSTANT PURSUIT  SO JUST BECAUSE HE MADE   A GREAT PRODUCT AGAIN AGAIN--TODAY DOES NOT  MEAN WITH THE RESOURCES  AVAILABLE IN A YEAR THAT  YOU SHOULD NOT CHANGE I . TO MAKE IT EVEN BETTER,  AND THAT IS WHAT WE  ACCOMPLISH AND  CONSISTENTLY DONE. THE  PRODUCT IN YOUR HAND,  ALPHA LIPOIC ACID ALPHA   WIDGETS OR OTHER SPECIAL  FOR MONTHLY SPECIAL FOR  MARCH.-- WHICH IS OUR.  THAT WAS A PRODUCT WE  TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF  SPECIFICALLY FOR FOLKS S  IT WAS OFTEN INGREDIENT  TALKED ABOUT. FOLKS ARE  HAVING CHALLENGES WITH  LEGITIMATE CAPITALISM,  BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL-- BLOO  BLOOD SUGAR METABOLISM  GET THEIR BODY UP  PROTECTIVE NUTRIENT. NOT  A DRUG OR MEDICINE OR  ANYTHING LIKE THAT. ANYT  ALPHA LIPOIC ACID WAS  ALWAYS AT THE TOP OF THE  LIST, BUT THE HIGHEST  LEVELS WERE ABLE TO GET  UP ALPHA LIPOIC ACID UP   WERE ORIGINALLY 100 MG  BUT THERE IS A SOURCE OF  ALPHA LIPOIC ACID OUT OF  EUROPE, GERMANY. I'M  GOING TO GO VISIT THEM G  IN THE COMING MONTHS, IN  BUT THEY MAKE AN ALPHA  LIPOIC ACID THAT IS(...)  IT'S PROBABLY 10 TIMES  MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE  ALPHA LIPOIC ACID YOU AL  SEE IN EVERY PRODUCT ON  THE MARKET, BUT  UNFORTUNATELY DOES HAVE  TWO MEET ON ACCEPTABLE  LEVELS OF CONTAMINANTS. CONTAMINANTS.--TO ME.  THAT THEY ARE NOT AS THA  PURE AS I WOULD LIKE,  WHERE AS THE PRODUCT OF  EUROPE, GERMANY IS  PRISTINE IN TERMS OF  PURITY. I'M JUST GOING P  TO GO THERE, BEGGED THEM  TO SELL BUT--IT TO US  LOWER PRICE BECAUSE IT L  IS SUCH AN EXPENSIVE RAW  MATERIAL. THAT WE HAVE  BEEN ABLE TO MORE THAN  TRIPLE THE LEVEL OF TRIP  ALPHA LIPOIC ACID IN ALP  THIS PRODUCT AS A RESULT  OF THIS NEW MATERIAL  BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS A  MORE PURE BUT IT ALSO IS  EASIER FOR US TO  ENCAPSULATE AND DELIVER  THEIR PRECIOUS ALPHA  LIPOIC ACID WHICH IS  REFERRED TO AS A  UNIVERSAL ANTIOXIDANT.  THERE ARE SOME FOLKS  ALMOST LOOK AT ALPHA  LIPOIC ACID  PREFERENTIALLY OVER THE  PROTECTION OF COQ-10  AFFORDS,--THAN, WHAT I  LIKE THEM BOTH TO THE  SAME DEGREE, BUT ALPHA  LIPOIC ACID IS A BIT LIP  I'VE ALSO BEEN TAKING I'  FOR OVER 30 YEARS. >>HOST:  AND JUSTLY KNOW  THAT MARGE MONTHLY  SPECIAL PRICING--MARCH,  I'M THRILLED TO SAY  BECAUSE WE'VE NEVER DONE  THIS BEFORE, GIVING YOU  EARLY ACCESS TO THE BEST  PRICING OF THE YEAR  BECAUSE ANDREW LESSMAN,  THIS WOULD NOT TYPICALLY  BE A TODAY'S SPECIAL  WETTED? >>GUEST: --WOULD IT?  WOULD NEVER DO ALPHA  LIPOIC ACID AS A TODAY'S  SPECIAL. WE HAD PLANS ON  DOING SO. AND IT'S ALSO  RAW MATERIAL BUT IF I  WOULD OPEN THE CAPSULE W  IT JUST DID NOT LOOK  PLEASANT. IT WAS A  DIFFICULT MATERIAL TO  ENCAPSULATE. >>HOST: RIGHT. >>GUEST:  BUT THIS NEW  MATERIAL WE HAVE THAT I  TALKED ABOUT OUT OF  GERMANY, I MEAN LOOK AT  THAT.--IT'S. THAT'S WHY  WE CAN GET MORE MATERIAL  INTO THE CAPSULE.  UNFORTUNATELY, WELL  FORTUNATELY IT IS STILL  (...) IT IS A BEST PRICE  WE'VE DONE PERHAPS FROM  IT BUT I WOULD LIKE TO  MAKE IT EVEN MORE  AFFORDABLE [LAUGHTER]  ND THAT'S PART OF WHAT I'M  GOING TO GO TO GERMANY G  TO BASICALLY IMPLORE THEM  TO GIVE US A BETTER  PRICE FOR THIS MATERIAL  BECAUSE I THINK ALPHA  LIPOIC ACID IS SO  IMPORTANT AND THE OTHER  SOURCES OF ALPHA LIPOIC  ACID A ON MARKET ARE  UNFORTUNATELY(...)  THEY  ARE SYNTHETIC PROCESSED,  THEY GO THE WAY THEY GO  ABOUT MAKING THE ALPHA  LINOLENIC ACID----LIPOIC  LEADS WHAT I CONSIDER  UNACCEPTABLE ORGANIC  CHEMICAL YOU KNOW,  WHATEVER RESIDUAL IN  THEIR PRODUCT, AND A  RESIDUE IT IS  UNACCEPTABLE TO ME. SO U  WE WERE ABLE TO CHANGE  HER MATERIAL, THE LOWER  THE COST FOR MILLIGRAMS   I WOULD LIKE TO LOWER I   THE COST OF MILLIGRAMS  EVEN MORE BECAUSE THIS E  IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT  INGREDIENT. >>HOST: HAD OVER THIS  WAY, FOR THOSE FOLKS  LOOKING FOR ACETYL  L-CARNITINE WE ARE ABOUT  5 MIN. AWAY, I PROMISE.  IT IS AMAZING ANDREW  LESSMAN TO SEE THE TEAM  BEHIND THE SCENES AT  WORK. IS A 24/7  OPERATION. >>GUEST: ONE DAY THROUGH  THURSDAY YES.--MONDAY.  MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY  WE WILL RUN BASICALLY  24/7. FRIDAY IS WHEN WE  GET TO CATCH UP ON  MAINTENANCE AND ALL THE  MACHINERY AND CLEANING  AND THINGS LIKE THAT. AN  BUT IT REALLY--TYPICALLY  BECAUSE I'M ON EVERY  THREE MONTH AT HSN,  USUALLY BEFORE OUR USUAL  SHOWS, THIS IS SOMETHING  ELSE TO TALK ABOUT OFTEN,  ALL THE PRODUCT FOR THE  SHOWS ARE MADE BEFORE SH  THE SHOWS. >>HOST: RIGHT. >>GUEST:  SO USUALLY I  WOULD SAY THE TO THE SIX  WEEKS OUT FROM A SHOW WE  ARE RUNNING PROBABLY,  SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. >>HOST: WOW. >>GUEST:  SO WE WILL RUN  OVERTIME DURING THOSE  PERIODS OF TIME, SO PERI  AGAIN UNDERSCORES THE  FACT THAT WE ARE NOT  MAKING PRODUCT AND  SELLING IT THROUGH OVER   A PERIOD OF COUPLE YEARS.  WE ARE MAKING PRODUCT  THAT IS SELLING FOR TO  OVER A PERIOD OF COUPLE  WEEKS LITERALLY  [LAUGHTER]  WHICH IS  SOMETHING VERY PROUD OF. >>HOST: IT IS AS FRESH >  AS IT CAN BE. WE ARE  GOING TO GO TO THE GOING  PHONES IN A FEW MOMENTS  TIME. I DO WANT TO LET  EVERYBODY KNOW IF SECURE  MEAL REPLACEMENT  AVAILABLE. THERE IS A AV  LOT OF US WHO PERHAPS  HAVE ON THE BANDWAGON  ALREADY WHEN IT COMES TO  MAYBE LOSING SOME WEIGHT,  BECOMING A LITTLE  BECO  WIENER IN THE NEW YEAR.   I KNOW I'M NOT THE ONLY  ONE.-- LEAN THER. THE TA  PROFILE OF ANDREW  LESSMAN'S PRODUCT IS  QUITE FRANKLY ASTONISHING ASTONISHING. I WILL  ANDREW LESSMAN EXPLAIN A  IT BUT DIDN'T HAVE THE  MEAL REPLACEMENT PRODUCT  IN THE MARKET NOTHING  [LAUGHTER](...)  YOU'RE  THROWING OFF YOUR. >>GUEST: I LIKE MY >>GUE  SECURE SO MUCH I WANTED  TO WEAR IT. >>HOST: [LAUGHTER]  >>GUEST: --HERE. BUT >>G  WHAT I HAVE DONE JUST  WHAT DOES GOOGLE  CHOCOLATE INTO EACH  GLASS. I CAN PUT WATER G  IN THERE ARE SOME MILK I  IN THERE, BUT THERE'S NO  MEAL REPLACEMENT THAT  MIXES AS READILY AS THIS,  THAT MIXES AS EASILY AS  THIS, AND WAS INTENDED TO  BE DONE SO. EVERY  BE D  SINGLE INGREDIENT IN  THERE AS I CONSIDER THEM  A MULTIVITAMIN, WE  PRETEND IT'S THE ONLY  INGREDIENT SO WE MAKE  SURE EACH INGREDIENT SUR  WILL NOT INTRODUCE A BAD  TASTE EXPERIENCE, ONCE  INTRODUCED ABOUT  SOLUBILITY EXPERIENCE. S  SO YOU WILL EVEN SEE AND  IF THE CHOCOLATE AND  CHOCOLATE IS GOING TO BE  ONE OF THE MORE  CHALLENGING ONES IN CHAL  TERMS OF SOLUBILITY, BUT  AS YOU CAN SEE WITHOUT  EVEN STIRRING IT THEY  BASICALLY MIXED. AND BAS  EVEN THE MILK HERE IS  COLD AND COLD THINGS  ACTUALLY AREN'T AS EASY  TO MIX, BUT AS YOU CAN  SEE IT ALREADY STARTS TO  LOOK LIKE CHOCOLATE MILK. >>HOST: ANNOTATES SO  GOOD! I JUST TRIED THEM  ALL THIS STAGE AND THEY  ARE SO WELL ARE SO WELL  RECEIVED--AND THEY ALL  TASTE. >>GUEST:  AT THE BOTTOM,  YOU SEE WITHOUT A YOU SE  BLENDER MOST MEAL  REPLACEMENT YOU JUST REP  HAVE TO USE A BLENDER.  WITHOUT A BLENDER IT  STILL MIXES AND(...)  OW.  IT IS JUST A LISH'S.--  AS DELICIOUS AS NESTL\u00c9'S  QUICK AS I WAS THE KID.  IT'S EXACTLY THAT FLAVOR. >>GUEST:  YOU WENT TO  THEM AND SAID TO THE THE  FAST FOOD RESTAURANT I  WANT SOMETHING THAT'S  GOING TO TASTE AS GOOD G  AS GOING TO A FAST FOOD  RESTAURANT. >>GUEST:  YOU GO TO THE  FLAVOR HOUSES. YOU GO TO  THE FLAVOR HOUSES AND  BASICALLY YOU HAVE TO  CREATE A FLAVOR, AND CRE  IT'S REALLY SORT OF UP A  OUR FORM. FOR MOST  COMPANIES THEY DO NOT  WANT TO SPEND MUCH MONEY  ON FLAVOR. THAT'S WHY  THEY'RE PROMISED TASTE  TERRIBLE. TO ATEVER THE  CAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT WAS  WOULD BE, SO WE INVEST W  IN FLAVOR LIKE NO ONE  ELSE AND THAT IN FLAVOR,  WHAT I SIMPLY DID, LIKE  ANYTHING. WHAT IS THE  TARGET? FOR CHOCOLATE, T  SO I WENT TO MY FAVORITE FAVORITE(...)  NOT THAT   I HAVE THEM ANYMORE, MY  FAVORITE BEST TASTING  CHOCOLATE SHAKES FROM  FAST FOOD RESTAURANT  WHEELE ALL KNOW, AND I S  THAT IS A FLAVOR I WANT  TO EMULATE. STANDING TO   WITH VANILLA AND THE  COFFEE, I WANT TO THAT  FAVORITE COFFEE PLACE  WITH A DELICIOUS SWEET,  YUMMY COFFEE. AND OF  COURSE OURS IS  NUTRITIOUS.

OF  COURSE NONE-- ARE THE  NON-GMO. WE WOULD NEVER  USE GMO ANYTHING, SO I  WAS IS OF COURSE NON-GMO  SOY PROTEIN. WE ALSO SOY  HAVE A VERSION THAT USES  MARINE COLLAGEN PEPTIDES  AS A PROTEIN SOURCE. WE  ALSO HAVE A VERSION THAT  USES WHEY PROTEIN, OUR  REVOCABLE WHEY PROTEIN  ISOLATE AS A SOURCE.  WHICHEVER PROTEIN YOU  PREFER YOU CAN FIND AT  HSN.COM. I'M GOING TO  DRINK THIS.--REMARKABLE. >>HOST: VANILLA,  CHOCOLATE, PI\u00d1A COLADA C  IS GORGEOUS!

BUT VITAMIN D AND  OMEGA-3 BECAUSE OMEGA-3S  ARE WHAT OUR BRAIN IS  MADE UP, AND VITAMIN D M  IS SOMETHING WITH THE  HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF  VITAMIN D RECEPTORS IN  THE BRAIN ARE IN THE  HIGHEST AUCTIONING AREAS  IN THIS EMOTIONAL IN THI  CENTERS OF THE BRAIN.--  FUNCTIONING VITAMIN D FU  AND VITAMIN D WHICH ARE  TOO AFFORDABLE PRODUCT  MIGHT BE A GOOD WAY TO  HELP(...)  MAYBE A  MULTIVITAMIN WITH GOOD  LEVELS OF VITAMIN D LIKE  A ESSENTIAL-1. >>HOST:  THANK YOU SO  MUCH, MARGIE, GREAT  QUESTION. QUESTIONS, QUE  THEN 1-866-376-8255.

WE ARE GOING T  TO GO OVER THIS WITH. WE  LIKE TO GIVE YOU  [INAUDIBLE]  WHAT YOU  LIKE, AND ANDREW LESSMAN  IT IS YOUR. >>GUEST: [LAUGHTER]  --HERE. WE DO NOT THINK  ABOUT MUCH THE SECURE  THEIR, SO HOPEFULLY(...)  >>HOST: [LAUGHTER]  >>GUEST:  IT IS A MEAL  REPLACEMENT UNLIKE ANY  OTHER MEAL REPLACEMENT O  IN TERMS--THERE-- IN THE  MARKET IN TERMS OF  FLAVOR, SOLUBILITY,  NUTRIENT CONTENT, AND  AGAIN HE CAN READ THE  REVIEWS.--YOU. TO THINK  IT'S BASICALLY 60 CAL IT  AND AS IF THE CALORIES A  IT IS STILL A CUSTOMER  PICK I SAID ORIGINALLY I  WOULD BE HAPPY IF OUR  MEAL REPLACEMENT AVERAGE  2.5 OR THREE STARS,  SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE.  HALF LOVED IT CAN'T HAVE  DIDN'T. THE FACT IT'S DI  1.1 AT 2.2 STARS IS  INCREDIBLE. >>HOST:  WE WILL PUT THE  DETAILS ARE SECURE BUT  ONE OF THE SCREEN FOR  EASY CONTINUED ORDER EAS  THAT ABSOLUTELY. I'M  EXCITED TO QUIT ANDREW  LESSMAN ABOUT ACETYL  L-CARNITINE.--QUIZ. L-CA  THERE IS SO MUCH BUZZ  ABOUT UPON A LOT OF  PEOPLE ARE SAYING THE  PRESENT ANDREW LESSMAN'S  IS INCREDIBLE IS INCREDI  CONSIDERING THE QUALITY.  BIG BUZZ ABOUT THIS. >>GUEST:--IT, HALF. WE  USED TO HAVE A DRINK ON,  SLIM, AND CANIS LYNN, IT  REQUIRED LIKE ANY DRINK  IT REQUIRED THAT YOU HAD  TO MAKE CERTAIN  COMPROMISES AND ADD-ONS  AND INGREDIENTS IN TERMS  OF FLAVOR AND THAT'S I  WAS ALWAYS TRIED TO MAKE  ON ENCAPSULATED FORM OF  CARTAGENA WOULD BOTH BE  AFFORDABLE IN THAT WOULD  BE HIGHER POTENCY--  CARNISLIM. A COUPLE  HUNDRED MILLIGRAMS UNTIL  NOW, SO NOW WE HAVE MORE  THAN DOUBLED THE POTENCY  OF THE CARNITINE PER  CAPSULE AND WE HAD MADE  IT AFFORDABLE AS WELL.  THE REASON I WANTED TO  TALK ABOUT IT AFTER  SECURE, YOU CAN TALK  ABOUT THIS AFTER WE ABOU  SPEAK ABOUT A PRODUCT SP  FOR THE BRAIN, TALK ABOUT  IT  WEIGHT-LOSS. WEIGHT-LOSS.[INAUDIBLE]  ESTIMATING THE ENO ACETY  L-CARNITINE, CARNITINE L  IS THE MOLECULE THAT IS  RESPONSIBLE FOR THE  MOVEMENT OF ALL FAT  WITHIN OURSELVES MAC--OUR CELLS TO THE CYCLE THAT  FAT GIFTWARE AND COMES F  ON BEASLEY CARNITINE IS  CENTRAL TO ALL FAT  BURNING METABOLISM. IF  YOU'RE ON A WEIGHT-LOSS  PROGRAM, EXERCISING. BUT  AT THE SAME TIME ACETYL  L-CARNITINE IS  WELL-ESTABLISHED AS AN  INGREDIENT WHICH IT IS  THE CENTRAL INGREDIENT T  IN MY MEMORY AND BRAIN  PRODUCT. SO WE MAKE A  MEMORY AND BRAIN PRODUCT  THAT WE HAD RECENTLY  IMPROVED AND WE ADDED  ACETYL L-CARNITINE TO IT  TO IMPROVE IT, AND IT'S  BECOME REALLY THE  HEADLINE INGREDIENT IN  OUR MEMORY AND BRAIN  PRODUCT ALTHOUGH IT DOES  NOT HAVE AS MUCH AS WE  CAN GET IN THIS SINGLE  CAPSULE HERE. SO THIS IS  THE HIGHEST LEVEL BY FAR.  AND IT IS A VERY  DIFFICULT MATERIAL TO  ENCAPSULATE. YOU'LL GET   A SENSE OF THAT ONE YOU  SEE WHEN I OPEN THE  CAPSULE BECAUSE IT LOOKS  LIKE SNOWFLAKES. THAT LI  YOU WERE HERE IT IS JUST  THESE CRUNCHY LITTLE  FLAKES WHICH WHEN YOU  THINK ABOUT THE  ENCAPSULATING MACHINE I  SHOWED EARLIER--EVERYBODY EARLIER IT'S REALLY HARD  TO GET THOSE TO FLOW AND  BEHAVE WELL. IF LONDON  BEHAVE WELL WE'D BE ABLE  TO GET SIX OR 700 MG IN  THE CAPSULE, SO  UNFORTUNATELY(...)  BUT  EVEN 500 MG IT MULTIPLY  SO WE ORIGINALLY DID WAS  100 MG BACK IN THE DAY,  SOON AFTER THINK WE ARE  FIVE TIMES THE POTENCY  ABOUT 20 YEARS LATER IT  IS QUITE AN  ACCOMPLISHMENT. >>HOST:  I AM THRILLED >  TO SAY THAT SOMETHING  YOU'LL NOTICE WHENEVER Y  WE ARE ON THE ANDREW  LESSMAN ANDREW LESSMAN  AND HIS TEAM ARE SO  INCREDIBLY TALENTED AND  MANAGE WHAT GOES ON IN  MEETING DEMAND FOR ALL M  OF HIS PRODUCTS. THIS  ONE, THERE IS SOMETHING  ABOUT THIS, AND I HAD A  WONDERFUL E-MAIL FROM A  LADY THAT HAD BEEN I  THINK A SLIMMING CLUB OR  SHE HAD BEEN TO SOME SHE  KIND OF SEMINAR WHERE  THEY WERE TRYING TO SELL  HER SOME TYPE OF FORM OF  THIS AND IT WAS DOUBLE  THE PRICE AND IT WAS THE  HALF AS GOOD. >>GUEST:  IT IS DOUBLE  THE PRICE AND THIS IS  JUST A NO-NONSENSE  INGREDIENT. IN THAT  CAPSULE IS ACETYL  L-CARNITINE. >>HOST: RIGHT. >>GUEST:  IT IS PURE  ACETYL L-CARNITINE. I OF  COURSE RECOMMEND YOU COU  TAKE A DAILY TAKE A DAIL  MULTIVITAMIN AS A  FOUNDATIONAL PRODUCT FOR  THIS LIKE B-COMPLEX, BUT  THIS IS PURE ACETYL  L-CARNITINE. WHAT'S  UNIQUE ABOUT ACETYL  L-CARNITINE IF IT'S ONE  OF THOSE MOLECULE THAT  CAN PENETRATE THE BLOOD  BRAIN BARRIER. BUT IOWA  TOOK ABOUT IN THE BRAIN,  THE BRAIN IS A (...) (...)--[LAUGHTER]  IT'S  AN INCREDIBLY VITAL AN I  ORGAN AND SO VITAL AND O  SO CENTRAL TO OUR  SURVIVAL BUT IT IS  ISOLATED. IT IS ISOLATED  PHYSICALLY. IT IS UP IN   A CRANIUM.--I ALWAYS  TALK. IT IS BASICALLY  PROTECTED BEHIND HIS  CRANIUM BECAUSE IF  ANYTHING HAPPENS TO IT  OBVIOUSLY IT COMPROMISES  OUR ABILITY TO SURVIVE.  ALSO IT IS ALSO ISOLATED  IN TERMS OF CIRCULATION  SO IT IS WE ARE VERY  SPECIFIC IN TERMS OF OUR  BODY. WHAT IS ABOUT TO  GET TO OUR BRAIN AND SO  IF SOMETHING CAN PAST IF  THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER,  SOMETHING BENEFICIAL IS  VERY ADVANTAGEOUS. IN  FACT, WHEN THEY DERIVED  OR DESIGNED DRUGS OR  MEDICINES TO BENEFIT THE  BRAIN, ONE OF THE BRAIN,  BIGGEST PROBLEMS WITH  DESIGNING THE DRUG OR  MEDICINE IS CAN THEY GET  PAST THE BLOOD BRAIN  BARRIER AS WE CALL IT  BECAUSE IT IS LIMITING B  IN THAT EFFECT. AND  WHAT'S WONDERFUL ABOUT  ACETYL L-CARNITINE, A  KIND OF SPEAKS TO HOW  ESSENTIAL IT IS THAT IT  HAS NO PROBLEM. IT IS  WELCOME FOR HIM. IT'S A  NATURAL MOLECULE, AND  THAT ACETYL L-CARNITINE,  THAT AS STEEL GROUP IS  VALUABLE BECAUSE IT VALU  HELPS MAKE THE MOST  IMPORTANT ROAD  TRANSMITTER IN THE TRANS  BRAIN, ACETYLCHOLINE, ACETYLCHOLINE,--ACETYL,  AND THE OTHER PART OF IT  IS THE CARNITINE PART,  THE BRAIN RELIES ON FAT  FOR PRODUCING ENERGY.--  NEUROTRANSMITTER. ENOUGH  QUANTITY TO MOVE THAT QU  FAT TO OUR SITE EPRINT  SOFTWARE THAT FAT IS  OXIDIZED TO PRODUCE  ENERGY, THAT'S REALLY AN  INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT  MOLECULE FOR OUR BRAIN.  IS ALSO A CENTRAL  MOLECULE TO ALL FAT  BURNING METABOLISM  THROUGH OUR OUR BODY. >>HOST:--THROUGHOUT. I  ALWAYS WANT TO BE  INTRIGUED BY THE FACT IN  AND FIGURES OUT OF ALL  THE PROMISE WE HAVE SEEN  SO FAR, THE FASTEST  SELLING ITEM. >>GUEST: AND WE DON'T  HAVE MUCH OF THIS ONE  UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S IS U  AN ITEM THAT WE JUST  INTRODUCED IN THIS FORUM  ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO. I  THINK WE'VE ONLY SPOKEN  ABOUT ON THEIR PERHAPS A  ON ONE OCCASION. >>HOST: RIGHT. >>GUEST:  THOUGH WE  DIDN'T MAKE THE DIDN'T M  CARNISLIM GO AWAY CARNIS  BECAUSE BASICALLY THIS B  IS HIGHER POTENCY,  LOWER-COST, AND IS 100%  PURE THE LIPID CARNITINE  HAD TO HAVE SOME FLAVOR  COMPONENTS IN IT, BUT  THIS IS THE WAY, JUST A  WONDERFUL NO-NONSENSE  PRODUCT THAT GIVES YOU  THE MOST CENTRAL THE MOS  MOLECULE TO FAT BURNING  METABOLISM AND ALSO I  WOULD BECOME A CENTRAL  MOLECULE IN TERMS OF A  TWOFOLD BENEFIT TO THE  BRAIN BECAUSE IT GIVES  YOU BOTH ASKED THE TEAL  AND CARNITINE,--ACETYL,  ACETYLCHOLINE AND THE  CARNITINE FOR CARNITINE   A CELL TRANSFERASE SO A   YOU CAN MOVE THE FAT  WITHIN THE CELL TO THE  SITE WORDS GOING TO BE  UTILIZED AND BURNED. BURNED.--DID. >>HOST: --WHERE IT'S.  THEY ARE TELLING US WE  HAD TO MOVE AWAY FROM IT  BECAUSE THERE'S VERY FEW  REMAINING BUT IF YOU  WOULD LIKE TO ORDER  YOURS, JESSE CAN SEE THE  PRICING ON THIS ONE FIRST  THE THICKLY MOST FOLKS  ARE ORDERING THAT'S WHY  THEY HIT IT. MOST OF THE  ORDERING THIS ONE FOR  OBVIOUS REASONS--JUST SO  YOU. ONLY $59.90, THAT  SAVES YOU $30 AND IT'S  UNABLE TO FLEX. >>GUEST: --ON 2.  ORIGINALLY I THINK OUR  WORK 102 MG CARNITINE WO  WAS SOMEWHERE IN THE  NEIGHBORHOOD OF 30 OR  $.40 A CAPSULE. SO NOW $  WE HAVE 500, WE'RE  TALKING ABOUT 11 MORE  THAN A DIME CAPSULE THAT  IS WHY THIS HAS BECOME  OUR CENTRAL AND OUR ONLY  DIRECT CARNITINE FORMULA  BECAUSE IT IS SO MUCH  MORE AFFORDABLE AND MORE  PURE THAN ANYTHING WE'VE  EVER DONE BEFORE. AND(... AND(...)  >>HST:  WITH THAT IN  MIND WE LOVE YOUR  FEEDBACK WHEN YOU DO GET  IT HOME. >>GUEST:  IT'S ONE OF  THOSE, ONE OF THE  INGREDIENTS I EMPHASIZED  BEFORE VERY IMPORTANT. B  IF YOU TAKE IS WITH  COQ-10 OR TAKE IS WITH  THE DAILY MULTIVITAMIN  IT'S GOING TO DELIVER IT  ITS BATSMEN OF ITS.  >>HOST: LET'S GO THIS  WAY, 2 MORE AMAZING WAY,  ITEMS TO GET TO-- BEST  BENEFITS. YOU NOT THAT  LABEL, GREG? >>GUEST: KNOT AT THE  MIDDLE OF APRIL. APRIL.--CORRECT? SO WE  TYPICALLY DO IS WE WILL  DO 3 BRIEF SHOWS, SIX  HOURS IN JANUARY. WHAT H  WE DID IS WE ONLY DID 2  IN GENUINE MOVE THIS ON  TO FEBRUARY.--NOT BACK  UNTIL. WE ARE NOT BACK  UNTIL APRIL AND WE DO 2,  SIX HOURS IN APRIL. AND  THAT WERE NOT BACK UNTIL  JULY. WE DO SIX HOURS JU  AND SIX HOURS. SO ONLY A  GRAND TOTAL IN THE YEAR  ABOUT 60 HOURS WHEREAS  MOST BUSINESSES ARE ON  MANY, MANY TIMES THAT. >>HOST:  JUST TO BEAR IN  MIND WHEN YOU SEE ANDREW  LESSMAN WHAT ANDREW  LESSMAN IS HE ABOUT WHEN  YOU GET THE EXTRA YOU GE  SPECIAL PRICING. IT'S OF  THE REASON WHY, THE  REASON WHY WE ARE NOT ON  MORE IS --  >>GUEST:  VERSATILE I DO  NOT WANT TO BORE YOU TO  TEARS. >>HOST: [LAUGHTER]  >>GUEST:  I DO WANT TO  REPEAT THE SAME PRODUCT  OVER AND OVER, BUT ALSO  UNLIKE OTHER BUSINESSES  THAT MIGHT HAVE THEIR  PRODUCTS MADE BY PRODUCT  CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS  ALL OVER THE WORLD, WE  HAVE TO DO THE WORK AND  THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH  WORK WE CAN DO TO WORK W  PRODUCE ALL THE PRODUCTS  FOR THE SHOWS. THAT'S  WHAT WE HAD TO BUILD  ANOTHER FACILITY NEXT  DOOR SHEAR BECAUSE THERE  IS ONLY SO MUCH PRODUCT  WE CAN MAKE WE HAVE TO  SCHEDULE OUR PRODUCTION  SO THAT WE ARE ABLE TO S  BE PREPARED FOR EACH  VISIT--HERE, SO YOU WE  DON'T WANT TO MAKE ABOUT  A PRODUCT AND HAVE IT A   SIT AROUND, BUT IF THE  BUILDINGS BEING ERECTED  THERE. >>HOST:  IT'S NEARLY  DONE, NEARLY COMPLETED  IT? >>GUEST:  IT'S PREMATURE  ALL DONE AND WE'RE  FINISHING OFF THE  INTERIOR NOW, SO AND INT  THIS TOOK ABOUT 60 DAYS  FOR US TO BASICALLY THE  CONCRETE TILT UP. WE CON  TILT UP WALLS AND ROOF  STRUCTURE ON,--PRETTY  MUCH AND IT'S GOING TO M  BE FULL SOLAR PANELS ON  THE ROOF AGAIN, THOUGH T  IT IS GOING TO BE JUST  LIKE THIS BUILDING, ZERO  CARBON FOOTPRINT BY THE >>HOST: SOMETHING WE HAD  A CHANCE TO SPEAK ABOUT  YESTERDAY AND HOPEFULLY  YOU TUNED IN YESTERDAY  PRESENT TO WHAT THE  TODAY'S SPECIAL, ANDREW  LESSMAN AND I HAD A FEW  MOST TALK ABOUT FRIENDLY  FLORA. I HAVE SPOKEN  SPECIFICALLY ABOUT MY  EXPERIENCE WITH THIS  YESTERDAY. I HAD A LOT Y  OF FEEDBACK ABOUT IT. IF  YOU ARE SOMEBODY THAT  SUFFERS YOU KNOW REFLUX.  I'VE HAD THAT MANY, MANY  YEARS. THICKLY NOT AS  MUCH ANYMORE. A LOT OF  REASON TO CHECK OUT  FRIENDLY FLORA RIGHT? >>GUEST: OF COURSE NO  PRODUCT I MAKE IS A PROD  QUEUE OR OR TREATMENT FOR  ANY DISEASE OR DISEASE  STATE TO THE EXTENT THAT  THINGS A LIKE A REGULARI  ARE GASTROESOPHAGEAL  REFLUX OR THINGS LIKE  THAT, IF THEY ARE A  RESULT OF SAY IF YOU RES  WANT TO DEAL WITH GERD W  IS ALSO THE SIMPLE IS AL  THINGS TO DO LIKE EAT  SMALLER MEALS, EAT LESS  SPICY MEALS, AVOID SPICY  THINGS LIKE COFFEE, THIN  DON'T EAT A BIG MEAL DON  JUST BEFORE YOU'RE GOING  TO SLEEP. LOSING WEIGHT  HELPS WITH GERD. ALSO IF  YOU HAVE A PILLOW A  LITTLE BIT MORE UPWARDS  OF IT SUPPORTS YOU AT A  LITTLE BIT HIGHER ANGLE  IS GOING TO REDUCE  SYMPTOMS OF GERD. IS ALL  SORTS OF WONDERFUL  THINGS, SIMPLE THINGS  THAT CAN BE DONE TO  DIMINISH SYMPTOMS OF GERD GERD, BUT IN TERMS OF  FRIENDLY FLORA, FRIENDLY  FLORA IS JUST A VERY  SIMPLE AND  STRAIGHTFORWARD PRODUCT  IN TERMS OF WHAT IT DOES  AND HOW IT WORKS. MAKING  A PRODUCT THAT WORKS A P  WELL IS EXTREMELY COMMON COMMON-- COMPLICATED IT  PROBABLY TOOK US ALMOST   2 DECADES TO MAKE THIS  PRODUCT BECAUSE I HAD A  REAL PROBLEM MAKING THIS  PRODUCT UNLIKE OTHER  COMPANIES I WANTED TO  MAKE SURE IT WOULD WORK  WITH YOU GOT IT HOME, SO  I HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT  WE WERE MAKING FRIENDLY  FLORA CHRONIC THAT WAS  STABLE,--PRODUCT, BUT  EVEN THOUGH YOU WERE NOT  GOING TO REFRIGERATE IT,  IT HAD TO BE STABLE. I  TOOK A COUPLE OF DECADES  TO ACCOMPLISH. AND WHAT  IS FRIENDLY FLORA? THESE  ARE ORGANISMS THAT  POPULATE OUR BODY POPULA  WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR  NOT, AND YOU LIKE IT IF  THEY DO BECAUSE WE COULD  NOT EXIST IN A HEALTHY  STATE WITHOUT A HEALTHY  COMPOSITION OF FRIENDLY  FLORA. IT IS AN FLORA. I  ESSENTIAL PART OF ESSENT  HEALTHY DIGESTION,  ESSENTIAL PART OF ESSENT  HEALTHY IMMUNE SYSTEM, H  IS EVEN ESSENTIAL PART I  OF A HEALTHY NERVOUS  SYSTEM BECAUSE OF THE SY  WAY OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM  INTO RACKS WITH OTHER  SYSTEMS IN OUR BODY. SO  THERE IS NO ESCAPING THE  FACT THAT WE MIGHT HAVE  TRILLIONS OF CELLS MEGAN  OUR BODY, BUT IN TERMS O  OF FRIENDLY FLORA  ORGANISMS IN HER BODY  THERE'S 100 TRILLION SO  WE ARE OUTNUMBERED,  OURSELVES ARE OURSELVES   OUTNUMBERED BY FRIENDLY  ORGANISMS. THE PROBLEM O  IS THAT THAT IS DEFINED  IN A HEALTHY PERSON.  UNFORTUNATELY MOST OF UN  US, THE WAY WE LIVE, THE  WAY WE DO, OUR WORLD IS  SANITIZE THE MOST OF THE  FOODS AND PRODUCTS WE FO  ARE GETTING ARE GETTING  UNFORTUNATELY ARE NOT  WELL POPULATED WITH  FRIENDLY FLORA BECAUSE F  WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE  HAVE ELIMINATED ALL THE  UNHEALTHY BACTERIA THAT  COULD TEMPER--  POTENTIALLY. WE POTENTIA  ELIMINATE ALL THE  FRIENDLY FLORA SO UNLESS  WE ARE CONSCIOUSLY DOING  SOMETHING TO MAKE UP FOR  OUR STERILIZED WORLD WE  BASICALLY WILL HAVE  EITHER IMMUNE SUFFICIENT  AND INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT  OF THE PROPER POPULATION  OF FRIENDLY FLORA WITHIN  OUR BODY WHICH AFFECT OU  THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM, TH  AND YOU TALKED ABOUT  THINGS THAT REGULARITY T  OR GREATER THINGS LIKE  THAT. THESE ARE ALL PART  OF EYE WITH AN DIGESTIVE  SYSTEM THAT IS NOT  FUNCTIONING AT ITS  OPTIMUM LEVEL. >>HOST: ANDREW LESSMAN,   I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO  MEET ONE OF OUR INSIDERS. DEBY. DEBEY ZEMAN IN  VIRGINIA, YOU ARE LIVE V  ON THE MONDAY NIGHT SHO\n- SHOW. DEBEY ZEMAN, SHOW.  YOU'RE ON LIVE WHAT  ANDREW LESSMAN AND ADAM  FREEMAN. >>CALLER:  ALLOWAY MAC. MAC.--[LAUGHTER]  >>HOST: [LAUGHTER]  >>GUEST: [LAUGHTER]  >>CALLER: --DEBEY.  VERTEBRAL ANDREW LESSMAN  I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU  FOR TAKING MY QUESTION  AND GETTING NEED THIS IN  YOUR PROGRAM. THERE HAS  BEEN A LOT OF DEBATE  BETWEEN ME AND SOME OF B  MY GIRLFRIENDS, AND  NUMBER ONE THIS IS ONE  QUESTION WITH TWO PARTS.  NUMBER ONE, WHO WAS A  GOOD CANDIDATE FOR  PROBIOTIC--IS, AND WHAT  ARE THE BENEFITS OF HER  PROBIOTIC?  >>GUEST: WELL WE ARE ALL  A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR A  PROBIOTIC, AND BY WHAT P  WE ALL ARE MEETING ALL W  OF THE SHOULD HAVE A  HEALTHY COMPLEMENT A  PROBIOTIC, OF FRIENDLY  FLORA IN OUR BODY. BODY.--MEANING.--NEEDING.  IF YOU WERE TALKING  ABOUT SUPPLEMENTING, ABO  THAT IS ANOTHER STORY.  BUT ALL OF SHOULD HAVE A  HOT HEALTHY POPULATION H  OF PROBIOTIC AND OUR  DIGESTIVE SYSTEM, RIGHT--  REPRODUCTIVE TRUCK, IN  OUR MOUTH.--TRACT. IT IS  PART OF WHO WE ARE. IT P  IS PART OF A HEALTHY  IMMUNE SYSTEM, PART OF  OUR HEALTHY DIGESTIVE  SYSTEM. WHETHER OR NOT  YOU'RE A CANDIDATE TO  SUPPLEMENT? UM, FRANKLY   I THINK THE WAY WE LIVE  IN OUR MODERN WORLD WE  ALL ARE A CANDIDATE TO  SUPPLEMENT, BUT SUPPLEME  CERTAINLY SO MANY OF US  ARE TAKING ANTACIDS,  THINGS LIKE PROTON PUMP  INHIBITORS, PRILOSEC,  NEXIUM, OR JUST EVEN  TOM'S OR ROLAIDS,  WHATEVER IT IS--TUMS, WH  THE MOMENT WE CHANGE THE  PH, ACIDITY OF OUR  DIGESTIVE SYSTEM WHEAT  CHAINS ENVIRONMENT FOR  FRIENDLY FLORA. WILL BE  TAKEN ANTIBIOTICS WE  CHANGE THE ENVIRONMENT  FOR OUR FRIENDLY FLORA--  WE CHANGE, SO WE ARE  CURRENTLY DOING THINGS  AND AS I SAID OUR FOOD  SUPPLY, EVERYTHING WE DO  IS SANITIZE IN OUR WORLD.  WHEN I WAS A KID WE  WH  USED TO RUN AROUND IN US  THE YARD(...)  >>HOST: [LAUGHTER]  >>GUEST:  AND THE DIRT  AND THINGS LIKE THAT. WE  DO NOT REALLY DO THAT  ANYMORE. I CERTAINLY  STILL AM OUT IN NATURE  AND THINGS LIKE THAT, AN  BUT OUR WORLD IS SO  STERILIZED, SO SANITIZED  AND YES THAT KEEPS US  SAFE FROM PATHOGENS,  KEEPS US SAFE AND BAD  BACTERIA BUT WHAT IT BAC  ALSO DOES? IT ELIMINATES  THE FRIENDLY FLORA,  PROPIONIC THAT ARE PART  OF OUR NORMAL HEALTHY  WORLD AND HAS BEEN SINCE  THE BEGINNING OF TIME. T  SO WHO WAS A CANDIDATE?   I THINK MOST OF US MIGHT  HAVE ISSUES THAT LET US  KNOW WE ARE, BUT FRANKLY  TO SOME DEGREE WEATHER T  IS EATING YOGURT OR  HAVING A PRODUCT LIKE  THIS WE ALL IN THE WORLD  WE LIVE IN TODAY, WE  REALLY ARE A CANDIDATE  FOR FRIENDLY FLORA. AND  IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY DO?  THEY ARE AN  INDECIPHERABLE PART OF  OUR DIGESTIVE SYSTEM,  REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM, AND  IN OUR PRODUCTIVE SYSTEM  AND DIGESTIVE SYSTEM NOT  DIFFER REGULARITY AND  ABSORPTION OF NUTRIENTS  BUT ALSO TO PROTECT US  FROM, ULTIMATE FRIENDLY  FLORA TO PROTECT FROM  PATHOGENS.- NORMAL  POPULATION OF HUNDREDS P  OF TRILLIONS OF OF TRILL  ORGANISMS THAT A HEALTHY  PERSON HAS OR FRIENDLY  FLORA--UNFRIENDLY FLORA.  HELP FIGHT, BROUGHT OUTOW OUT--CROWD, A UNHEALTHY  PATHOGENS IN OUR WORLD,  SURF LACED A MULTITUDE S  OF ROLES, AND CERTAINLY  WHEN WE TAKE THEM, IF WE  SEE A DIFFERENCE OF ME  ARE TAKING THEM WE KNOW  YOU'RE A CANDIDATE AS I  SAID JUST LIVING IN OUR  MODERN SOCIETY, DOING MO  THE THINGS WE DO,  MEDICATIONS WE TAKE WE  ARE ALL A CANDIDATE, AND  WHEN WE USE A GOOD  PRODUCT WE WILL KNOW  QUICKLY AS PEOPLE KNOW  WITH MY PRODUCT THAT WIT  THEY ARE A CANDIDATE >>HOST: DEBEY ZEMAN >>HO  THANK YOU SO MUCH.

SHOWING PEOPLE ", "KOtZ3v8t3s8": "plus five and everybody boys I hope my neighbors are at home but I'm sure that they are boy we finally get late in today's video I feel so awkward right now I don't know why but welcome back to video hope you guys are having an amazing day today and if not I hope my video is able to make your day a little bit brighter I'm super duper excited for today's video I not only have half a blind I'm so butthurt you guys I have shout out to King palms send me more because I thought that I was too cool for school and that I didn't like hemp blunts and that I only like tobacco blunts but after smoking so many tobacco blunts and getting like headaches I [ __ ] with the king poems and so I try to like stuff it and I had it ready and when I was walking out here to set up my little filming it broke in half like literally in half so lively and as type [ __ ] I got a little Roach first a smoke and then I also got a bomb muhfucka a drink this is so refreshing you already know I got that double cup because honey Google today is a multiple game for toy edible loot bag video oh yes we've heard it here part two part two the first thing I pulled out is this rice krispies treat this is what it looks like I don't think the cameras focusing on it but looks like this this is one of my favorite edible but I feel like rice krispie treats and like treats like this like cereal bars I feel like they never hit me awhile back I went to dabba thon and I bought a 400 milligram at a bowl and it really didn't do much to me so yeah I have eaten this before in a my part 1 video but it was by a different brand I like to try all kinds of different brands and none of them seem to hit me too well but they're super super tasty so if you're more in it for the taste these are both then I got some soft beat thugs I never tried this brown before so I'm SuperDuper excited I love trying new brands of all kinds of different things and especially freaking edibles so in my part 1 video I had some different brand of chips so where is pretty much the same thing wheat hot cheetos and these have a hundred and fifty milligrams in this whole bag this has 500 milligrams so you got a great fight I also got oh my gosh I am so excited for this you guys these are sour belts candies and I love blue raspberry like flavored candies like airheads the blue but skittles the blade skittles is a happening but like anything blue and this is blue so I'm really I'm really stoked and I've heard from a lot of people that these were really really bomb so they hyped me up they hyped me up when I went to go get this stuff I was hyped up to try this because I guess you only eat one or two strips and you get super high but I have a high tolerance so honey a 300 milligram one or two bites is not gonna do me justice but if it tastes bomb I'm with the ships and then this is more my style you already know we might beat us this is a freaking la lucha that lon mmm okay so I really want you to this like right now okay I also got for the last but not least you guys oh by the way this has a hundred and ten milligrams so a little bit over 100 milligrams my everything really so last time we did a lemonade edible for the drink in the first new thing and then for this time I really needed to freakin go in with the 1200 milligram THC syrup because I've tried to CV syrup I've tried codeine I tried it all you know and I even tried filming a video trying this but in the fruit punch flavor and YouTube decided to delete my video so you know LBD famine stoppable honey and I came back with a great flavor so when I went to the dispensary and they had grave I was like put back on my shopping list cuz I gotta try so I'm really hyped up for this honestly like I'm pretty pretty pretty pretty hyped it's 1,200 milligrams this is the most potent edible I've ever seen on the market and that I've ever consumed you guys have seen probably my previous videos of me eating a thousand milligrams brownies trying to do my makeup and all kinds of different things and I really am NOT a fan of brownies and you know I like the rice krispies treats but they just don't hit me as hard you know sour belts are bomb but I usually like little gummies or something but something like there's like a beverage gets you so [ __ ] up you guys if you ever want to try any of one of these edibles please try the syrup do yourself favorite so I'm just gonna hop right in by mixing up our syrup because I'm just so hyped so I have my double cup my my sprite with my sprite and yeah oh actually I'm gonna take a thumbnail damn taking it thumbnails kind of hard okey-dokey well I literally could wake up the whole neighborhood anyways step yeah just so you guys know like what time it is it is 12:30 exactamente 12:30 exactly so let's see how long it takes for these edibles to hit why don't we first gotta you know consumed that no mm-hmm so I have this syrup I'm gonna just shake it because I bet you it's been sitting for a minute make sure you shake that hole nice and dandy Wow look at the cap it looks like th season there alright I'm gonna show you guys up close personality wait it off when you have no groups and you don't want a nip slip it's kind of a brown I wish it was a prettier shade okay so I used a lot I don't know if I'm gonna like this one I'm licking the syrup and taste a great I don't know okay so a lot of people like to come at me like dest you swear like you're sipping lean Jaime its [ __ ] syrup same base okay therefore you're supposed to make like I want my [ __ ] to be mixed honey mixed Loki I'm making a mess [Applause] pretty mother [ __ ] bomb I can literally see the THC in my soda like it kind of looks green like if I wish you guys could see it but it literally looks like wax on my ice it looks good though it doesn't look like what the [ __ ] is in my cup it looks like ooh that's bad again me so so far so good you guys I would give this syrup a 10 out of 10 if I had to pick one edible that's like my favorite edible technically it would be the syrup because [ __ ] bring your spray whether you're going to [ __ ] Six Flags [ __ ] Disneyland like no I'm just kidding I don't know if you're a lot of bringing drinks to Disney but sticks legs I know you're allowed to bring your own drinks honey so best believe I'm putting this in like a little canister my hydro flask I actually just recently ordered a hydro flask for college and I guess I have a six like season pass so if any of you guys are trying to go please hit me up cuz I ain't got no homies to go with and I'm fine I bring this Sara you know pour up and a hydro guess you popular okay um I don't know should I smoke or should I eat the rest of the edibles this is a mute thing I guess I should just use edibles you know I have to try that you guys I I've been dying to try these hot cheetos like I said I've tried different brands and other Browns were bombed on fire so let's see if this Alito's friends compares hmm ooh smells like like a [ __ ] spicy cheese ball with a little bit of weed it doesn't really smell like weed though that's what it looks like got a [ __ ] hot cheeto this [ __ ] looks like our normal hot cheeto it tastes just like the other ones hmm these ones were a little bit cheaper cuz the other ones I tried were 300 milligrams these are only 150 milligrams so less potency the artist Lee is still super bomb hmm smoking a blunt eating your chips and then sipping your [ __ ] lien just kidding tasty syrup it doesn't get better than this you guys like Yuki a highest [ __ ] by sipping this this tastes so good it tastes like a grape flavored sprite I love it I kind of want to add more syrup you added to do it just so I could be like really [ __ ] up you killed me cuz this is 1,200 milligrams like the big if I wouldn't take any of the other edibles and I just drank this I would be dead I would be dead but the fact that I'm eating this and I'm eating edibles like Wow I never even added up the amount of milligrams that I'm consuming but let's see 150 the syrup is 1200 I probably won't drink the entire bottle of syrup because I want to mix it also in this sprite I'm going to a family party later at a pool best believe I won't be chilling by the pool with my sprite so later I'm gonna finish the rest of that but right now I'm putting like just the perfect amount I actually added a lot more so I'm gonna mix it so 1213 50 and then the rice krispies is 500 milligrams so B 1850 and then the sour belts these are three hundred so that'll be 2150 yeah and then this is a hundred and ten oh my gosh oh honey wait twenty one fifty plus one ten twenty one fifty plus one and 21 carry the one twenty to sixty right I'm already feeling it now I'm just getting back right am i right I believe it's around 20 160 so 2,000 160 milligrams that's insane other thing mmm and these chips are so bomb if you guys like to medicate but like microdose EPS look like a sandwich and you'll be chillin won't I'm obsessed with these chips homie bomb but else is gonna say oh yeah somebody tried commenting in my other neat thing video saying that Oh a thousand milligrams ain't [ __ ] that's equivalent to one gram honey honey honey let me just sit my soda these are spicy I got the extra flamin hot ones they had regular hot ones and I got the extra hot superbomb um honey what the [ __ ] you talking about 100 1000 milligrams is one gram I'm not trying to call you out or anything much love to you but you have nothing but good intentions but that's just insane hundred milligrams is equivalent to one grab so eating a 100 milligram edible like this most likely since its 110 they used about a gram and a half maybe probably less than that excuse me they probably used about a gram to make this to make this now they used a hundred grams to make it a thousand milligrams but it's actually more than a thousand to this 1200 so there's more than that for this 300 milligram edible it's around 3 grams do you feel me you feel what I'm feeling so yeah 500 about 5 grams so as a human as a [ __ ] Union who smokes every [ __ ] day you know once I get to the first second balloon I'll be chilling so it's about 4 grams in you know the third blender mice so that's around five grams of weed so evening around 500 milligrams of an edible will get me pretty chilling but like I said the Rice Krispies don't usually hit me but that's why it 100 milligram edibles don't really hit me because if I only smoke one blood one gram I'm not gonna get that high cuz I have a high tolerance but for someone who never smokes and eats even 20 milligrams of an edible will be super fun but you know it's not always about the number it's kind of about well what's your what's your past like what's your what's your tolerance like have you tried edibles before did you smoke a lot but you've never tried edibles like yeah oh okay so I'm trying to open these and I'm super excited to try these these are the styler belts damn if I can even open it wrong it smells like cotton candy let's try it I know that flavour rx makes some like these I mean my sister tried I may really like them hmm sour I don't like sour candy but I did it for the bike for the milk bank drop them on the floor five-second rule hello wrong number wrong number the [ __ ] why you calling my phone yeah so I was told that if you eat one or two of these you'll be [ __ ] up so I'm kind of gonna save them so I can eat one or two and see if I get [ __ ] up but today I just wanted to try them out and they're pretty bomb you guys like they don't taste like weed at all none of these edibles so far it tastes like weed I hate edibles that tastes like weed I've gotten hate in my past videos where I eat the 1000 milligram brownie because people are like why are you gagging so much like it's not even that bad the honey of course you're not gonna [ __ ] know because you ain't the one eating it but when I was eating it it tasted like I was eating weed and that [ __ ] tastes bad you know this it tastes like I'm eating a [ __ ] airheads and I get high smoke it was so that shit's pretty tight same with the chips it tastes like regular hot cheetos you know it doesn't taste like I'm eating them a nug so I feel like that's really important when it comes to edibles it's just like at least for me personally is like one is it gonna get me [ __ ] up - is it gonna taste like [ __ ] cuz I don't care if it gets me [ __ ] up if it tastes like [ __ ] tastes like [ __ ] and I don't care if they taste bomb if it doesn't get me [ __ ] up you know that's again [ __ ] up so this is the little logic become behind the life beam des and me picking my edibles knees are pretty bummed I like the blueberry I like the flavor it doesn't taste like weed aiyo there's a little hit of an aftertaste but not really stay what's on my Cheetos you know like you're gonna get those little aftertaste but it's not bad at all if I could tolerate it you could part ollar a because I have a really bad like if it tastes like weed I won't eat it I'll give it away straight up and that's right today I didn't buy any brownies because brownies and cookies no matter what Brad how potent it is you know I've eaten the thousand milligram IV the 100 milligrams from the best friends from kirova to enjoyable - lol edibles like I tried it all and I'm just not a fan of the cookies and brownies especially because when you make a fresh batch of cookies at home how long do those cookies taste bomb for you guys for the first [ __ ] five minutes that those cookies come out the oven after 5 minutes those cookies taste like hard [ __ ] breaks and they're not bomb same with the [ __ ] edibles they're gonna have it in the refrigerator for months weeks months years and then you're eating it and it's hard and it's just it's not like a fresh bomb [ __ ] cookie so until I find a company who makes a bomb cookie that's like super potent I'm gonna stay away from the baked goods I really like these though these are really really really good really good and I'm not a fan of sour candy I'm not a fan of candy I have a sweet tooth too but I have it in a way where like I crave hot cheetos I'm not one to crave chocolate or sour candy and like skills like every time I go to the gas station I don't buy candy I buy water and chips super spicy chips and water so I don't I don't pass out I want to spark my blood already but I still have two more edibles to try freeze so I'm gonna try this one I'm super excited for this one this says Tama reand oh so this is a tambourine dough you guys if I ever have a me angry I'm gonna have a pinata and it's gonna be filled of these you know let's give it a gander my shirts already [ __ ] up this should taste like [ __ ] there's like a bunch of the product in the cap like that's already my 50 milligrams right there homie the [ __ ] this edible is too messy honestly it's not even that it tastes bad it's just that it's so hard to eat pbbbbbt I remember being little and thinking that was so fun to like push up these like normal candy I says it has sugar chili THC extract caramel citric acid I'm an enol egg corn product that's so weird I don't like it I'm kind of like like I don't know it's kind of like when you think about it it's like yeah like caramel and like what else did you see corn acid the [ __ ] Beach I bought this for you guys honestly I thought that maybe you guys would want to see it and it was like unique and it was cheap so 300 milligrams but honestly I don't really [ __ ] with it I wouldn't buy this to be like Tiki I wanna get high like no [ __ ] I'd rather just buy a topic rather by the sour Bell just cuz that's so much easier to eat like this it's already coming out from like the bottom right here it's all over the cap okay you guys have one more edible to try and that is this Wow crisps fruit [ __ ] so it looks like this I tried all kinds of different brands of the same Mountain milligrams oh I guess smell the weed I get smelly smells beautiful these are my favorite he's like if I can eat this every day I would Bob this is pretty bomb I really do like it it tastes a little bit like weed though out of all the edibles here I think this one smells the most like eat and taste the most like lead so really full all right you guys honestly [ __ ] the [ __ ] my camera just stopped recording for some random ass reason probably cuz I'm taking too damn long but let us spark my roach I haven't smoked all day and I honestly do love smoking obviously do love smoking but like I'm not an addict no but like you know you could eat edibles all day you know get high as [ __ ] whatever whatever but I like smoking like I like smoking my ganja and chillin so we finally get turned up on the life being dead you kill me I know you do wait I think I was imminent just to get to the big bucks ain't got no bad intentions just occupation I don't know how to so I'm gonna go do something productive like that but I hope you guys enjoyed this video I'm gonna take a little bite of everything before I go whoa first book is 10 o'clock so I'll be back at 10:30 and then it would be like an official power ok maybe at like little past we'll see yeah it's so [ __ ] saying hey I really want to go to sleep like I feel so [ __ ] tired I just I probably look all like dead right now but um I have two little Tommy Party and I looked at the address you days and it's so far cuz I live far you know and make family looks like so it's like far it's like driving on ago they do we owe you no honey there are red ants there are red ants [ __ ] girl and um I'm just gonna say that I'm high as [ __ ] and I'm really scared to get bit by rhythms which love for me to you guys every day and really cool a bit stay low stay obviously positive so if if dad told me okay in case you guys I swear everything you I got it look cute but now show me myself my dog I feel um I guess a lot I can't because it's called my block camera he's like [ __ ] lost the battery that was traveling so I said it was a camera but that's the battery charger so I'm just you see that physical account it is a literally 8 very right now it's 8:31 it's a while I've just been sleeping all day you guys I didn't go hello [ __ ] family party I [ __ ] slept I wasted a [ __ ] brand-new pair of eyelashes I don't know how to feel about it but my family just pulled up so I'm gonna go before this gets awkward so will these guys be sure to thumbs up the video if you guys liked it and I majored a little bit brighter [Music]", "MmGOzS0TNXU": "nicotine shots or knick shots for short are small bottles of highly concentrated illiquid they are

milligram concentration empty about one quarter of the Nick shot into the larger bottle to make a six milligram concentration empty about half of the Nick shot and for 12 milligrams empty the entire Nick shot into the bottle in order to achieve your desired Nick strength when mixing your Nick shot into a 30ml bottle of zero milligram ejuice use an even larger empty bottle to mix it in and double the portion of the Nick shot that you add to it then make sure to thoroughly shake the e-liquid mixture it's also recommended that you let it steep for at least a few hours once you've done this
