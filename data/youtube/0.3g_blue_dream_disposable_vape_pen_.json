up these numbers right here because I get an experiment on how many full hits it takes to or how many full hits there are and a half gram cartridge you know cuz I was curious so I went ahead and did that if you ever wondered well now I have a almost exact precise number so if you stay tuned and watch this video then that by the end then you'll know the number and you know a little bit more information as well shout out to shout our house you know these are some good good cartridges if you find them out there and dispensaries there anywhere you might want to check them out on that note stay tuned and watch the whole video and I appreciate you guys into the next one everybody has the question so I'm gonna go ahead and give you guys the answer to the best of my ability that is the question is how many true hits can you get out of a half gram cartridge so I'm gonna go ahead no not this one as you can see this one's kind of empty but I'm going to be using this one and this is a timeless sfv og right here but this so you see because most of the time I tap it and I hit them you know a few times at once but for the sake of this test I'm gonna be hitting them one time for through each pool just like this so that's one hit most of the time I like to tap them and try to give it a maximum hit for the back some effect but for the sake of this experiment we're gonna see how many of this take so stay tuned [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now people see that it might be one more Inlet someone mark 20 34 34 you know results from a berry these were fooled some of those Mayberry if you're not taking it might get up with this but I got 34 silent ones hope this information was valuable", "Oulri9qCTkg": "YouTube what's up guys how you doing make sure you have

percent THC bust this thing open and check it out comes in a nice little container rhythm it almost looked like it was leaking I hate these cartridges for Oh like looking at just like nothing in there sure ow yeah it definitely was leaking you can feel it's all sticky all over the side of it which isn't cool I'm going over these cartridges like I'd swear I want to be doubled try to pee a Dutch energise rhythm cart good takes good picture hard I just hate that house like give me a lease to the jeezum man but very well to medicate you and Keystone's father's well the cartridge on it happens I mean but I like TDI cartridges more than I like really any other cartridge for the grass roots are good but kind of pricey this is on sell thing was 45 bucks man that tastes good that tastes good rhythm PA Dutch definitely an energizer and find your rhythm yeah I was wrong", "AEcUBF7vwGU": "hey there youtubers what's happening well I figured everyone's been asking so I'm gonna start making a video where I'm taking apart one of these pens so I've never taken apart this kind before well I got is two pliers here I'm just gonna grip one here grab it by the tip I'm gonna have to use the other ones for it this is kind of what I did last time and I did just kind of might be crushing this one though nope there she goes let's see if I can get the other end off I don't even know I think I did this last time I don't think I need to get this end off let's get it off anyway if it comes off I think this would be the end with all the electronics yo luck I came right out so I had another one before but I could not get the damn thing out and I remember I was struggling hard this one came apart pretty easy okay so now I'm gonna take some outs here to poke it out hopefully there you go this one came out easy nice perfect so there you go and now this has probably made the exact same way yeah this is a little different wouldn't be sure it looks like this cap can come off over here so you can't just no no these one's a little different like this one's even different from the last video there I'm gonna worry about this that's just the battery rip that off I bet I can get that off look I'm close you'll usually see like ridges yeah I don't know if this is gonna focus properly yeah there's like a little Ridge on the top usually look for that kind of thing that was like the ridge on the end of here when you're taking that off same kind of thing it's gonna take a look at your unit and see where you need to grab onto like I gotta keep grabbing onto the tips here so it's really good to have a good pair of linesman pliers there you go there's the wek and everything she's toast and I'm sure I can just dig that out if I were to get something I could probably just dig that little guy oh but actually you know what doing this backwards because I think this here on this end oh yeah okay there you go that's there you go that little rubber nipple in there and that'll that'll be where my uh now this stuff I'm not gonna smoke this stuff cuz I jumped in a river with this one this is river water basically yeah Rasen there anyway there you go so I bet it would be a little harder to get that out if it wasn't so liquidy I'm sure you can figure out a way like stick a pin in there dip it in there I don't know you'll you'll figure out a way and if you have to I bet like this plastics kind of flimsy enough I bet you can find a way to kind of find an exacto blade and if you were careful enough you know not to cut yourself you could probably put it down and cut through it or even figure out a way to get in there and eventually you can get your oil this one's plastic I'm not sure how other ones are but there you go thanks for watching", "GlxbV8OprWU": "hey you too Alex here back again with another quick video this time I got some rhythm it is Gorilla Glue number four by rhythm check out the stats let's get this bad boy open I'll let you know what I think this is a hybrid it is coming in I don't know if you see that at 70 the THC is seventy nine point four one eight and the THC a is one point two two for one or one to one for really small but it's like eighty percent THC Gorilla Glue is one of my favorite hybrids you guys probably already know that is one of my favorites all around nice little tube it comes in this is a clear tube some reason the king was having a lot of trouble focusing up close nice little rubber pieces off rhythm gorilla glue hybrid see a chart ridge very nice cartridge nice-looking co2 oil gorilla glue number four you guys know it's the real deal no we don't smoke Street carts around here gorilla glue number four by rhythm this one's got the little peach I noticed that the sativas have a little yellow swiftly line right there these does hybrid has a little peach color sweetly lime can you see the little squiggly line you can see it right there it's very nice on the pen let's give it a rip Gorilla Glue the number for co2 oil very nice nice flavor real earthy kind of tastes almost like the flower would taste if you smoked it with sweetness to it very nice I like that a lot that taste see so cartridge a little plastic mouthpiece though I don't like to really care for the plastic I do like the ceramic ones that Prime has in vero has a ceramic piece by than that $55 I paid for the half gram of the Gorilla Glue as a mouthpiece there's a little swig Li line and cartridge it says the C cell its co2 oil cheers let's get another rip mm-hmm I like that a lot nice tasting hybrid let's hope that pit does the trick I think it will I'll let me know a little bit more about what I thought down in the descriptions but yeah so far it's pretty good gorilla glue by rhythm co2 oil cartridge half gram yo peace now let me know what you guys are smoking on of course down in the comments section have a great weekend happy Saturday here in Erie peace", "fvCQ-DDJT6c": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we're gonna show you our latest addition to the honey stick lineup of product which is our flavor max disposable oil vape pen now this little pen we just put up on the site yesterday is not a rechargeable it doesn't have a cartridge and a battery that's separate it's a one-piece little oil tank that you're gonna fill up you're gonna use and then once it's all done out of battery then you're gonna toss it and either get a rechargeable one or purchase some more if you really like this pen now we put just because the disposable doesn't necessarily mean that it's a it lacks on any features we really wanted this one to have nice creamy solid hits but to really have the big box flavor taste that you could get out of some of our other more high-dollar cartridges so in case if you want to travel or you're just not one of those people who wants to maintain your vape pens this is gonna be a good little go-to for you now let's jump into some of the specs so as I mentioned before the battery is not rechargeable also it is an auto draw so it doesn't have a push button it's gonna be activated by your airflow so in order to turn it on or to vape you're just gonna inhale and when it's on it's to be indicated right around the foot here of the vaporizer with a hyper white LED since we have a light here I don't know how well you're gonna see it but I'll inhale on it just to show you guys oh that was coil do not dry inhale these vaporizers otherwise you will taste nothing so first of all when you get your your your oil vape pen it is going to come in a little transporter tube like this and we're gonna jump into some of the technical specs so if they come in here be it is a glass tank glass mouthpiece okay you're gonna want to keep this little plastic tube in order to transport going out on the town going out for the night you want a small little vape pen you don't want to carry around your stay-at-home unit or you're scared you might get a little reckless and you might lose it these little pens are good for those occasions so this pen will slide right into this little plastic piece as you'll see we have a rubber stopper and as long as you push it all the way down past all of the three ribs it also has a little seal right there which will plug into the mouthpiece it'll be flush to also additionally seal your kit case of ends up upside down you won't em even I don't recommend storing it upside down that you won't end up with any leakage that comes out or goes into your pocket so let's jump into technical specs so we have here is a 280 mAh battery which the battery should last through the entire duration of you vaping the tank and also have a little extra spare I don't recommend after you've run through a full tank to refill it because you could get snagged before you run through the second tank and have some oil left over in there which you don't want to happen so fill this thing up give it to you have a 280 milliamp power battery which is a good capacity yeah design-wise you have the honey stick insignia there with the hexagons you know give you guys a little better view just to the bottom base there and then that's all followed up by a glass pyrex glass reservoir so just give me a nice high-quality topped off with blue seal gaskets at the top and at the bottoms to make sure that you are not leaking and it also has for purity not a wide bore but a nicely cutout glass mouthpiece now this tank is a ceramic heater it is also non-porous so you're gonna have pretty good heat ups on here definitely gonna be flavor oriented with the glass mouthpiece a ceramic heater and also as you saw I had nothing in there and it was still kind of smoky heating up when I inhaled on it so you're gonna get good heat up time and it is a 0.5 mil fill so you're gonna be able fit just about a half a gram in there in terms of orifice holes and how thick a liquid you can put in there these have one point eight millimeter orifice holes so you're still gonna be able get on the thicker end of the spectrum oils in there even if you have minor coagulating in there but with an auto draw you Nicole a ting you do have to know that if it does get solid around the heater or the air holes you might have to take a few little priming puffs and by priming puffs I mean puffs like you would take on a cigar when you were lighting it you know just just very slow don't really inhale just really get the heater going start getting the tank hot and allow the materials to break up so how do you fill this thing let's run right through it this glass mouthpiece you're gonna grab the metal collar right here you're gonna twist counterclockwise and again twist gently because you have gasket that goes up here then you also have gaskets on the mouthpiece you want to make sure that you keep those in place you also have a seal gasket on the very top collar there and you just place it down gently then you would take your CBD juice or syringe and you want to carefully and slowly inject up that went a little fast inject around the sides and let the liquids work their way down to the bottom now one thing that you definitely do not want to do is you don't want to force the syringe in there don't make it so that you move the center post at all you know don't have it bounce off the center post the liquids because then you could run a risk of leaking around the outside of the tank really wait for it to settle before putting any more in okay now you see I might have actually overfilled it just a hair I got right to the brim I'm waiting for it to kind of settle in a little bit because I don't want it to leak so I'm gonna give it a couple seconds here kind of blow on it a little bit now I'm gonna slowly and gently make sure you leave the gaskets in place slowly and gently twist now clockwise tank then when I feel it you're gonna feel it when you get it tight it's gonna get a pretty good little seal there now you are all filled up and then what you do is I would just leave it let it settle for about ten minutes and then you can start to vape on here and like I said what this is not a rechargeable unit it's not something I would be in the practice of refilling but then once you vaped it through you're pretty much ready for a new unit so if you like this and several other cool items for a little flavor max pen check us out on WWV pani stay calm

had been married I had three kids I didn't divorce for a couple of years and now we said I had already been her lover for numbers of times and we touched in the end kissed and caressed and touched places and did things that I had never ever average fritz I didn't even know I didn't even know that I didn't know what making love was about or making making feelings with other people and touching with other view there was no there was nothing in my life to prepare me not my marriage night and I love my wife very very much and and I and I nothing had ever prepared me for the experience I had

around it it didn't just kiss over a molecule you experienced that whole molecule and the ones sitting next to and the ones seen next to it and each person and each kiss and each every feeling it was the best thing I've ever happened in my life and having a another person in this kind of a real sexual and sensual and all-encompassing feeling of love and being loved and when when we were finished I

the last few months well let me tell you this whole legalization process it was cool at first but then you know I got kind of tired of it got kind of bored I liked we better when it was illegal I feel that they really fumbled up and [ __ ] up the initial launch Ontario in general and I'm actually pretty disappointed I mean I like the San rafeal tangerine dream I like the San rafeal della haze but after a while they just kept having the same stock from like it was just all old weave and it's just you know they lost 40 million I read and just overall really really disappointing but but my curiosity's been piqued once again and I have decided to upload a new video because there are now other things to have besides old Krusty weed that expired long before you received it so my old favorite San rafeal tangerine dream but this time in oil form so let's open this [ __ ] up right here and see what we got of course we got the classical childproof packaging I can't [ __ ] break whatever the [ __ ] I bought [ __ ] was you know this [ __ ] was [ __ ] 230 $3 per gram I swear that's [ __ ] more than gold itself it's absolutely [ __ ] ridiculous the prices they charge for this [ __ ] and you know what OCS is a scam there I said it OCS is a scam and that's the reason I gave up smoking weed and that's the reason I don't do this channel anymore and that's probably the reason why this is the last video I'm ever gonna [ __ ] make but I will say this I want to get high and therefore I will San rafeal tangerine dream one disposable vape pen I don't even know what the [ __ ] that vape pen is th 750 milligrams I'm gonna shove this thing up my ass and I'm gonna get so [ __ ] baked beyond [ __ ] that I'm never gonna get sober again so let's see cannabis s drag do not freeze store in a cool dry place storage keep upright no expiry date has been determined I don't know if there's a good thing or bad thing so let's see what we're dealing with here huh pretty simple when do I have to remove this part yeah you just have to remove this part you can't even see how much liquid is inside what the [ __ ] okay let me ruin this [ __ ] better have an instruction manual what the [ __ ] common in me yo this is the same [ __ ] that they've been given since times what the [ __ ] blood disposable pen how the [ __ ] do I use this thing man what the [ __ ] alright um I guess you inhale through this part I don't know if you have to block this hole is this a joke or something I can't probably see it very well is this a joke no no alright three two one blast stop Oh Oh me in the ass oh my god just be advised I literally haven't smoked weed in [ __ ] months oh my god I gave this [ __ ] up got kind of tired of it oh my god what is this oh [ __ ] oh alright first hit um I think it's

I am overall 8.5 out of 10", "WLD7kW_uVEY": "- I don't know how any\nof this works at all. So, where do you put the fluid, why do you need power? I know nothing about this. - Yup, that's exactly what I thought. What the heck is a Juul? - What is a Juul? A Juul is a closed-loop vape system. It consists of a battery\nand a pre-filled pod. Pre-filled pod is filled with e-liquid with a high nicotine volume. A Juul is very easy to use, all you do is put the\npod in and vape away. - Lots of high school kids\nwould never think of smoking. They've grown up with anti-tobacco ads. - [Girl] With this contract, I relinquish part of my freedom, to you. - [Kavitha] The scary thing\nis they don't think of vaping as smoking a cigarette or as smoking. - [Boy] Vaping can deliver\nnicotine to your brain. - It is true that Juuls don't have a lot of the toxic chemicals\nthat say a cigarette has, but a tiny Juul pod has the\nequivalent amount of nicotine that's contained in an\nentire pack of cigarettes. So, why would kids Juul? - They love the flavors. - I've heard a lot of kids say like, just gives them a quick buzz. They feel good after they do it. - You see the younger celebrities, they're holding a Juul in their hand and everyone on Snapchat\nwill like post videos of them juuling. They just find it as a way to be cool. - If you have money, you\ncan get it super easy. Just ask anyone. - One of the things that makes\nit really hard for educators is that Juuls are really easy to hide. - So, if I'm a student\nand not dressed like this, but if I have a pocket or if I, I put it right here. - Juuls look so similar to\nsay thumb drives, right? It's really easy to get confused and of course, kids\ntake advantage of this. So, a lot of students told me about a game they play in class, where a student can go up to a teacher, who has no idea what a Juul is, and say hey, I've got my\npresentation on this thumb drive, can I charge it on your computer, please? Because, I really need to have it. And then, they go ahead\nand charge their Juul on the teacher's computer\nand teachers have no idea. - It's very tricky, it's\nmade to be very tricky, to trick us, so it's therefore\ndifficult as teachers to know if they're actually vaping. - So, what's a teacher to do? Here is some of the things you can look for in your classroom. - So, your typical high\nschool bathroom, right? - Frequent or long bathroom breaks. A lot of kids go to the bathroom and then they hang out juuling. In fact, it's become so common, that schools across\nthe country have either cut down on the number of\nbathrooms that are open, teachers may monitor the bathroom, sometimes even principals. - You might have five or six kids hanging out in here with\nthe door closed and vaping. - Watch out for kids who cover\ntheir face with their hands, who sometimes have sleeves\nnext to their nose, who put their head down often, and maybe they just hide,\nthey're teenagers, right? But it could be that\nthey're vaping in class. A principal I spoke to said one of the most\neffective methods he used was really involving parents. So, for example, he didn't just talk to\nkids about the problem, he had after school seminars\nwhere he would invite parents and then it grew even bigger, it wasn't just parents, he actually invited the entire community, so that there were lots of\nsets of eyes on his students. And parents are still really influential in their teen's life, I mean just listen to what this one kid, Zane, said to me. - My momma don't play that. (kids laughing) It's that simple. - [Kavitha] Your mom is a very smart one. - Yeah, my mom would kill me too.", "SkMSUTbZNt4": "YouTube what is up today we got the Ballet Russe had a new sauce cart half gram we're gonna go and throw it on I'm going to show you what my favorite dispensary cartridges dog I'm an if mmm well my favorite dispensary cartridges and we're gonna go inside and now burners down have evolved animals and if you love animals make sure you hit that subscribe button cartridge but this is my favorite go-to dispensary pen the standard form with the temperature gauge on the bottom these haven't been around for a while sleeve Oh in Cranberry Haslam but they work really good i charges up and waiting for a cartridge to put it on but anyways back to this I don't even know how to open it guessing you got some kind of button or like a damn push to start that is the dopest cartridge I've ever seen you guys a baby blue bottom that's fancy see so regular Bank cartridge but Robert on this thing super dope could be filled a little more [Music] oh all right we're back with the grassroots look at that I hit it there was two hits no three hits tagging on and look at how much sucked on that bottom whatever it's trying to paddle a aru's I got the cartridges on 3.5 so with some dad mug I got along this thing rips and there's no fake flavouring it's just straight straight straight strain like probably can't see is good I love that grab this today I got the video up something new very very disappointed I've really had nothing but fake turb sitting in a while but this oh my god it is so strange specific and the cartridge hits so hard to you can feel the smoke running into your throat this is a definitely I would grab you guys Rock make sure you subscribe you're not subscribing my subscribers you guys [ __ ] extra rock and this is good I love the new style I love the new box I love everything about this cart I don't move it I'm lat -

and I just got this brand-new stand that I bought so I can record on my phone easier it's a nice little thing you can just stick your phone in there using that right now and I'm already loving it just because before I was just [ __ ] around with she putting shine on top of [ __ ] this is a nice little thing that about that today I'm reviewing my first disposable with a pen this is called ace Valley and it's indica vape that's the first time buying a disposable vape pen at the dispensary about a spare leaf on in Calgary our rate across from co-op on all 11 pass yeah anyways he I wanted to try a vape in because I tried a nexus one so I just loved it it was like literally just inhale it and that's it you don't turn anything turn anything on I got to recharge anything you use it until it's empty and then you throw it out this weight is two point two eight grams hope this isn't I don't know how it's gonna turn out sound wise but to to plane grams I think was fifty bucks so perfect the dollar thing and she has a pretty surprising amount of weight to it too so I'm surprised at how much there's weight like I want to get a vape pen that's just like this but I could mean we use it like I have one almost like it very close I should go get it but I want to go again but this is a straight-up indica let's see THC they're saying 180 milligrams CBD so we got anyway just try it out it's crazy it's so weird you just like take this thing that like doesn't have any connection or anything electrical on it that you can see you just inhale it and out comes feet and I can't like that I can hold up a cigarette as someone gonna get smote years the vein production is pretty good too it's like it's just good just as great on thing indica right they're getting a bit of a aftertaste to it and cocktail is not a weed advertised that almost like a mechanical or like new device that when you buy a new vaporizer and sometimes you gotta like burn off the smell it's coming [Music] that's the thing you can't burn you can't wash another 50 bucks Oh I got lay em and one last game all right I swear I bought like reusable weights that are like gee business I think I have forget how much my keep in know who was that anyways for like one of the most discreet pens can't really beat this all right maybe you can get ones that a little smaller that one so that local must exactly like a cigarette but we don't really need to be discreet big neon the whole book like that and just baby sweet though I love that and and it's like it's always lived you know put some ice good night indica starting hitting me the sun's still out I gotta be here so so the device is off I love indica in it I'm getting a weird sticky stickiness on my lips I'm like can there seriously be residue build-up already from like three puffs don't miss Fergus residue the building up I'm getting something that's like sticky the bit of a stickiness coming on the end and the mouthpiece I don't know if that's just for the first couple uses or every time but I'm already getting a sticky residue on my mouth my lip set I didn't get to like one or two puffs we'll see long-term use we'll see what happens I'll still on this lass I should note the date to see how long and anyways maybe I'll get back to you to see how long this lasts whatever but for now that's my review of the indica yeah even just at the end of eight that's the only thing let's just straight up man to go you're not getting like you know flavor or whatever you know like a high strain name this way anyways guys you gotta turn this off now so peace out [Music]", "mToqWkpWpyc": "look this the raw [ __ ] about it even though it's a disposable pan bro you can unscrew your you can screw that [ __ ] bro what's up y'all due to the youtube

and pen banana punch uh lime og citrus sap fino indica hybrid i guess those are the strands they use to come up with the behind my mama number three i'm not really sure then uh it says all this [ __ ] but i'm not gonna read all this [ __ ] bro it basically just describes raw garden the brand and all that [ __ ] bro how they got pure cannabis flowers oils and all that [ __ ] it says it's indica down here uh that's pretty much it guys it didn't really say much about it um i didn't really say much about it uh pretty much always said that uh it's uh by mohammed and they broke down all the strands used to make this [ __ ] up so yeah guys we're gonna fight the [ __ ] up see what's popping uh i was smoking this [ __ ] earlier bro this [ __ ] got me so lowered it earlier man hopefully this [ __ ] don't need no help no uh charging anytime soon because i don't even gotta charge it for this [ __ ] let's dive right in man see this shit's popped oh yeah a lot of this [ __ ] got a small hit to it for one joint he'll bro he got like the little kicking like the little last kick into it bro so that [ __ ] feel me i should start growing [ __ ] out your toe bro god actually made me cussing a lot so here again man uh i had earlier bro the whole day i wasn't smoking bro which is the whole time i was chilling here man uh so i'm like man you know what i'm gonna go to the club and see what the guy

show me the alien laughs a little green things i'm going green thanks i i made a video on backing them back in the past i thought she was gonna bring some [ __ ] like that but she brought this and then she brought some other [ __ ] the other [ __ ] i didn't like it for the fact that it was sativa i took this because this [ __ ] was indica so she brought this i'm like oh [ __ ] i ain't never seen a raw garden uh disposable penis i'm like [ __ ] i'm gonna take that [ __ ] so i took that [ __ ] brought it back home and i would never expect to get a battery no lie that's wrong like i think they got a whole free battery guys like after i finish smoking with this [ __ ] throw that [ __ ] out i got a whole bag to the neck that's tight not alive it's some weird [ __ ] though that is the 0.3

this time we got the latest offering from Aurora this is from their brand Aurora drift so we've got THC sativa blend one disposable of a pen 0.15 grams literally the beta vape pen never view here for it this thing will go for about 3035 bucks you get total THC seven hundred and thirty five point six seven milligrams so that comes in at 73% the CBD content is 0.46 milligrams so 0.5% it's basically non-existent there's like no CBD in here it's a THC heavy sativa pen so let's check it out here kind of eager to see what Aurora has to accomplish here lately it seems like that company can't do anything right let's see how they do for the rapes so I'm gonna open this up so it looks a little bit like San rafeal just open pinch the sides and pull it out so there we have it that's all the packaging you got not just wasteful as others so it'll wasteful but there you go so we will take this and and take this out here so there you go it's actually kind of a nice little pen I like the black color which is nice see on there it says THC sativa you got the Aurora branding on there got this little mouthpiece condom we just take that right off and there you have it it's your standard disposable Big Ben oh you got your THC sticker on here really like the design of it actually it's got a nice little mat feel nice design so far so good let's not waste any time always jump in on so hmm not an explosion of flavor definitely some cannabis taste there almost a little fruity hmm I'm gonna have to investigate a little bit more let's just try here see that little a on the end I take it that probably lights up when I drag yeah you get a nice smooth drag not overly tasty but doesn't taste like crap either yeah terpenes I don't know a little bit of fruitiness in there kind of earthy fruity tapes go together nothing too memorable nothing you're gonna be writing home about but nothing you're gonna really complain about either vapors not too bad pretty good so yeah that's your pen therefore you gonna be back here I'm gonna go take a little bit of experimentation on this I'm gonna put it through its paces gonna see what we get you're gonna wrap up the review on the old THC sativa blend grower drift vape pen here don't have a lot of good things to say about this pen so let's just getting a pros and cons pros great design like the black design like the iam of the unit feels really great like that little glowing a you know it's really great really branded nice for aurora yeah the design is great don't like the fact that there's no way to see inside the tank to see how much yeah well enough to see what the oil looks like so it's really no way to know but other than that great design and thus ends my list of pros let's get into the cons cons value this is not a good value for you you know one buy this package is gonna run you a 30 35 bucks you're getting 0.15 grams and it's gonna last you like a day a couple days maybe if your moderate easier but not long and what are you gonna get out of those a day and a half well not much the effects I got on this thing we're minimal at best stiva blend 73 percent THC I was thinking I was gonna have a really strong cerebral energetic sativa high really didn't get anything didn't really feel lifted at all to be honest with you if anything I kind of felt a little bit of a headache later and it was really feeling burnt out so I don't know not the effects I'm looking for on a THC sativa pen as well like I said this thing lasted me about a day maybe 25 drags and it was dead already very bad value it's only 0.15 grams it's not gonna last you long anyways but I was expecting a little longer taste first first few drags there's a little bit of a fruity kind of spicy taste going on there it just evaporated quick like by 12 13th Drive it's getting like no flavor on this pretty much just sort of a kind of a harsh hot vapor flavor that's it just heat the vapor quality degraded as time went on with the thing and yeah this was just not a good disposable vape pen so you know flavor not great did not last like it wasn't that great in the first place and the flavor that was there just did not last like 10 drags and you're not tasting any flavor in here whatever terpenes they put in there did not last the value not there 0.15 grams is not going to last you a long time in the best of times but they seem to go really fast I've had some other ones that last longer than this not good value effects like I said the effects were not what I wanted to be not feeling what I was thinking didn't really get me lifted it didn't get me energized they can't expect that of a sativa same didn't really get me high kind of just gave me a headache and left me feeling a little run down and burn so not what I'm looking for in a disposable sativa vape pen so yeah Aurora had some high hopes for you like I said things have not been going too smooth for that company the last little while hoping these babes might turn things around for them they are an Alberta company you know I got to support them but I cannot recommend this product to anybody I do not recommend it to myself probably will not be buying it again sure hey maybe did I get a bum unit that was not good possibly am I gonna be running out to try another one to see probably not for quite a while so I recommend you do the same I would stay away from the Aurora drift disposable vape pens not too sure about their 510 threaded cartridges gonna try those in the future but this is a no-go for me so there you have it or a drift THC sativa blend disposable lakebed do not recommend so but any of you out there have you tried it what do you think leave me a comment just comment down below read them all reply to mom love to know what you think I like to know if you think I'm right if I'm wrong did you like it what did you like about it what didn't you like about it you know how it works let me comment so ok thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed the review hope you're all staying safe out there taking care of each other and until next time keep smoking", "NtKpQchsoRE": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] what is going on folks my name is steve stevenson this is maryland marijuana review hola konichiwa gutentag and aloha for any of you island nations that are lucky enough to be owned by the United States government welcome to the show how do you folks do today hopefully all's going well it's your first day back from guessing a solid break in action hopefully you all were lucky enough to get that break in action and take full advantage of the season it is summer this is the unofficial start to summer and I know it's not a happy Memorial Day but it's a good day to take time to remember the people that gave you the freedoms that you have for what it was worth you know what I mean I know everybody joins everybody joins different groups for different reasons any group at all you know what I mean you join them for different reasons your job may be you joined it because you like what you do maybe you join it because you like the money you get yeah anyways back to those topic at hand um as I'm so easy from getting off a topic today I have a product called true cush true cush is going to be a two seconds I will get us a true push by grassroots grassroots of Maryland true push is a cure oh gee cush derivative oh gee originally meaning ocean grown in California that provides patients with a strong body high and a relaxed head field the strong indica effects of true Kush or are perfect for patients seeking relief from pain inflammation and restlessness I don't know if any of you a restless but I get all uppity it happens to the best of us so this um true pusher I got this because it doesn't smell I wouldn't say that it is a sour smell but it is a diesel gas II kind of smell it reminded me of several of the other jet fuel from g6 jet fuel from Verano it reminded me of a few other buds in town but this one had a really high THC content for being a middle tier but I think it's 28 or 29 these labels aren't printed too well but the other reason that I got this was the terpene rating is somewhere in like the three almost 4% for a for an actual bud that is crazy it's not crazy it's just really high for those of you that are unfamiliar terpenes are basically the flavor markers for weed so if you wanted a specific weed and you didn't know you know what weeds tasted like what but you knew the terpene profile that you were after they could just type it into the Machine and pull up um you know all the skunky buds in the store and they'd have a bunch of them because that's you know if that's what you're after so this true G let's get it a click the smell on it is just pure gold the buds on this thing let me see if I get it yeah they're a little bit darker they look a little bit less uh I don't know how to put it they're not the buds are not tightly packed they seem kind of loose and veget of from a first glance but yeah we're definitely going to get a good good smoky choke mmm-hmm damn that weed smells good you know I was in a store one day and um I was waiting for food and this guy came in that just stunk like death he smelled like I mean like someone lit a bale of weed of really really skunky weed on fire in his back seat and it dawned on me I'm like I'm not mad that he smells like skunk weed I'm mad that I don't smell like skunk weed I'm like where is that good [ __ ] how do I go about finding that [ __ ] and now to be honest with you it was Sour Diesel it was the black market sour Diesel's black market Sour Diesel is very popular I totally understand why like I say Sour Diesel in my humble opinion is the the quintessential go-to essence of if I'm having a dream and I'm smoking a joint in the dream it's going to be Sour Diesel even if it doesn't say Sour Diesel in the dream I know that's what I'm smoking on and that don't get me wrong I think there are better tasting weeds out there all things considered I like my mai tai there was a cross with Maui wowie and something else because that had a skunky but al in a little terpene in it I think I've [ __ ] that up I know I [ __ ] it up but uhm yeah that's a like a purple weed style terpene so the two of those flavors together actually one of my favorite tastes and for the longest time I was mixing a LCU which is an Afghan mixed with some Rainbow PUSH with a Sour Diesel and the sour diesel I forget what that's in that but uh it was some amazing weed all around that was like my best happiest hope times and both of them were sativas or sativa leaning dominant so yeah let's get into this quick turkey smoke lighters up if y'all feel like joining me for the smoke America well oh yeah hmm smacks lips but as it were the smacking lips flavor on this is actually pretty damn good it's got um it was a little bit harsher of a toke early took a little one but I got a little bit of a scratch I'm not gonna lie um All Things Considered though yeah I would say this is a really good weed if I had to rate it I would give it somewhere around an eighth for flavor and for THC the THC I want to say twenty-eight twenty-nine percent I'm not entirely sure as I say the labels are looks like the printer needs an upload own ink yeah but yeah I guess that's it folks try to keep it rolling because I know uh I know things so you all enjoy yourselves digital high-five from me Steve Stevenson enjoy folks hope to see you all again over and out", "rpVMTvEEWJ8": "hey we are back once again perhaps I preemptively lied about it being my last video because I was a little angry but I must say that this is a Wizards penis this [ __ ] gets me high as [ __ ] it is unlike anything I've ever tried before I have no idea what the [ __ ] inside it and that's just crazy few problems with it you got to keep it stored up right apparently every time I talk from it it's clogged so I got to inhale hard and then unclog it I don't know whether that's about so when at first clogged the first time I thought that [ __ ] was over with it was done and I was actually really pissed but it seems the last a long time you just have to unclog it every time so now after this mini review we are back I've also preemptively opened this before hands so I will not have to one-handed struggle open I'm still gonna struggle with these but as you can see same [ __ ] different pile disposable vape pen reusable vape pen so let's see what we got here San rafeal tangerine dream and though bloody so yeah as you can see I'm gonna get high as [ __ ] I do not like the CBD I like the THC so I got one cartridge because I figure it would last me a long time if I got it and this one is the actual pen itself so I'm gonna be reviewing the pen the cartridge will come maybe later so same thing instructions unlock lock five clicks auto locks after 10 minutes fate prescient hold heat three clicks low green medium blue high red preheats two clicks 15 seconds low battery eight go home you think a [ __ ] stoner can figure this [ __ ] out three purple flat like what the [ __ ] is going on blood contains the equivalent of 1.2 of dried cannabis let's see what this shit's all about let's see what I got myself into oh this one is miraculously easier to open so that is quite delightful so we got Oh what the [ __ ] well I thought it was wet for a second or just a minute all right so it's the exact same [ __ ] thing does this parts unscrew I'm gonna have to figure that out later so let's see we got battery five as I said five to turn it on and off unlock five clicks they press and hold heat three clicks okay let's go through this again so five to turn it on vape press and hold heat three clicks so okay let's see 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 1 2 3 ok
