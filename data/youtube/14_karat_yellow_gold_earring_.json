Mark's Square I don't know the exact little shop that I got them from but if you guys are wondering it thought is where I bought them and I will try to have like a dupe link down below just so you guys can like get this look for less just because these are 14 karat gold pieces and they were more expensive just because I wanted them to last me a long time and yeah and the next necklace I get a lot of questions about is this little mini Scorpio necklace and it's just a gold chain with my zodiac written out on it and it's just really tiny writing I got this on Etsy I'm actually gonna go back through my emails to last year and try to find the exact shot that I got it from cuz I know it got shipped from Europe over to the United States it took like a month and a half from when I ordered it to when I received it and it's just a little mini 14 karat gold solid name necklace and I will find the Etsy shop I got it from a link down below for you guys just in case you guys want to get the same thing I know I get a lot of questions about this necklace and I don't know I just like thought that it was different because I'm really like into my zodiac and horoscope and that type of stuff so instead of just getting like my name on a necklace I decided to get my zodiac just because cuz it was something different so I really really loved it and layering these two necklaces together just like looks so good and I just I don't know I really love them a lot so that is basically the jewelry I wear every single day now I'm gonna go into a few pieces that I wear kind of like switch off throughout the weeks and just like whenever I feel like it these items are not like 14 karat gold they're not real these are more affordable pieces that I bought just because I like them and I like to like accessorize with them but the first items are these earrings right now I've been wearing these ones a lot and I have my like ear pierced with the double piercing so I just wear a little gold hoop and then I wear these little earrings that have like a peace sign and then like a love sign on them and so these are the earrings I've been wearing recently every single day and then right here I just have all of my chunky hoops and like fun earrings and accessories that I wear or have been wearing all the time recently so I just want to share with you guys where they're from just because I get so many questions on them and the first pair of earrings are just these gold chunky hoops then I got from Target they're super cute I will have them linked down below they were only six dollars but they're just like the perfect small chunky hoop and the next pair of junk you have they're my absolute favorite lately and they are just these solid gold hoops from Madewell and they don't go all the way around which I really like and they're just really really big I know that they also come in a smaller size so I will have both of them linked to down below just in case you guys don't want to get them me or my favorite hoops right now at the moment I love them so much I just think that they're like literally the perfect pair of Hoops and they're not like that shiny they're kind of a more like a distressed metal gold hoop and I really really like them I think they're gorgeous and very timeless and then inside this little marble like jewelry container I just have a bunch of Hoops that I either got from Urban Outfitters or forever 21 so in the first pair that I have are just these tortoise ones these are from urban these are so cute and just like a nice little accessory to have I know earrings are my favorite accessory just to just have any outfit so these ones are super cute from Urban just for the days where I'm not really feeling a gold hoop it's nice to like to switch it up and wear like a tortoise one and the next pair from urban are just these kind of like oval rectangular hoops and these are just plain little gold shaped hoops kind of self-explanatory these rooms are just super fun they're really lightweight and then my last pair hoops from urban I wore a town over the summer I haven't worn them a lot recently just because I've been into more of like a bigger more chunky OOP but they're these little dainty gold like half circle hoops these are super cute if you're not really into wearing big earrings I think that these ones are absolutely perfect and then I have two pairs of like bigger fun more chunky hoops to wear like when I go out in the first pair are just these twisted ones from forever 21 and they just look like that these are so fun I love the detailing on them like when you wear a plain bodysuit I feel like it really dresses up your outfit because of like the twisted detailing and then the next pair are these ones from Zara they're super thick and they are kind of like a hammered gold it's like detail hammered gold I almost have material hammered gold detail and they're just these little half Hoops got these firms are in Canada these are amazing I love these obviously you guys know I love a good chunky hoop if you couldn't tell already it by the video but my laughs pair that I own are just these little small ones from made well and I got these I think last spring and they're just little mini gold chunky hoops and these ones actually go like halfway around and then like the part where you put in your ear it's like up there at the top so they kind of look full circle but they're not and these ones are super cute just again like little small ones if you don't like wearing big hoops you it definitely can wear little tiny ones like this but these are just my favorite hoops that I've been wearing recently that I own and all of them I usually get from like urban or like Madewell Zara places like that where they just have like good accessories even Free People has really good runs too but I will have all that hoops that I just mentioned link to down below for you guys I actually forgot to talk about these two bracelets right here just because I haven't been wearing them recently since it's not summer I took them off but I have the double ball kpop bracelet and then the single ball just the silver bracelet with the gold ball detailing and they are from Eden in East Dennis on Cape Cod they are just the original authentic kpop bracelets and they actually weren't my mom's but I have been wearing them for a couple years now they're just beautiful sterling silver and 14 karat gold bracelets and that concludes today's video I hope that it was helpful for you guys just sharing my favorite jewelry pieces where I get my everyday jewelry and all of that again it will have all the links down below so it's very easy for you to find them if you guys want to check out any of these pieces and thank you guys so much for watching this video I love you guys so much and I will see you in my next one bye guys", "FciFJzh1aWQ": "[Music] hi guys is a girl Pauline and welcome back to my channel today we are talking about gold jewelry and I'm super stoked to talk about gold jewelry because one I feel like recently within like the past year I feel like gold jewelry has definitely become like a trend like my friends and everyone around me plus like on social media and including myself I've been seeing that we've been building out our like gold jewelry collection and especially because like all these ecomp brands like maggiore Athena's jewels um miss Alma like all these brands have made it very easy for us to buy jewelry and made it more affordable um first it's like going to life at Tiffany and Co or like some other jewelers around like the local area and so being the newbie in the cold jewelry market definitely is super confusing and so this is why I felt like the need to make this video because um I feel like so many of you guys out there are probably like going through what I'm going through is just kind of like figuring out what's the best cycle jewelry for me what do I really want to invest in and like I just had to do all the research and so this video it's really for you guys who are also newbies like me to just kind of like have the basic knowledge on like gold jewelry and then using this knowledge to make your purchase and so yeah and so before we get started if you guys like my videos and want to support me I do really appreciate it and you guys subscribe to my channel give me a like during or whenever comment and let your friends know about me in my channel let's start with the different weights of gold and so when you're reading these subscriptions you'll see 14k 18k 24k and occasionally 10k but what does this really mean and so the K means karats and this is just an indicator of help here the gold is and so 24k is the purest form of gold and then anything below that is just like a fraction out of 24 and so really like 18k is 18 out of 20 for 14k is 14 out of 24 and so for 14k this means it's gonna be 58.3% gold and the rest it's mixed with other metal alloys like zinc nickel sterling silver um brass or whatever other metal set the manufacturer might be using and so this doesn't really mean that it's a bad thing it's a less pure form of gold but because gold is actually a very soft and malleable substance it does need to be bonded with these other metals to make it durable so 14k is actually a pretty good choice if you're planning to wear your jewelry every single day kind of like engagement rings they're usually like 14k because like you're wearing it every day you might be like working with your hands a lot and so it's very resistant to like scratches a lot more than like 18 or 24 because again gold is very soft and so 14k is the most durable another reason why you might like 14k or it might be a better option for you is because it has a lot of Verity and what I mean by this is that if you ever heard of like white gold or like rose gold um that can all be felon under 14k and rose gold is actually is very specific to 14k um and what makes these different Gold's a different color is not because of the gold content is because of the metals that's mixed with a gold and so white gold is typically made with like silver or white metals and I think this is like nickel sterling silver and I want to say to think as well and then for rose gold it's because there's a lot more copper content which gives it a rosy pink color that rose gold has and so if you like different options or you just like don't know I think like having a Verity of goals to choose from gives you the ability to choose and try things on home at a more affordable price and that you know that's also like the best benefit of 14k gold it is the most affordable price because you know there is less gold content and more metals but because it's like very durable I think it's pretty worth it if you're just testing things out and if you really want to wear it everyday 14k is not a bad option at all moving on to 18k and again 18 and 24 24 being the purest form of gold means 75% gold and the rest are metal alloys and this doesn't mean that it's a not a durable choice it's still durable because it's bonded with these metals um it's not as durable as 14k so if you're planning to wear this jewelry every single day and it's 18k 18k might not be the better option but why you might like 18k more is one um it's the more hypoallergenic choice if you're allergic or you have sensitive skin to like metals like nickel I think that's a very popular one a lot of people are allergic to um and we're like you know if you ever feel like you've gotten rashes because of necklaces um 18k might be the better option for you because there's more gold content which may means of course less metal content that you might have an allergic reaction to and also because there's more gold content in 18k it also makes it more valuable and so for resale um it goes a lot higher than 14k um and also just having a pure form of gold just feels like a flex s so that might be a reason why you like 18k more so those are just like the many benefits of 18k and that's like the difference between 18k and 14k it's still durable but it might not be for everyday wear so and lastly 24k this means it's a hundred percent gold and most of the time you actually won't find jewelry that's made of 24k because again gold is soft is a soft boy and so if you buy jewelry that's 24k just know that it will get scratched it will get damaged and so use should be for very special occasions if you want that rich yellow color or you're just trying to flex on someone but just gotta be careful with it all right so 24k for ya 24k magic now the most important part how gold jewelry is made there's different ways that gold jewelry is made and this is super important when you're buying gold jewelry because if you're seeing 24k and you know that's pure gold and you're like oh that's cool but if it's plated and you're picking 24k plated versus of 14k solid gold I would go with the solid gold and I'll explain why so first gold plated gold plated jewelry how it's usually made is that it starts with a base metal whatever the manufacturer is using and then they dip that into gold whatever purity they're using and then they take it out and electric current stuff I don't know science happens and that's how cool plated jewelry is made and what this really is is that it's actually a small thin layer of cold that's sitting on top of the base metal and because it's sitting on top and it's very thin it's more susceptible to damage so a few things that you should keep in mind when you're buying gold plated jewelry 1 it's very affordable and so it's light on our pockets so if you want to try different looks um gold plated jewelry is the option for you and because it's so affordable for not only us but for the manufacturer as well they can create actually a lot of different designs and so that gives it a lot of versatility so big chunky earrings or necklaces you usually see probably is gold-plated but what you really have to keep in mind is that all gold plated jewelry will tarnish gold plated jewelry is known to not last very long and so you only get a few wears out of these items um because you know it's really easy to damage one because there's a very thin layer of gold so it will get scratched or if it gets exposed to any type of moisture that will tarnish the gold as well or whatever base metal the manufacturer might be using um like I forgot what it is but it might eat through the gold over time and so if you want to save money in the beginning gold plate might be the better option for you but if you want to save money in the long run I would kind of just not consider gold plated jewelry at all so like what the hell for me well romaine is a very specific type of gold plating um after doing some research I learned that roommate it's just a little bit thicker than gold plated jewelry um it's a standard so if it doesn't follow the standards then you can't call it for me but after doing some research and reading a bunch of blogs from all these like websites and like small Yukon brands um I feel like a lot of them don't follow the regulations or the standard and they still use for me and so I would stay clear of firme in general because one it is also gold plated jewelry and so it will tarnish over time and unless you know that this company is a reputable like brand you should buy their firm a stuff if you trust them but I don't trust nobody so so next is gold filled jewelry so gold filled is not what you might think it means it's not filled with gold like I thought that you can't blame me because it's called gold filled but how it's actually made is that the base metal that whenever the manufacturer is using it is mechanically bonded to the gold that they're using so instead of like gold plated jewelry where the jewelry is dipped and it's a very thin layer sitting on the top of the surface of the base metal it's actually bonded together and so the goal is actually a lot thicker and because it's bonded to the metal the metal overall won't Beach out um and so some key things that you guys should keep in mind when you're buying gold till jewelry it's that one it is a pricier option compared to gold plated jewelry but overall it is a mid tier range it's not like super expensive like solid gold but it's not as readily available as gold plated and as I mentioned before because the gold is bonded with the base metal the base metal again won't leach through the gold so overall this makes gold filled a more hyper allergenic choice for people who have sensitive skin or are allergic to certain metals lastly we got a solid gold baby and when that's exactly what you think it means it's solid gold all the way through there's no base metal at all which of course makes this the most expensive and the highest price point of the three I mentioned and what's really nice about this if you have the money to invest in solid gold jewelry I would definitely do it because you don't have to worry about tarnishing or fading over time because gold is gonna be gold in because it's all wood all the way through there's no leaching of any types of metals except for you know like I told you about 14k 18k but overall still the best option for a solid gold and if you plan to resell your jewelry after you wear them for a while you can make some money back because it definitely has a higher resale value personally for me I'm still building out my jewelry collection and though I am tight on budget but I also want to invest in something that's a little bit more high quality I'm seeking out more gold filled jewelry options and so I got these earrings also another pair of earrings and a necklace from skin studio I just found them on Instagram they're this very small business from Melbourne Australia and I love the quality of they're like work so far I definitely feel and see the difference of gold plated jewelry versus gold filled and these are like my first time buying gold fellow jewelry so I'm just very excited to buy more to build my collection but also know that these items will last me a lot longer a really popular brand that I see everyone wear and their marketing is so good and they definitely know how to target their audience is Maduri I personally bought form a pieces from Missouri and I don't know what happened but it's only been maybe two months that I thought were made jewelry from them and it tarnished and it looks really really bad except for the ring that I still have from them that I said kept separate from the necklace and that year I don't really know what happened my opinion I think my jury overall is very expensive for what it is very dainty cute items I want to say but I don't think it's worth it if you can seek out a better quality item or gold-filled item or if you have the money you can pay for their 14k solid gold jewelry but I don't really agree with their price point on their solid gold jewelry but what I am excited about is this recent piece I added to my collection so Garrett got me this Tiffany and Co 18k solid gold necklace and this is super cute and dainty I definitely feel the difference in quality and weight compared to gold fills and gold-plated and this is my first time really owning something that's pretty expensive I want to say so I really treasure and appreciate this present so much so one day when I have enough money I definitely want to invest in more solid gold jewelry but for now gold filled will do the job alright

"dHbWS5TluWs": "hi I'm Aaron Galligan and I'm the founder and designer behind MMR jewelry welcome to our FAQ videos the common alloys that we work with in the US are 22 karat 18 karat 14 karat and 10 karat the higher you go in karat like 22 karat the more pure gold you're going to have so it's going to be richer and more yellow in color it's going to have a lot more of those gold properties so it's more resistant to tarnishing it's more hypoallergenic it's also going to still be very soft so as you go down in the carats you're going to have a metal that is harder and more durable not more likely to tarnish and change color and less hypoallergenic so 18 karat is great for somebody that wants a more yellowy or richer color or possibly has a lot of allergies or skin sensitivity so they want something that's a little bit more hypoallergenic some people can only really wear high karat gold but with 18 karat it is going to be more soft so for a ring it's going to show a lot more wear than a lower karat gold so 14 karat gold is going to have more of that pure gold and the alloy than other metals it has enough other metals to make it harder so it's really great for everyday wear but because it has more of that pure gold it's still more resistant to tarnishing or changing color there is a reason that 14 karat gold is as popular as it is in the US it just got that happy medium between having enough of the pure gold in it to have those really great properties of pure gold but enough of other metals to increase that hardness and reduce the price of it so a 10 karat gold you now have more of those other metals in the alloy than the pure gold so it is going to be more likely to tarnish and change color and it's also going to be less hypoallergenic but 10 karat gold is great for somebody who's looking for a ring and they're really hard on their hands it's going to be the hardest of those alloys or if you're on a tight budget you might be able to get a 10 karat gold frame where you wouldn't be able to get 18 karat gold thanks for watching I hope you found this video helpful for more answers check out our other videos or our FAQ page on our website the link is below", "1ZZLZRVk958": "hi guys welcome back to my youtube channel my name is kate for those of you who are new make sure you are subscribed if you're new here and like this video if you enjoy it today's video i'm showing you guys my updated jewelry collections i did one of these last year i believe i don't know if it's been a year yet i know i've gotten some more jewelry pieces since then and my style's a little bit different and i have some different pieces some new pieces that i wear every day so this is kind of like my jewelry collection slash my everyday jewelry that i wear i'm just gonna be sharing with you guys all of my jewelry pieces if i can find them i will link everything down below for you guys so that way if you like any of these pieces you can grab them yourself i don't have a lot because if this is like my everyday jewelry i don't want to go into like my whole entire jewelry collection because i don't even wear most of it i just wanted to show you guys like my everyday jewelry collection that i have going on now so i guess i'll start off with what i have on first so i'll start with my earrings so the hoops that i'm wearing right now in the first hole are called the jennifer fisher mini kevin hoops so these are like my favorite little chunky hoops ever they're so cute they're such the perfect size so cute they're so flattering they're hollow so they don't like weigh your ears down you know like some big earrings do i really am in love with jennifer fisher hoops they are pricey but they are a very good hoop to have i'm serious they're just like the perfect amount of chunk you know what i mean like if you're into hoops you're into jewelry you know what i mean like i never thought that i would spend that much on a pair of hoops but you know they're just stunning i love them so much if i'm having like a no makeup day i like to wear hoops for some reason so i'll usually throw on these if i have like no makeup on i just feel like a little bit snatched you know so in my second hole i have these earrings that are actually from urban outfitters they're 18 karat gold plated little mini huggies and i have had these for at least two years at least one and a half almost two years and i've worn them i think seriously every day since then and they're not even like tarnished or anything and that's amazing since they were only like 18 and they are from urban outfitters i'm pretty sure they're like 18 karat gold plated so it's not like solid gold but it's honestly really surprising because i worn them every single day i wear them in the shower i wear them in the water and they don't tarnish at all so i love that about them i just love little mini huggy hoops and then the third hole on my ear i have these little gold studs and these ones are 40 karat gold from etsy some pieces that i have are 14k gold just because i like to have a variety of good jewelry that way i can have it forever and it'll last me a long time and i can wear it in the shower whatever i don't have to worry about it tarnishing so i do like to have some really good quality jewelry pieces again i will have everything linked down below and i will also have some dupes if you don't feel like spending a lot of money totally get it and then when i'm not wearing these big chunky hoops these are in my ears every single day there are these mini huggy 14 karat gold little plain huggy hoops from missouri so i wear these every single day this is what i wear i wear these in my first hole the urban outfitters ones and then the ones from etsy every single day if i'm not wearing like anything else they are 14 karat gold and they don't tarnish so you don't have to worry about that or anything and i do know that they have these same exact earrings in a gold plated version i believe i love these they're the perfect size for the first hole and then with the second hole in the third hole like it just looks really cute so then i'll move on to my necklace right here this is a 14k gold necklace from etsy and it just says my name just love it so much because it's so dainty it's like the cutest little necklace and i've been wearing this every single day i used to like layer my necklaces but when i got this one they were getting like all tangled so i just took the rest off and i've just been wearing this one just love how it's personalized to me and it just looks beautiful that is my everyday necklace that i've been wearing and then these are my rings i have four rings that i wear my hands every single day so i will start with this one so this is i don't want to like flip you guys off but i'll just take it off so this one is a cartier look-alike ring that i got actually from amazon you can hate on me all you want saying that it's fake blah blah like i know i'm telling you it's fake it's not real i've just always wanted a cartier ring i think a lot of girls do i don't know just something about them i just like because they're very like minimalistic here's the thing with jewelry is that i don't mind spending some money on it just because i know if it's real gold or whatever i know it'll last me a long time and i'll have it forever rather than like spending nothing on something that i know won't last me a long time and i just have to like keep repurchasing it you know what i mean but i haven't gotten to that point yet with this cartier ring so maybe someday down the line but yes i got this from amazon it's actually pretty good quality for what it was worth it was like 20 i think and i'm not sure if it's still on the website i could find like similar ones i mean it doesn't tarnish or anything and i've washed my hands with it a million times and it's still in like perfect condition it actually says cartier in the middle which i think is funny i wear this one on my middle finger and then this little one is from etsy and i just think it's really pretty and this one is not real gold i think this one is like 18 karat gold plated or something like that i think it's really cute really dainty i'm really into like dainty little pieces of jewelry so moving on to this hand i have a pinky ring and then a ring finger rings my pinky ring is also from etsy and it just has my initial on it if you can see that it's really really tiny and dainty which i love hands in general are like tiny and my pinky is like really tiny so i really like this for my pinky i just think it looks really cute this one is actually 14 karat gold and then this one is also from etsy it's just this little chain type ring let me take it off for you so this one is not 14k gold this one is plated so it's just like a little chain ring i think it's really cute different you know so yeah those are my rings that i wear every day and those are like the only rings that i have to share with you guys because these are like my everyday pieces i don't really have any other rings that i wear and then my bracelet that i wear every day is this 18 karat gold beaded bracelet that is actually from italy i went on a trip to italy last year actually oh my god it was like a year ago it was a year ago in september wow that's crazy i just think it's the cutest funny story i actually broke it um i think like last christmas and i was so upset because the beads went everywhere like i'm not gonna be able to find them oh my god it was like freaking out because i love this bracelet so much it means a lot to me but luckily i found most of the beads to form it back into a bracelet and now moving on to all my other jewelry i guess i'll just go with my hoops so as i said before jennifer fisher love her love her jewelry i'm kind of sad because i have two other pairs of her hoops and these are not real gold they're actually brass like 10k gold brass plated i have the baby samir hoops and then the i don't know what these are called wait no these are the mini samara hoops and i'm dropping them these ones are the mini samira hoops and these ones are the baby smear hoops so they're a little bit bigger than the mini ones i'm a little sad because i don't know what it is i think it's because when i lived at my old apartment i was in a loft and i had them in my jewelry box like in the little pouch that they come in they come in this little pouch that says jennifer fisher and it was always so humid and hot up in my room because i was in the loft and i was like a pie was also on the tallest floor of my apartment so it was like always hot in there and i think the humidity of my apartment just like ruined my earrings like i'll try and show you they have like spots all over them i don't know if you can tell like you can tell from this angle like on the inside i'm like really sad about that because i love these hoops so much and i can like tell that they're on these ones a little bit it's like so strange if you have a pair of jennifer fisher hoops can you please like let me know how i can fix these or like what the issue is here because i honestly don't really know love jennifer fisher i'm just really really sad about the way that they're like tarnishing a little bit like i don't even know how to describe it i'm gonna have to like email customer service over there or something and see what they can do because they are quite expensive so i also have another pair of little dainty hoops that are actually from urban outfitters i think these were like 18 at the max i don't really wear these that often but if i just want like a little tiny dainty hoop i will grab these because these are so so cute i think i got these like two years ago or something and they've held up really nicely and then these hoops these are the last pair of earrings that i have for you guys so these are from adina's jewels and they're just little dangly huggy earrings i think these are stunning they're so so cute and different and i love them i got these not too long ago and they look so cute paired with like other earrings if you have multiple holes on your ear they just look so cute so i'm so obsessed with these these ones come in two different finishes so i think you can get these in the real gold but i didn't i just got the gold plated ones and i just make sure not to wear them in the shower just in case they tarnish though now i'm going to show you my necklaces and i only have two so we're coming to an end here but i guess i'll start with this one so this is from etsy and this one matches my bracelet they both have like diamond cut shimmery beads and i just think it looks so so pretty so shimmery and it gleams and oh my god i love it so much this is i want to say 14 or 18 karat gold plated so this is not solid gold i've worn it in the shower i've worn it in the water it hasn't tarnished like one single bit i haven't worn it in a while but i used to wear this every single day like if you watch some of my previous videos from a little bit ago i used to have this on like every single video and i just love how it matches my little bracelet the last piece of jewelry that i have for you guys is this little dainty necklace from etsy so this is 14k gold and i just wanted to have this just in case i wanted to put like a little pendant on it because i used to actually wear my grandmother's chain like exactly like this and i used to have a little pendant on it that she gave me and my little brother actually broke it so i was very very sad but my girl etsy always coming in clutch she has legit everything like i'm telling you so this is like the exact same chain as i used to have it also looks cute like just plain so yeah that is basically my whole little collection of my everyday jewelry so i hope you enjoyed this video and i will have most of these pieces if i can find them if not all of them linked down below for you guys if you liked any of them you can purchase them yourself and also this is actually my jewelry box which i keep all of my jewelry in so i will also link this down below for you guys because it's just very pretty and i love it don't forget to subscribe to my channel and like this video and i will see you guys next time bye", "_ZsXUwTQDmA": "hey everybody at silver seeker and today we are talking about gold we are actually talking about the difference in value and purity of all the primary carats of gold some 10 14 and 18 and what I mean by that guys as in gold jewelry generally it's going to be either 10 14 or 18 karat now also in this video we're gonna teach you how to calculate the value of each one of these as well as figure out the value for any carrot of gold whether it's 22 or 8 or any of the other carats out there all the way down to even 1 and additionally after this video is over you're gonna know exactly how to tell how much the goal than anything is worth as long as you know exactly what the carat is it's actually pretty darn simple so let's get into it and guys really quickly before we get started I do want to say if you like this video and you want to see more like this make sure you subscribe so you don't miss out in the future okay so in front of us guys we have 10 14 and 18 karat gold this is a gold and these are gold wedding bands right here and this is a pair of 18 karat gold earrings so to figure out what exactly the carrot of gold value is is actually pretty darn simple because all you have to actually know is that 24 karat is pure gold and I think most people that know anything about gold know that 24 karat is pure that's as pure as it gets and because of that it's actually really simple to find out the value of any other carat of gold so what we did is we actually got the calculator here and we're gonna show you very very simply so if we know that 24 karat is pure we can use one to represent a whole or in other words a 24 karat piece now if we divide this number by 24 you will see that each karat is point zero four one six six six six six percent pure or in other words point zero four one seven percent pure so now that we know that we can say okay well I have a 10 carat ring so this number times 10 there is the purity of 10 karat gold 0.41 7 do you see what I'm saying very very simple or we can take this number we'll take 1 divided by 24 again and then we can multiply it by 14 for 14-karat and now we know that 14-karat is 0.58 3% P R or in other words 50 8.33% peer and we can do the same for 18 karat and actually 18 karats pretty simple math but if you take one divided by 24 and then multiply it by 18 you can see that 18 carat is 75% pure which makes sense if you were to say you know divide 24 into four parts 18 carat would be three of those parts so you get the idea is 75% so knowing that you can actually calculate how much gold is in anything so if we take 1 divided by 24 let's say we have an 8 carat ring so we'll multiply that number by 8 we know that 8 carat is 33.33% pure now knowing that math makes it very very simple to find out the value of gold so all we have to do now is get a scale so we're gonna get our scale out we're going to turn it on so we're gonna go ahead and start with this 10 carat gold ring right here this is actually my own wedding ring and it is 10 karat gold and the reason I have a 10 carat gold wedding ring is because you know I work with my hands sometimes and I wanted something strong and since 10 carat gold there's only 41.7% pure as we now know it must be filled with other metals that are much more strong than gold is so it can resist a little bit more damage a little bit more wear and tear so knowing the math that we have we're gonna go ahead and put this on the scale and we can see that this ring weighs 0.26 ounces Troy so we'll go ahead and clear out our calculator and now let's do the math and figure out what the value of this ring is so today gold is sitting at 17 hundred and thirty dollars an ounce now ten karat gold is 41 point seven percent pure so we just take 17 30 and we multiply it by 0.4 one seven and that tells us that 10 karat gold is worth seven hundred and twenty one dollars and forty-one cents per troy ounce now we can simply multiply that by 0.26 because we have 0.26 ounces and as you can see our ring is worth one hundred and eighty-seven dollars and 57 cents now you might be curious how that relates in grams since jewelry as we know is generally winning grams and so I'm gonna show you that the math is actually the same it just takes an extra step so we'll go ahead and switch our scale mode to grams and as you can see the ring weighs 8.1 so to get this number it's actually just as easy you just need one extra step we know that a gram there it takes 30 1.1 grams to get one ounce a troy so all we have to do is take r1 and then we're gonna divide it by 24 and then we're gonna multiply that by 10 for 10 karat now we're gonna multiply that by spot so 1700 and 30 and we get to our 720 dollars and eighty three cents now we just divide that number by 31 point one and now we know that 10 karat gold melts for twenty three dollars and almost 18 cents per gram now we just multiply that by eight point one and as you can see again we have one hundred and eighty-seven dollars and this time 74 cents it's slightly more precise because it's weight on grams instead of ounces troy and other than that it's the same it's within cents of the other way of doing it so this math can be applied to anything so without getting into the ten and fourteen carat ring here let's go ahead we'll get our scale back on because it's shut off for being timeout let's imagine that this ring is 14 karat gold well the math can be applied the same way so we're gonna take 1 divided by 24 we're going to multiply that by 14 now we're gonna multiply that by spot so 1700 and 30 and now we know that 14-karat gold melts for one thousand and nine dollars and seventeen cents now we just divide that by 31 point one and then we multiply that by what it weighs in grams eight point one and as you can see two hundred and sixty two dollars and eighty three cents so in 10 carat this ring is worth one hundred and eighty-seven dollars and fourteen carat it's worth two hundred and sixty two dollars because 14-karat obviously is more pure so the beauty of doing the math is that it can be applied to literally any care to gold so knowing simply that 24 karat gold is pure and if you divide one by 24 and then multiply it by the carat you get the exact percentage purity of gold you can literally use this math for anything in fact let's do one more example will say that our ring is now eight carat so and United States something you may or may not know in the United States for something to be marketed as gold jewelry it has to be at least 40 percent pure so 10 karat is the minimum basically for us gold marketed as jewelry 9 karat goes below 40 percent so 10 karat is basically the number it has to be in the United States for it to be marketed as gold jewelry but let's say we have a European 8 karat gold ring those things do exist so let's go ahead and do the math again so we're going to it's very simple we're gonna take 1 divided by 24 BAM point four one six times eight multiply that by spot seventeen hundred and thirty now we're gonna take that number divided by thirty one point one we're gonna multiply that number by eight point one very quickly we know at eight carat this is 150 dollars and nineteen cents worth of gold so as you can see it can be applied to any gold ring if you know the carat you can easily figure out what the value is with very very simple math so 10 carat 14-karat 18-karat eight carat 22 carat 24 carat it doesn't really matter this method right here makes it very very simple to figure out the value of any carrot of gold so guys that is what I had for you today and as the scale just said it's set by and I will say buy as well but I do want to say thank you very much for watching the video and we hope to see you next time thank you so much for

I'M", "hxthMM8xIJE": "hi friends and welcome to RK traders Center my name is Roy and in this video I'm gonna teach you all about gold not the gold bars that you find it's a $9.99 fine and you already know what they're worth or gold coins that news motifs can tell you that just by knowing the grade you can look in a book and find out what it's worth but I want to teach you about gold jewelry gold jewelry like this to be exact and why would you want to know about gold jewelry like this well do you know how much this gold jewelry is worth with a little bit of knowledge I'll be able to give you the tools and knowledge to know what this gold is worth just about by looking at it let me give an example say you found this ring at a garage sale flea market estate sale do you know how much this ring is worth let me first say I'm not an expert I don't have a degree in gold but I do know a lot and let me tell you a little bit about my background so you understand when I was young my dad owned a gold silver shop so I was raised learning all about gold silver and coins I also learned that a lot of people don't know the value of what they have why is that why don't they know the value of their jewelry well the reason being is most people just don't know I would see somebody coming to a shop with a ring like this and then tell my dad they paid $4,000 for at a retail shop many years ago and they'd like to sell it because they need the money he would take it he would look at it say it says 14 karat say that he tested it and it does test gold and it has diamonds in it and then he would take it weigh it and tell him he'd give them 150 dollars for it that was very puzzling and perplexing to them so why is that that was the question I want to know and so I learned the answer well in this video I'm gonna give you several tips and a little bit of knowledge so you understand how to appraise your gold jewelry and know exactly what it's worth especially if you want to resell it so go grab your favorite beverage maybe a snack a pen and paper if you want to take notes and sit back and relax and enjoy this video of knowledge that I'm about to share with you [Music] Before we jump in and start talking about gold I just want to say one more time welcome to our cave treasure center my name is Roy if you like videos like this and you might consider subscribing and click that middle notification bell that way you know and videos like this come out now I've been a reseller practically all my life I've gone a garage sale to stay sales free markets trade shows just about anywhere I can find out how to flip for a profit I've owned my own business and I've sold at flea markets and trade shows and while I've traveled around I do a lot of reselling I retired several years ago and I just couldn't let that reselling bug go so I've been selling on eBay for about ten years and still do to this day and I still find a lot of gold like this so this video is rather lengthy and it's important that you don't skip ahead to try to find what you think is relevant by the time I'm teaching you everything you need to know about gold you're gonna understand why it was important to know all the things that I've taught in this video I might teach you what is gold what's the difference between carat or carat some simple math to determine the percentage of gold how to use carats to determine gold purity different gold colors and why they look the way they do what do hallmarks and numbers mean on your gold jewelry pieces some quick tests to check if your gold is real or not and what is my gold worth so what is gold gold by itself is a naturally occurring element it is represented by the chemical symbol au and atomic number 79 on a periodic table gold is the most valuable of all precious metals which makes this precious material perfect and ideal for jewelry making gold is ranked by carat CA are 80 which means 24 carat is this most purest form however gold can be mixed with other materials such as nickel zinc and copper and sometimes it can be rhodium plated gold itself is soft however by combining alloy materials the composition is strengthened the desired effect means the material or the gold will be stronger and last longer and that's very desirable for the beholder or the wearer so now you've got your piece of gold jewelry and you need to read markings on the inside but you can't see them because they're so small or if you're getting older like me you really can't see them so we need our glasses but even with glasses I can't see the inside of the George to be able to tell what the markings say so what do I use do I use a jeweler's loupe like this do I use magnifying glasses like this or do I use eye loops like this well it really doesn't matter no matter what you use as long as you can read the markings inside a piece of jewelry me I prefer either one of these and I use a loop because it folds up or I use a pocket magnifying glass because it folds up and I can stick them on my pocket and that way I have them whenever I need them so that brings me to my question what is a carat or what is a carat and what exactly do those numbers and letters mean inside a ring or piece of jewelry well let me explain k-katie or CT all mean carat when you look inside your piece of jewelry you may see numbers and you may see letters and sometimes you may even see a three-digit number and so K or K T means carat and CT which means carat CT is usually used in Commonwealth or European countries and a lot of those European countries will use numbers instead of 10 carat 12 carat and I'll explain further later on the term carat ka ra T refers to the fineness of gold such as I said tanker at 12 carat 14 carat the term carat CA r80 refers to weight usually when they're referring to gemstones but sometimes they can also refer to gold as well I know it's all a bit confusing but it's okay to use both now that we've got carrot and carrot out of the way what are the numbers a piece of jewelry mean well the numbers represent the finest of parts of gold anyway parts per thousand as I said before karats is the finest and the number represents the parts per thousand so if you look at eight carat gold is 333 parts per thousand or 33.3% pure gold if you look at 14 carat that's 585 parts per thousand or 58.5% pure and if you looked at 24 carat well that's 1,000 parts per 1000 it's the purest of gold which means it's 99.9 percent fine gold so are you thoroughly confused yet well hold on to your seats because I'm about to confuse you some more but I promise I'll straighten it all out eight and nine karat gold is not considered gold in the United States standards eight nine karat gold is the most minimal possible Gold there is and it's usually found in British Commonwealth in European countries we don't recognize it in the United States to be sold in the United States Gold has to be 10 karat 14-karat 18-karat and 24 karat 8 and 9 karat is the lowest possible standard and it will tarnish very quickly so you may be asking me Roy didn't you mention 15 carat 15 carat or 625 parts per thousand which is sixty two point five percent pure is gold recognized the United States however its antique gold and it's not made anymore it was stopped and discontinued in around 1935 so if you find a piece of jewelry marked 15 carat or 625 gold well that piece will hold a little bit more value than just gold value because it would discontinue before 1935 and so now you got antique and gold value and hold on Roy what about 22 karat gold well if you find a piece of jewelry mark 22 karat gold that came from the Middle East or Asia it's usually very bright yellow and very soft in other words your best jewelry to find in the United States is 10 carat 14-karat 18-karat 24 karat and you can easily find the weight and value of all those carrots that I mentioned can you please explain a little easier so we can all understand okay well let's just jump right back into it and I'll explain it even easier alright if you pick up your gold jewelry and you look at it and instead of having a hallmark like 10 carat 14-karat 18-karat 24 carat and you notice three digits and those three digits may indicate it's gold but it may also indicate a silver a good indication that it's silver is of course the piece of silver not yellow or gold looking and it has these numbers these numbers you want to avoid 809 25 or 950 those generally represent silver if you find those on your jewelry even if it's yellow color it's not gold it's silver unless you're into buying silver so Roy you're telling me the this necklace right here it's stamped 7 5 0 it's worth more than a necklace marked 925 yes that's right remember I said 9 to 5 is equivalent to silver 7 5 0 is generally found in European countries or British Commonwealth countries and 7 5 0 equals seven hundred and fifty parts per thousand or 75 percent purity which means it's equal to 18 karat gold and how do I know that well you're gonna find out here a second as we start getting to simple math before we get into the simple math portion to determine the value of your gold let's talk about the hallmarks and numbers you don't want to find on your gold pieces let's say you look at your gold jewelry and for instance it says 10k GP what is GP mean well many of you probably already know but in case you don't you don't want to find certain hallmarks on there you don't want to find ep GP h GP or r GP e P means electroplated GP means gold-plated h GP means hard gold plate and r GP means rolled gold plate so if you find those on your piece of jewelry and this is for instance 10k GP and what that means is your piece of jewelry is made of some other metal material and it's just plated it's not solid so now would be a good time to say if you need to pause the video for a minute go ahead and do so go ahead and refill your drink and make sure that you have a pen and paper handy and if you want to get a calculator go ahead and get a calculator I'll wait while you pause the video oh you're back okay well now let's get into this simple math first of all I'm going to tell you when I start explaining to this simple math may not be so simple but once you get the hang of it and you've done a couple of problems a few times you'll realize that this math is almost as simple as two plus two over all this simple math is going to be relatively easy we're going to break it down in a couple equations that'll be easy to understand but first of all you gotta learn to carats of your gold and find out how to use them to measure the purity of your gold so that way you can take the purity of your gold and determine the value and knowing that way you'll know how much your gold is worth before you can determine how much your piece of jewelry is worth you first have to determine what the carrots are of this piece of jewelry is and how to use the carrots to measure the purity of your gold in other words if you've got a ring that came from British Commonwealth or a European country I explained earlier that it will have three numbers for instance if this one says seven five zero and I know I already told you seven five zero equals eighteen carat but bear with me if this says seven five zero all you have to do is drop the zero and you have 75 or 75 percent gold so you already know the purity of this would be 75 percent so I'm gonna give you an equation and you don't have to write this one down I'm gonna give you another one but I just want you to listen to this one and just try to follow along it's gonna be a little bit confusing one thing I want you to keep in mind though remember this one carat is equal to one part of 24 now keep in mind 24 is 24 carat or pure gold which is 999 fine you can't get any finer than 999 fine now that being said picture this ring and it says 22 K so if this said 22 K it'd be 22 K parts of 24 pure gold or 22 24th so if you divide 22 by 24 you get 0.9 1 6 if you move the decimal place over two places you get ninety one point six which would be ninety one point six percent pure gold but if you took point nine one six and multiply by 1,000 you'd get 916 or 916 out of 1,000 pure gold or now you got your number let's just say that it was 625 if you took 625 and multiplied it by 1,000 and divided by 24 you'd get 15 and what is 1515 carats wait a minute is that really confusing or wet when it did I lose you okay let's do this really slow and real easy because we have to find the carats and measure the carat to find the gold purity in order to determine our gold value now I'm gonna give you two equations and I'm gonna put them right here and I want you to write these equations down and they're gonna be real simple and there's something for you easy to remember so the first equation is 14 divided by 24 equals 0.583 or if you move the decimal place over 58.3% the second equation is 14 divided by 24 times 100 equals 58.3% simple equations easy to remember let me use this an example and give you an explanation say you purchase piece of jewelry that is 14-karat gold and since the most number amount of carats that you can possibly have is 24 just divide 14 karats by 24 you get 0.583 this means the gold purity is 58.3% easy to understand right okay so put those equations away and hold on to them you're gonna need them later on before we go any further let me explain there's different types of gold and I don't mean the karats I mean different colors Gold comes in many colors and it depends on the types of alloys or how much alloy was inside that gold the amount of gold is still the same for example you have white gold rose gold all the carrots still the same the purity of the gold doesn't change because the colors different color added to gold jewelry is just used to enhance the desire effect of the that maybe want to buy it for even more understanding let me give you a better enhancement there's rose gold and there's black heels gold so what are they what's in them rose gold is a comprised mixture of copper and gold which gives it that rose gold color effect Black Hills gold which is famous for its grape clusters leaves in the stems gets its color from a combination of silver alloy and yellow gold to produce that green hue also the copper is mixed with yellow gold and that gives it it's red or pink you an accommodation is that kills gold and we have white gold and sometimes we see white gold is being prettier shinier in some places we'll even charge more for white gold and yellow gold white gold is no different it's just a purity of the gold that which makes the carats but white gold is just a mixture of silver nickel and palladium and generally it's rhodium plated so that that way it has that nice bright shiny silver effect which we call white gold now you're saying okay Roy you told us about yellow gold white gold the different kinds of gold you've told us about numbers and carats and letters but what we want to know is the facts we have this gold jewelry what is it worth how do we sell it so we don't get ripped off by our local buyer and I'm going to tell you but first now we've got to talk about ounces and grams and I know what you're thinking Roy I know what announces well no we're not gonna talk about a regular ounce or a fluid ounce we're going to talk about troy ounces in ordinary ounce or fluid ounce has to do with the weight of mass of something food liquid well we're going to talk about is a troy ounce and inside of troy ounce are grams now one regular ounce would be 28 grams but a troy ounce is thirty 1.1 grams you might want to write that down one troy ounce is thirty 1.1 grams you're gonna need this knowledge in a minute alright ladies and gentlemen you sat here well I've told you all about gold and we've even got the equation on how to determine the purity of the gold just by the carrots now it's time for me to tell you how to find out what this gold ring is really worth and I've given you the tools to do that so I'm gonna give you another equation so I'm gonna need you grab your pen and paper and your calculators so that that way we can determine exactly what this gold ring is worth and with that tools and knowledge that I'm about to share you'll know exactly what your gold ring is worth or your gold jewelry and you'll be able to know what you're gonna get for it if you were to turn around and sell it now one thing that's very important and I want you to keep this in mind if you were to take this ring to a pawn shop they're only going to give you the value of the gold weight they're not going to give you the value of the gemstone that's in the middle whether it's a diamond a ruby and emerald or even just glass they're only gonna give you the value of gold weight now I just wrote down a quick equation and I stuck it behind the camera so I'm gonna read along while I read along what I'd like you to do is write it down and I'll put it up here so you can see it so after we run through this equation maybe a couple times you'll understand it you'll be able to write a cheat sheet down and you'll be able to determine what the value of your gold jewelry is with this gold ring let's determine its worth now it's a 14-karat gold ring so what I want you to do is I want you to take 14 and divide it by 24 write it down remember 24 is pure karat gold so 14 divided by 24 and you get point five eight three which is equal to 58 point three percent next we're going to take spot value now you can find spot value just by looking at the newspaper the computer the phone the news and just find what the actual price of gold is currently for this example let's assume that it's $1,700 an ounce so I want you to take 1700 and divide it by 31 point one and that'll give you the exact amount of one gram of 24 karat gold which is equal to fifty four dollars and sixty six cents now I want you to take that amount fifty-four dollars and sixty six cents and multiply it by 0.583 and that will give you the determination of what one gram of gold is worth at fourteen carat you see how we're starting to go with this now the next part is something I haven't told you about but it's kind of important and you're gonna need some sort of a scale a pretty accurate one this is an actual jewelry scale and you can use a regular scale but it's not gonna be exact or postage scale again it's not going to be exact what you're gonna want is a scale that measures in grams and if you don't have one that's okay let's just go ahead and continue with the equation so you'll understand how to wear your gold so just for the purpose of this exercise we'll assume you have a scale now we'll take this ring and put it on a scale and it weighs six point six seven grams so now I want you to take that number you came up with earlier thirty one dollars and eighty seven cents and multiply it by the weight of the gold that we just weighed which was six point six seven your total is going to be two hundred and twelve dollars and fifty seven cents that means if I went to go sell this ring at current spot value at seventeen hundred dollars in house this ring is gonna get me two hundred and twelve dollars and fifty seven cents so if I paid $5,000 for this ring five years ago and I needed to sell it now it's only worth two hundred and twelve dollars and fifty seven cents and I'm not gonna get anything for that diamond that's why I like to go to garage sales estate sales flea marks and trade shows and that's why I like to find my gold so let's run through one more equation and let's use this ring and this is a 10 carat gold ring so what I want you to do is take ten and divide it by 24 you're gonna get point four one six six six six anyway you get the picture there's a lot of decimals well we're going to do is we're gonna around the decimals next we're going to look up the spot value this time let's say it's $1,600 so what I want you to do is take 16 and / 31.1 that's gonna get you a total of 50 $1.45 keep in mind that 51 dollars and 45 cents that would be the cost of one gram of 24 karat pure gold so now we need to determine the price of this gold ring at 10 karat gold so take 50 1.45 and multiply it by 0.4 167 that gives you twenty one dollars and forty four cents now you know the price of one gram of 10 karat gold at a spot value of sixteen hundred dollars an ounce so what we're gonna do is take that ring and we're gonna win it just like we did before okay we weighed it and it comes out to four point three to write that number down did you write that number down okay now take four point three two and multiply it by twenty one dollars and forty four cents and you're gonna come up with a total of ninety two dollars and sixty two cents if we were to go to the pawn shop and offer this for sale they'd give us ninety two dollars and sixty two cents now they might actually be generous they might look and say that there's well over a carat of diamond there and they might be generous and offer us fifty dollars more knowing that they could take the Diamonds and knock it out of this ring and probably make about fifteen hundred or two thousand dollars just on the Diamonds alone now spot value of an ounce of gold is always going to change but I went ahead and took the liberty and made a cheat card right here's where you can see it and it's never gonna change for ten fourteen 18 or 22 carat it's always going to be the same decimal number so if you want to pause the video and write these numbers down then go ahead and that way you'll have the numbers available for you so the other thing I want to tell you is if you've got a piece of jewelry and you can't find a mark and you're pretty sure that it's gold go ahead and take it to your local pawn shop or jewelry retailer and they'll test it for you a lot of we'll do it for free or they don't charge very much and don't forget to get yourself a good jewelry scale you can usually find these at hobby stores or retail stores and you can definitely find them online such as Amazon or Ebay so be sure to pick one up

Cuba's have this sudden you start out playing this Thank You the bus stop big 8 Cubans big Dookie cubans we got it all i got i go check out my profile I made a 701 706 706 in the meantime see like this one 18 karat gold we got different solutions we use we got 18 karat gold solution 14 karat gold solution 10 karat gold solution CERN tang is 18 karat gold we got a tested with an 18 karat gold solution you can break the camera get the 18 karat solution right here make sure you don't touch it cuz it's very very strong chemical make sure you don't smell it you get cancers like very strong very very poisonous what so you touch this your whole finger get burn all yellow take it out together that's clean 18 because you see the the color the gold of the scratch is not tarnishing or not fading any color you know but let's say you put a 14 karat gold or 10 karat gold scratch tester and use the 18 karat solution then the color is gonna come off because this is strictly tested for 18 karat gold anything that's fake that the color goes away so like I'm trying to see I don't have anything think what should we say like a paper clip right or like a vault came to this is something I used to pin like my diamonds you see to pit the I'm gonna use this look check this out look you see I scratched this over here [Music] barely could even see you could already tell that snake is like you don't even see a gold scratch this on it so once you get the 18-carat solution or not on it it automatically disappears you see [Music] yep off RIT that's the first way you can detective one things real or fake hi so you see as you see as I move the acid into the paperclip you seen all the the color went away then that's how you did detective this Baker real so obviously this is fake because all the color faded away but you can see the 18-carat even I got is still still there the colors still sticking here you know so this is the old school way of doing it though this is like the old fashioned I don't even need to touch the gold man I could just look at it just tells me what's it difference between 10 and 14 this is how it works 24 karat gold is a full hundred percent gold pure gold right so like it's like 24-karat divided by 24 is 100% this was once one pie you know so 14 karat gold it's 14 divided by 24 so it's 58 like about 58 point 30 percent and then the rest mental outlook you know so like a tank carat got a little less gold than 14 they got more metal alloy you know some people think here it's still real it's just not it just ever happen as much tinker's careful 41.6% gold and then the rest metal alloy you know but some people find most people like 40 cuz you get any more gold into the chain then than the metal metallic so that's why people prefer a 14 or 18 you know everything that I put on my chains diamonds and everything I've only put 14 at least 14 karat and up so I use 14 18 karat sometimes 20 to 30 you gotta zoom into that thing Charlie do it but a zoom into that danger y'all never seen diamonds like this but I guarantee you bro", "ClG2PoAgsv4": "give your classic studs a little extra swing by adding these fine 14-karat gold earring

I'm going to be talking a little bit about marks on jewelry and if they say they're gold does that mean that they are always going to be gold and these are basically words of caution too especially new sellers or seasoned sellers that it is a really good idea for you to get your very own gold and silver testing kit to have at home so this is the kit that I bought there are multiples of certain acids because I did buy some fresh acids because I think they might have been getting old of had this kit for a while and basically what you're gonna need is a testing stone I'll link the kit that I bought because the kid I bought came with all the acid the testing stone it came up I think it came with this diamond tester too and a lot of other things that you can use so you'll need a testing kit you'll need this stone it comes with the one I got came with a littler stone but I ordered a big one and you'll also need a magnet you don't have to get this big mammoth JAMA but a nice strong magnet I'm something to protect your hands with rubber gloves or if you're allergic to latex some other way to protect your hands and I think that's pretty much it so Anna loop a loop is always good so basically the reason I wanted to do this video is because I got this necklace and these two earrings in my last thread up box and they looked really good I'm gonna zoom in for you to the so these are the ones that I got this one looked really good it it is marked 925 and you can't see that because I don't have it focused correctly let me take these off real fast so let me zoom in a little bit more so you can see this a little bit better so the first one is this little earring it was a solo earring but as you can see it looks gold and it looks really well-made it's got a nice click to get it put on and there are little teeny stones set into it you can see and it is marked 9 to 5 in there and I think I actually might see another mark not just 95 so that that was really interesting because it does have perhaps a gold plating over it because it does look gold so I'm gonna show you how to test that because we'll test it I'll show you all tested for gold but then we'll also test it for silver so that you can see that even if it is gold-plated that it should still test positive for silver so we'll do that one and then the second solo earring was this little hoop that has a little gold heart on it what I look for is that this part of the earring is also gold the post that goes into your ear so it doesn't always true but you when I find gold earrings they generally have a gold post like that and I didn't originally see them work but now I'm seeing some little scratch marks on the post there I might go get my loop and double check it and so this this earring has got three pieces so want the chest all three parts it's got the back it's got the earring and it's got the charm on it so we'll need to test all three of those I'm gonna get my loop and see if I see what that little scratching is there and then finally there is this necklace which initially I thought oh my gosh this is a score if it is gold it looked really good these parts looked really legit along the edges and like the finish on the end of the the chain then the clasp looks really good for it to be gold and it is marked 14k so I was pretty excited until bum bum we pulled out the magnet and as you don't see it is ever slightly it is ever so slightly magnetic it's not usually magnetic but it is a little bit and for it to be gold it's not gonna have magnetism to it now I know there are exceptions I was gonna comment but I have never come across it where it did test positive so if just one does and I get to eat my words because really it is very well made and if I was a new seller and I didn't have a kit this might you know I might list this because it's marked 14k and looks really like a nice quality another place to look are is on these rings hope you can see that the little rings connecting the pieces generally on a gold piece it will be soldered closed this one actually looks like it might not be I can't tell for sure I'd have to get my loop again but it might be like keep pulling it out then look at the camera so these little leaps jump rings will be soldered closed usually if it's really really high-quality one because they don't want it to pull apart or break you know so let me grab my bleep real quick so when I look at it close I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to see it is not but this is another really good tip I'm not we thinking Alana's looking is that when you're looking at gold or silver pieces and you're not sure if they are real then another place to look when you got your loop out is in these spots where the jump like the jump ring connects to these other pieces or the hook that the moving parts basically because these parts that are moving all the time if it is plated or if it's fake then you're gonna see where you're gonna see that the gold has rubbed off if it's you know just coated and they're trying to trick you know trick you so let's take a look at that and see I keep moving it out of screen now focus sorry but so as I'm looking in here I I don't see that it it doesn't look like there's any gold rubbing off let's look on the other end as well so if you are if you can see and try to ignore those crazy lights there it doesn't look like there any is any of the gold that's rubbed off I'm trying to look at the inside of it as well like inside of the the looping part in here like it's what would get rubbed a lot and it looks from really good so if I didn't have a testing kit you know it'd be super tempting just to go ahead and lift it this is ring up already tested and I know that it is gold so we will just use that for our gold to testing all right gloves on ladies and gentlemen because those acids will burn your hands the first thing I do is I line up the pieces so since this is probably gonna test for silver I'm probably not going to test all of the pieces of it so I line them all up one two three and four and so that I know the order in which my scratches are in and I'm gonna take first this necklace and I'm gonna find an inconspicuous spot I'm gonna scratch on this end of this piece here what's gonna not really be very noticeable so that's my first piece and a lot of times with gold and silver you'll see a difference in the scratch marks too so sometimes when you get really good at this you'll start to be able to tell even with a scratching like it because it's a different color so there's that one you can see this one's a little more goldish this one's lit already a little more silver ish and for our next piece I'm gonna scratch I'm gonna open it up and scratch um from the the post part that goes into the ear okay so there's that one and then finally my gold ring and this has got this kind of a sizer piece in it so I'm gonna scratch on the bottom of the sizer piece going down okay so first things first its marked 14k so I'm pulling out my 14k acid I don't wanna get my number one out so I'm gonna get my 14k acid and I'm just gonna make a little line I'm gonna go ahead and go across the silver to so you can see what happens so straight down the line like so and when you look at them let me zoom it in if the mark underneath disappears that means that the acid has eaten away at it and that it is not that carat so as you can see the acid has eaten away pretty much all of them except for my gold ring so not one that said that it was gold marked gold is not you can still see the asset there or the Goldmark there okay so what we're gonna do now for the the silver mark so this one that we that was marked 14k it's not 14 K so the other ones what we're gonna do to find out if they are silver is we're going to use our 18 K solution and what will happen is when you put 18 karat solution on silver it'll turn like a silvery white so here we go okay right there hmm right there so you can see that it turns like this silvery whitish kind of great color I'm gonna do it on this one too just for funsies just to see what happens to see you're like maybe they've got like silver that they've played it or something nope it isn't vanishing away these two earrings that were marked 95 silver are in fact silver and my necklace which was marked 14k was a complete and utter fake so I would not even list it for obviously obvious reasons because it's not really gold these solo earrings I'll probably either put into a lot or sell them as solo sterling silver you know vorm a which is another name for gold plated silver earrings so those ones might get sold solo and then this one's already listed so you bring you gets back of it in this necklace is still really cool it's a really well made it's really pretty the chain is unusual but I just won't list it as a gold necklace so it definitely won't have as big of a value because of it not being actually gold but I will put you know it is marked 14k but did not test positive for gold so I won't be deceptive in any way but whoever may like the chain somebody may like you know that it looks really nice and get a gold looking necklace for a really good price let me know what you think and if you have any other tips for new sellers of jewelry and I will link a gold and silver testing kit down in the description box below so that you can pick one up for yourself so that if you come across any pieces of gold or silver that you think might be fake or even if you think they're real so that you can be confident in listing them on eBay

inch so we have different sizes very very classic so those are the larger hoops here at the bottom here are the one and a half inch and then from there you're gonna choose your color do you want the 14 karat yellow gold or white gold and then your final option is do you what kind of texture do you like so we have the highly polished here which is extremely classic never goes out of style that's why I like our today's special value this is a fantastic investment piece you pay this price once they're not throwaway hoops you keep them for a lifetime or do you want the twisted which is really modern and fresh this is the texture that I went with this this morning so you have the different textures the different sizes the different colors and different price points so going through your choices you can see that the one and a half inch highly polished hoop earring and 14-karat gold only comes in the white gold in this option this monthly payment plan is $30 a month in the textured white gold one and a half inch that's also $30 then here is your yellow gold in the twisted hoop earring at $30 and then this is going to be the larger size the white gold at 2 inches that's $39 and change a month in the highly polished or twisted and then in the yellow gold same choices in that twisted but here's where we have a little twist in the 2 inch yellow gold option we also have the diamond cutting texture as well so if you love that diamond cut look which I think goes fabulous with our one-day-only necklace I'm wearing or our today's special value bracelet that kind of to me resembles a bit of the look in that box chain only two dozen though in this two inch yellow gold hoop earring and that diamond cutting texture which is always so popular it's gonna give you a lot of sparkle and shine but you also have that diamond cutting inner today's special value so just keep that in mind if you like that matching match you look that would be the selection for you J three five three four nine four what I love about this is it's a round tube on a snap bar closure so I'm gonna take it off the bust to show you how easy it is to get on and off the ear but also you're never having to worry about an earring back when it comes to an investment piece and earring like this that you buy once and you keep in your jewelry wardrobe forever as it's real gold it's really nice to know that I'm not worrying about ever losing an earring back you have that nice you can actually hear the click safety of the snap bar closure it stays in the ear it's gonna measure 1/8 of an inch wide so it is substantial in terms of that goal that you're getting so I'm just gonna grab my ruler really quick to show you how this is going to measure on the ear it's so so classic there's that one eighth of an inch tilting it right there we go and this is gonna be yes a lot of choices but if you can or you want to using easy pay today six monthly payments the best that we offer here you can essentially build your entire earring wardrobe if you want I would be picking up on a sale price today a highly polished and maybe a diamond cutting or maybe the twisted hoop to get variety in your wardrobe or maybe it's getting a different color that you don't have because a hoop is such a jewelry essential it's so so versatile it can be worn for every occasion running around town it's a black-tie affair it's that signature hoop and you know what's so great is when I see Katrina who's coming up shortly you are a lover of those hoop earrings and I always think it has such a beautiful look on the face and I also love hoops because it offers such a figure flattering shape on the face and I think that's why we really gravitate toward hoops circles and orbs really trending in terms of what we're seeing in Hongkong and Milan and all of these high-fashion runway places where the models are walking the catwalks like you walk in that catwalk yes you still girl you can work it but this is going to be what we're seeing on the runway and we go to Italy this is what we're seeing with the Italian women are wearing it never goes out of style hoop earring has always been in my jewelry wardrobe box although I've never invested in a high-end piece of 14 karat gold hoops it's like that piece that I replace season after season stop replacing get a classic hoop earring on a sale price

it was a really nice conversation that I have with Tom he's been in this industry as long as I've been sitting here with all of you and and sharing your days so I love the idea of diamond earrings then I think every woman can and so we talked about this is Bridal this is anniversary and you said besides that probably wedding band and engagement ring diamond earrings are certainly up there in the desire of the top three things women really want in natural diamonds this is your moissanite and a choice of round let's see we have round of stud earrings than one carrot - carrot three carats

easy pays on this one white gold yellow gold the price on this will go up at the end of the day these debuted on the only other day we ever had moissanite presented on the air which was August 29th of last year first time in the yellow gold and again one two three and four carats available as you can see so we're talking about six easy pace in the one carat of forty one dollars and eighty three cents two carats six easy pays of seventy five dollars and seventeen cents three carats six easy pays of a hundred and eight dollars and fifty cents four carats six easy pace of a hundred and twenty eight dollars and fifty cents this is the hallmark I think for a lot of us this is the celebration this marks either appointment that we've gotten to in our lives as women where we can afford to buy something as fabulous as these incredibly flawless durable synth elating earrings or they're a graduation or they're a bridal gift or their a birthday gift one carrot - carrot three carrots four carrots straight post butterfly clutch style back we kept it to a basket setting so it has a very realistic as far as comparing it to that natural diamond no question the moanings themselves - everybody should take note I know that mountings are very a lot of people are very particular when it comes to jewelry it's amazing to me at how many people produce the wrong stud earring mounting this is the right one I promise you there's so many people out there that we asked to help us and it's it's it fits well it's it's one of those that everybody said this is the one so this is all we use within the company this to me tom is a little black dress for women it's never going to go out of style it's never gonna look wrong I mean this could be you know we're gonna have our wonderful Kim Gravelle with us this could be your Kim Gravelle this can be your susan graver this can be your t-shirt and jeans this is something you wear every single day again you talk to me and all of us about the the advantages of moissanite granted I'd be the first I'd add this to you know my insurance policy because they are more of an investment but you're getting something that will look this good years from now so you get to tell us one carrot - carrot three carrot for carrot white or yellow gold in the round and the round is the most popular of all the cuts no all right one carrots completely sold out thank you if you want the three carat white only yellow gold gone two dozen four carat white only one dozen Wow yellow gold first time so stay on the line for those there are more earrings

without saying a word diamond shine a bright light on the timeless peace sign adding a nice sparkle to our earrings and matching necklace of 14-karat white gold you", "sqT4WaARvj4": "hey guys this one share you want a quick look here the earrings me as my thoughts on them now this right here is besides six millimeter and just to let everyone know if you are purchasing them for yourself as a dolt are for another adult or even a teenager I highly highly do recommend that you at least get six millimeter or up even five might might be okay but the reason I say that is because if you get four millimeter you might be very upset just because they are very small unless of course you know you know what size the four is and that's really what you're going for but if you want a advertise earrings out the definitely Bailey's get six or seven millimeter but with that says they're very very pretty and the gold is very light in color they're not really really dark my experience with gold jewelry this real I'm at 14 karat are 10 karat or whatever I've always noticed that the gold is usually a little bit lighter than something to say 24 karat gold I do have a necklace is 24 karat gold and it's a lot darker and golds and these are and that's just my experience with gold jewelry itself but they're very very lightweight very comfortable and keep in mind is the ball of the studs here the ball itself is hollow it is not just completely solid I mean it is gold but the ball itself is hollow it's not just filled with gold on the inside as they worked out look gold on the inside they will actually probably be a lot more a lot more in price and a lot more heavier but considering the ball is hollow they're very lightweight I actually did forget that I was wearing them when I had them on and I even slept in them I showered in them and I did not find a gold itself to chip off or peel or anything like that or discolor so very very nice and pretty and I do have some other ones to compare them to they actually look identical to to them how to actually try not to get them mixed up so this is another one from a different brand they're both six millimeters but as you see they look pretty much exactly the same even the Pope's I didn't notice the post from the other brand is a tad bit smaller let's see then this right here I'm not sure if you guys can tell or not sorry but one does not want to stay up but anyways um one of the backs here it's actually a little bit smaller the one the back from the other company is a little bit small in the back from here but again they're still very discreet very little and tiny um and keep in mind that whenever you are putting them on you do have to secure them I did read some reviews from other customers on here on the reviews that pretty much data it you know that they lost the earrings or the backs not staying on and they fill out just keep in mind that you do have to hear it click and you do have to secure the earrings um and I'll show you guys how to do that here in a second sorry my throat is dry but I guess that you do have to make sure that you hear a click you have to make sure that they are secure and they are in place but like I said I have showered in them I have slept in them and I didn't not have him get moved at all whatsoever and I have very very curly hair so when I shower my hair tends to get rattled in my earrings no matter what earrings am wearing it always does that and sometimes it pulls that my earring and my earrings and sometimes I have found not these airings in particular that I did have found other earrings in the past that uh you know pretty much would get uh I guess make my earrings loose so keep in mind it you know when you're washing your hair if you're drying your hair off if you get your hair rabbit around your earrings just please keep in mind to make sure that they are secure they don't get loose because I'm that can happen that you might lose them and like I said you do have to make sure that that bag is secure and it is clicked in place so I'm going to show you guys on what they look like on and how to secure it alright guys I'm so I do to get the back here stable here on my hand but as you see the one the back to the right here on the camera that back is from the one here from the company for the listing that you're looking at and the back to the left that one as you see the one is a little bit smaller it's from the other company but nothing lasts like is that they're both still very small and very comfortable alright guys sorry about that now I'm just going to show you guys that pretty much you know whenever you do have the earrings I'm not sure if you can tell or not but it does have like the little ridges there I have got one or two and you put the backs on you know you can put them you know rellis well it's up to your earlobe you know if you don't need a little bit tighter a little bit more loose but since our mobility and the I can't say the postal with it shorter than most earrings at half but I'll talk about that here in a second but when you put it on you do have to like hear a little click and you can't hear it as you see the backs are pretty much to the end as you see they're pretty much on to the end right here and pretty much that's where one of the ridges is here on the post itself and it kind of just locks it in place so make sure that they are like that and they are secure okay and lastly before I go and I show you guys what they look like on for the six millimeter I just wanted and like I just mentioned while ago when I was showing you guys how to make sure that it is cure I might want to talk about the post really quick and it looks particles in your ear I will be completely honest it is a little bit kind of short it also depends also on the size of your earlobe so if you have a really thick earlobe you might not be the earrings for you but I mean I'll show you guys my earlobe here in a second and I'll show you earrings in my ears in my ear but I'm a dolt and I'm gonna adult and you know they fit my ear little pretty well they do not feel too tight not too uncomfortable at all whatsoever with that said I think they're really great for children consider the post a little bit more short compared to standard size earrings I'm are you know then the earrings were to say buy one more bright and collectibles these are bright and collectibles if you know the brand but um I would say most of my I had a few different earrings that I looked at the post and pretty much all the posts were longer than these but I can say from the other company as well if you look at them the post is pretty much exactly the same pretty much exactly the same you know it's not short or not longer a pretty much identical exactly the same with that said I notice with most real fine jewelry the posts are usually always shorter than say jewelry that you know sterling slow bars it's not realize that you can just get you know out on the streets kind of really cheap that's my experience I don't know what everyone else's experiences but like I said with my experience you know the posts on real jewelry that fine jewelry it's usually always shorter but like I said even though it is a little bit shorter I did still find them very comfortable that makes a really great for a child or adult and like I showed you guys how the back was on the earrings themselves I didn't have to put it all the way at the back but they did not leave infants in my ears they did not feel uncomfortable or too tight or anything whatsoever and again like I said with the other brand it's really great as well pretty much identical for this brand I mean the back pretty much like I said the post is pretty much the same length so let me show you guys something to click on okay guys sorry for keep stopping it but there you have it this is like a six millimeter and as you see I mean I consider my ellipse not your lobe more Melora whatever you consider normal is um it's not too thick not too thin I mean I have a ear lobe of an adult so as you see they're not too big not too little it's actually really that honestly the perfect size um I mean like I said before what I went I thought would have went for they would have been too tiny and this is actually the size of the military size if you are in the military the biggest you can go is six millimeter so if you are in the military and looking to purchase some earrings that are sweet and simple cute I would definitely say go ahead and get this six do not get 5 or 4 you might be disappointed but like I said this is a six and the size is pretty good here is the back as you see as I mentioned the post the back of stuff goes all the way to the back of post but like I said it's not too tight at all whatsoever very very comfortable and I'm not sure if I mentioned but this is the little box that it came in very nice for packaging if you do receive your earrings and like I said they are hollow so if you do receive them when they are damaged caved-in anything like that be sure that you do come to contact the company or Amazon just because they should not be like that I mean I have not had any issues with mine like that but if you do receive them they are like that be sure that you do contact the company itself or Amazon but they do come in the little red box to protect them so please let me ask you any questions thank you", "yaYXTtwT0-Y": "OW OW ABOUT OW ABOUT OUT OW ABOUT OUT\n>>HOSTHE OW ABOUT OUT\n>>HOSTHE JEWELRY OW ABOUT OUT\n>>HOSTHE

in your choice of sizes in your choice of styles in your choice of gold and this is Dino Lenovo he comes to Milano yes accepted from an analyst and now I pay Stacy yeah because is my English teacher oh she is yes cherub cherub yes you got it okay you've got but I like kettle better he's wrong you can say cherub but it it is it is he was presenting a cherub before and he says he said it with the Italian flair let me share with you what we're looking at right now so we have your choice of the high polished hoop the twisted hoop or the diamond cut hoop in your choice of sizes so we have it for you in a one inch as we go over here in yellow or white one inch one and a half inch or two inch so in each one of these sizes you can pick which kind of finish you want that's the overall story here here's the yellow just showing you this in the one inch your choice of high polish that's and you can get in any one of the three sizes the twisted in any one of the three sizes or the diamond cut in any one of the three sizes so maybe you choose your metal first you say I want yellow gold Rachel that's fine then tell us what your finish is high polish twist or diamond cut and then tell us what size that's how easy it is so the one inch just to let you know is gonna be six easy payments of 20 to 32 and then one and a half inch is six easy payments of thirty five forty nine and then when when you go to the two inch it's six easy payments of forty six 65 that's how easy it is but tell us why did you want to make a hoop in three different sizes and then three different kind of textures as well because hoop earring is a must-have in every jewelry box I think so we try to do to do something new and evolution on the classic appearance we have a classy very polished but then we try to catch the lights in the new way with diamond cutter hoop earrings with a twisted hoop earrings the diamond cut is right up my alley anything that has more Sparkle keep going the secret of the jewels is how they catch the light yeah yeah so and reflect the lights yeah and you know honestly so which one would be the most reflective yeah the most reflective is the diamond if you want to go out with Luke you can choose the diamond cut hoop earrings right so the diamond cut is gonna be the most reflective because it's got more surface area yes yeah so you've got all these different you know this all this different type of surface area for the light to bounce off of and that diamond cutting allows it to be really really sparkly now why why would I choose maybe a twist twist as it's an organic shape so create a create a movement on the earring but it's a different movement respect in is you know it's it's it's a kind of continuous you know twist or a spiral if you will yeah there is a fluidity to it it feels like it's moving because it's twisted and then we also have your high polish why high polish this is my step polish is the simple and elegant it's good for everyday also each one of these readings are and with the tubing process are made with a tubing process so inside are a low so it's are very comfortable in the air yeah they're very lightweight I can share with you that the one inches across the board are very very popular so again you're gonna choose and I put actually the diamond cut in my ear because I love sparkles so the diamond cut I also love they're very lightweight as you said so it's tubing so that what's nice is that it is that tubing so it's not heavy it's not pulling my lobe down I like the fact that it is a snap bar closed so that it they sit well you know if you've ever had a pair of earrings where there's not enough room for your earlobe really and you're kind of going this doesn't really work they sit well on your ears and so that's the one inch we have one and a half inch and two inches as well I feel like if you've never tried a to a jeering go for it you know seriously because a two inch earring is really really fun you know when we talk about sizes who wears to which earrings in Italy my friend the common size now yeah cuz change every year the trend changes now isn't trend the smaller smaller okay yeah but maybe next year it would be the larger section so yeah fashion is in continuous Changeling yeah always always change it you're looking at just synth and just simply has the two inch on and she's got the two inch I think of the she's got I think they're the twists they look like they're the twist to me and they're really really gorgeous and you can see them you know from afar I feel like there's always extra drama and I was right the twist so you are looking at the twisted you know detail there look how pretty that is that sculptural nature of that twist is really pretty it catches the eye it draws the eye it continues to to to intrigue for sure we're looking at any pair of these earrings under two hundred and eighty dollars so the one-inch will always regardless of what you know you do you side the high-polish the twist or the diamond-cut $22.32 like that's for gold for 14 karat gold and your choice of yellow or white period get a pair of home like at this price cuz it's only 1:30 392 this is a steal this and they're made in Italy these aren't made around the corner at Bob's shop around the corner where who makes these it's difficult to make these earrings because this we have to do to make strong the hearing for mixed around the earrings we bake in the particular temperature yeah when finished to two toward the heels to get more strong you may have an example when you show this because maybe if I show is better than there then pretty if I told Commission okay I want to show this yeah okay it's wrong yeah you can move this it's not flabby right when you work on it is flabby but yeah this is strong so when you don't like it's yeah it gives you confidence okay yeah it's know if it if it was flabby when you want to close the hearings yeah this move right it's difficult to close yeah you're getting stuck stop here yeah so you put like this yeah and you and that's had to go and then you and you can hear actually a little snap when you know when it closes you can hear a little snap which is what you know it's just angled perfectly and you'll hear it go click and then you know it's nice and secure and that's how you open it so this is the diamond-cut one and just I mean wow look at the diamond cutting on here it's crazy and again you're seeing those kind of like making of light and the way that it flickers because of the diamond cutting cuz it gives you more surface area for the light to dance and to bounce off of so it just is like rolling across that that's the diamond-cut one and then the twisted one comparison the twisted one is just quieter but it's like that bread twist that you might get at the bread shop where someone gives you a twisted roll or you go to the donut shop and they give you a twisted roll it is twisted so that's what you're seeing and you know the high polish but then twist it and then finally you know for everybody here is the high polish this is your high polish you know exquisite always have it in your purse always have this pair of your handbags because I always have a pair of earrings in my handbag right now because if I forget I forgot to put any on who knows I'm caught somewhere I need a different pair always a different pair of jeans I'm doing a simple and elegant always do you prefer I understand that you prefer to diamond cut I always cut sparkle and shine yeah do you know there is many kind of diamond cut but the first ever is the disco ball diamond cut oh that makes sense yeah that's why I love it so you've got your choice of finishes being at the solid high polish the twisted or the diamond cut and then as we keep on going this way in either the yellow 14 karat yellow gold or the 14 karat white gold and then in choice of sizes the one inch the one and a half inch or the two inch we have all of these sizes in all of these finishes available so to think about it really easily what size you want do you want a one inch one and a half two inch what metal do you want do you want yellow gold or white gold and then what size do you want do you want it to be two inches one and a half inches or one inch just let us know and tell us that you want to put this on six months of easy pay and we gotcha and we'll send it to the house Deedle in Iowa if there was a pleasure standing behind you thank you so much thank you here is my pick of the show so we love", "kGLp3BPRS7k": "14 karat gold today a bold polished

does that better than diamonds but we just can't afford and build a huge diamond wardrobe I know I can't but I certainly can pull off that look again and have it be believable like I feel good I don't feel like I'm settling for anything when it comes to diamonique oh absolutely not actually I know a lot of ladies that wear a diamond a real genuine diamond wedding ring engagement ring I guess it is and then the band the actual wedding ring is diamonique they do Dominique well you know Amy straight night our host did vice versa she had a real I think diamond band huh never had an engagement ring and so she got a diamonique yeah I think your engagement ring and now every you know we keep recreating it because everybody everybody loves that in love and the thing is then you can layer it and layer it and lair it and your ring can just keep getting bigger and better solutely about these but I digress years yeah well that's my well I know it's jewelry I mean come on but these are the only 14 karat gold bezel set studs from the diamonique assortment is the only one the only one so that's pretty fantastic in and of itself and what gets even better is that it's on 5 ezpay from either nine dollars and eighty cents up to thirteen dollars and eighty cents depending on which size you choose so we have a couple choices for you to make here okay and the first is what carrot and size do you want oh I'm wearing these tonight I do I think we both yet are you were doing the same one no no I have a different one okay there's so many lovelies to choose from but I've been wearing these this evening or this morning I whatever ready thank you like you like simple you like I duplicity and these are perfect for you and I like studs because my ear piercing is a little bit lower so I can't wear a very heavy earring okay this is perfect for me so your choice is going to be of the one carat I'm actually wearing the one carat here or a two carat oh okay why did you get a little bit yeah you can get a little bigger than one here okay now the two care is only one that we have all three colors in and we'll get to those colors in just a second and then have a choice of the three good now now in this one's available in white only so the colors you have to choose from our yellow white or rose okay and that's four that's 14 carat yeah I'm Carol I over top yes that's layered over sterling silver okay so these are bezel-set clear round it's really nice there's no prongs your hair cricket catch and caught in those prongs with longer hair do you find that sometimes when you're on set in the stud perhaps a little in your hair out of it yeah oh yeah all the time both kinds of things that happen with long hair I just want you to see the side of these because look at how the light gets through that there you go that's why you get that sparkle oh ok so I don't know about you Stacey but for me I absolutely love seeing the top of the diamond of course but I love seeing that little point as well yeah it's really special so again you have three and size choices to make the one carat the two carat or the three-carat I am wearing the one carat I'm not going to lie i started with the three then I tried the two then I tried the one and i thought i'm just going to wear these because they're the last ones i put in but i love them all and you have a choice of 14 karat yellow gold layered over sterling silver 14 karat rose gold layered over sterling silver or 14 karat white gold that's recounted on i want to say yeah that looks great it sounds like a lot but it's three carats split between two years it's really the size of a one and a half um it does not look too big for you party that is and I actually appreciate the size having a little bit of the longer hair but look at how the nice that is you know what this is that this is a perfect pair of earrings for the young girl think about maybe your daughter granddaughter who's just graduating college they have to go out on job interviews they need something that's going to be tasteful professional smart sophisticated maybe you won't buy her a pair of actual diamond stud earrings maybe she's you know not was in my early 20s move it around a lot I was a little not careful with jewelry I wasn't very responsible I lose it so you don't have to worry about that factor but she has something that we sets a great tone for her when she's going out for that job interview or maybe you just work in a conservative the office environment you can't wear big bold earrings you can't wear hoops you know you're conservative this again always in perfect taste and then t-shirt and jeans and where you're diving eek in the pool in the ocean you know on the cruise don't take them out because again you might not do that with your real diamond stud earrings for fear of it falling out and like I said you'd hate to lose a beautiful pair of earrings regardless of what they cost but should it happen to be the diamonique that gets lost because you're swimming around your plane and you're having fun you know what you can come back and we'll place it right lines a real diamond studs might not be able to do that especially with the clearance price Elise absolutely yeah this is an amazing price you can get this home on five monthly payments of nine dollars and eighty cents if you're going to pick up the one carat eleven dollars and eighty cents if you're going to pick up the to carry we're thirteen dollars and eighty cents if you're going to pick up the three-carat which by the way is going the quickest so just a few dozen remaining in that three carat so if that is piquing your interest go ahead and place your order now don't wait if you even wait just a little bit of time with these clearance prices you don't know you may miss your opportunity the thing with clearance prices is that they don't are these items don't last long because they're priced it's such a great value and we have no way of knowing if we're going to get any more of these back in because it's clearance price so most likely not you know in here again maybe you have a pair of real diamond studs and how awesome is that and wonderful but you know you have it in just gold or you have it in just white gold or sterling silver and you're like you know what I'm starting to wear a little bit more rose gold now and with with necklaces

jewellery but can't invest in solid gold which is much more expensive gold field metal might be an option for you this turn refers to a material on which a layer of gold has been bonded by fusing this means that a solid layer of gold at least 10 12 or 14 carats has been mechanically bonded with pressure and heat to a base metal usually sterling silver or brass this technique provides much thicker layer than gold plating and is more resistant to wear also the color is of actual gold [Music] now that we know a bit more about this metal let's see how to solder it I'm using solid gold solder for soldiering because that gives me better finish and even color a tiny piece of to three centimeters is enough solder in gold fill metal is different to sterling silver where you must heat up the entire piece evenly for the solder to flow with gold field you are only heating up the area that will be soldered and you need to do this very carefully remove the flame on and off overheating will cause the copper to come to the surface as you can see I prefer to use solder pick technique which means I melt the solder first then pick it up with the solar pick and place it on the drawing I'm very careful not to overheat the metal let's see again under smearing I'm quickly drying up the flux and then use the same technique to place the solder with tiny pieces like this it's hard not to heat up the entire thing but try to be very careful and point your flame only on the join there we go now quench it in cold water and pickle [Music] pickling is another important part try not to use the same solution as for silver you need a separate solution if you put silver and gold filled with exposed hands that been cut in the same pickle silver will get plated from copper from the gold fill metal and will turn orange trust me I tried it after you're done with soldiering sand and polish as usual just be careful not to remove too much on gold layer when sanding and that's all for this video I hope this information was useful if you have any questions ask them in the comments below thank you so much for watching please like the video if you did and I will see you soon bye [Music] you",

the trusted gemstone and gemstone jewelry experts since 1984", "neQa6eYZp5M": "I have to give you this story time for these earrings they are so elegant if you look at that mesh print on them it reminds me of expensive costume jewelry that would cost like 30 or 40 dollars to get something this size and women would pay that kind of money for him because they didn't want them to turn because you know if you buy a cheap costume jewelry it turns turns your ears green that kind of stuff though and they needed that elegant look they were copying the high-end designers like Van Cleef in our pails I know I'm in my pajamas but I just thought about this I gotta tell you Harry Winston Cartier those really really fancy jewelry top-of-the-line designers of jewelry you know so this style here this is not your regular go-getter who's from the ghetto swapmeet kind of earring this is really really nice and they had about three other very fancy styles that were unique and elegant and look like they were like costume jewelry like expensive Nordstrom's or Saks Fifth Avenue or Chanel quality costume jewelry that was replicating like somebody like Van Cleef and Arpels I use van cleef and arpel because they are very elegant but understated designer you know they use a lot of jewels but when they don't use jewels if you look at their metalwork it's very elegant understated whereas cardio's look is a little bit more nuts and bolts and it's gorgeous but something with this fine work with the mesh and everything I might not associate with a house like Cartier and Harry Winston they are everything is a diamond you know so but these earrings oh my goodness well anyway I went to I went to Sears and I had my coupons I knew that I got a $25 coupon that I can use online and I knew that I had a $50 coupon that I can use in-store the way it works is I got two hundred and fifty dollars of coupon from one purchase but that purchase gives you $25 a week which is giving me like Christmas every week I get to go and spend my twenty five dollar coupon and then make a purchase of whatever I want so I'm like ecstatic over that but I also made a $50 purchase you had to make it on Black Friday in store and that $50 coupon you can only use in store so as soon as my coupon came acted it came active I was looking online and I didn't see the $50 so then I got I said okay let's go to store my mother had a $50 coupon too I don't know what she bought she's not telling me but in any event so I went and I was looking around at the electronics and nothing was on sale and so I went over to the jewelry department and of course since I just spent all that money on Black Friday I don't have a whole biggle stash set up to be able to buy stuff so anyway I went over to jury counter and I was looking at all these elegant 14 karat gold earrings they just got these in and I know within two weeks all the best ones are going to be gone because they're between 84 dollars and a hundred dollars instead of being four hundred dollars or in the case of this ones these are three hundred and three hundred and forty dollar earrings so there's that quality too I mean when I go to Beverly Hills and I do go and look at the fine jewelry stuff stuff because I like it I like fine jewelry and I have some allergies so I have to wear it so I know when I'm looking at high-end quality fine jewelry versus just gold jewelry that has been made for a ghetto market this is not the hoop earrings that is typical of what is worn by an african-american in south-central this is very unique it goes out on a limb and they priced it well at three hundred and forty dollars but any event I go over to the counter and I thought that they had a 75% off sale if you know anything about jewelry fine jewelry they typically have a 50% off sale that's pretty common so you can expect that if something is $140 you can expect to pay a hundred and seventy dollars for that well I didn't have anything I had to buy it take a look at my black friday haul you'll see all the essentials that I needed to purchase you know just to live just to be just to breathe and clean up and you know try to maintain in life so I didn't have a hundred and seventy dollars but I looked up and they had that seventy-five percent off sale still going I think it was eighty percent off for Black Friday but hey I didn't I needed a vacuum cleaner I I couldn't look at this and then wait on the bathroom clearance back winter has to take priority so in any of it I went over there and I thought that I would have like $25 coupons to use on my purchase so the lady told me these were gonna be 80 84 dollars and I said to her I said I would I had looked at the ones that were $100 they had some really nice ones that were $100 they were really nice and but they weren't as elegant as these you know I wouldn't prefer since I had the coupon to get up here and there was $100 regular $400 over a pair that was 340 that's now 84 dollars because the difference between 84 or 85 dollars and 99 dollars fifteen dollars and these I will have a while right so anyway I was looking and I was like but I couldn't find me out like more but finally I said lay I'm gonna go ahead and get these because they're they're unique they're not something that I'm gonna find everybody in they're definitely high quality and the person who designed these for Sears did an excellent job you know and so but I told her I said look I have to have a $25 coupon on that register in order for me to get them I can I do not have 84 dollars to hand you so I need that $25 coupon I made a purchase a large purchase on Black Friday and they did tell me I'd have that coupon available so could you please check and she's like no problem I completely understand you know you guys just purchased all that stuff on Black Friday so she looked oh and I got myself a coat that I can use a jacket actually that I can use you know it's just perfect for wearing all the time but in any of it she said I look and so then she's going through and she says girl you don't have to worry you have 76 dollars in coupons that you can use towards this purchase god is good because I knew I had the 50 and I had the 25 but I thought I was gonna have to spend 25 and then spend another 25 and there's been another 25 which I was grateful for you know God intervened and I'm gonna have a halt after this cuz y'all wait next week's 25 I got my eye on some shoes and a sweater cuz the way God's working this things out you know my mother made a comment to me she says you know you get an unusual amount of free stuff most people don't get that amount of free stuff I did have to pay $10 and clothing tax for these three hundred and forty dollar earrings yes I did I had to pay ten dollars in tax and these are 14-karat gold these could be sold in any Beverly Hills store because I noticed when I was in Beverly Hills a lot of people in Beverly Hills they don't want the biggest hoop earring they want something that's elegant and works well with their outfit and this fits into that category I remember I was with a couple I was I once ate dinner with an heiress and I think she was she was into women and so she was very friendly to me and she invited me to eat at this fancy restaurant hot sauce probably thousand dollar dinner and everything and she was where I first discovered Cartier she had on a pair of Cartier earrings not even as big as this where in exchange one would be the Cartier screw and then the next would be a little diamond and it was just so elegant and then I understood sometimes the biggest earrings are not necessary to make the statement now I love some chunky fun jewelry but sometimes when you're getting fine jewelry the quality and the elegance does it for you so I just want to come on here and share that price report with you and shop your way if you need an appliance the oven a vacuum cleaner you know a mattress and you're thinking that that's gonna stop Christmas you going to Sears and you know Good King winters Jesus gonna touch his heart give you them shop your way points and it's gonna be all right this is a blessing I know that Jesus did this because it's I mean I have I have so many how I got stuff free hauls on here I guess this is another one but I mean God is intervening in my situation he's singing not just my needs but my wants and I mean I don't mean to make it about things what praise the Lord and I don't know what the Lord has for me when next weeks $25 oh thank you Jesus I'm gonna do another one of these videos because I got something else free that I just have to share and I hadn't shared see now I share don't Instagram but I hadn't shared oh I hear something too in my pajamas you know look in ratchet as I usually do but you know it life is not about how you look is it I mean I try to present myself to the world I don't in a manner that encourages people but um Jesus loves you and I love you without Jesus and be blessed beautiful", "zj2S_qDHolw": "others of the day what we call them our hot pics some of our favorite things and most importantly your favorite things you've told us in the past Italian gold it doesn't get any better than this because you're talking about traditions you're talking about family pride passed down from generation to generation we're

decide whether you love them within the 30 days and the nice thing is then you work them into your budget that way you can get what you aspire to instead of at the moment what you could possibly afford so Patricia is back Patricia hails from Italy and she gets that fabulous job of going to all working with the designers going to all the factories she works with one of our largest suppliers of gold and gem and beautiful jewelry and has been for many many years so Patricia I'm gonna give everybody their options just know everything is made in Italy if we start here in the middle sizes first of all the half carat if you're looking for a closer to the ear more of a huggie style we've got it in polished or satin then the one carat is what I like to call your everyday everywhere earring this is six easy pace at $26.66 that's less than a dollar a day then the inch and a half and it always amazes me the size difference between the one inch and the inch and a half but it truly is that's how they it just looks different to me six easy pays at $40 if you're looking for those perfect spring/summer earrings that you can wear year-round but they just look so good you're gonna save 135 dollars on these they're a quarter of an inch wide so they're again not skinny they're beautiful they're Bombay but we'll before we discover that take a look over here and I'm going to go ahead and do it this way I'm gonna rearrange them just a little bit so that you could see the inch and a half highly polished or do you think that you would prefer something with that one fold diamond cutting and then once you decide that then you're gonna have to decide whether you want all yellow gold and these are Italian gold so it's 14 karat gold 14 karat white gold or 14 karat rose gold so you can be any more specific and you know you're like in this most magnificent jewelry store having an expert like British to help you and you get to choose oh I've always wanted those in white gold or I like them and highly polished a more highly polished or I like more of a diamond cutting you tell us what you like you to size you choose color and then you choose highly polished or that wonderful satiny twisted effect on that alright you know what to me this is the LBD of jewelry this is what every woman should own a pair of Italian earrings you choose the size the color absolutely and you know a lot of the time if you go to your you know high-end jeweler I would say are you even in New York you go to a jewelry store and you look for an earring like this from blue or these are male or you usually can only find them maybe a 1 you know one size one choice so what we do is we actually cut out all the middlemen we go straight to blue or oh they are able to give us the world's best tubed earrings this is a D tubing it is fully fat fully finished side and finished fully polished and you are getting the best quality now a woman like you said the first thing always looking is a woman's face you know we always take care of her hair you know our skin what's the next thing that you want to do is you want to wear a pair of earrings that like I say work sometimes better than a good moisturizer cuz it was gonna be like it's gonna reflect the light it's gonna give you that you know that the highly polished yeah they were a definite that highly polished that what that's going to do your face the light is going to shine off is gonna do wonders and take years off eyes I always say that and the Italians really do do it fast yes blue Oro is a factory that's known around the world recognized for their tubing and that's what you would make bangles out of that's what you make earrings out of so here's our update John remind me the one-and-a-half inch polished yellow a few dozen remaining and then it is gone so make sure you are picking these up because you're talking about saving 135 dollars in the inch and a half saving $90 in the one inch the half inch you're going to save $69 and you can get them home and see what they're like for $18.33 these are timeless generation after generation as far as women wave worn hoop earrings absolutely and really when you you get them and you look at them you see the high-end finishing of it but what's really great is they give you large impact they give you the you know the most out of your gold you're getting 14 karat gold I want to stress this this is not plated a lot of the time even jewelry of when it is sterling silver and plated in gold it will cost the same amount you're getting solid 14 karat gold from Italy the design is is done in Italy the quality down to the quality controls everything the whole process is done in a country that is known for their standard of gold and you're also getting these done at a factory that is world renowned and the best in this style of earrings this doesn't get any better than this you know what I love about this is the detail on it and we'll take a look at this so everybody has their own recipe of gold every well exactly so here we see the gold being melted this all done in the blue our Factory here we see those sheets of metal that are being flattened out you know this is a really specialty machine and this really takes a high-end art isn't to do it here you see that tubing coming out and here we see that beautiful finishing that sat in that twist tube coming in then we have the wire that it's pulled around that gold is looped around to make those hoops depending on the size then we see we have those all cut they are then this is very important and I keep on forgetting to mention so we bake them at a certain temperature to make sure that they harden now this is really important because gold in general will get harder with time so if you were to get gold just straight off it's going to be soft it could tend to bent so yeah we have a specialty process that we put the hoops through that bakes it at a special temperature first starting high and that goes lower and lower and lower that actually mimics the time process that it would take for the goal to get harder say if you had them for a hundred years so this is really important so you know when you go like this you're not gonna bend the gold that is the blur standard of you know approval that is the quality that we make sure that we bring you these so not only are you getting beautiful comfortable earrings you're getting 14 carat solid gold made in Italy you're getting pieces that are gonna last you a lifetime and that's the beauty that's why you go and invest in something like this I also want to point out some other little details on that and one is the contoured wire and the length of the contoured wire many times a manufacturer will go ahead and cut it off to the quick right there where it's going to click down we don't allow that so if you are someone who is worried about the length of the bar look how much extra you get you can see why they would cut it to the quick because then they would have to give you less gold but we don't allow that the other thing that the Italians do so beautifully is they execute where they put that contoured wire and snap bar so that you really have a continuous look of a hoop all the way around the hoop has to the wall of the hoop on this has to be a certain thickness to be able to create a design like this talk to me a little bit about what the design is Patricia so what we have here is we give you the option of getting both the attention and detail of the satin finish that's done by hand and the just the position of that high polish you know it's really beautifully giving you two finishes that all done by hand set into the grooves and then you're getting also that goal that high polish and from the inside coming out from that D tubing I love how you we're showing the class than how it goes down further what I want to point out too is I could hear that when you are putting that clasp down I could hear that from right over here and that is telling you something then not only are you getting beautiful longer post that you are getting more gold we don't cut out that little piece that actually in the long run does make a difference you're also getting really amazing quality control over here look at that is sticking there that is how you know this is look at that quality and I wish I killed even closer to my mic so you could actually hear it at home it is real attention to detail this is our standard of approval this is our you know grade a quality and that's why blue aural is one of the world's most renowned on places factories in the world that creates these earrings so let's remind you what you're going to have you're gonna have a choice of size the half carat huggy hoops very very popular and now I think particularly when you do it in the highly polished you're talking about an earring you could very easily wear maybe even and you know if you have more than one hole here's the one inch size to me particularly in this highly polished look somebody's graduating and going out into the world if you've never really truly had Italian gold earrings these are less than a dollar a day per month and then the inch and a half if you want those larger beautiful earrings go ahead and pick them up and get them on our best ez pay plan they're $40 a month that's two $20 bills and you choose your color do you like white gold do you want rose gold do you want the traditions of yellow gold you tell us J three five six four seven five well over 1000 of you have already purchased yours the one and a half inch polished yellow gold three dozen remain and then that sold out the rose and the polish one and a half inch also very very popular jig three five six four seven five all right and just a heads up coming up in just a little bit we're gonna have the or pause sterling silver half carat gemstone", "xqcv8UH0hZw": "our assortment at QVC and now for the first time you are seeing them on air for under $300 it is the first day presented at this price on easy pay for $50 and with nine months special financing I hope you'll consider getting them with three choices for you so we've got them in the peach aren't those pretty and then we have them in the champagne champagne in the center that's a gorgeous and that's all natural isn't it's amazing that this mollusk can produce a pearl that can go from that pink into the champagne okay and into this then you're going to show you a beautiful natural almost like a pink plum pink plum mm-hmm and I think that's just because it is natural you'll have variations yeah it's you know it's the this is what one of the more popular natural colors that comes out we were not able to make a lot of a lot of pairs I know we're doing tooling down on inventory so it's nice that it's here on clearance but I could promise you it's not on clearance because it didn't do well it's on clearance because we just can't get them so we're waiting for 2019 and to see what the harvest brings in the meantime these are 12 millimeter so every pearl is gonna be a minimum of 12 millimeter okay you'll probably see the one on the right slightly bigger that one's probably pushing upwards of almost 13 millimeter is probably 12 3/4 listen we're all between those sides give you an update on each one of these choices so we'll start here this is that beautiful peach how many left in the peach just a dozen and a half left in the peach and the reason I took an office to show you the back and will will go there because it's an important part when you see a pearl of this size to know that it's going to face on the air perfectly because of that happy back all done in 14 karat gold and maybe you can touch more on that will elaborate necessary look at that let you show you know because I don't want you to miss if you need especially if you've got a strand already and you're buying earrings to go back to it so here in the center this is the champagne choice we only have three dozen left in the champagne and then in the pink plum four dozen left in this one and remember we cannot get these back on special financing better than six months on easy pay so let us know if you'd like to shop with your cute card what have you done here and why well a couple things that everybody needs to know first of all again when we talk about quality this is as good as it gets there these are our double rounds we showed you some before we use double a button when they're Double A rounds they are super bright really really great luster they've got great surface cleanliness this one has it all we can't find better pearls than this the colors are totally totally natural we broke them down into three categories but even amongst them they're all one of the kind pairs every one that we're gonna deliver it sounds like we've got less than 100 pairs left all together and all of those hundred pairs are going to have almost their own individual fingerprint and then you know the next important thing is this song is these are all above 12 millimeter when you put something that large on your ear okay you can literally see this from across the room if you bought one of our mink necklaces any color is going to go with the necklace you don't have to worry about it it's gonna look it's gonna look great you know you could just you know thank you can take mine on yeah that's okay well kind of give everybody look it doesn't matter whether you're going it's gonna all of a sudden kind of here it's picking up the champagnes if I bring it over to this side you know kind of a kind of pop with the plums and if I bring it over to the other side okay it jumps out with the peaches so it doesn't matter which way you go and if you don't have a strand like this and you've only worn white pearls it's phenomenal to step out in a single pair of colored pearls you look gorgeous and the happy back is the kind of the piece that wraps the whole story up most women cannot wear a pearl this large without the Pearl drooping but look how great that looks on Mary I mean you know it's and I promise you if I took a normal stud out of an inventory of almost any jeweler in America that would fall over like like I put a bowling ball on her ear but the happy back literally gives it the support you want in the back it's extremely large and elliptical it follows your ear your earlobe it is a patented earring and it does what it promises which is to make your pearl just stand up there at attention like you put it on there with Krazy Glue and I love and I love that look at how great it looks on Katya you're so cute these are their exceptional and this is truly a and I don't use this phrase lightly when I say it's once-in-a-lifetime Joel it's so such a precious opportunity to even be able to shop for me stud earrings that we only have one pair in our entire assortment at QVC we have more than 16,000 pieces of jewelry in our store so the fact that we only have say we have one pair of Ming studs that's special that they it's Honora quality you're going to be incredibly proud to wear them and no matter what you choose they will go back to the necklaces because it's a mixture of these chains and so all-natural no matter which of the three you like this is what we call the peach just a dozen left in the peach this is the champagne choice 30 left in the champagne and then this is the pink plum with 40 pairs left they're on easy pay for $50 but with nine months special financing you get them in a matter of days but then you've got nine months to pay for them with no interest if you pay them off in full in that period of time J three five five zero six nine I'm not taking them off I hope that's okay maybe I should because we have the dangle earrings coming up and those are fun well all I could promise you is when you come to something like this you are going to own the best of the best and we talked about the average of an aura using 3% and something like this you know this is what I said it varies okay I couldn't tell you the exact percentage but it's probably far less than a quarter of a percent of the pearls come out in equality this beautiful and that round", "3uTmPi9mCr4": "today we're putting a post on the Pearl Earring 14 karat yellow gold i'm using a hundred july weld we're just going to hold these pieces together in our hands and we're going to take attacking shot okay stack together we're going to roll it to make sure that it's right where we want it looks nice and straight we're just going to adjust our settings now make it just a little stronger go a little deeper okay our core our world is finished changing my settings and at the same time I'm grabbing my point 0 10 filler wire this is 14 karat yellow gold I'm just going to add a little bit okay that's enough will wiggle the rest off just going to change up my settings one last time because we're going to smooth it out okay settings are ready and there we have it now if we want to thicken up the base we can do that too without doing any damage to the pearl we'll just add a little more material right down here this is going to rest assure that this post will not come off basically comes like that because we're putting a actually a thicker post and was previously there all right that's enough material change up our settings again and well let's just smooth that small increments should do the trick and there we have it no damage to the Pearl nice strong world", "N-6Qi_eibMU": "these are seven millimeter pearl studs they're great with any hoop or on their own", "dY61U5QaFyQ": "[Music] so [Music] you", "_vksrfWBUeo": "what's going on everyone in Springwood tukoji fine jewelry your personal jeweler in this video we're going to compare the differences between 14 and 18 karat gold let's get started don't forget to follow me on instagram at code you find jewelry visit my website WWE Smackdown smash now let's talk facts first because that's more important is 14 karat gold is just above 58 percent pure gold meaning if you were to melt your 14-karat gold piece down you would have 58 little or 58 percent of pure gold in that piece the other percentage of that will be the mixed alloys that will vary depending on the jewelry the manufacturer the color of the gold all those things buried so the important part is that pure gold percentage now with 18 karat gold you have 75% pure gold that's a solid sea and it's a lot more gold in there so with that comes the more because the word I have to use to describe this color is from Southern California so excuse me but the word I have to use is organic it has a more organic look to it because of the color of the more pure gold in that piece so when you look at 18k gold we go side by side now both of these pieces right here are eight millimeter by me Cuban link bracelet yet I do carry a few 18 karat gold pieces the my own Cuban links the Franco's I don't have ropes yet but soon I will so if you look at them you notice that the 18 karat gold has more of a darker gold color more of an organic color than the 14 karat gold usually 14 karat gold a little bit lighter because the other alloys kind of lighten that up the more gold the more rich in gold color that skin it that's going to really look for you so that is the big difference when looking at 14 verse 18 karat gold there's no way of getting around the color differences there because it is what it is the gold is made how it is unless you have a super light karat gold piece and you need to get your gold check unfortunately because it should have that same overall look to it now when we're talking about the wear of gold jewelry pure gold jewelry very easy to bend and to work with you can stretch gold for miles and miles if you really wanted to that's just how gold is as an alloy metal so when you add the alloys in it to harden up and also to bring the price per gram down let's be honest but with 18 karat gold it's still relatively soft you have to be careful with it it's for certain people people love the look of it and want that rich gold color and understand and accept the responsibility that comes with wearing a piece of 18 karat gold a lot of females wear 18 karat gold because they're not as rugged as US men are and for me personally I do like 18 karat gold if I'm going out to a nice dinner for two three hours that's it I'm going to go with some 18 karat gold but everyday wear I just don't trust myself that's why I go with 14 karat gold even my 10 millimeter Miami Cuban link it's starting to get a little roughed up because I'm just I'm kind of clumsy I am in the business I know better but you can't teach this old dog new tricks when it comes to just being and clumsy and kind of you know get myself into trouble sometimes with my jewelry but that's why I stick with 14 karat so you need to realize and understand that with 18 karat it's going to be a little more soft it's going to have the ability to dent and and Bend and kind of get into trouble a little more easier than a 10 karat or 14 karat piece of jewelry we'll all in all of us I think it's preference as to what you like look around go to shops see what she check out the 18 check out the 14 even check out the 10 and just see kind of what you're comfortable with if you're just starting to get into jewelry and wearing pieces all the time I would start with a 14 karat gold and graduate up to 18 just because you could learn how to wear and how to be careful and how to take care of your jewelry so but you know if you have a big budget jump right in the deep end goes 18 karat gold I do have the Miami Cuban Linx and the Franco chains and 18 karat others that my 18-karat is pretty limited I'm always working on getting more stuff in so you know maybe a year to now have all the ropes and all those types of things but either way great choice I think that 14-carat Miami and the 18-carat Miami are just as beautiful as one another that's it for today's video and we will see you in our next jewelry video", "4AXw9dGTge8": "in that so she would she would

patricia said when you see something that has movement like these butterflies literally look like they're about to take flight that is the the expertise of the craftsmanship of the master artisans that we use to create these designs so the wings are textured so magnificently the the wings look like they're fluttering and then the body is done so beautifully in that white gold diamond cutting to give some extra emphasis and sparkle to the body it's diana they look so pretty on you look at how much light and radiance they bring to your face it's just the perfect i mean it's the perfect touch it's the perfect little flutter at the ear and i think what's nice is um this is sort of ageless too i i'm looking at these and i'm thinking about a friend who has um a daughter who had her ears

person named John he asked for a diamond giveaway we're gonna do a little something different stay tuned alright so in response to what Sean said mining is dead I don't believe mining is that I believe that the prices are down and it's not as effective as it was before the mining is still alive and mining is still active now I want to switch gears a little bit from cryptocurrency mining to diamond mining gemstone mining and that whole different field about different genre now I told you before about the giveaway with the ant miner s9 it's still on we've only had a few people do it so far so guess what those few people weren't a huge running small pool right now so get a huge chance to win but let's switch it up a little bit so something I want to do is another giveaway but with this giveaway we're gonna do a pair of natural v vs ruby real gold earrings okay these are earrings that I'm not the earrings but these are the rubies that I mined myself I pulled them out of the

just started so I always been kind of looking at YouTube and thinking should I join a lot of friends and family told me Ryan get on YouTube do it your Energy's fire yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah great thank you I appreciate all that I guess the problem was I joined at the wrong time because when I joined the whole algorithm changed and it's extremely hard to get the followers and to get the likes and to get the subscribers you know that everybody wants to do so they can share knowledge now other people do it from on a station you know they want to get that money and they want to put it in their account other people to do it to share knowledge other people do it to be famous listen I want to do it to give you guys the truth and the share knowledge all right so once again the same exact

personal jeweler in this video we're doing the most quickest basic way to clean your gold jeweler your jewelry this is very easy to do at home in case your chains your pieces get dull and you need a quick freshen up now this is a three part series this one is the easiest to do and a lot of you guys can try it most you guys probably already do this yourselves the next one we'll take it up and uh not and then the following will be more on a professional level too so you guys can really see how these pieces get cleaned and looking restored like brand new you buy your chains you buy your jewelry it's sparkly it's shining that's how it should be everything needs to be cleaned up if you think about it your dog needs washed your car needs to be cleaned I hope you guys are cleaning yourselves on a regular basis you guys get the point you buy something and eventually you wear it a lot it needs to be clean so we have to address that show you guys how it's done or at least how I do it and how I recommend it so what that means it let's get started when you spend all this money on jewelry you want to wear it that's what you're spending it for if you're just buying gold to invest it then put it in your safe buy pants buy bars it's a better Buy but when we're talking chains when we're talking the Rings you've got to keep it clean because you'd be shocked and I will show you guys what how it this gold collects dirt over time and how it just kind of keeps it in depends on the link depends on the piece some are easier to clean than others but the two pieces we're gonna use our bulk bracelets a two and a half millimeter Franco I will show you guys a side by side of a brand new one verse one that's been worn every single day for four months and then also a three-and-a-half millimeter rope bracelets side by side of a brand new rope laces you guys can see because when you get it it's nice it's shiny it's great you put it on sometimes you don't really notice how dirty it's getting until you see a brand new one so you've definitely got to keep up and keep these pieces clean freshen up this jewelry we're gonna use a method that is very easy and straightforward takes you no time at all that's why I recommend it to you guys and you'll see it does a great job we're gonna need a bowl of water I put in the microwave for 30 seconds be careful that water is hot when you take it out and then you squeeze a couple drops of Dawn dish so if you just need a mild detergent it's not gonna affect diamonds gold anything like that and you let those chains anything you're cleaning just sit in there for a little bit this is more of it's not a chore it's a spa day for your jewelry it works hard to make you look good to make you feel good easily these chains make me from a four to a 4.3 so you've got to put in the time of work to keep them shining because they work for you at the end of the day now after you let it sit you take them out and careful that water is hot and you just scrub them now the thing is you don't want an old toothbrush that's like really stiff and hard you're gonna scratch that gold you won't scratch diamonds but you'll scratch that gold because gold is soft so you've got to make sure that sponge is soft as well as if you're using a sponge I like sponge or toothbrush the toothbrush is better because it kind of gets into those crevices and really doesn't just like if you're brushing your teeth so but make sure that bristle is pretty soft when you're scrubbing and just take your time and work it now you don't have to like put your back into this scrubbing process if you scrub it like 10 times harder it's not really gonna make a difference so just take your time with it and not try to rush it and put a lot of pressure into scrubbing it and just work with it and go up and down that chain try to get inside those links and get that dirt out because that dirt like how we found the gold inside rocks inside crevices that's where that dirts gonna go it's gonna go to where the crevices are and just trap and hide in there which is the bad thing so you gotta do your best the best you can with this method to work all that dirt out but after a nice scrub-a-dub-dub you put it back in the tub all that's left to do really is just rinse it off with water just to get the soap up and then towel dry this process you really don't even need when I get out of the shower I don't even dry my chains it's gold it's good to go that's why I spend money for gold just so I could have at that convenience this is really just for the video and of course like after you clean something you want to just dry it really nice it's like the the cherry on top of that you did a good job it's so you sleep better at night okay and that's pretty much it guys it's a very simple process of I wasn't filming this it would take me like two minutes so if you're going out to dinner you just need a freshen up your change or jewelry it takes such a little time and really we're doing this method for is that surface area the top part that the oils and lotions it really does out diamonds doles out gold and you'll see the shine come back now as far as in between the links like a rope train that's gonna require the next step another video for me to show you guys in case you want to invest in some cleaning equipment to get a better clean this has its limitations of course it's not going to make it completely brand new but from time to time you could just use this because it does not take any time at all to do it and you just kind of get that luster back whether you're talking diamonds or gold so it works pretty well in my opinion let me know if you try it or if you've tried it what you think of it and if your jewelry goes back to looking nice and clean thank you guys for watching let me know if you have any questions that's it for today's video and we will see you on our next jewelry video", "KPntPMP6-sU": "back inside out top to bottom left to right the amount of design and a hoop like this it's really quite remarkable but we have it available here as you're looking at it aren't those gorgeous here in 14 karat yellow gold but that's not your only choice we also have this earring in 14 karat white gold those are so pretty I love this earring the white code looks platinum enough wrists and white and it's all of that channel style design and then the twist we'll talk about it one more choice here it is in the rose gold these are new sell priced at $104 40 cents for easy pay though 26:10 get some home and your choice of either the Rose the white or the yellow you chose to wear the ease I'm wondering why I did I just love for me I don't tend to go for those huge bold leap hoops which I know look great on people but I still want presence in my hoops I might go a little more gentle than you know the big two inch I still want presents to me these hoops are so elevated I love the unique design like you said there's a lot going on with these that make the interest so special and just an elevated hoop to what you may already have so when we look at these you spoke to that channel setting these are oval so they're they're a little elevated hoop they're not that round style they're gonna sit really beautiful on the ear as Mary's turning it around you're seeing there's almost this twisted wave design when you see the profile of it so every angle when you're looking at that hoop is beautiful when we go back to the front you're seeing a little bit on the rows there you have these almost striated lines so the front angle has this juxtaposition between these beautiful lines and then you even get that subtle twist design peeking through on that on the face forward look so like I said every angle is super interesting super beautiful super flattering near the face and to me very different than that hoop you may already own but still it works so well with any other gold piece absolutely wearing the eternal gold shimmer rope chain absolutely great I don't it doesn't have to match to go gold plays well with any thing I mix your metals if you tend to be classic gold and you're looking at the rose to it with this piece because they'll all you can mix your metals you can lay with your golds and this is a beautiful way to do it it's it's unlike any hoop you've probably ever seen before almost an inch the 7/8 of an inch in the drop which means that you can wear it almost anywhere any day anytime it is up to you so ball cap and a t-shirt or the black sheath dress that that you sort of look in your jewelry box and think oh heavens you know I'm going to this fundraiser tonight what am I going to wear you'll reach for these beautiful 14-karat gold hoop earrings because they do they Sutekh ster makes them feel special at that sale price of $104 40 cents but then on easy pay too so 26 dollars and 10 cents to get these beautiful earrings home the yellow gold has been our most popular of the three and so not the only though that we have available for you so here in the yellow gold also available in the center that is beautiful that white hot white gold and then on the end here rose gold so 14 karat gold across the board it's Klondike Gold Rush our encore show here this morning on QVC really great to bring you values like this earring but giving in mind with the sale prices and those easy pay offers will go away coat up real soon here at the top of the hour well here comes my gift from the crew you guys are so generous to get this for me really sweet that's really happening but that'd be great if I went back to the dressing room when this show was over there was a beautiful I'll take blue topaz bracelet waiting for me listen this is a real collector's piece freedom inspired could be a fashion piece it feels like jewelry from the fifth century I think but these coins were minted in the United States it's item number J five zero five twenty seven sale price and depending on the choice that you're making here we have six and three-quarter seven and a quarter and eight inches on easy pay starting at three hundred nine dollars and fifty cents substantial savings with this piece and I'll let you know early that eighteen months special financing is available here only about 100 of this bracelet to go around for all of these United States which brings us to the coins themselves the gemstones are gorgeous so we have your choice here of either the blue topaz so pretty and you see all of your links there too and then also available here in the garnet available in all sizes but I'm wondering if you wouldn't mind Stacy to talk to us about these coins and love because as gorgeous as those gemstone stations are if you're purchasing a Liberty coin bracelet that's where you want to begin I think yeah cuz it's just so classic and regal and you're buying it because the point is so beautiful what you're seeing there is Lady Liberty and I just love how you see the detail so beautifully she has 50 stars that represent our 50 states there's beautiful like scalloped design around the texture around the coin when we turn it over if you can do that shot for me Mary you're going to see a family of eagles and that just represents family and tradition and unity so like you said", "zJlPh27cMPs": "looking for the gift that

alike wonder what's in there besides that 58 and a half percent gold it's in 14 karat so before we actually put some together for you today I wanted to show you what all goes into it first almost all the gold alloys are primarily copper very pure copper oxygen free high grade and then we make some grain so we can measure it accurately the next most common ingredient is silver always in 14 karat yellow alloy there's some silver and then to help that nice yellow color there's some zinc zinc is interesting because when you mix it with copper you actually make a yellow metal called brass that we see around all the time but we need the silver to make a good gold alloy when we mix those together in a lot of quantity with a lot of heat and in a great big crucible like this at the end we'll pour 600 ounces of alloy out when that's done and it's dried the alloy looks a lot like this and this is exactly the alloy that gets mixed with the 24 karat gold and we're going to see that happen in just a few minutes", "Qin7hIJ-YKY": "[Music] [Music] [Music] all over [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

karat gold hoops and glanced over at Mary to see what earring she was wearing and she did the smart thing she was wearing diamonds mmm like let's just go ahead and get a look at that these are the half carat total weight diamond stud earrings by if any others so pretty on you well she's so pretty behemoth oh you are lovely when you see them up close and you see the cluster design of these diamonds you will understand now why that half carat really does radiate even more to the eye than a half carat affinity is our own signature brand of diamonds here at QVC if you've not heard of it before it doesn't mean that it is like diamonds these are genuine eye clean diamonds and what really blows my mind Mary these are customer top-rated diamond earrings top-rated like I know if you're making the investment on diamond earrings you're opening up that box and going alright QVC show me what you got right cuz I gave you that much money I want to see something that's gonna take my breath away it took your breath away and what I saw and your reviews over and over and over again was the word sparkle Sparkle Sparkle I can't believe the sparkle two color choices in the gold bed in which the diamonds lie hmm but isn't it funny why you're looking at them right now look like almost exact same earring because there's so much diamonds I'm sorry they kind of cover up the gold a little bit I'll pour us through your choice of white or yellow gold you know just go with your typical preference you love the white it's likely because it creates a much more unbroken clean look in the diamonds and then the yellow gold lovers because you love yellow gold right and that's what you typically wear not only did we take a hundred and fifty dollars off markdown on diamonds we then divided that into six easy payments so these diamond stud earrings can be yours for fifty eight dollars and 17 cents they will not be reordered they cannot be reordered and maintain this kind of a value Wow I just I know I looking at the light bounce off of those diamonds I mean there's just nothing like it and this is your everyday earring I mean I wear the same pair of earrings every single day because they have a great story and I love them dearly these could be your story you can pick these up taking advantage of those six easy payments and think of it you can wear them forever you can absolutely wear them forever if you have a fancy occasion great but if you don't wear them every day they're just subtle enough so that they're not so in-your-face but they are dressy enough because hi they're diamonds you can wear them to any fancy occasion when we come back I do want to kind of get a little bit tighter and show you that close-up of what's happening with the diamonds you see that right there it is that cluster design the halo design or a bouquet whatever you want to call it in these individual diamonds when we take diamonds down to these smaller carat weights individually and they still do this do you see that sunburst of light well that's because you're starting out with such great diamonds to begin with when you cluster them together hahaha that's on fire light bulbs what do they do right they absolutely radiate and regardless of if you're choosing the white or yellow gold those gold prongs of course hold the diamond securely but add to the radiance of these that's why I would argue stud earrings like this in many ways their properties are better than a solitaire because in a solitaire really the only way to get that kind of a breathtaking Sparkle is to have a flawless diamond and they're not cheap well here you still have such great quality and diamonds only because they're individually faceted and then cluster together the light just does that mmm which is why they look so great on Mary and Dianna and you and they come home for $58 and 17 cents that's just the icing on the cake as far as I'm concerned I mean you've got me I'm in I wanted to have everybody see the size just because I think that always is such a nice perspective sure especially when we talk about these carat weights like what does that mean you saw them on Mary and Diana but we're at about a quarter of an inch from top to bottom and I just love it every time the light just is off it like that and then you know what it's worth doing - I know about to wrap this up I was gonna yeah good you've got honey great just so you can see how much gold is in there as well and then that post in clutch that's all gold - now I need to give you an update on how many we have if you want the yellow gold one dozen remaining and how many fewer than a dozen in the white and great thank you for showing that because remember we got all those branches of gold 14-carat gold holding up those diamonds as well so in every way nothing's been scaled back well that's a lie the price has been scaled back yay great point by a hundred and fifty dollars get them home as beautiful as they look here on the screen under these lights you've got to get it in sunlight incandescent light your own night and if they don't make you think what all of those top rated customers think sparkle Sparkle Sparkle oh my gosh send them back right but you got to try it first to know J 3 2 4 5 8 7 so excited to see this Jim", "fwSzW5cvGqk": "[Music] 15 foreign very bye it's not a game",

diamond is all about so these are a floral motif as you can see here and you have a choice between a 1 carat total weight or a half carat total weight these are on clearance so let me just clarify for you what we're talking here for the half carat total weights you've got a quarter carat per ear these are a 599 dollar earring where we're taking a hundred and fifty dollars off the price on clearance they're for 49 or five payments of $89.99 which i think is an unbelievable value again in that case it's about a $300 price drop plus you're getting easy pay as you can see it gives you the illusion of a big solitaire but what you have are all of these stones that are all set nicely together that create a little bit of that illusion of a bigger look yeah I'm glad you brought that up because these are actually although they look very traditional they're really modern and a little bit edgy see that Center diamond is pressure set it's being held in place by the diamonds around it so it floats there in the middle and the reason that's important is there's not as much metal around it to impede the light yes so the brilliance on these is they're really off the charts these are just the perfect perfect gift all brilliant cut 57 facets in each of the diamonds again known for their incredible fire and their incredible sparkle and it does give you the look of one big solitaire I like to call it the icy floral collection yeah they're looking a little Edelweiss or little you know I see flowers popping through the snow the colors are just off the charts if you want to light you want a color show these diamonds are bright bright bright look at those all done in 14 karat gold this is the one carat total weight so half carat per earring not a lot of stones on these I mean we didn't make luster 50 stones to put these together I mean I think you can see you really only have I think 7 stones per ear that create this look and the table it's got a nice proportion to the depth of the diamonds you know I looped these not long ago and I was really impressed with the cutting and to me it's one of the things that gets overlooked a lot in our discussions is cutting cutting is really important yeah you can have the nicest material and if it's not cut to the proper proportions in diamonds it loses light or leaks light that's when you start to see bowties or dark spots within diamond right so that's why we're willing to pay more for great cutting these are again cut by one of our favorite manufacturers and the light show goes on for days you're gonna love it I think I need to try them on sure it's a hard decision honestly because both sizes are really powerful yes the one carat it does not overpower your look yes but the smaller version gives you so much sparkle that you think well maybe I don't need the bigger ones in this case I don't know it's really up to you every diamond is tested before it's set again we talk about our affiliation with the Gemological Institute of America I am a diamond graduate they're learning about diamonds is a constant you know growing process it wasn't easy it's taken me a lot of years but I've learned so much about it and we're changing every day and not only here in affinity but as a community the diamond dealers the diamond brokers the miners everybody involved we're really upping our game and I think you're gonna see things like this happening more frequently here at QVC our buying team is really on top of it cut pretty just simple right always appropriate yes never never wrong you know if you're trying to figure out what do I put with it you'll never be out of place if you have on a beautiful diamond stud never overdone never underdone and here's the thing if you were to buy this as a solitaire 1/2 carat solitaire 1 carat solitaire total weight you know you're spending a lot more than 800 and $49 for sure you're spending a lot more than on the smaller size than four hundred and $49 but look at the look that you get I mean it's just it's pretty it's classic which I love I'm a classic girl I think you all know that if you shop with me here over the years I'm I am never claimed to be a trendsetter and that is fine with me yeah I just like to look appropriate I like to dress my age I like to look neat I like to be pulled together maybe I play with color a little bit I'll always throw on a cool shoe and but for my jewelry especially my investment jewelry pieces let's keep it classic right stay classy San Diego so keep this classic keep it forever keep this so that every time you open up that jewelry box you don't think I don't know what I was thinking when I bought those but instead oh I'm so glad I splurged on those I'm so lucky I found those at a clearance price yeah I never thought I was gonna be able to own diamond earrings and here you can do it so you get one carat total weight or half carat total weight the yellow gold choices are completely gone I have a dozen left in the white and that's in each size the half carat and the full carat and because it's clearance when they're gone they're gone so get that while you can J three six one six oh seven oh here's another beautiful ring I love this Oh", "eQ-M1C6ntR8": "just restock these best-selling earrings very affordable white or yellow gold with the screw backs diamonds all the way around those are the mini ice cubes swipe up now two years to pay it off with no finance charges you cannot go wrong for this price comes with an appraisal and a warranty", "mPVHG-qt1O4": "looks like via's beautifully done these are 30 points for the pair so each stone is 15 points a lot of sparkle and shine beautifully done many studs swipe up now two years to pay it off no finance charges comes an appraisal no warranty", "hZmsI04UA2s": "that you guys are watching you know a good deal when you see it come on in because it is time for the one day only hoop earring o player you change what's good hello the textures so sexy that high pony yeah that is rocket girl I have a hoop earring obsession I know many of you at home do like you collect them I mean there's something so alluring about a hoop earring and all of us I think if we love a hoop earring we go and someday I'm gonna make the investment in like an all gold you know hoop earring some of us are saying the two inch some of you wanting to happen some one inch can you stand the price on this I'll walk you through your choice of yellow or white gold that's your first choice second choice do I want the twisted texture do I want the high polish that's your second choice then you go do I want the one inch they're all right here one inch one and a half inch there's no question for me straight to the two inch guys the two inch isn't even over $200 and it's going quickly in the high-polished okay so here's the breakdown for you six easy monthly payments I do not have a single hoop earring here in all 14 karat gold that exceeds a $34 easy pay this does not make sense in the world of gold alright but I'm not asking any questions I'm just running at the end of the day the price goes up we won't beat it for at least six months it's J eight zero five one four I know there's a lot to look at there's a lot of decisions to make we've got about six or seven minutes to talk about it but already 400 of you said I'm going to QVC comm and I'm not bothering with the explanation I'm getting in the door right now this is exciting this is so exciting I mean the choices that we've given you the last time I think and you know it when I saw Jen I was even a little surprised to see that she went with the boldest choice looking at them they may look super super large tiny we did I they were so to scale they were the perfect little resized hoop I just love them on her ear I did it right away he goes oh you're not wearing the two inch and I went no girl I'm wearing the two it's and she said oh I had it pictured so much bigger but don't be deceived especially in this refined gauge this isn't a big wide unit doesn't have sparkle it's just a high polished tubing which means lights as well yeah so keep that in mind and I also want to come in and show you both of your choices in both of your colors so here's the yellow in the high polish but I also want to show it to you in the texture if we brought all of them out and all the choices it might be a little too much for our our eyes to handle so here's the textured and we move down here are your white gold choices and we have those in the textured and in the high-polished too so that's just to kind of give your eye a sense of what it is that's available for you but does it get any more classic does it get any more useful right I would say no this is your it hoop I mean this is your it hoop of the day they're made in Italy you know they're gonna be made so beautifully they are just like you said there's a size for everyone you know I was telling Jenna I don't tend to go towards those big bold hoops this is either my day to try it right or stick to the classic stick to what looks great on you if you already have a polished a smooth line get that texture it is we're looking right now that is the high polished look at the shine look at the glow look at the width I mean you are getting a lot of gold there that is a beautiful substantial amount of gold and then you have that twist that classic with a twist with that beautiful texture you really see it from all angles it's open its Airy its fresh to me gold is a wonderful day to get those really incredible pieces and then today it's those foundation pieces those easy pieces that you just wear over and over again because they just work they pull every outfit together so here I'm trying to show you close-ups at that temperature because you're getting the twist it's significant to know that you're also getting diamond cutting into every curvature of that twist so this one what a different personality it has right from the high polish so maybe you know what I'm gonna say any one time does that and roll your eyes if you need to that's okay nineteen dollars and eighty three cents you get these and it's like well you because you got it but then you go not really dig the sparkling ones can I do another twenty dollars if the answer is yes take advantage of the one day only I often say that first easy pay buys you the first month right and you can change your mind so within 30 days you can decide this isn't for you or get this you can exchange the high polish for the textured the one inch for the one and a half the two inch for the one inch within 30 days and that's free we cover the shipping and handling for you both ways on that one and I mention that because at the end of the day price goes up you're comparable retail is over $300 for the 2 inch but there's not a single pair here that is more than $200 and I'll do just like Stacey did remind you it's all 14 karat gold Jen you know it's so interesting to me about these whether you get the high polish or the texture they offer such a different look right it's that same size hoop you're getting the same gold but it really depending on what look you're going for this is a very classic look this might be you know this is a hoop that you have been you know aspiring to today is the day to get it if you don't have it if you are a hoop collector and you have some of these classic hoops go for that twisted textured hoop it's a lot of look it's a wonderful day to do it with beautiful beautiful gold so I always get a little nervous my producer says Jenna I need you to disclaim something I go oh gosh what did I say we didn't realize this actually none of us did these have free shipping and handling the information on your screen was incorrect so we corrected that for you I have no problem just claiming when it's news like that what else you got John five dollars you just saved in just a couple of minutes I know that's great right so actually I feel even less concerned about encouraging or suggesting that you pick up more than one because you now have a built in buy more save more because every single one that you pick up you save five dollars with free shipping and handling every single time and I'm going to do this here I'm gonna take one out I'm gonna do the same size if you guys don't mind do that and show you kind of the different looks in the two inch which I mentioned because apparently that 2 inch is very popular and that hasn't me really really excited they just snap right in well yeah I mean the wine easy yeah it's just a snap bar closure so that's okay all right so they're lightweight and they're comfortable Jen's wearing the heaviest one the most amount of gold I want you to literally know it while I didn't buy this before the show because I didn't want to be greedy just leave me one in the two inch all right so here's the yellow and the high-polish 2 inch here is the white in the texture do they look like the same earring because to me they don't so here's one look and here's another look two inch in the yellow high polish two dozen remain you guys and you are wearing B oh yeah these are coming up coming up coming up um alright so let me walk you through your choices again it kills me that we only have I took a long minute that we only have two minutes remaining and I'll take you through your choices again snap bar closure on this tubing design all 14 karat gold your choice of color your choice of size so a lot of you I think will automatically know what color of gold you like right whether you're the yellow gold or the white gal so do you go with the high polish we have that in both the yellow and in the white there's the white do you go with the textured and twisted we have that in the white and in the yellow and then your size choices so we have for you the one-inch the one and a half inch and the two inch your easy pay breakdown is six easy payments of $19.30 if you are choosing the one-inch six easy payments of $28.30 old hair so valley you're going to enjoy themselves just 100 remaining in the white in the twisted two inch there are four dozen in the white and just a few more than that in the yellow j 8:05 one for Jen what's so exciting about these to me is that you really can't go wrong each one of those are the fabulous choice they really are and they're gonna be flattering they're going to fit comfortably they're gonna be lightly they're gonna just be fresh they're gonna I mean look at that to me that becomes a little more elegant a little more subdued you know it takes on a different look I am loving that whole look right now I love the texture I love that you see the texture you know that it's a really substantial beautiful twisted texture that's been applied that you really see from we angle and there's so much light bouncing off of it that this is why you tune in the klondike day right it's yin and yang it's I want to try something funky in front and fresh and different and then you come to us because you go I know I'm gonna get the great core pieces the chain necklaces the stud earrings the hoop earrings man did we deliver this time with a price that goes up at the end of the day on something that is brand-new today your first look on the hoop earrings but already we are losing sizes and colors thank you so much Daisy I'll be back Jen you come back [Music] okay so I made a wish and it's coming true we will get another look at our one day only from affinity the $500 discount on diamonds is coming back Jose

today because you know what you gals are smart shoppers and you know a really good deal when you see one look who's bad", "3uZmtLoJLRk": "shoot a quick little video here I was cleaning out my safety deposit box while I wasn't cleaning it out but I was going through it to see what all I had and I came across some jewelry that I'm just not using I mean I buy gold and silver if y'all look at my channel I'm heavy into gold and silver this is a nice bracelet it's uh it's a long one I think it's eight and a half inches I mean I can get all the measurements of anybody's interest and I think this one is 10 carat that's pretty it's pretty you get a good look diamond cut 10 karat yellow gold oh my I have a rope necklace here this is pretty pretty long it's not super thick but it's solid it's a nice 14 karat gold necklace I think it's 22 or 24 inches long so let's just remember this is 1 this is 2 here's another one this one is a little bit thicker 22 or 24 inches I can get the measurements and all for you if you need it 14 karat gold cross down three this is a little Figaro necklace 20 inches 22 maybe 14 karat gold this cross was 14 karat we have a thick older 14 karat gold bracelet here rope this is uh this one from back in the day they just made things so much better back then it's got some weight to it it's a big good size for a man have you can hear it it's just heavy needs cleaning I can clean it but that's not a problem this is a 10 karat think this is a mariner-link not sure I think this is 20 to 20 or 22 inches this one's 10 karat this is a 14 karat gold EG thing that stands for turn of gold 14 karat gold maybe seven and a half eight inches I can get the weight and everything this is a nice thick rope them you always give to get this is not a solid one like this here this not as heavy but you get a big look I mean this one used to be my my favorite one 14 karat gold so basically this is just stuff I pulled out that I want to sell if anybody's interested

everything have eBay store I was gonna list this on eBay if I don't have any body then wants to Bobbie it but just let me know if you need some gold this does good I will I'll break out another bag keep stacking", "jtGDH9a1yUY": "what is going on everybody this morning I got an email from one of my clients discussing a custom piece that they wanted to make and they basically had a bunch of questions regarding 10-carat verse 14 karat gold and in this video I get these questions a lot so in this video I want to address basically my opinion on whether going with 14 karat 10-karat and just talking about both of them all my information will be down below visit my website feel free to contact me if you have any questions and let's get talking about gold now 24 karat is pure gold for 14 karat gold it's 14 parts pure gold 10 parts mixed alloys they do that for price and just everyday wear abdullah we they add always to make that jewelry stronger too for everyday wear now that percentage comes down to 58.5% the four 10 karat it's opposite it's only ten parts pure gold 14 parts mixed alloys that percentage is 41.7% pure gold it's hard for me personally to label something gold when less than half of it is actually gold in itself the minimum in America is 10 karat so anything below 10 karat is not going to be labeled as gold in other countries it dips even lower than that so that's just something to know durability wise 10 karat is more durable as far as scratches if you look at your piece and you have some scratches there I mean that's just happens you know for the everyday where it happens gold is soft it's going to scratch now 10 karat that will not scratch is easy because obviously there's more alloys in it but there's a flip side to that is the the allergic reactions to those to that high amount of alloys mixed in there so some people do get skin irritation rashes to that to those alloys so that's something to look out for as well if you know you don't have that if you worn 10 karat you're fine that's okay but if you don't I would just play safe and go a 14-karat gold because it has more gold less chance to get a logic reaction to those alloys now I think 10 karat gold is more of a price point thing for people but to me it's there's not a huge difference for instance today gold is at $24.95 per gram for 14 karat gold for 10 karat gold it's at 17 dollars and 82 cents per gram the difference there is 7 dollars and 13 cents so it's not a huge difference I think people want when they you know say a 14 karat gold chain is $1000 they think a 10 karat gold is gonna be like 400 but it's not the case it's not that much per gram so I personally think yellow gold looks better I believe that yellow gold has better materials diamonds gemstones typically used in 14 karat gold and it's manufactured a little better than 10 karat gold would be when I look at 10 karat gold pieces they have the worst clarity of diamonds the worst you know grade of gemstones so I think price point it's worth it to save up and buy invest in the 14 karat gold save the extra 100 to $500 you know depending on how many grams you're going to buy and buy the 14-karat gold I do think that you know the durability issue between the 14 and 10 isn't as great as you know people would say I think you should always repolished or rear odium your pieces every one to two years and get them looking like new but with 10 karat gold there are issues with possibly tarnishing or getting dull or the wear on it over time because of the gold content is pretty low so 14k gold will hold up a little longer you could still have those issues with 14 karat gold but more times than not you won't so the durability is a big key for 10 karat gold other than that I don't see a whole lot other pros I could think of as to why I would recommend you going with 10 karat gold I think spending the extra couple hundred dollars to invest in the 14 karat gold it's going to be your best bet as far as value everything goes I recommend 14-karat gold I personally don't sell ten karat gold chains I can manufacture ten karat gold I don't though I've made I did one project where I did five ten karat gold pieces for somebody but ever since then you know I just do stick with 14 karat gold but yeah that's my recommendation is always go with the 14 karat gold 10 karat you might save a little but over time you know you're gonna have more problems with 10 karat gold down the road and for for gold Julie finds really the whole purpose of it is to wear it and possibly hand it down to kids loved ones and generation after generation that's what I feel gold and fine jewellery represents so go with the better quality always and that's pretty much it if you

[Music] i'm kind of a big deal my beautiful peoples you know who it is this year boys today first i want to give a shout out to james otto for these joints because these is crazy look at these talk about affordable super well constructed and the flex game is real these shits are sold out and every time they get on the website they're sold out so if you're interested in a fly ass pair of shades i'll put a link in the description below so y'all can get on the waiting list because the shit's long now thanks to daniel jewellery inc i was able to get my hands on of course the different gold tones that i was looking for to present to you guys to help you guys make your decision on what gold tone you're looking to go for like if you're on a tight budget but you still want an authentic non-gold plated joint but you want to go 10k but you're just worried that the gold tone is gonna be too off this video is for you if you are on 14 karat gold and i'm thinking of upgrading to 18 karat but just want to know how does that 18 carat luster looks this video is for you now if you own 18 carat gold and looking to upgrade to 22 carry because your pockets is thick because you were selling 700 bottles of hand sanitizer during the pandemic you piece of this video is also for you so let's get right into the  shall we i'm going to start with 22 carrots and work my way down to 10 carrots so i'm gonna start with almost pure gold miami cuban link and this is lusty check it let me put on my butler gloves first just so y'all can really see the tones in action look how rich this looks so this is what almost 92 pure gold looks like in a miami cuban link form  beautiful the shine is incredible and even so with the lusty beautiful orange golden glow this should still don't look cheddar cheesy it's pretty stunning man it's pretty incredible it's an incredible piece now this particular chain is let's see this is slightly over an eight millimeter and in length uh i'm going to say this is about a 22 inch the weight of this joint is approximately 131.5 grams so this is a beautiful beautiful piece and i know what everybody wants to see and i'll be more than happy to provide it to you neck profile big money talk this is not cheap you've seen how gold prices are although they've taken a little bit of a dip and hopefully they'll take a little bit more of a dip you get to see what a 22 carat miami cuban link made by hand looks like now let's move down to 18 carat now the 18 carat that i have is in a bracelet in a beautiful nine and a half millimeter eight inch 18 karat gold miami cuban link of course with the box lock and it is stamped let me show y'all that color cannot be denied 18 karat gold over i believe 74 percent pure gold up in this and then the wrecks are mixed with alloys etc etc i don't know but i know what y'all want to see wrist profile again very stunning piece beautiful bracelet this is a perfect daily wear size for most people who've been asking what a 9.5 millimeter looks like on wrist here you go it gives you a nice perspective this is an 8 inch so it's a little bit big for me i can fit a whole finger through it because i'm a seven and a half generally so but you guys get the idea beautiful gold luster looks crazy and when you put them next to each other you can see what 22 and 18 look like now let's move to 14. you all seen 14 carat a thousand times on my channel i personally own a 14 carat but this one is a beautiful 14 karat gold also like mine with the diamond button only this one is eight millimeter 24 inches long [Music] now with the 18 carat gold bracelet off i'll show you 14 and 18 side by side you can definitely see more of a luster in the 18 karat gold than the 14 karat gold these are pretty much freshly polished so you can get a nice visual appeal of the brightness and the shininess so it's not taken away the gold tone in 18 karat is definitely more present than 14 and you can just tell even from this distance when i twist it there is definitely a nice difference between the two i mean they're both beautiful beautiful pieces but you can see that the 18 carat gold definitely is bumped up now when you go from 14 to 22 i'm sure i don't have to tell you 14 22. it's a big difference very big difference like it's crazy this is just rich this is incredible it's a huge huge huge difference beautiful piece is obviously well constructed but tone wise this is different i'm gonna put the 14 carat gold eight millimeter on neck because y'all seen 14 karat gold a thousand times but there are some people in the market just looking for different sizes and just wants to know what a eight millimeter may want to look like on the neck so of course i'm here to give you the neck profile and lastly we got the 10 carat 24 inch this one is about a nine and a half millimeter miami cuban link now i'll show y'all 10 carat versus 22. yee it's not even in the same planet this is just blows this joint out of the water but when you put it with 14 14 10 it's not that far off it's actually quite close you could definitely see the 14 has obviously a little bit more gold tone but really once this polish starts to fade out and just go into evenly it's going to be hard to tell 10 to 14 to be honest with you now i'll show you 10 to 18. 18. definitely noticeable now let me go ahead and show y'all 10 14 18 22 10 14 18 22 and it wouldn't be a cabana video unless i hit you with the ultimate net profile oh i hope you found this video slightly informative at least you were able to see the perspective from 10k all the way up to 22k aka from the moderately affordable to the oh knobby i love y'all  from the heart let me know if this video was popping by giving it a huge thumbs up the ass and i'll see y'all next time you know what is the biggest in the might not want to give these back [Applause] [Music] smooches [Music] is", "DgCePC1zhdI": ">>HOST: >>HOST:  WELCOME >>HOST:  WELCOME INTO >>HOST:  WELCOME INTO

we had at the time and there were all these diamonique pieces which i i didn't know about i thought they were diamond i'm like why do they have all their diamonds sitting out they're not in cases like they really trust their customers here so it fooled me the first time we will shop for that coming up true story that was my first qvc purchase was from diamond my most recent qvc purchase is right here because i bought these earrings today stacy and jane i bought the cross in the white gold i'm really excited because i have been in the the on the hunt because i i have a necklace across necklace that i love i've been searching for awesome huggy lever back in particular cross earrings i decided to purchase these so i cannot wait to get them i thought the price was awesome 219 you are getting 296 cents 43.99 on easy pay and your choice of yellow gold or white gold and we have the same silhouettes or styles that sold out in the necklace so i can take you through those we have the yellow and white gold in the heart love that around the face in the star last call and i mean how neat is seeing these translated from the necklace into the earrings they just translate beautifully and then what i purchased the cross and i cannot wait to get it white is much more limited across the board so grab these up so here we are again the necklace sold out the i've never presented i want to call them huggies they're they're leverback earrings i've never gotten to present are these new i'm not i don't have that they're new but i don't know that i've ever had these on the air with you guys at home so i'm happy to be able to present so the star and heart are new i guess we just i didn't have like a presentation on the earring these are great these are wonderful we do we have had the cross they've still always sold out that's why we're so excited to also bring you the star and the heart and they're done for you in our most requested finding the lever back because they're so comfortable and they don't pull and now remember they're done in a turn of gold and eterna gold is nickel free it's hypoallergenic so you can feel so confident when you're putting that lever back right through your ear knowing that it is nickel free if you ever have a reaction to other metals it's because of the nickel so then it just drops down into the beautiful iconic design and to jane's point eterna gold has that higher refrain refined grain structure that's what allows these pieces to take on that beautiful high shine and that is why you can have a piece like this with a more petite charm but there's so much presence and so much credit for the gold because of all the luminosity and radiance that we love from the color of eterna gold i love that they're not flat either i mean so many times when you see little shapes like whether it be a cross or a star or heart which you have all three it'll be flat and and that's nice and i like that but it feels a little more special as i turn this around if you do wear your hair in a ponytail or a bun it's three-dimensional like that is so unusual or me and blair we have short hair so yeah like you know we like that look they're nice and full they're they have a puffed up look to it which is really nice an inflated feel of gold so that every angle is really pretty the same design front and back so really you get credit for every single angle there's lots of depth and fullness to these pieces and i can really see real quick i'm sorry to cut in here but my uh pretty sure sean's telling me i need to let people know if you want the cross a dozen left in the white gold six dozen in the yellow gold if you want the star there's only a dozen in the yellow and if you want the heart there's a hundred in the yellow gold and three dozen in the white and that's it so i a man this i think because all three right the heart the cross and the star can be so meaningful for several different reasons and the price the necklace sold out and now we're getting close to that in the earrings too oh i love them on blair and what about if there's any crosses left like we're getting into confirmation and first communion right it's the time it's the time of year so did star sell out oh oh okay the earrings are gone you're sold out i'm glad we got to see blair real quick though because they really do look cute in the cross we're down to yellow only four dozen remain and then in the hearts we have a hundred in the yellow and three dozen in the white yellow gold in this cross you have yellow and white but getting very limited in the heart look at how they dance and i love seeing them on blair too because and it's perfect because jane has short blaire has the shortest hair jane has short hair we have long hair they don't whatever your hair length is whatever your hair color is they don't disappear like they they they have a presence about them they do they bring lots of light and radiance to the face and we were talking and morgan has used this term this above the keyboard look that so many of us are really engaged in right now and what a perfect time to invest in an earring that's going to bring light and radiance right up close to the face that's what i think are those pieces we're going to be reaching for now every single day and i call these turtleneck earrings because if you love to wear turtlenecks or cowl necks and you have on just a french wire i cannot tell you how many earrings i have lost because what happens is the turtleneck kind of starts to get up where your earrings are and it work or like you have a scarf on and you pull it off with the lever back the reason why we don't do a lot of it is because it's expensive it's for gold like that's so secure and they're also really good with a facial covering because you still see them or your little earbuds so because they're not just a shepherd's hook yeah have that lever back you don't have to worry about it um falling out of your ear but you do have to worry about it falling out of our inventory look how cute they are funny but we have we still have the cross right sean in the yellow a dozen left so go grab that because that'll go if you want the heart six dozen in the yellow gold a dozen left in the white gold and then that will be sold out j three seven one zero two two we're to take a break stacy we'll see you in just a bit we'll be back jane and myself we're having a jewelry party we've decided", "P5WPzSMNEUM": "Vrai & Oro Presents: The Difference Between Solid Gold vs. Plated, Filled and Vermeil Hey there, it's Mandy, Vrai & Oro's Community Manager. Today we're going to be talking about all things gold. We'll be breaking\ndown the differences between solid, vermeil, filled and plated gold, so you can\nknow a little bit more about what goes into your jewelry. Last time we talked about gold, we went over the differences between 14 karat and 18 karat gold. As as a quick refresher, the karat number refers to the percentage of pure gold and other\nalloys that are mixed and melted together. Combining these makes your\njewelry stronger and easier to wear. Whether 14 karat or 18 karat, the final\nmaterial is called \"solid gold,\" a bit confusing, we know. Gold Plated When something is gold plated, it means that a base metal like brass has\nbeen quickly dipped in a gold bath. The gold content of these pieces is usually\nless than 1%. While they may have the same lustre and appearance as gold at\nfirst, this layer is quick to fade when washed, rinsed, or rub too hard\u2014leaving\nyou with discolored skin and dirty-looking jewelry. Depending on your body's sensitivity, you may see a green skin reaction once the gold plating wears off.\nMost fashion jewelry is gold plated making the cost as low as possible. Gold Vermeil A common type of gold plating is gold vermeil, which uses sterling silver as the base metal. Vermeil is more hypoallergenic and has a thicker layer of gold than normal gold plating, which is why you'll see it more frequently\noffered in stores that sell fine jewelry. However, with enough scuffs and scratches the plating can wear off. Gold Filled To increase it's longevity, some jewelry is gold filled instead of gold plated. Instead of being dipped in gold, these\npieces undergo a mechanical bonding process that melts solid gold onto the\nbase metal. By law, gold filled jewelry must contain 5% gold by weight to be\ncategorized as \"gold filled,\" which means the gold coating is generally much\nthicker than that of plated or vermeil jewelry. You'll see that gold-plated\npieces are still stamped with a karat number but this is only for the filled\ncoating which can still wear down over time. Solid Gold And then there is solid gold. Here\nat V&O, we only use solid gold in order to avoid any discoloration or\ntarnishing. We also like that it reduces the chances of any allergic reactions and can be worn every day while still retaining its beautiful gold color. We know that was a lot to digest so here's a quick recap. Solid Gold: Features a solid material of pure gold and alloys with no base metal, Avoids discoloration and tarnishing, Is most hypoallergenic, And best for\neveryday wear. Gold Plated: The brass base is quickly dipped in gold, It has less than 1% pure gold, Is most likely to irritate skin, And is quick to fade and rub off. Gold Vermeil: Features a sterling silver base metal, More hypoallergenic than brass, Has a slightly thicker layer of gold, But is still prone to scuffs and scratches. Gold-Filled: Uses a mechanical process to\nbind gold to the base metal, The gold coating is thicker than gold plating, The gold coating is stamped with a karat number, but it can still fade with everyday wear. And that's a wrap!

our affinity expert and so I'm wearing this earring and I'm going to switch out so that you can see a few sizes here in a second but I want you to just look at the impact that you're getting here that looks like four and a half carats of diamonds in my ear in one ear that's the look you're getting here but the reality is in the size that I have on right now you're only paying for one carat look of nine total but you're only paying for one we also have the half carat available in this stud and then a choice of shapes so I have the round on we have it in cushion in 14 karat yellow gold or 14 karat white gold this is my pick because it doesn't get much better than stud but the reason that so many women who want them but don't get them is because it costs a lot to get a beautiful stud home but because of the way the diamonds are set here you get the look you want at a far better price so the half carat size whether you're choosing the round or the cushion is now at a clearance price of 399 96 on easy pay for just $66.66 those are a hundred and forty nine dollars off the QVC price making them the equivalent of a today's special value I'm glad that that popped up on the screen right now because that's the balance of perfectly aligned exactly okay and then the one carat size seven ninety nine ninety six and then on easy pay for 13333 those are two hundred and ninety nine dollars off the QVC price and if you want more than six months you'd rather have nine we do have special financing available on these stud earrings if you're using your cue card so Jose as I slip into I'm gonna find the half carat size here would you please explain what's happening with the look like what are we getting exactly but then what are we getting the look of when we're talking about the half carat here that we're going to show you and I'm gonna have Mary show you one and one and same with kinesia so I think khadija is gonna be wearing the cushion and Mary is gonna be wearing the half because we want you to see the scale of them this is a half carat that we're looking at here but that Center cluster is one the look of 1.2 and a total of 4 so this would be like looking at two carats in each year this would be thousands of dollars for you to get at home we've worked with the very best the largest manufacturer of diamonds in the world to give you a composite setting where all of those diamonds are so closely set together that it looks as one but when I was speaking with her route he also wanted it route is the designer who has worked with let's say I'm gonna say it this way on 57th Street and Fifth Avenue there are three of the largest most renowned jewelry houses in the world he has designed for two of them so we're not getting designer like diamonds we're getting designer diamonds babies I was just showing you like you didn't have to come in close to see these earrings know that it makes it it's a two-carat presence on the ear in the half carat size so you just saw the round on me let's take a look at the half carat on kinesia did you do the half and the one as well awesome so you'll see here the way they look and maybe that'll help you decide if you're on the fence and you're wondering or maybe you already know you know that that other look would be more wearable for you or you want the most impressive statement possible correct then you'll go with the one carat size well I love that we're looking at we're looking at Khadijah and value hello some of the but you're looking at Canisius a guys can we go back to Kadena for one second I'm sorry we got all distracted by the gum mazing price look at all of the hair on Khadijah but that is where the half carat is so that is the fire that is the presence that you're getting on that diamond that's the half carat and then the other ear where the hair is swept away is the one carat that looks like four and a half carats on that one ear so this is your upgrade this is and you know what I do believe in recycling so you perhaps take that earring that you've been wearing and you give it to your daughter or your granddaughter and you do a little upgrade the the rel I'm not thinking about anybody but myself one for them one for you honest and hard I you know what I would do and this is this is crazy me with my the round half is the most popular right now yes and it always has been in the past I would crazytown me would get that round half pay that off right away get the one carat and put that on easy pay because you are completing your entire stud selection for your wardrobe forever this is the round in the half carat I know it seems huge no it's that's a half carat total but it does it looks like two carats in each ear in each ear that's what the look is but yet you're not spending thousands of dollars remember this size whether you want the white gold or the yellow gold whether you're choosing the round or the cushion the half carat size is on easy pay for $64.99 and then if we could look at the one carat choice and what did you say the sort of the earlobe impact is on that one on the one carat yes would be for also for the half and nine for the one carat weight okay so if you're getting the one karat earring it looks like a total of nine all right so it's four and a half carat per year and I can show you remember same choice is still available at a clearance price is so exciting that we still have all of these options for you at a clearance price because often that's not the case so if you want to be able to see the the larger size that one carat size I have it in this ear she's going to close up so she can do because I think scale is really a member so close up that she's uncomfortable so that's the one carat that looks like four and a half per ear and we're gonna switch you could look towards me and that's the half carat that looks like two carats per ear so you get a better sense of scale it's hard I know it's hard to see it on the boat for I'm gonna do EasyPay $64.99 or 131 66 that is crazytown in the round but remember we've got the same carat weight in cushion I'm wearing the white gold we have yellow gold available across the board as well it's just so many options a beautiful classic piece and so if you are investing in diamonds we have these exciting fashionable pieces playful pieces that we can bring to you through affinity and Jose but sometimes you just want a classic you want something that you know you can wear every day anywhere and not feel like you're restricted in the least like white diamond studs I can't think of any occasion where these would not be appropriate whether it be a party a job interview work I mean Church these are these are that piece that you go to all the time and they're so impressive you'll be proud to wear them and that's one of the reasons why I love affinity you know sometimes when you find diamonds on sale you're like I mean I I kind of like it but I don't love it I don't know that if my girlfriend's grabbed it that I would want them to look really close at those diamonds please you want everybody to see them you're gonna be so proud and you'll own them for many years I'm sure on six easy payments in the half carat size at 66 66 the one carat size 13333 but with nine months special financing it gets even better in white and yellow gold in the round or the cushion and those are your options in my pick of a show J three five five zero three seven is a good pick Thanks", "tyTcfQPOn_g": "looking for the gift that lasts forever this gorgeous piece of

I'm answering the question, \"What is the difference between\n14 karat and 18 karat gold?\". And here we're talking karat with a K, and karat\nwith a K is how many parts out of 24 karat. Pure gold is 24 karat gold, and\nwhile it sounds like it would be wonderful to have a pure gold piece of\njewelry, the fact is you could scratch it with\nyour fingernail. You could just take a ring and bend it. It's very soft and\nmalleable. And so we alloy it with other metals meaning we we melt it and mix it\nwith other metals to make it stronger. So when you hear karat that's how many\nparts out of 24 karats. So 18 karat is 18 parts gold out of 24 karats. The other\nsix is another metal or combination of metals. 14 karat is 14 parts out of 24. 14\nparts gold out of 24. And similarly 12 and 10 karat are the same. They're 12\nkarats out of 24 and 10 karats out of 24. So 10 karat gold is actually more other\nmetals than it is gold. It is 10 parts gold and 14 parts other metals. So that\nis karats. Always when you hear karats with a k, think \"out of 24\". Now sometimes\nyou'll see 18 karat gold marked 750, and that's because the Europeans do it\ndifferently. They'll say 750 parts gold out of a thousand, and that's how they\nmark it. You might see a piece that's marked both. It could be 18 karat and 750,\nor it may just say 18k, or it may just say 750. And similarly 14 karat gold will\nbe marked 585 sometimes because it is 585 parts out of a thousand. So there you\ngo. That is the difference between 14 karat and 18 karat gold. If you have a\njewelry question, just ask me in the comments below.\nUntil next time!", "EzpGM02fURE": "[Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter]", "0OjGJoB6U80": "now so what

luminosity that we love in our return of gold not to mention that it will come with a lifetime guarantee so eternal will repair or replace your piece for a lifetime because i know with earrings i'm

gorgeous texture as well there's the width by the way they're great quarter of an inch wide really really cool piece like a really cool piece of jewelry love that i love the texture but even the high polish the reason return of gold was created ted leach in a turtle ted lisa's dad wanted a special alloy for strength and durability and they changed the molecular structure of the gold and they did originally in a bangle because bengals scratch bengal's dent and they were like creators of gold and women complained and so they went back and said can we make the the alloy patented and strong it took them forever to do it and they did it and they used to you know did we used to bang the bracelets on and they didn't dent they didn't kink and if you're talking about a pair of earrings like this you take them off you drop them on the table you drop them on the dresser right over a period of time you want your earrings to last and that's why this is a wonderful story and a better price and we've got our premier line of gold and it has an opportunity to last a long long long time snap our closure on them so again one is a polished one is the diamond cut and one is the rib so diamond cut

how would you love to give someone 14 carat gold and gemstones at a really crazy good price that's for sure these to me are heirloom worthy they are that beautiful they're crafted out of Italy they are such beautiful detail work I'm also trying to be a model as I speak but what you're seeing is beautiful wires and wires of gold twisted to make that almost that but instead feel you're seeing right on top and that wire has all been diamond-cut so that's giving you that extra sparkle and that extra reflection of light and then I just love how it drops into that beautiful faceted pear-shaped gemstone genuine gemstones there is so much light reflection and then look at how it's bordered with that beautiful diamond-cut gold wire rows and rows just encompass it so beautifully it complements it's so gorgeous it's amazing and I'm gonna turn these slightly to the side because I want you to see the depth of this when you have a stone that is that deep look at that I'll hold it really I'm stop touching it and let it just calm itself look at the depth of that stone and it looks like five rows of that diamond-cut wire of 14-karat gold wrapped around and then if you even come up a little bit look at the depth of that beautiful it's almost like a little beehive up there right above it look at this you see that and you see as much of the stone from the back as you do from the front yes so if your hair is short or your hair is up you've got this exquisite look exquisite that's right it is so beautiful there is so much presence the gold with the gemstone marries so beautifully together and that pear drop gemstone is a beautiful sized gemstone it's elongated that pear shape is so flattering and it's just done so beautifully with that diamond cut gold that's what really elevates it giving it that beautiful light reflection all that sparkle jumps out of that that beautiful earring and it's really done at a very wearable comfortable size it gals that's one inch from top to bottom now by the way in the citrine four or three dozen remain in the citrine - doesn't remain in the amethyst look at that purple I mean that is so regal and roil and by the way don't forget that the color Pantone of the year next year in 2018 is called ultra violet it's like purples and blues together and and you know all the different shades of purples and blues so if you want to get

contemplating not even making this video I just wanted to give a different perspective on Cuban link chains now I'm not doing this video to try to claim like I'm better than anybody yeah so I got more money or I'm in more debt than anybody else it's just to give you an idea if buying the cheaper Cuban Linx that you find on all these Instagram ads for all these websites making chains if they even look like a possible real Miami Cuban link what I bought here was an eight millimeter 22 inch long triple electroplated 14 karat gold Miami Cuban link now I'm gonna compare this triple plated 14 karat gold never tarnish according to the website I'm not giving no free advertisement to this website because this quality [ __ ] I'm sure a ton of people buying chains from this place for a fake chain it don't even look good so I just want to give you an idea of what a shitty bootleg Miami Cuban looks like versus a real quality Miami Cuban link so this is the eight millimeter joint and usually a red flag to spot whenever you see anybody with a Cuban link chain if you see this type of box lock with these stones I can't even call them diamonds as call them stones these stones in here this same pattern usually it's an automatic red flag that shows bootleg I have seen many box Loxley clocks diamond locks and none of them really look like this first of all the box lock is of really poor quality and there's a lot of spacing in between these links I mean it's not a bad construction link but it's just a lot of spacing in there the welds in here are actually pretty decent and not horrible for a fake chain the lock is absolute [ __ ] like it's not even locking correctly Adam you're falling apart but let's see if it hang straight for a fake chain no kind of like once it hits this border just starts twisting over this way so you can't expect too much I believe I paid 60 bucks for this [ __ ] and the [ __ ] nerve of this [ __ ] being stamped 14 karat gold a laser 14 karat gun it is 14 karat triple plated gold whatever but this is a Slyke you look at the I don't know if you can see the entrance of X lock but it clicks into place but it also has this huge gap right about here then the figure-eight clasps barely click into [ __ ] place and they're completely misaligned or whatever where would you can afford right so visually from a distance and doesn't look bad other than the spacing between them it's not a really really tight link now let me put them side-by-side and see if you guys can tell any difference now we're not doing size comparison here because obviously mine is a little bit thicker but just get an idea of how the links look side-by-side compared to each other this is the real one this is the fake one like the gold tone on mine is definitely a lot richer obviously because it's really gold plating seems a yellow but looks it just looks faked compared to the gold one obviously the links online are just way tighter than this industry-leading higher one I guess they look semi kinda sorta comparable from a distance if you have like cataracts and why I a limp and maybe suffering from polio they might look super comparable but I mean it's a drastic difference to at least a daniel jewelry one the sad part is that i've seen some real often 10 14 karat gold cubans that kind of look like this do somebody who doesn't know any better and just doesn't give a [ __ ] does this give the visual appearance of real 14 karat gold for the price point the weight of it is non-existent this is like a paperweight it almost feels paper clip ish I just think it's a very poor quality if you're trying to get somebody to purchase a product to look like something authentic at least put a little bit more construction and thought process behind it all in

"xO7mfJR-2B4": "show because almost every item in my last show was a first look debut so we're going to keep a good thing going i'm actually super excited about these earrings because i unfortunately misplaced one of my love knot earrings i had obviously two of them and they were 14 karat gold one of my favorite pieces of jewelry and i lost one and i kept thinking surely on gold day we'll have a love knot earring right here she is all right so it's from italy so what do we have iconic design classic design durability genuine 14 karat gold these are the mini love not stud earrings look at your price i mean on gold day honestly that isn't always what i drive your eyes to because it's like all right let's talk about it first because we've got an investment in front of us no no we have one of the most affordable items on gold day in front of you right now 82 dollars and 40 cents my friends now's the time to start shopping because i don't think this is going to last 16.04 cents is your easy pay i feel like i'm presenting like dominique or something like at these price points but this is still 14 karat gold okay so great news three colors in the gold and on a gold event day often we are fortunate to have yellow gold and stop there really lucky when we have yellow gold and white gold when we have all three then know that you've got something that our buyers truly believe you're going to want multiples of all right so obviously there's your yellow gold in front of you it's already very popular not surprised white gold in the middle five dozen to go around in its first look that could be the price for silver earrings and here it is in white gold fewer than 200 what in total or in the rows oh in the tritone okay so here is your tritone which features the yellow the rose and the white so you get the best of every world in one i think there are maybe a handful of tri-color gold items in our entire assortment at qvc so it's j37137 patricia costra joins us again you're going to see her a lot in this show because obviously we have the today's special value but this features one of the most rich selections in italian jewelry than i've seen in recent years so patricia thank you so much for working with our italian designers to bring us these beautiful pieces but here's one that i mean it's a classic italians a lot of we're seeing innovative designs and trendy looks and diamond cutting and here we kind of go to something that frankly has been around for centuries it's the love knot yeah absolutely i think when you think about those classic pieces and you're able i was lucky enough to go to a little workshop in larezzo where i see the artist that make something that his father made that his grandfather made an artistry that has been passed down it's really special to see the the workmanship that the time that comes into something like this and then to be able to bring it across these two qvc at you know an unbelievable uh day like this it's really special and something that you can wear every day like we want those pieces that you're able to wear uh you know by himself running your errands you're around the house and like you said chad like this is the time really where you wear jewelry for yourself to love it and enjoy it exactly and i also want to call out a couple things hey dionna your makeup is amazing today i mean you always look great but like i saw you on the couch like dang girl okay gold day bringing it yeah b getting back to the actual product um i almost don't like i understand why it is but i almost don't like the fact that minnie is right there in the descriptor because i'm afraid you're going to think it's like invisible you know or that you won't even see it and hopefully seeing it on diana really drove that point home in fact gorgeous shot you're about to see of the lift that this love knot has the dimension it looks like three eternity bands rings that you would wear on your finger that constantly roll and revolve around each other so while technically when i get in there with my ruler and you're gonna see you know that it's just barely at a quarter of an inch that height and that amount of gold and the width of the bands gives it presence because we do multiple sizes and love knots but this one absolutely is one that i would argue is probably most wearable even in a second or third piercing two so keep that in mind and then um patricia we can't ignore the fact that i'm looking at a tritone i mean we never see this yeah no it's again something that we love to do when we get a chance to showcase it in its finest form i like in the tri-color the rolling over style this is really where that tri-color takes center stage you get that gorgeous richness of the butter yellow gold that beautiful not gray but that white white gold and then of course that perfect for every skin tone for every outfit that rose gold but i love jen how you said that that volume is there yeah you're not just getting a regular stud you're getting beautiful artistry and a lot of presents yeah and that's that's the key because the price tag is one thing but i mean 82 can get you like what are you wearing this is something that you definitely see now you probably noticed if you got the kenai i started with three choices i'm down to two the white is sold out tritone four dozen the last update i got was seven dozen and that was about 30 seconds ago so a lot of you loving this tritone we never see it fewer than 200 now in the yellow gold and that i could i mean come on patricia when you get down to it we could order 5 000 love not earrings and just kind of always have them living in our warehouse because they are never going to go out of style and then also let's think about what it even symbolizes there's a reason why it's called the love knot right true love is eternal love it has no break it is infinite and you know we're talking about that a lot today especially with our today's special value and what it signifies but um here's another update tritone sold out by my lonely little yellow gold there um but if i'm gonna be left with one i'm glad it's this one yeah but it looks so beautiful there on its own too doesn't it i mean this has kind of been my my job for the last hour and ten minutes is just removing items from the table because you all are loving our jewelry sale so much yes the prices are amazing but maybe it's time um here's just personally where i'm at i'm going through my jewelry and really i'm editing right you know what are the pieces that really make me smile what are the pieces that i look forward to wearing because yes we have this feeling like oh i got to fill the jewelry box but does it really matter if you're not wearing it and this is one of the pieces that i think edit after edit after edit it continues to make the cut think of it like a gold stud earring but with a lot more interest and certainly a super affordable price tag so last look there your 82 dollar price tag one of the most affordable items of the entire day j37 j371137 just 100 to go around we only have the yellow gold remaining all right still to come", "0D_9nYDTySM":

what's this I'm like thank God well dance you on the floor we'll get it wait no no I'm gonna get it for you so you know real live TV we picked it up thank you yes live TV yeah there you go see still perfect still perfect where's that there we go still perfect these earrings are starting in perfect tune yeah they are so this is the one and a quarter inch diamond cut oval this is a clearance price remember when I said we've got great clearance price opportunities first time on clearance thirty dollars off our price but check out the retail value of 265 fully for a one and a quarter inch earring what the first time we have it on five months of EZPay of $27 come on Ted okay we only have 200 of these to go around because we're all going really $27 what are the best games ever done what is what we call our number one pattern of diamond cutting and is diamond cut on the inside and the outside all the way around the top wires are perfect the end caps are perfect we really have tried to perfect hoop earrings and we've we started in selling hoop earrings in Japan before we sold them in the United States because it was a more demanding market we said if we can do it there will be able to do it and create a world market which we have done that's going to click close absolutely there's a little safety click when you put that closed you see there's a little gold rivet that holds it firmly in place and can't come out right so it's not going to wiggle free and fall out on you look at the loop it's diamond cut every single with every single actually I love these earrings and for some reason people haven't kind of noticed these but I think they're great I'm not quite sure how they haven't noticed them because when you say they're diamond-cut just for those of you who are just joining us these are a diamond cut that means that's done by hand so each person who's receiving these earrings if you're getting these earrings home somebody did that you know like the Becky Julia Tammy some in an individual person diamond cut all these all this texture and shine and glow on your earring and it's not just on the front side Ted it's not you know just on the back side it is on all sides of this elongated oval that by the way as we said is one and a quarter inch long and you're getting at home for that five months of ezpay of 2780 forgive me look at the sparkle this incredible yeah amazing amazing so look at that close-up isn't that fabulous yeah look how pretty that is yep and people these are going to frame your face and because they're slightly oval they're a little elongated make your face look a little thinner which Rachel's need to worry about but a lot of women kind of go for that look and these are just going to be your go-to earrings I think that they're fabulous people are going to notice your face framed with this incredible luminous gold you know and we're looking at them right now on Jenna and Jenna has long hair and look they have such presence with that one and a quarter inch that they're not lost you're seeing them as Ted just said they'll frame your face they will and that oval is the quintessential II kind of elongate encase a--'s I don't care what you know if you have a heart-shaped face an oval face a round face a square face that the oval of the earring seems to help I just need to give you an update these are going really quickly because good because you know you're seeing how pretty they are we have fewer than 150 to go around and the first time we have them on five months of EZPay of twenty seven dollars and eighty cents I can't even tell you enough of as we're going into graduation season new job I have a friend and his daughter actually just graduated from lilit Loyola Chicago and just got the job that she really really wanted so you know maybe you have a daughter or niece a grand niece who is starting their first job and what better gift than to give someone 14 karat gold and better still 14 karat eternal gold which means it's shinier it is longer it's more durable and it has that lifetime warranty absolutely and what a great wardrobe piece for somebody we're starting a new job really professional you look successful and you feel successful in it there's something about wearing real 14 karat gold that is a confidence builder and in women I think I mean since time immemorial has been the precious

lifetime because we make classic shapes and forms that won't go out of style beautiful earrings day 3 to 10 9", "mWhfBAC6YkY": "what's going on everyone in spring which coach fine jewelry short personal jeweler in this video I want to compare 14 karat white gold verse 18 karat gold do a nice side-by-side and show you guys the difference I get a lot of questions on white gold so I think visually you want to kind of see the difference if there is a difference and with that being said a lot of questions come in about white gold so I'm gonna do my best to put those questions to rest with that being said let's get started now everyone has a different reason as to why they might go 14 karat gold over 10 karat gold 18 karat over 14 karat you guys get the point going up in purity the most common that I hear about and we should all know this the higher the gold purity the more gold that is in that piece of jewelry which equals the richer the gold color that is really directly applies with yellow gold with rose and white it gets a little bit different because white gold has rhodium over it so is it really worth to spend and go 18 karat on a heavier chain with more gold if you're going to get the same look as the 14 karat version with white gold and I want to show you guys the side-by-side and explain that and if we take a look at the side-by-sides between the 5 millimeter diamond-cut franco's the 5 millimeter 14 is on the left and the 5 millimeter 18 is on the right both from the same manufacturer both with the same rhodium process I try to get the variables as close as possible to show this review in person you definitely see the difference it parallels really to the yellow gold version the lighter or less purity that a train is like if you look at a 10 karat chain compared to a 14 karat gold chain the 10 karat chain is lighter in yellow color because there's less gold gold is yellow I get people all the time this is kind of a different talk for another video like hey if I buy a white gold chain is it going to be yellow my answer is hopefully over time it does kind of thing into yellow that means your chain Israel if it doesn't you need to get it tested because gold is yellow we don't mind white gold out of the ground it's all yellow so the more gold it is and tuned if you really look closely at an 18 karat white gold chain you kind of see that yellow starting to pierce through of course the road is a top layer over and it's nice it looks good but if you're going for that kind of disco ball that flashy look the 18 karat white gold is not really gonna do it as much it doesn't have a stronger white gold color it has more of a dull gray color compared to the last period of the 14 karat gold because it has more white alloys in there to really shine so it really depends on what you're looking for when you're going yellow it's like yeah you do want to go 18 karat yellow because it's more of a flex you get kind of a deeper richer gold color and you could really tell it's 18 karat gold but with the white gold not necessarily it's kind of opposite but it ain't the same at the same time now you might be thinking well why would I go 18 karat white gold a few reasons come out to me number one the most important for me when we're talking why do people go up in purity I simply like more gold around the neck for that speck oh that was a nice one but you guys get the point I think 18 karat gold you're gonna have it all show it on the scale here's a 14 same length on the scale the 14 karat version and then the 18 karat burn is sorry I'm still thinking about that bar just dropped the 18 karat do you guys see the difference there's more gold an 18 karat I hope we all know that by now by the end of this video so a lot of people just want more gold around their chain for that side they don't want to go up and with they'd rather just have that style chain but more gold more value around the neck I think that's great that's a very mature gold train thought right there also in my opinion I know a lot of people are weird about white gold because they think people think it looks like silver the white 18 karat doesn't look as like sterling silver ish it's more dull and has kind of its own unique look so you don't when I see sterling silver it's like bleached white like just silver I mean a lot of people say I can't really tell the difference between white and silver I can it's very like white looking so and that's kind of the same with a 14 karat or 10 karat white gold has that bright look to me you still see the difference between a 14-karat white gold chain and a sterling silver chain but it just looks less like that more dull just kind of has a little more of a masculine classy look if you ask me so those are the other difference mainly the gram weight difference between the 18 karat and teen carry all in all guys it is all preference on what you want to do I showed the side-by-sides I gave my little review now it is up to you to go to WWE comm and pick yourself up a chain and thank you guys for watching that's it for today's video and we will see you on our next julie video", "tLju8hypdYc": "hello and welcome to my youtube channel this is my virtual yard sale via eBay as always no returns no refunds items are sold as is now that's out of the way I've got a 14 karat pair of dolphin earrings for everybody to give you an idea of the size they are pretty decent about an inch and a quarter in diameter and they are yellow gold if you like the warmer tones they've got a really cute design if you like dolphins as you can see there's two dolphins that are either kissing or holding a ball together now these designs are very fragile they can easily Bend out of shape ask me how I know huh now the reason why I know these are authentic it's because I know they came from some department store either Walmart Kmart or something of that these do have a defect it's just this one earring as far as I can tell but there's a dent here from improper storage maybe if you're a jeweler you'd be able to I don't know repin that or melt it I don't know there's another one here to various like the good news is though even if he can't fix it this part I believe is meant to be more on the outside anyway so if you were to wear this on a regular setting would show like that now this one as far as I can tell this one is okay for now maybe some minor scratches but no real denting here just again be careful if you have long hair these can catch these look gorgeous on people with their hair up or short hair some hoops are just more fragile than others and the 14 carry it's going to be softer than say a 10 karat anyway first I'll show you the weight so like any authentic pair of golden earrings their friend be very light that's my kitchen scale and I was not expecting them to not register as anything there's no tear that's I gotta weigh something but mmm that's it anyway I do not expect that to happen now I have a magnifying glass here and I don't know if I'll be able to get on video it was super hard to get in a picture but beefs a 14-carat right here you can see on the post there's a tiny bit of writing oh I don't know if I'll people do it on here if I says 14-karat like MC or something 14-karat and this is Israel so I guess these were made in Israel so

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "k4KYi_5924Q": "[Music] you", "fEdRzMXm0k8": "um I don't often see it and I've searched it my whole life I don't often see it set in 14 karat gold the other thing growing up when I was a kid I hated my birthstone I thought cuz all i ever saw was brown root beer barrel colored garnets and I thought it has no pizzazz I've come to QVC and I learned about Mozambique carnets I learned about Rose blush garnets I see the juicy reds and pinks and purples that come through even the tsavorite garnets make me wild so now finally as an adult I love my birthstone as you look at these you're going to notice that we're setting them in 14 karat yellow gold look at those garnets that's what this stone is all about this swirling tornado force of nature color inside the belly of that huge garnet that is so hard to get garnets of this size with that color that's sparkle so of course they're going to set that in a lot of 14-karat gold a full-blown two prong for setting on this one of a 14 karat gold the carat weight on these the total weight is almost 4 carats you almost have two carats in each ear almost 2 carats in each ear let's measure that so these have a lot of gold of them in them and as I said before not a lot of garnets are set in gold this is very affordable for a pair of 14 karat gold earrings you're coming in at about a quarter of an inch maybe a little bit more by a quarter of an inch maybe a little bit more than that double prongs big singular stone this is something that they don't know if they can reorder it and hold the price on it of course they could probably get these stones back but they probably won't be able to hold this price on it know which price will go up so if you're going alright I already know I want these I love them I gotta have them this is the day that you want to get it because most likely well definitely the price is going to go up i'm just going to tell you honestly they'll go up j 288 724 that color is what dreams are made of with a garnet so if you've been watching you're going you know I don't totally dig the Mozambique I don't do the Rose blush I want the sincere color of garnet which is that deep rich juice red that's the sign of a really really good garnet and that's what they did that's what we found with this one and to set it and 14 karat gold is really the only way to go with it because when you have a gemstone of that quality of that size of that carat weight yeah you're going to set it in gold matter of fact probably should have been platinum by the way one more time sir oh there are fewer than 200 of these left it is j 288 7244 145 dollars so now let's talk about this let's talk about that person 145 dollars think about this setting a gold setting x 2 and the price of gold right now when I saw this and I saw that these weren't just little skinny prongs you know in a little shallow basket holding this I want you to see the I'll take these out of my basket so you can see a little bit but look at that look at all that gold that's a lot of gold and you think about the price of gold and you're looking at the price tag of 145 that's a great value then you shoot in almost a two carat fabulous garnet round garnet double prong set that's a gem that's a gem that's a treasure in your jewelry box look at the way it twinkles look at the way it sparkles if you're a purist when it comes to your jewelry you don't like to plan the other colors of the gemstone take theirs garnet that's garnet and you know say goodbye to those root beer barrel Brown garnets out there say goodbye to the ones that are murky and cloudy and have no life this is like sparkling red champagne if it existed that's what these look like and feel like 145 dollars all set and gold you might be noticing this this was a once-in-a-lifetime by to get a garnet stone that size that is surrounded by diamonds and 14 karat yellow gold and it was a it was an opportunity

"slF9LI2pPO8": "okay so here are a pair of solid boulder opal earrings so when we say solid we're basically it's a term we use in the industry for 100% natural they're not double it's not triplets not inlays these the real thing so boulder opal forms and is the opal forms inside empty cavities and then the silica solution eventually turns hard into opal so and we've just removed one side and we've left the opal attached to the back I really like square shape opal earrings and because it doesn't matter if they rotate in the air and they still look they still look I'm correct and in the right way the right way up and it's also you just don't get me square earrings either so a really nice pair very bright brightness is the most important thing when it when determine determining value great matching pattern ticks all the boxes if you want something special something unique one-of-a-kind I think this is a great pair", "SSMa7ojBuDc": "hello everybody out here on YouTube it is I hear real beautiful Biddy gonna be doing a derby haul for you today actually I just purchased these products about two weeks ago from Walmart I know so I was really reluctant about buying jury from Walmart because typically I do not normally I buy jewelry online from Ross Simon so yeah but you know Ross Simon is very pricey it's very expensive I have spent way too much money on Ross Simon jewelry over the last several years and yeah it just adds up it gets very costly gets very expensive so I decided to go out on a limb and make some online purchases from Walmart and actually buy real jury from Walmart so I got this order about two weeks ago and I bought a few pairs here anyhow I want to share some of them with you okay let's start out the first one these are called these are simply gold oval hoop earrings and ten karat gold so I really like these I do think you know they're decent quality they're very lightweight there's you know there's not much to them but it is becoming increasingly more difficult to find solid gold jewelry for sale these days jewelry excuse me gold is obviously in sketchiest scarce demand and it's not as abundant as gold used to be whether it's 10 karat or 14 karat or even 18 karat gold depending on whatever it does not make no difference it is becoming increasingly more difficult to find real jury if you know what I mean an actual gold because go up the prices of gold of just skyrocketed unbelievably so anyhow I thought I'd go ahead and give Walmart jury a try I'm very pleasantly surprised with their juries so far really no complaints it's very decently priced yeah so I really do like these these are the simply gold 10 carat oval hoop earrings yeah I really love those so yes move on to the next product here next Juri Adam here I'm so used to doing product reviews I know so I really love these these are gold balls and once again these are 10 karat these are 10 karat gold balls and I just love them I think they're fantastic you they're not too big they're not too small they're not overdramatic they're not you know they're not less dressy or more dressy you can dress them up you can dress them down you can wear these with blue jeans and a t-shirt blue jeans and a sweater you can wear this with pair of shorts and a tank top it makes no difference but I think they're so cute just the same I really do like these and I'm very pleasantly surprised I think the quality is fairly decent and I wanted to share that so me show you that other one here that's what they look like there they are very cute if I can get a if I can get a hold of them here so yeah you know Walmart jury is what it is and obviously you can find some good pieces at Walmart at a you know fraction of the price because like I said just the price of gold has been driven up and it's so scarce lately and it's just expensive so I thought I would get in on some deals here for some real gold Sheree and what better place to look than Walmart so yeah I'm joy Z's and here's another pair I really liked this is part of the simply listening nice let me see let me see Missy this is the simply gold kids these are very small but I wanted a very tiny very small pair of hoop style earrings because on my double piercings I want to wear them in my upper whole of my double piercings and wear the bigger earrings down in the bottom hole if you know what I mean so yeah these are fantastic these are the simply gold kids collection these are 10 and karat gold simply gold and they are really small hearts there are hoops that are shaped in the shape of hearts I think they're very cute I think they're very awesome I love wearing these in the top hole of my ears they look fantastic I love them very decent quality once again being that they are for kids I would think they would be fantastic for children these would be absolutely fantastic for a little girl they would be such a treasure okay let's move on here to the next pair we got some more children's product here these are let's see these are 14 karat gold so they these are unlike the other pairs that are 10-carat these are 14 let me look at my receipt here and see if I can figure out which pair I'm looking at so I can give you accurate information these are these are also simply these are simply gold this are let's see these are okay these are simply gold kids and I can't find it on my receipt okay but anyhow I bought them whatever I don't know I think my receipt had a second page to it I can't find my second page but anyhow these are also simply gold the simply simply gold kids collection these are children's very small these are oval ribbed rib style hoops oval-shaped and these are 14 karat gold I love these once again I love wearing these in the top hole I could dress them up dress them down I love them and for children these would be awesomely fantastic for a little girl they come in such a cute little box here so yeah that would be such a treasure I would have absolutely loved to have had those when I was a little girl growing up I mean I was so girly girly and I just I loved anything girly girly your girlish and I would have just idol of those so much I absolutely would have those would make a fantastic children's gift they really would okay and the last pair I have here is let's see these are these are what I'm looking at my receipt here but obviously I left the second page out to my receipt okay so these are going to be these are mache with the earth these are going to be simply gold 10 karat scalloped hoop earrings okay I love these these are absolutely fantastic as well I have worn every pair that I've showed you I have worn within the last two weeks I have just circulated through them I love them these are the scalloped oval hoops and a 10 karat gold fantastic absolutely love these they're very lightweight they're not heavy they won't weigh your ears down and yeah once again like I said it's a joy getting in on some real gold jury because if you notice all the jury stores whether it's online or a physical actual jewelry store notice that everything for sale is sterling silver and it's set in sterling silver or it's spray sterling silver or spray gold or it's gold overlay or it's a rota dime or it's gold-tone it's very difficult lightly to really get in on real gold or solid gold pieces so I thought I'd jump on it and I am very pleasantly surprised with my Walmart jury haul I hope you enjoy it hopefully it enlightened you and if you're interested just check out Walmart online where I bought all my items from or go see what your actual Walmart store has so yeah here's just a recap of all them and I love them I just say they were there economically priced and I'm glad I bought all them I'll show you the little balls that are hiding out there they're so adorable I love these I think these are my favorite out of the hall here the jury hall these are my favorite of favorites here I love the gold balls I think they're so adorable okay so yeah hope you enjoyed the gold jury Walmart haul take care beauties be sure to give me a like give me a subscribe as always give me a thumbs up and check out all my
