{"ORCdvawQ69w": "but now I hope everyone is having a good ass day today I plan to it's a shitty [ __ ] Monday and we're gonna start things off right it's about 950 in the morning and I got one of these to get me through the day this is a medicated nerds rope seriously strawberry 400 milligrams of THC this is going to be wild yo it says I like I don't show you guys the whole thing just like sharing hair I get from Cali it says da right there I'm in Maine so other side of the country I shoulda thought about the fact I have braces it doesn't feel like I should be eating it and like 10:00 in the morning but you get strong but no this is obviously gonna take a while so I'm just gonna eat this real quick for you guys and check back in later at some point I'm dropping little nerd [ __ ] everywhere [ __ ] sweet I like don't eat candy but actually not enjoying this I really don't like this it's like the Nerds of the sour pirate but I don't even think that that has any THC in it it's probably all on the gummy so [ __ ] not pleasant to eat I'm sorry [ __ ] it's so [ __ ] sugary like halfway there it's all in my teeth gonna be tasting this [ __ ] for like an hour bought some blackberry Kush mostly endicott [ __ ] within because if you guys ever wondering if I have like a strain preference I mean I guess it's based on whatever I want to do like if I had like a whole day planned out where I wanted to get stoned but I had to go do things I'd pick a sativa but what the [ __ ] but most of the time I smoked to relax so I do enjoy like in the car better more often doesn't taste like weed at all that's not what I mean when I say it tastes bad it's just so [ __ ] sweet it's like early [ __ ] I took a shot of whiskey like it was like a little bit of whiskey and like a glass of my my throat's been like getting sore if you ever like feel like your throats getting sore and you take like a shot of alcohol or something for like an hour I'll just start to feel better but so I have that like sitting in my stomach a little bit and it's [ __ ] tangent well I'm sorry I from choosing if I'm chewing my mouth or talking on my mouth shooting with my mouth open I might already be stoned I don't even know fully last little bite here the video and see how this 400 milligram edible hits me etc ear actually I miss that but I guess it's supposed to work in 60 minutes I don't think that's a hundred percent if that's not represent accurate everybody obviously everyone's metabolism is [ __ ] different through it you'll make it hopefully I'm making it I'll check that few guys in a little bit all right so checking back in with y'all it's about two hours later I'm pretty stoned but like I don't know definitely not a stone as I like thought it would be so I'm just smoking now but I don't know I'm just I'm definitely kind of time just like feeling a little more tired but it's nothing like it's nothing like too crazy rolled up a little Jay got the absinthe flavored papers but he'll be here left this the main live cards as I've showed this pen yet but it's got like a little different voltage options of warm that up this cart is some blackberry Kush hybrid mostly indica so yeah I think I told you guys fun at the end of coz oh yeah let's give it a rip should I turn it down a little bit right there to about like 2.75 and then we'll take a blinker and hey I hate it like it's so awkward because like the cart [ __ ] never like screws on to like match up with the button so like five buttons right in front the [ __ ] mouthpiece is like awkward Cheers now I'm pretty big but I want to try some [ __ ] like I want to have either like a few 500 milligram edible doses all at once I'm just see what that's like because I really want to see if y'all got if you all remember my own the first time I ever took edibles story - it was crazy we don't really know what the dosing was but there's a slight chance there might have also been acid in it which if you eat that with edibles just makes it like way more I'm trying to think of the word like it just enhances the effects of like both highs I think and but yeah I know I want to see if that was like if that was the case or if that feeling is like 1500 milligrams worth of edibles because if it is I'm trying to [ __ ] get there - yeah that was such it was a good day but it was like a terrible day at the same time cuz like I wasn't expecting it is there I don't know there were times I was like worried there's a long [ __ ] story you guys should go back and watch that video if you haven't thought was a [ __ ] it was a banger oh [ __ ] well battery's just about dead anyways plug this [ __ ] and I know I think you know this this is like a pretty decent edible for me I just I need to take more but now mm-hmm I hope you guys enjoy the video I'm definitely gonna be takin I'll do a video of me taking a shitload more edibles um have like a big-ass me I'll have like a bunch of different [ __ ] to eat drinks it's actually a dope idea anything but no drop a like if you guys enjoyed the video comment and favorite way to smoke away smoking from state country whatever but yeah stay lifted everybody have a good a stay in peace y'all", "PQ8Kg3Uisr0": "[Music] i did a licorice in today's video we are going to see if candy is strong enough to hold the weight of a person i wanted candy uh-huh you got a good amount of it it looks like 12 pounds that's probably more than we needed but not more than you wanted you wanted to do some strength tests i did i actually wanted to see if you could climb a rope made out of licorice or maybe nerd rope or something like that but before we even attempted that i wanted to try something a little bit easier strength test about whether or not it can hold the human's body weight i think the most popular brand of this is the twizzlers pulling peel just like nine of them you peel them off yep i think this brand is tougher than those which is good for our experiments i think so they're a little bit stretchier but i actually got them because they were the longest pieces that i could find it is much longer than a twizzler's pull and peel that's like two feet and that was kind of what i wanted because i want to be able to hook them onto something and then try and swing from it like we've done in the past with other things yeah so i'm just tying this in a square knot i don't know if there's a better way to attach the ends together so it can hold a scale but i'm going with the square knot okay we've got our fish scale here okay turn it on and i'm gonna pull and see what pounds and ounces this gets to okay [Music] wow it's a lot stretchier than i thought that stretched a lot and it got to about two and a half pounds which is not a lot no but we have a lot of strength we do have a lot of strength i'm gonna do another one see if we get the same result [Music] that one hit like two pounds exactly okay so if we calculate that each one of these is two pounds i'm going to need 80 to hold my body weight that got two pounds but then it broke pretty quickly so i think we want a little bit more time than that especially if you were hoping to swing so i've got four strings here just together and then i've got four strings that i have braided together yes it is a four strand braid and i want to know which is stronger which is stretchier now i'm going to think this is going to be a lot stretchier with the way that it's braided together but let's find out [Music] okay got to like seven ish okay and uh it does seem like we're kind of cutting through with the hook so if it were like a wider could be anything like say hands maybe it would do better i like your idea then about putting a hundred because that gives us that leeway [Music] about the same seven okay so it is getting a little weaker but that's okay i do think that if we use 100 that's 20 extra strands that are just and it does really look like it's breaking on the points these narrow points that's how it always is with our rope test it's going to be at the fail point often with ropes the fail point is the knot and that does not seem to be the case not the knot it's not for me not the knot all right let's count out 100 of these [Music] i believe that is 100 strands all divided up into bunches of four singing moods today they're so oily i think they're coated in oil like yeah explains why it's so difficult to hold on to now you want to tie these i honestly just want to loop them you just want to loop and hang we can try that the time is first the tying is maybe to make it easier to hold on to i want to see if i can hold on to it with my teeth your dad is a dentist callie don't do these things that's exactly why i can't do it free dental oh dear all right let's add some hooks into the ceiling sure we have our reinforced spot let's not take well i mean i guess we can't really i can't take the shoes down no i'm just gonna put the hooks in right here and that should get the two by fours and possibly even well not the wall beyond but it'll get into the two by fours how many nates does it take to screw in a hook just one oh i might either back up one [Music] this is heavy it's a shocking amount of licorice does licorice go well it's really oily i would think that's by far the biggest risk here okay is not the strength of the licorice but how well you can hold on to oily like slimy ropes how's your grip not great not great nate [Music] this is gonna be a problem but it is holding my weight if you uh if you grip through paper towels wait yes good but it did hold me it was holding for me it did hold me and the one that was breaking is the one that you tried to hang on by itself so you had already started to break some of them i think let's count out 100 again and see if you can hang from it okay [Applause] [Music] all right now it's my turn i'm gonna see how long this licorice can hold me up one two three four five hey you cheated you ate it it didn't hold me up after i started eating it but it did hold your body weight and i think it would have held a lot longer if you hadn't started chowing down maybe a little that was pretty great guys you can hold a human's body weight with licorice and i'm thrilled alright so i've braided in other strands to see how well it holds and i'm curious if it will break or if it will actually like pull the strands out i guess oh yep the strands unwound i don't think anything actually broke now that one did interesting so it's maybe possible to make even longer ropes out of this stuff but it wouldn't be difficult yeah so you can hold your body weight with candy but whether or not you can make a rope out of it it's not looking like it i think you could but by the time you had a rope that was functional to do anything it would be as thick as all 100 of those strands together and it would be a ton of work to braid them all so what you'd end up with is a rope that barely does anything is thicker than your wrist and takes a lot of work to make so basically my weekend plans are shot [Music] oh my so bad gosh hurt are you okay okay okay but you're okay i'm fine guys you can jump rope with licorice look at it oh that's gonna be a whelp hey let's go before uh nate comes back and we have to clean all this up that's a good plan yeah let's go guys that's it for today but you know we've always got more great stuff for you see go ahead and hit that box right there to check out another one of our cool videos and we will see you in the next one talk to you then [Music]", "G70-Bp6kHGU": "is it just pure pain now that's what you hate to hear goodness gravy I've got a story for you guys today listen in the pursuit of life sometimes we run into bumps along the road the bumps vary in size and severity sometimes it's a little tiny pebble in the road and sometimes it's a giant [ __ ] boulder like for instance if you were hiking and you got hit by a giant [ __ ] boulder we're doing our best alright and sometimes things don't work out the way we would we would prefer today is one of those little interesting conundrums that we run into every now and then in our lives and it happened to me I ran into a bit of an issue so sit back relax and let's talk about how I once accidentally drugged myself with the largest edible I've ever eaten last February for all the coronavirus garbage happened I traveled to Los Angeles for spring break and one of the things that I had to do was I had to sign a [ __ ] ton of posters for u2's there was probably more than three thousand posters that I had to sign and the posters were being kept at the house at The Misfits YouTube group were staying at in LA Carson was there Schlacht was there Cooper's there we were all just trying to like sign all of these posters as fast as we could because there's so many of them and it was take us it was taking us literally hours to do at this point there was maybe about five or six people in the house at this time and that's because at that point the whole main misfits crew had gone out to dinner somewhere I don't know if you know this about the misfits in general but they smoked a lot of weed every trip they do they probably spent a couple thousand dollars on weed okay they smoked the mary-jane they do the weed in order to make the process of signing these posters go a little bit smoother I had smoked like half a joint of weed so I was already decently high because I hadn't smoked in a while either sign in a way crossing my eyes Dodd might ease however my personal reaction to weed is that I get the munchies I get the munchies pretty hard I smoked a little bit of the mare Lona and then I say oh I'm gonna eat an entire sleeve of club crackers with no cheese because gluttony I originally planned to go to dinner with my girlfriend and her father so I was trying to wean off of the hi and just kind of sign the posters and wait until it kind of wore off and then I would go and do that one of the things that they had at this house was they had a giant counter in which a bunch of snacks were all laid out there was chips there was more chips there was I think pizza I don't [ __ ] remember as I look across this horizon of bountiful snacks I see a nerds rope and my monkey brain is like oh and I'm thinking to myself man I remember nerds rope I haven't had nerds rope and [ __ ] forever dude I'm thinking back to my childhood where we would go to a campground in Maine and I would wattle on down to the snack shack and grab myself a nerds rub and before eating it considering its potential applications as nunchucks or trying to tie a knot with it but then realizing I'm a kid I don't know how to tie knots and my prefrontal lobe won't even be done cooking for another 20 years so what's even the point give me a slush puppy give me a Game Boy SP let's [ __ ] it up but lord have mercy did I learn in this moment I no longer was a child but a man a man who experiences consequence in the worst way possible so I'm signing more posters you know I'm cruisin I'm having a great time all right nerds rope tastes a bit strange but that could also be my perception that I have of being already high and it's kind of you've ever been high before it kind of messes with your perception of taste a little bit it was like drinking a diet coke versus a normal coke where there's like you know there's something there there's something there but I don't fully process why it tastes different so I finished the Nerds rope and then I go to have another nerds rope because I'm high and have the munchies as I'm biting into the next nerds rope one of the misfits guys says Ted don't eat those those are edibles hmm sorry I said I'm back I must uh I must have heard you wrong um scusi yeah Ted that's inedible so I say no [ __ ] way how much was it he says I think I think it might be like 60 milligrams what 60 milligrams to give you context the largest edible I'd had up until this point in my life was 20 milligrams so of course I asked are you sure one of the guys walks over to the counter and picks up the package of the Nerds rope and with the most you are [ __ ] face I've ever seen in a person he says it's actually 400 milligrams now remember I've already freaked out when I heard that it was a 50 milligram edible and I've just been told that it is actually eight times that amount so you may be asking yourself Ted how the [ __ ] did you not know that that was inedible and that's a good question let's start with the packaging that's the packaging it uses the same packaging as the actual branded Nerds rope it's got a thing that says Terran share as if it's just a normal candy in hindsight that's very much so implying for a good reason that you really should be sharing it and not eating it entirely on your own if you're not really paying attention and it's been like eight years since you had a nerds rope this is pretty easy to mistake for a nerds rope in addition to that there was a very specific and deceptive way that everything was laid out as snacks in the misfits house and I'll just let swagger CIL's explain that for me there was a very reasonable way like we set it up because the Nerds rope was inedible it's a 400 milligram edible and he didn't read the packaging but we have on that bench it's a big-ass bench it's snacks and food chips Pringles gummy bears all that [ __ ] munchies and then there's weed food which is edibles in between that and the weed which makes sense like a spectrum dangerous that's the thing is that it would make more sense to kind of put the weed food away so that you don't confuse confuse you've ever been in a car crash even if it's not your fault there's a certain feeling after it immediately happens it's this mind racing feeling when you have absolutely no idea what to do but you also know that something has to be done or you're [ __ ] aka panic so at this point I begin to freak for three reasons first of all I didn't know if I was personally prepared mentally to get as high as I was about to get second of all I had made plans for dinner with my girlfriend and her father that night and I definitely won't be making it and I'm pretty sure she's gonna be a little bit pissed and the third reason I hadn't smoked weed in two months which meant that my tolerance was rock-bottom I like to explain this with what I like to call the skyscraper analogy right here we have the tolerant skyscraper which represents my tolerance to marijuana let's just say that whenever I smoke weed I started the ground floor in the lobby if my taunts were higher then maybe I'd go a couple stories up to the mid-level apartments that's where all the stoner kids from high school hang out and they're all pretty high up there but it's nothing really to be worried about you're probably couch locked but you'll be fine with my tolerance at zero though I knew in my heart and my soul that I was going all the way up to cheech and Chong's [ __ ] penthouse as an unwilling and unexpected guest for an undetermined amount of time as things stand right now I don't even live in the building I'm from out of town and I sometimes commute into the city oh it's a Friday night oh we should go we should go get drinks in the city that's the that's what I'm operating on I know that I'm on a timer most edibles take about 45 minutes to an hour before they kick in but I know that I've taken this edible about 10 to 15 minutes prior which means math I've got about 45 minutes before this edible hits me and I died although other things can affect this such as being on an empty stomach which I was my first thought was that I need to make myself throw up because if I can get rid of as much of this edible as possible I could potentially mitigate the level of inebriation that I was about to experience so I stumble over to the bathroom and I start to gag and I'm trying to make myself throw up but I've never made myself throw up before I don't know how to do it so the next step is that I got Carson on his phone looking up how to's on wikiHow on how to make myself throw up and then Cooper's in the kitchen and he's making cups of saltwater for me to chug because apparently if you chug saltwater it helps with the throwing up process I'm not sure how true that was it just ended up with me just throwing up a bunch of pinkish salt water so I can't speak for its effectiveness but there you go and I'm pretty sure since the Nerds rope was sort of a candy sugar based food it was really easy for my stomach to digest it really fast so I'm pretty sure if I hadn't thrown it up within maybe five minutes there really wasn't that much that I could do from there so by the time I was done throwing up some food that we had ordered earlier arrived and Cooper basically advised me that the best thing that I could really do for myself would be to just fill my now completely empty stomach from this point on all I could really do was buckle up strap in and get ready for the [ __ ] high of a lifetime god bless my soul [Music] so I'm gonna give you guys a walkthrough of what this high was like it wasn't fun I also have some video footage that Cooper took so link to his channel in the in the description once I kind of came to terms with the fact that I was gonna have to ride out this high no matter what I decided to give myself a home base just somewhere where I could ground myself and not really need to worry about moving around or anything I found myself a nice armchair and I sat myself down there and prepared for the ride of a lifetime the first thing that happening was a classic weed symptom which is cottonmouth which is when your mouth gets really really dry so I was pretty much just constantly drinking water I remember starting to get colder and The Misfits they had a room where they just had a bunch of extra merch laid out where they could just give that to friends and stuff while they were in LA and I kind of just walked in there and just threw on one of the sweatshirts and then just went back to my home base and sat down and I was wondering for myself if that cold symptom that I was experiencing was real I did research on the symptoms that I was experiencing and this was something that actually happens informally it's referred to as weed chills the THC literally lowered my internal body temperature so I actually was getting cold another thing that happened and I think this also might have been a symptom of being cold but I started getting shaky and it's really funny the way that I described that when I was high and I actually have video footage of that right here welcome back it's gotten worse friends we are it's been about 45 minutes since last and bad okay I think you need another stick of butter I feel like my entire body feels like rubber bands pretty much after that point was when things started to get um they started to get bad the shaking was also the reason why in the video you can see me clasping my hands together because I was literally like shaking so much that I had to hold my hands together really tightly and keep my body really tight and close so I could be in like a comfortable state and then I get into what is called the painful zone or the first level of weed hell pretty much any position that I was sitting in felt painful don't do too much weed I was in the pain hotel and I was its only guest any surface that I touched whether it be the arms of my chair putting my hands on my knees anything like that just felt bad and what I think I would attribute that to is just being so high my sense of touch was just so elevated that my brain was just overloaded or something most of the time I was just trying to like breathe deeply and kind of maintain my composure but whenever Cooper would turn the camera on me and he would start recording I would sort of like try to elevate my attitude and try to seem as cheery as possible because I didn't really want to seem like an idiot hi stoner on camera you know at a certain point I had to move my home base because it was too disorienting to be sitting straight up I had to go and get [ __ ] horizontal baby I pretty much had to make a mental agreement with myself just to survive is it just pure pain now that's what you hate to hear it was during this time of unbearable dizziness that my good friend Schleck decided to use a [ __ ] handheld massager on me I'm just getting the lactic acid fun I just want to get the juices I just want to get the juices flowing if you please organism do you see my attitude there I wonder why I wouldn't like that a rapidly moving massager if you want a lesson on what not to do to someone when they're high that really takes the cake eventually the fateful moment happens I had a weed barf I honestly think it was really just because of how dizzy I was getting from being high and luckily for me I had a whole sandwich about an hour ago I literally had to run across the entire room and just run into the bathroom and throw up after I threw up though that's pretty much where the high took the downturn now it was cleansing I had it was a cleansing barf yeah it was uh it was detoxifying I went to go eat some skittles but without even knowing I was on camera I went around to people and not trusting my own ability to determine this I asked them if the skittles were edibles or not I ate the Edible at about 6:30 p.m. that day and I stayed awake all the way until about 4:00 a.m. that night I woke up at about 9:00 a.m. and I was still very high but I was definitely a manageable amount of hi what struck me though was I was high for the entire next day I went to bed that night hi so in total after eating a 400 milligram edible I was high for about you know 26 hours if there's one thing you guys shouldn't take away from this is like any anti weed sentiment from this video I think weed is a perfectly healthy drug to use recreationally but we'd like everything else follows the rule that too much of anything is definitely a bad thing obviously only consume weed in a state in which it's legal and if you're of age I hope you guys enjoyed this video let me know if you want more stories from my life I don't really know how many stories I have to tell this is like the second one I've ever told on this channel but I hope you learned a thing or two and if there's one thing you should take away from this it's this weed is for sinners and I'm going to help [Music] ped accidentally took 400 milligrams of edible", "M3AhWx5zzk4": "three two one this is the world's first ever load-bearing rope made of actual candy and while at first it might look like i just slapped a bunch of licorice together and called it a day in reality making a licorice rope that works like an actual rope is a lot more challenging than it seems which is why if you search for giant candy rope all you'll find are a handful of people who made half-hearted attempts and a few that are just straight-up fakes it's easy to say you've made the world's biggest candy rope but actually doing it is a very different story so today we're gonna put to rest another ridiculous question of mine can you make an actual rope out of licorice rope but before we put this rope through the ultimate set of tests i want to take a sec to show you what we actually had to do for the past three months to make this project work the ideal licorice for this project would be as strong as possible flexible enough to weave and accessible enough that i could get my hands on a lot of it you can't exactly google what licorice fits this bill so i had to test them out myself to measure strength i bought four common kinds of licorice cut five inch lengths of each and performed two strength tests first i measured how much weight it held when bent over the hook and next i measured how much weight it held when pulled along its length to make them easy to compare to each other i then converted these measurements into strength to weight ratios as a cool side product of this we're now able to calculate the maximum theoretical length of a single twizzler when held by the end that length is a surprisingly short 28.5 feet any longer than this and the weight of the licorice below it will cause it to just break off at the top after seeing the results of the testing i wanted to use twizzlers because they performed the best but fresh out of the package twizzlers are kind of too short and fat to weave and i discovered you can't really re-melt them or weld them together with heat either that's because unlike gummy candy which melts because it is a gelatin base red licorice has a starchy wheat flour base meaning it actually has more in common with spaghetti than it does with gummy worms being unable to lengthen my licorice meant i had to use a strand that starts out long so either super ropes or licorice laces i tweeted all my math at red vines on twitter asking for a sponsorship by way of some free super ropes but after a couple dms they ghosted me at which point i knew i was going solo this might have been a blessing in disguise though because super robes aren't actually all that strong according to my testing so i headed to amazon in search of a bargain on some licorice laces these are just as strong as broadway laces and i got them for an absolute steal loki abusing an amazon subscribe and save promo to get myself an extra 40 off their already discounted price before i went full scale i wanted to test the strength of various weaving styles so i made a two strand twisted rope a three strand flat braid and a four strand round braid each with a similar total number of licorice fibers in the test the three and four strand braids perform by far the best so i plan to use these in combination for the final rope these ropes are designed to bind against themselves when under load maximizing their strength and also locking in any extraneous fibers at this point you might think this video is all about science and while that's kind of true it's also kind of not rope making is an art and it's one i have absolutely zero experience with so instead of struggling through the making of this massive rope alone i called up my friend jeffrey who i knew could help me out oh here's here's the situation right this is a three strand and that's that's your four strand jeffrey's a craftsman who knows way more about rope making and leathercraft than i could ever hope to he also makes a ton of other stuff and without his help i'm not sure i would have been able to do this so please go follow his facebook page and check out his incredible work as soon as the licorice arrived we got right to work but even for someone as experienced as jeffrey making a rope this big with these materials was no easy task the mountain of licorice seemed unsurmountable at first but bag by bag and strand by strand the rope began to form i handled the licorice wrangling and jeffrey handled the weaving we started by making two 32 foot long three strand braids making sure to keep them as consistent in thickness as possible then we match them up at the ends and slid in a 2x4 to keep them in place as jeffrey leapt up onto the table to weave the final rope he admitted to me while weaving that even he found this a bit intimidating because the licorice is all basically the same color and since it's translucent light shines through it making shadows less visible making it really easy to lose track of where you are in the weaving process even so we pushed through and eventually after two days work we finally had the world's biggest licorice rope to catch a big fish now while we could have technically left it just like this i was going to have to move it a ton while setting up my testing and that repeated pulling and pushing on the weave could cause the rope to fall apart as a precaution we wrapped the rope with a handful of zip ties to help keep the fibers together but to be clear these don't add any additional strength to the rope they're just there to help keep the licorice strands from shimmying out of place at this point the rope was done so i thanked jeffrey for his help packed up the rope and came back the next day to finally test it out the only way to really know how strong your rope is is to push it till it breaks so i was determined to do just that and i figured why not start big yep all right i've got it going we're in neutral make sure we're freaking rolling we are all right here we go so i'm gonna call this a success if i can get from there to that pole let's test this thing out three two one go come on yes we got it yes yes let's go oh yes holy crap guys this is like 1200 pounds of machine that got moved with a pile of twizzlers that's freaking nuts or is it i was absolutely thrilled that it worked but to be honest pulling the car felt kinda easy you see the carpool used in ads for adhesives and here on youtube as this epic test of strength as if to say that pulling a car means the rope or glue or whatever can support thousands of pounds but that's actually kind of deceptive when you pull a car you're not actually pulling the full weight of it you're just overcoming its resistance to rolling which is a much lower weight how much lower well in the case of my car instead of 3 600 pounds it's closer to 36 that is way less so as impressive as it looks it's actually not that hard to do in practice so next time you see a test like that on tv now you know it's complete bogus but that also leaves us in a weird situation because we still haven't broken our rope if i was going to break this thing i needed a harder test so i packed it up and took it to a local gym to do just that oh and by the way if you think this kind of thing is cool please don't forget to subscribe it's free and it really helps me out and if you change your mind you can always unsubscribe later we are here at fit club in columbus ohio where they are graciously letting us use some of their equipment to test out this ridiculous licorice rope i

like that that's sick and nobody's ever come here with the licorice rope before right that's correct all right cool sick so what we're gonna do we're gonna put it to the test with a weight sled to see just kind of what it can pull all right we got two 45s on there all right so that's working so we got 85 pounds so far that's pretty good this is 90 90. you think all right let's try it all right how many pounds is this now can i even pull this let's find out holy crap yo it's holding let's go let's go even more i guess how many is this i don't even know if i can move this you want to pull this you got this all right ron yeah holy crap yeah it is that is nuts what is this 305 here we maxed out the capacity to sled at around 360 pounds but as we know pulling force can be kind of deceptive so how much weight did that actually put on the rope based on my calculations we put about 118.8 pounds of sustained stress on the rope and even after that this thing was still going i was still determined to break this thing though so fortunately i had a trick up my sleeve i knew the hardest test of all would be trying to actually climb it because not only would the rope have to support me it would have to support the weight of the entire rope below it if this didn't break the rope i didn't know what would so this is like the test robe and this is the giant rope we're just gonna send it we gotta go slow that's the thing that is gonna be the hardest part about this i see it just stretches that's the thing yeah the rope is getting longer as i do it here let me wrap pull round so that far worked i feel like this is long enough that we need to hang it from a higher point i mean frankly this is holding together a little bit better than i anticipated look how big this freaking thing is i'm so glad this didn't fall apart immediately i was like there are two ways this is gonna go that's the thing that's holy sh the higher i climb the heavier this oh my god like come over here look at this that is just dummy big i think we just got to send it louis unwise let's do it three two one let's go we know this thing is climbable we climbed it one time over there how about then we hang up this end let's just give it another whirl we got this grab these gloves we're gonna do this again new end of the rope i'm just gonna try and be efficient right here we go ready all right two one got it it's got it it just held yeah it's just stretching that's all ah and there it was finally after everything we put it through we managed to break the rope but my calculations including my weight and the weight of the licorice being supported this rope held around 180 pounds but why did i do this why make the world's largest licorice robe i just did it because i was curious my goal for this youtube channel is to ask ridiculous and interesting questions and then use science to actually answer them i don't just want to test stuff i also want to show you why so whether you're new here or

what is going on today we're taking a look at another edible this time nerds ropes these have been going on going around like crazy especially in the Northeast you do have to be careful though because there are fake versions of this this is lemonade wild cherry they also have the red which is you know the normal nerds colors and then they have a purple and they have a pink but there is no blue if you see a blue it is fake and stay away cuz there's been stories of these being laced with various other drugs so make sure you're getting them from a reputable source and make sure you really trust who you're going to but if we just get started take a look tear and share No thank you I'll keep it for myself point 9 ounces I don't know I don't know what that matters to you this is the lemonade wild cherry if you have the option of flavors I would I just love lemonade so like you know I obviously picked this one but this is by far my favorite flavor add all of them super potent formula I would honestly have to agree with them 400 milligrams per rope so I won't lie I'm a lightweight when it comes to edibles I smoke flower everyday I smoke concentrates most days but edibles just do me very dirt they really just [ __ ] me over so thoughtful portion 1/8 of the rope will be 50 milligrams so you know you can extrapolate that to however edibles match your body those are the ingredients in case you would like to know some more nutrition facts and this I did another nerd rope edible review and that one was a lot more thick and not you know like more homemade this they've they tried very hard to recreate the exact like texturing and everything the other one who's a lot softer and more gelatinous than a real nerds rope this one's a bit more hard and a bit firmer than a normal rope but these these really kick lands I gotta say hey this much about say about thirty minutes ago 60 minute activation time as I said I'm kind of a lightweight when it comes to edibles so I'm already folded and I've gone to other edibles and eaten them and you know how to like felt it obviously but these for some reason I love like these just get me in such a good mood and they give me like folded like where it's like a body high you know one thing that why is he covered in blood I'm assuming it's supposed to be the you know the rope part but this just looks kind of scary like are you okay man looks like you're stomping in someone's guts and he's very happy about it if you like Evan if you like edibles if you like karts you like you like Bud them sort of things drop a sub check out my channel she liked this video there's probably a ton of videos just like it that you will also enjoy hope you guys are staying safe smoking something good not smoking some [ __ ] pesticides yeah later", "HyIDi6b4iwk": "what's up YouTube today we're gonna make a giant nerds rope you don't know what nerds rope is it's this thing you see I you see nerds ropes so much when I was a little kid today we're gonna make a bigger version of it because I'm a big kid now so basically what it is it's a whole bunch of little nerds on a thin strip of taffy ish gummy like substance in the middle all right here are some basic ingredients need for this you need nerds lots of nerds some red vines a pot and some sugar noodles oh yeah now let's unbox this big nerd right here oh yeah look at that Oh what oh what oh man this is so disappointing is that what that's the only thing that came out of it oh my goodness that is such a disappointment anyways as soon as you unbox the Nerds all you gotta do is unravel it and put it into one little pot to make it easier for your day so at this point I was like is this enough nurse to fill the giant nerds rope we'll find out later in this video now get your quad put some Red Vine in it and start melting it this will serve as the coating for the sugar noodles you gotta be careful because if you don't watch the pot correctly it'll melt and burn the house down that's right it will cause a fire and then you'll be in trouble anyways after adding a little bit more Red Vine and melting it for another 10 minutes I think we are good to go from here all you want to do is just add the melted Red Vine into the sugar noodle all around just like that once you covered the whole sugar noodle with Red Vine you want to coat the whole thing with nerds the question is do I have enough nerds to cover at all and the answer is yes [Music] how does it taste it's good it's good alright everyone thank you all for watching hope you enjoyed today's of DIY junior trope and then yeah see you next time bye [Music]", "qg6Na2ncYns": "everybody's down here for me give me a comm here we are today back and got the Rope grabbing the last two grindy achievements calorie minimizer and ultimate rope cutter I recommend doing this in cardboard box part 7 this is going to be level with six ropes so this is the level with the most ropes in the game you can do just you your classic circular to cut all the ropes at once you should get six per game you need two thousand look at the last achievement and you need to drop the candy I believe it was two hundred times in order to get calorie minimizer so the first stream it's gonna be to lose the candy two hundred times it's gonna be pretending gamerscore and then once you get your two thousand rope cuts you should get that achievement takes about six to ten minutes but once you do it you should get a bunch of achievements and that's all there is to it", "UgDQ0zsfvVY": "what's up guys thank you guys so much for

"xLGdwseHhwM": "now here's the question are you the type that likes to play with your candy perhaps you'd like to wear it well these are nerds ropes and they can be a necklace perhaps a bracelet or they can be stretched out like that now how do they think of these things and how do they make them let's watch call it colorful and crazy twisty or tasty nerds rope stretch the imagination network has quite quite something it's a gummy Center covered in rainbow nerds it's like a big delicious strand of DNA nerds ropes are fairly new but regular nerds have been around since 1983 the most popular flavors are great and strawberry and if you like them tart they also makes our nerds and flavors like lightning lemon and amped Apple usually one box of nerds has two flavors but the Nerds rope is like a cluster of five colors and flavors grape orange lemon watermelon and strawberry it's it's quite an experience Willy Wonka invited us into his private factory in Itasca Illinois where nerds ropes roll off the conveyor in not feet but miles we're to line up all of our nerds rope so we make it one day and then we have over 60 miles of nerds rope believe it or not it's thought this sugary strand came about by accident the word round the factories that one day there were load of nerds laying around and somebody was experimenting with some gummies that mystery inventor apparently dribbled some of the gummy mixture over a pile of nerds and then he went to lunch and then when they came back they discovered this amazing thing and then they said about how to how to create this so that lots of people could enjoy and they were very successful before you can have a nerds rope you have to have nerds nerds are just this iconic amazing candy that have tons of character I mean I think when you see the me big mango get just it just blows your mind more than a hundred fifty million of these tiny crunchy candies coat the ropes each day the sugar spins and pans like this and slowly grows into lots of uniquely shaped nerds check out these naked nerds this is what they look like before they add color meantime the gummy Center cooks with gelatin sugar and a special ingredient citric acid for fruity flavor this is not a shower of nerds it's more like a storm countless little candies cover the long sticky red ropes then they cut them and cool them down and within a few minutes a conveyor leads to the finish ropes to a container called au bord and that you board allows us to be able to wrap it so it'll maintain its shape as we send it out each rainbow-colored creation slides into a shiny foil wrapper as for what happens next well that's up to whoever opens it no Jeff is just one of those super super creative candies I mean it's just like pure imagination I would say it's a one of a kind so the next time your kids want a colorful candy edition to play dress-up how about a nerds rope ring or belt for candy bling nerds ropes make a funny fashion statement ten and even better edible accessory", "DoRyjd2zKwY": "what's good bass draw militia bass draw keys here i'm your friendly neighborhood negro and welcome to another episode of good eats in today's video guys we got a highly requested video for you today we're going to do our own homemade nerd ropes and you know that they're goodies for 20 style so without any further ado let's go ahead and get into it let's do [Music] way all right guys and real quickly here i do want to invite everybody please check out our membership program that we just started here on the channel it really does help

pledges every month and it really does help make these videos so guys please if you can support us right here on the on the youtube membership program or on patreon now let's go ahead and get into this video here we go all right guys so let's go ahead and get into today's video today we're going to be doing our own homemade nerve ropes this video has been highly requested for quite some time so we're going to go ahead and make it happen today now there is an easy way to do it and there's a hard way to do it of course i'm going to show you the easy way to do it today if you guys want the like the harder way maybe we can do that at a later time but today i'm going to show you the easiest way to make your homemade nerd ropes so the first thing that we got to do is i'm going to show you what we need we're going to be using some is it haribo i don't know is it haribo hariba let's go haribo we're going to use haribo um gold bears this is what i was saying about the easy way and the hard way these are ways just to take these bears right here we're going to melt them down in the microwave that's the easiest way the hard way would be the harder way i was ashamed to be to go ahead and make our own gelatin just like you would do when we're making our gummy bears you can go and make your gelatin that way as well and do it but we're going to go ahead and just melt these down and do it the easy way and of course with nerd ropes you're going to need some nerds so i went to the store and i got some nerds so as you can see right here i have a baking sheet on the baking sheet i have some parchment paper what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take some aluminum foil and what we're gonna do is we're gonna actually make kind of like you can call it like a mold and that way we able to we'll be able to distribute our nerds and make our our nerd ropes the way that we want to make them all right but first what we got to do is we have to take some aluminum foil and we're actually going to make our mold you can say so that way we'll be able to distribute our nerds evenly let me show you what i mean you're going to take some aluminum foil we're going to make kind of like an accordion shape let me show you all right so you can see we have a piece of aluminum foil and we're going to do an accordion shape what i mean by that is you're going to hold it like this you're going to fold it like this and then we're going to [Music] hold it back like this we'll do that back and forth all right so you see we folded it back and forth now we just want to open it all right so that way you can you guys can see what i've done i've just made you can basically say like a w or m whatever that way we have places where we can actually put our nerds right we can put our nerds in here are you guys getting a good picture this way i don't think so let me raise up the camera and get a better angle for you guys but i don't think you're getting a good a good angle let me raise you guys up some there we go i think i made this a little bit too long i do believe i can fix that though there we go so i made him too long but i fixed that just by tearing off so now you can guys can see better what i'm talking about so what i'm proposing to do is [Music] now you see we have peaks and valleys in the valleys we're going to actually form our nerd ropes you see what i'm saying so what we're going to do is we're going to pour our nerve ropes in here right for the bottom layer and then what we're going to do is we're going to put these bears inside of this measuring cup and melt them down in the microwave at that point that's where we're going to medicate it now as far as how to medicate this you can use tincture you can use coconut oil it's up to you we're going to use some coconut oil today but if you got some tincture use that and as far as how much you want to use it's really based upon how strong do you want it i'm going to use two or three tablespoons of coconut oil for this but it's really up to you about how much do you want to medicate it if you're talking about how much thc you're putting in it that you know it just depends on how strong did you make your oil how strong did you make your tincture and then from that you can go ahead and you know put it in accordingly so let's go ahead and do the first part of this which is putting the nerds in here i'm gonna take a box open them i'm gonna start putting them in here i got seven boxes so hopefully that's enough [Music] if it's not oh no [Music] oh nerds all right [Music] and i said i'm going to try something on this last one what i want to do is i really want to take some spray and like spray it in here [Music] because as you can see i did these without any spray right here and so i'm wondering how how they're gonna be as far as sticking to the aluminum foil in the past when i've used things with aluminum foil and it's sticking it's been really hard to come off i'm just really trying to make sure they got an even coat so let me do that coconut oil cooking spray and i'm just going to [Music] and that's going to be our test to see if we should have sprayed it i just thought about it right now all right so look take some more of these nerds put them in here all right so we're pretty good on that i have four rows ready to do four ropes i bought a lot of nerds so i can now always do more batches so now what we got to do is we're going to take our bears right here we're going to put them in this measuring cup pyrex measuring cup put it in the microwave we're going to melt them down and then that's when we're going to take and our fused oil and medicate this up obviously if you don't want to medicate it just don't use the oil don't use any tincture if you want to make fantastic nerd ropes just like this that'll be just fine so yeah here we go all right so there's two cups in this bag we're going to use one cup right now like i said i'm doing this in batches so that way everything will work out the way we want it to so i'm going to take a cup of these gummy bears there's two cups in the bag we're going to take half of this and let's go ahead and put this in the microwave and melt this down and i'll show you what it looks like when it's finished this is two and a half minutes in the microwave and so you can see it's melted down now look at that so we're gonna do now that just melts it down we're going to take our coconut oil you can use tincture if you have tincture and like i said depends on how strong you want it i'm gonna do two tablespoons you know what i really you know what three tablespoons why not three tablespoons in there we're going to stir it up make sure you stir it up nice we're going to put this back in the microwave so we can warm this back up and keep it liquid once that happens and we take it out i'm going to put it in this squeeze bottle to make it easier to do the lines for the nerd ropes there's a lot of ways that you can do i've seen people pouring it cutting bags and that kind of stuff i think the easiest way to do is going to be with a one dollar squeeze bottle that you can get from the dollar store if you need a link for this i will put it in the description for you but yeah back in the microwave we go all right guys so we're out of the microwave now what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take this and i'll pour it inside of here to make it easier [Music] so now we got this in here let's go ahead and do some lines that doesn't sound right let's put some lines in here so we can go ahead and medicate this go slow all right guys that's pretty hot so i'm going to use my magical butter glove in order to do it [Music] there we go very nice [Music] and this is going to be the easiest way for you to do it so you can control what you're doing what i like to do is just go down one time up one time and that'll be good enough [Music] it's like the easiest way to control what you're doing you can put exact strings in there perfect look at that look at that beautiful that's the way to do it without any of the waste and what's so great about it is in this squeeze bottle if it goes down in temperature all you got to do is warm it up a little bit and you can continue to do what you're doing all right guys so now that we got that done before this dries up let's go ahead and put some nerves back on the top of this [Music] all right guys so now you can see that we have everything covered there we go so now we have our [Music] gumby mixture in between the nerds and now all we got to do is just let them sit all right guys so what i'm going to do is i'm going to put these in the refrigerator for 30 minutes and then i'm going to take them out and take them off the take them out of the mold here and show you what they look like so yeah give me 30 minutes we're going to put them in the refrigerator and we'll be back in 30 minutes all right guys so it's been 30 minutes inside the refrigerator all right so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to attempt to peel these off see if they're set [Music] look at that it doesn't matter about if all the uh excess nerds fall on the tray that's why we put the parchment paper down look at that yeah i told you guys this is the easiest way to do it nero nero all right so these have been coming off pretty easy here doing it the way that i did it these are the ones by the way these are the ones that we didn't put the the spray down this one right here is the one that we did this right here is with no spray nerd rope nerd bro all right now this one is the one with the uh with the sprite and they came look the one with the spray came right off so i would say guys you might want to use this break because the one with the spray came right off look at that [Music] alright guys so

understandable as he's got a mountain of burgers monica just about inhaled her small serving that was fast though katie won't be outdone by anyone and she shows off her skills and quickly destroying food as well nice look hun [Music] ted wants to make this round as impressive as possible and starts to build a tower of burgers we've all dreamed that at least once now it's one thing to build something but another to make sure it won't come crashing down [Music] that didn't last long but the taste has not been affected thankfully [Music] oh wow seriously mentos and coca-cola we all know what comes from that particular combo [Music] filled with fear and with shaking hands ted opens his can of coke [Music] hmm well that was underwhelming [Music] you can all breathe a sigh of relief and ted can sip on his soda no problem [Music] all right now it's katie's turn and things are gonna heat up that's a much bigger bottle boom hope that was refreshing [Music] too bad just about nothing at all is left for katie to drink maybe if she rings out her clothes though last but not least in the slightest we've got monica this is going to be a massive explosion guys you might want to back away from the screens too just in case there she blows everyone was in the splash zone don't try this at home kids your parents won't be amused by the results oops we've got ice cream we've got a spoon but the two don't really match one another in size do they [Music] everyone in our trio has been served up such a pairing funny stuff monica gave her spoon a go but it just wasn't meant to be it's out of here and she's treating her treat like a finger food bit gross really [Music] but manners be damned the ice cream is gone [Music] everything ted's got is just right a medium-sized spoon for a medium-sized carton of ice cream what a mess ted katie that means you're up that giant bucket of ice cream is insanely huge and it's gonna take ages to eat it with a tiny spoon the other two drift off as they wait how much time has passed a day a week a year oh she's frozen solid what's with this measly serving [Music] ted isn't exactly living the dream either what and somehow katie's plate is totally empty how unfair right no one is particularly happy but monica knows that one skittle is better than none [Music] ted bit greedy aren't you got a showman all the same too [Music] now that was quite the trick he just pulled off [Music] things keep getting stranger [Music] what's with the umbrella huh i don't think rain was in the forecast well regular rain wasn't at least but a skittles downpour has already begun if only bad weather was always this sweet candy rain and ice cream blizzards that would be awesome yeah ted monica what's with the faces yeah a few candies went places that perhaps they shouldn't have but that's no biggie now it's time for our heroes to finally feast [Music] a kit kat do you love these crunchy candy bars as it goes the more chocolate you got the tastier it is monica is drunk with power with all those kitkats before her monika you need to take a chill pill right about now ted isn't going to put anything off he's going to dig in small as his portion may be that crunches music to the ears [Music] katie whoa go big or go home huh girl [Music] if that's how she likes to eat more power to her i see though it is a tad frightening for those of us watching [Music] all right now for the main event wow monica and her horde of candy bars oh would you look at this she knows just how she wants to come at it all quite an interesting recipe though to pull this off you need some specific superpowers like monica's got that's got to be a very sweet soup [Applause] [Music] eggs that's a far cry from the delicious chocolate bars from the last round you three big egg lovers by any chance what [Music] yeah no guess not katie you're the bravest start us off already a raw egg right in the mouth that is beyond disgusting ted won't be following her example he's got what he thinks is a genius idea i'll see hey man be a bit more careful would you [Music] and what's this going to be [Music] an egg smoothie [Music] it looks innocent enough but the taste is just horrible but who expected anything else oh no what um what's going on guys any clue [Music] i think this might be a special place for those who have already completed the egg round but what about monica [Music] there's no saying no my dear [Music] that was an epic fall right into the pool made just for her raw eggs are everywhere i wonder if she'll ever wash them all out of her hair and clothes [Music] not very nice to laugh at your friend oh i think all three of you may need a shower now [Music] oh no peppers things aren't getting any easier and for one lucky contestant this round is going to be crazy hot namely ted oh no we feel for you man but you knew what you signed up for with this challenge katie takes the tiniest nibble from her chili and feels the burn immediately [Music] monica picks up her peppers and takes a bite out of all three that was so brave [Music] wash it down with water now [Music] ted knows what awaits him and there is nothing he can do to change it do it man there's no turning back the only way to douse those flames is with a bucket of water thank goodness their dishes came with plenty we're dead once a minute or two hmm that's it one piece of gum ted's sitting a bit prettier to be sure but the big winner is miss monica by a long shot [Music] katie isn't going to wait around she pops her piece into her mouth what turns out she's not exactly a master blowing bubbles but ted thinks he can show everyone how it's done he's got lots of practice in this field but there's always a catch bubbles pop sooner or later to take your time and clean yourself up bud [Applause] monica isn't messing around at all no tricks or funny business she's simply shoving as much gum in her mouth as possible and now she's going to show up even ted's bubble he's got nothing on her this might be a world record someone called guinness [Music] still attached to her balloon monica starts floating upwards so long hon have a nice trip and hold on tight [Music] sweet little gummy bears hmm well gummy bear ooh now there's a whole lot more in that bowl not too shabby but when there's a virtual army that's even better katie wants to show off a bit with her one bear if you don't have much make it unforgettable ted loves to play with his food too his mother would just be appalled by his behavior but it is pretty entertaining girls don't be such sticks in the mud what's with the judgy faces monica is on cloud nine right about now would you be in her place she's really rubbing it in the other two spaces but her greed has really come back to bite her have you ever found yourself in this sticky situation who's got an idea on how to free up her hands from that mess did you enjoy our video share with your friends give us a thumbs up and leave a

illegal it's a hair accessory good morning my love welcome back to today's vlog so today i knew i already knew going into today that today was going to be wacko today was not going to be a regular shmugler ass day because last night i had a crazy stream and i'm going to tell you all about it but first i do want to mention that um i was going to do like this cute little video that i saw a bunch of other youtubers do that was like eating candy from the decades 1920s candy 1930s candy and i was like i want to do that so we went to oldtimecandy.com not spons and i ordered so much [ __ ] candy and i was so excited i did this little layout i did this spread i started vlogging it was honestly really professional except for the [ __ ] fact that i wasn't recording but other than that everything else was professional like the way that it was set up like the ankle the sun was shining in and i was just like oh i want to rank this of a taste test and then i i opened it all on camera i showed you guys the packaging i did some uh like this [ __ ] you know what i mean and it just was the best thing ever and then i look at the camera and normally there's a red dot in the corner and i can see no red dot at the corner so i ate all that can't even nothing but we still have like i would say 90 of it that we haven't eaten so technically it wasn't that big of a fail no big deal even tiger wants to join us but i do want to tell you guys about my dream before we get started because it's so uncomfortable this dream was honestly one of the weirder dreams that i've had and normally i have nightmares that are really intense of like you know my front door is missing there's a home intruder there's all of these crazy things we're getting dead bodies shipped to our house fedex to ups to our house we open it up dead person you know like i have those types of dreams but this is by far one of the creepiest dreams i've ever had so my fiance and i we went hiking that's at the end i'm kidding we went hiking at the la river which i don't know if you can even go hiking there i feel it sounds like something that you can do in l.a so we went hiking but this time it wasn't like dehydrated la it was like a lush la like the river was flowing it was massive like there were rocks everywhere and then there was like this nature trail and we were like let's go hike on the nature trail and everyone before we went hiking was like hey you need to bring a weapon because there's gonna be like coyotes there there's gonna be wild bears there like you have to protect yourself and so instead of bringing something like pepper spray or a taser or anything that i would normally bring i decided to bring one chopstick and i don't even think it was my best chopstick which like what a branding moment that could have been but i bring one chopstick and i'm like yeah this is gonna protect me from coyotes until we go hiking and i randomly went off the trail a little bit and this panda this real panda approaches me and it's trying to [ __ ] fight me and so then i'm like oh my god this panda is gonna kill me today so i grab my chopstick and i just go like this at the panda and it goes up the chin of the panda into the pandas head and around that like the chopstick was already in the head my fiance runs over and he's like are you getting attacked by the panda and so he body slams the panda onto the ground but in the process of that i guess i was holding on to the chopsticks anyway any which way any who anyhow panda's decapitated that's what i'm trying to say in my dream the panda's head is here the panda's body is here and we're just looking at it like what the fork do we need i pick up the head put it on my head and that's how mr mango butt came to be that didn't happen in my dream but in my dream we're like okay what do we do now like we just have this dead panda and i was like okay well if i tell everyone that i killed this panda from self-defense nobody's gonna believe me right and he was like right so we dump the panda into the flowing river the body and the head separately because decapitated so we dump the body i'm thinking the body's gonna sink because the panda was real that comes doesn't sink it just floats and then a gathering appears and everyone's like what happened to the panda and so i told everyone like yeah it was in self-defense and everyone was looking at me and was like did you know that china just bought part of the l.a river and i was like what does that mean and that's what i was like oh [ __ ] there's like going to be chinese authorities that are just like looking at the river and then they're going to see a dead panda and somehow they're going to tie it to me because my chopstick's still in there probably and they're going to be like where do we get this chopsticks fandroid.com that's crazy they're going to know that it's me i was so worried that chyna was gonna execute me i'm gonna go to mister for killing a panda yes absolutely would they really execute me for killing a panda i don't know if they will execute you but i mean panda is the national treasure so so we're going to eat these candies yeah yeah okay so we're going to eat the candies again can you show me the jelly beans of the butter popcorn can you show me some of these so these we already opened we already taste tested so this one's so cool because if you listen to it does that not sound like a beer can to you you pop it open and then inside of it are these mini little jelly belly bags these are so cute these look so high-end why was candy so high-end back in the day now it's just like bags of chocolate back in the day you're creative look at this show them this he thinks this is really gross i grew up eating push pops this is the way that it works you open it up you stick your finger in teaching kids yeah and then this comes out and then you set got it and then you're like wait a second i gotta go to class okay put it in your pocket the gross thing is we both licked this like 20 minutes ago and now he wants me to lick it again lipstick lipstick no he can't it's young it's a lipstick honestly it tastes pretty good i just think like think about it how unsanitary this is did you guys grow up with this chocolate leave it in the comments if you guys ever grew up with any of these candies because some of these are from the 1990s and the 2000s so don't be [ __ ] acting like i am like the oldest bits in the game i don't know why i got so offended these are push pops i used to love these you can still get them at gas stations and then this one he had no idea what this one was i told him to give me his finger because it's a like a jelly and he this is how little idea he is he goes okay i'm like no your finger and he goes and i go no i need your finger and he goes and then i smeared it on and he was so grossed out by it he absolutely hated this one what did it taste like and then we have another icy this one is a spray this is my first time having i feel like i've had some sort of squeeze i don't think it was an icy brand this one is very interesting it's like a lysol spray like a disinfectant spray but you just and it sprays sour juice straight into your mouth this is what he was so amused by our cinnamon flavored toothpicks this is his favorite thing you can't even eat him i just got them because he loves toothpicks i'm still too young to use toothpicks but he uses toothpicks and then we have these cocktail jelly bellies these are just the ones that we've already opened because i thought it was important so these have margaritas strawberry daiquiri pina colada okay have a mojito okay i'm gonna have a peanut pilaf mmm i'm toasty popcorn this one i can't eat because i gagged he loves it he says it tastes like harry potter so it's a popcorn box you open it up it tastes just like butter freaking jelly beans tastes just like popcorn just like popcorn magic it's like when you bite into it the buttery popcorn porn oh candy necklace show them the necklace my favorite thing and just in the world so i pulled this out and he goes oh it's just like the pancake necklace that we have in china so in china they like to wear do you like it i feel like i'm going to like coachella and i'm on drugs because that's the only way that you can be 20 something and think that this is a sanitary meal put on your neck can you show them how you eat it i can't eat it anymore i have to eat it that's so cool this has got to be the funnest candy and then they came out with um candy underwear i remember shot off like is it an adult thing or yeah it's like a thong but it's candy but apparently i think they stopped it because it was giving a bunch of girls yeast infections what exactly is it i think it looks like a thong oh it exactly look like this oh that is so creative do you like it or something no i just think it's funny [Laughter] so now we have champagne jelly bellies that came in this bottle which this is like the og sugarfina because if you guys know sugarfina does like the green juice bottles of just gummies or bellies or jelly belly you get it jelly beans and it's like a bajillion dollars i can't even open this this was okay it tasted like sparkling water to be honest and now we are back we've got some cigarettes we talked about my favorite pixie stix that he absolutely hates for some reason cigarette is not good cigarette is not good it tastes like corn starch yes okay this i know because my grandma used to have these around the house all the time i don't know why my grandma was so obsessed with it they're called charms candy sour balls i don't even remember what it tastes like but i remember seeing this everywhere and then after we ate it all she would clean it out and then put other stuff in here like she would use it wait a minute what i think i know this is this come with like white powders outside the candy boss that's sour and inside sweet wait wait wait give me one oh no the ones we have very similar but they're all coated with the white powder and those powders are so sour and inside sweet it's like our sour altoids back in the day oh god i missed it those are so good we call these just charms candy sour balls and my grandma was obsessed with these had them all over the house i hated these why they're just like not that fun so when you were growing up are you into soft candy or hard candy i feel like i only liked hard candy right but now i hate hard candy i know like now if you give me a lollipop unless it's a tiny dum-dum like you know the little ones that we get at heidi lau i don't really like them and we have this i used to be obsessed with these these are chocolate roses they taste like this one is actually wrinkled but they used to sell these like at most stores and you would just buy chocolate roses is this the one that they give away in high school like you buy one for someone or no i don't know we did v-roches so who do you buy this thing for for like your lover no like your boyfriend did i say i guess or like your girlfriend is it milk chocolate or black chocolate um that looks nasty oh my okay open it whoa oh it's not even dense on the inside that's pretty good oh baby bubble balls these are my freaking favorites i love this so much more than push pops have you ever had a baby bottle pop before i think you have found me this before okay so here's how you do it you take the lid off oh yeah you dip it and then you suck it and dip it again right and then you gotta ah to get the nasty and then you dip it oh my god i am so glad they discontinued or you can even if you're really good oh my god this is so nasty and then you flip it back oh my god and now it's coated in white you put it back on ah this should be illegal and then you put it back in oh my goodness lord have mercy oh my god this usually my favorite so if i do the same thing you just did can you still eat it you know i am a very sanitary person i am a class act i'm a classy person i'm a tumblr these are called cry baby tears and it's extra sour candy i've never had this one before you press here these boxes are just genius it's a teardrop candy so please have one so we're gonna cry yeah i mean i have a really good tolerance for sour stuff though cheers not even shower oh it gets my shower at the end he's crying i've never met someone who makes more sour faces than you this is him being the most dramatic okay this is how he does it ready where are you going oh he's spitting it out this is him every time he takes a sour pouch this is it one sour patch but he likes to look around like are y'all seeing this [ __ ] like it's so sour he's such a drama queen okay next i will let you choose one this big so this is called a big cherry i think there's another chocolate yeah that's a chocolate i hate fruit and chocolate you gotta give it a go i can't do it just bite it it looks like a pile of poo poo do it do it how does it taste mmm do you like it there's nuts in the chocolate yeah that's nasty nuts and fruit actually no the aftertaste is weird it's not terrible but not my not your style okay so this one i'm really intrigued by because look at this packaging it says ice cream it looks like an ice cream there's a cherry on top and it just says twist and lick another one of those wait what seems like they spent a lot of money on the packaging twist oh my gosh it comes out the candy just squeezes out doesn't it it's giving me like tryptophobia okay go ahead push it and then go ahead go ahead go ahead get it get it yeah don't do that i don't know what do you want me to do how to do this i see why this is discontinued i would be really alarmed if i was just walking around and i saw a bunch of people just doing this [ __ ] in public i feel like we're missing something oh oh my gosh oh my god look at this it just all came out whoa here you want me to lick it you don't have to lick it you just taste it did you see that it just bends like jello i thought it was gonna be like hard candy it's some sort of liquid it's some sort of gel it's like hair gel all right let's get rid of this one oh he's trying it that one was wild okay so this one is called boston baked beans i don't know why they like the baked beans i don't know why this is like this one's 25 cents look at it can i see the beans it's not a bean it's a peanut not my fave oh gosh no my favorite off not my favorite it's not bad but i feel like i've had better this is 25 cents really it's not bad i don't know why i feel the need to stick this up my nose but i just feel like it would be the perfect ergonomic structure for such a thing so this one is red green and yellow and it says specialty candy store edition 50 larger wow we're lucky today it looks like they just filled it with the syrup and then waited for it to harden and then just tied the end because i mean it's it just looks like a frosting bag you just pull out the the sword yeah grab the handle and pull you do it you do it pull it out it won't come out what is all this white stuff like literally i was wondering where all this white stuff's coming from taste it while he does that the inappropriate stuff i will be going into a bazooka i don't know how to open this though look at this look at this door you want it or no it tastes like plastic it tastes like plastic now like nothing much tastes like sugary water that's hardened yeah okay so this is called original bazooka it's gum you open it up you take out whoa there's only six in here can you believe it unbelievable maybe that's why you shouldn't have friends because every time you open out your gum case like you take one five friends that's it oh it smells yummy it's hard it's so hard i can't bite into it oh my god my dentist said no you sure you don't want this candy no more i saw you juicing [ __ ] candy that i haven't even done to you i don't want that candy okay all right i need to trash this can you trash this it's not looking good bazooka is probably one of the worst things i've ever had in my life yeah it doesn't matter did you see there's stuff in here i didn't even see that there's inside the packaging there's a cartoon here it says hi pesti hi joe did you get any bites yet no i don't think my worm is really trying fortune you are anxious to achieve something very important you will succeed tell that to a five-year-old this is good it's hard as a rock that's so good i like it how do you like that so we've got a couple more snacks we've got this one which is called scented gum this one looks like it's from the 20s there's so much gum what about this it's juji fruits okay i feel like juicy fruit was taken by the gum so they're like let's do juji it's such a saturated market be careful once it touches your tongue it becomes a parasite these are stuck on your teeth oh look how pretty we've got camo jelly beans made in the usa it says freedom isn't free jelly belly charities will donate 10 cents to support u.s veterans and their families for every one ounce camo bags sold 10 cents every one ounce yeah one of these is 10 minutes which is nice but i just don't like the fact that they put freedom isn't free it kind of ruins the whole like laid back candy aspect where you're just like you know what i'm having a [ __ ] day let me just grab a bag of candy oh freedom's not free [Music] you know it's a little a little sad what is it is this jelly beans again how many jelly beans did i eat today vanilla that one's toasted marshmallow i am good honey i'm good on the beans these are dots they're poppable sheets i love that when you peel it off half of the paper comes with it so you're just eating paper i think maybe that's why i was discontinued don't eat that one let me try to get you a cleaner one nope this one's all paper too yeah let's skip on the eating paper show of today we've got bits and pieces bubble gum so this is from the same makers of hubba bubba i believe it's called bubble bubble america's original bubble bubble and you just press on this press and pull out and then you just it tastes like when you're shampooing your hair and accidentally get some in your mouth you don't like nothing do you i'm sorry i love all of the modern day candies this one is called six let's chocolate candies this one i think is from like the 30s i believe it just comes in this bag it's good oh sugar wow this is called cup of gold does this not look like a giant bc species let's try this there's supposed to be some cream in there do you think reese's pieces copy them oh there's some white stuff in there huh look good i realized maybe the packaging's not that great i think this is supposed to be the same thing it's called mallow cup so is it marshmallow on the inside so far my favorite you know which one's my favorite butter popcorn no there's one thing i find it very fun you find it fun the necklace look no the push pop the punch is your favorite shut up yeah that is not your favorite i'm saying this because he is such a stickler for things like this he thinks they're nasty he thinks this is actually tastes good and it looks so cool this is him right now it looks so cool is it so good that you would keep this one yep okay so this one's called chuckles minis this reminds me of [Applause] sir thank you licorice oh [ __ ] i'm gonna try a different flavor i thought it was gonna be great they're just nasty i was literally about to say i can't imagine paying money for it but then i realized i paid money for it this one right here is called a niece naturally flavored fat-free gluten-free old-fashioned hard candy that's not what i was expecting it to look like just bright red balls whoa did you eat one or two one oh it's a big one oh no there's licorice again why i'm gonna go with this we're gonna have a bubble blowing contest so this is just you know nerds wrote honey do you like nerds bro no but you know what nerd rope is right we had it for a mukbang oh okay i know what it is but now imagine just a stick of gum this is overcome this is all gone eat the whole thing why would they soak up like this what's that [ __ ] [Applause] it's so much [Laughter] oh you could literally knock someone out with it you could honestly you could oh my god you know let's do it i see why that one failed i feel like today is an episode of understanding how candy companies made weird ass products that didn't last the test of time so this one is a butter rum lifesaver i got it because i was like you know what if they have anything in harry potter it would be something like this what is it it's a butter rum flavor ah like butter beer like butter beer right like butter beer oh this is good this reminds something i used to eat kind of caramelly caramel scented chewing gum it's not licorice but i don't know what the fork that is eight pieces chewing gum fragrance that refreshes after eating smoking or drinking it tastes like eating cologne doesn't it taste like when you accidentally spray a perfume and then you walk into it and then you get some in your mouth holy [ __ ] oh my god let's try turtle bites that sounds good oh it's a turtle it's a squirtle what's that just chocolate caramel what the [ __ ] is that is that chocolate pipe is it chocolate or hard candy or soft candy what is that i don't understand it tastes like rubber i don't it's nasty dude i don't know what it is but i do yeah let's see the princess candy oh they're jelly beans oh my gosh how many jelly i'm so done with jelly beans how many jelly beans have you consumed today which princess did you have it's actually just berry blue basically this one is called cherry mash didn't we have a cherry thing earlier i guess the 20s were full of cherries would you like to try not good not good lucky so this is called turkish taffy here's the issue the paper is stuck wow it looks like the things like stop signs are made out of ready let me see straight up don't do that i'm trying to smack it it's so sticky it's like a banana laffy taffy the worst flavor of fluffy puffies this one's called a curly whirly there's um no information about what that might be is it chocolate is it gum we don't know how much did you spend on these candies yeah give this video a thumbs up for my stupidity the curly welly was weird all of these are um getting a little bit weird at this point so we're going to try a mamba what is that will you open that another gum i don't know what any of these are this is called a chicko stick this is crunchy peanut butter rolled in toasted coconut what does that mean i want to try it that sounds kind of fascinating that's inappropriate this is so good no kidding right this might be one of my favorites [Music] i hate it i'm so sorry i think that's gonna be it okay honestly besides maybe like four of these i realized why the rest didn't do so hot or maybe times were different back then you know i will say though everything's not as sweet as candy today which maybe is something right a lot of jelly beans yeah like nothing's like crazy sweet nothing's crazy sour nothing's like crazy chocolatey like there's a lot of chocolatey stuff but i don't feel like it's as like crazy as these days no what if this year halloween candy this is the way you give out actually there's no trick or treat so yeah but if i did i would assume that our house would get egged almost immediately the parents oh my god remember give it to me and they'll be like do you want to come over for dinner one day we can reminisce about the old days and i'll be like hey nobody got time for that all of our neighbors are relatively old so we would fit right in do you think our neighbor would remember a lot of these oh yeah that's really messed up that yeah first of all all right guys that's gonna be it for today's video i hope you guys enjoyed let me know in the comments what are your thoughts on all of this candy have you guys tried any of this candy would you try any of this candy and i hope you guys enjoyed and i'll see you guys tomorrow", "OYewTazNJgg": "today's video is sponsored by Ray Khan in today's video we are back with our cotton candy machine to see if we can try something new cotton candy rope [Music] [Applause] and I think we've had a lot of people ask about this we've made a bunch of stuff with cotton candy done a bunch of experiments with cotton candy and we've also done a bunch of experiments making rope out of weird things and so since a while ago people started putting together like hey maybe they could make rope out of cotton candy I think we've hit like a critical mass if people ask me if we can make rope out of cotton candy so we're gonna try it we're gonna give this a shot we've got a lot of cotton candy supplies here so many we're just gonna use the normal cotton candy sugar nothing fancy nothing weird not throwing any different types of candies in here and we're just gonna try making you know the longest bits we can twisting it down into sort of a cord and then see if we can twist those cords into rope we'll see what it takes to actually get some kind of strength out of this I kind of want to try and see if I can not necessarily knit but I might try and like macrame a scarf for myself out of cotton candy this is gonna be real messy Oh studio is not gonna survive this [Music] were you feeling that your body had gone too long without cotton candy it was it was really it was starting to feel the cotton candy depletion it's curious if it's like a self-correcting problem eventually making his own cotton candy for us like a little ball our last cotton candy machine had been used for entirely too many things that were not cotton candy good yeah and it wasn't working very well so we got a new one Arthur hopefully it works better let's just start making cotton candy here we go no no turn on all the buttons this machine comes with a music button apparently doe a deer from The Sound of Music is perfect cotton candy making music yeah enough of that I refuse to make cotton candy Bob well then I'm just gonna make cotton candy and you can go ahead and refuse possibly want this ah I was dancing you threw off my groove you do off my groove but look at this big beautiful fluffy cotton candy that's not in horrible ropes well we wanted ropes but it was strings wonderful all right guys at this point we're gonna do the thing that we do so often time for a montage everyone knows a good montage needs some music and providing our music today rake on earbuds rake on earbuds started about half the price of any other premium wireless earbud the newest model the everyday e 25 earbuds are the best ones yet they provide up to six hours of play time seamless bluetooth pairing and even though the housing is smaller the base is stronger the newer smaller design gives a nice noise isolating fit and they come in a lot of fun colors these earbuds come with this nice small carrying case that can charge your earbuds four times on a single charge as you can see they are completely wireless there's no anything wrapping around my ear there's no stems hanging down there's nothing that was going around behind my neck it all just fits right on your ear I tried these out for awhile and I was very impressed I was using them for music I was using him to watch TV shows and I answered a phone call while I was using them and the person on the other end of the line I actually asked because I was testing them out and said like how is the sound he said he didn't even realize that I wasn't just holding the phone up to my head so apparently they worked pretty dang good for calls and I was able to hear him very well as well right now our

need and that is exactly how long I needed it [Music] we can get three pieces this length I can macrame all right so a few things I'm observing is like go I am by no means a professional yarn maker when I was little I read a book from book series by Tamora Pierce called the circle of magic where people had magical gifts in everyday items and one of them was able to sort of weave magic into her weavings and her her yarn pulling there's a couple of other different parts of it in the song of the song the lioness I think anyways small Pierce made wonderful books people learned how to do everyday things a couple of people learned how to weave and how to do yarn making I made my own drop spindle and I never looked back so a couple of things I'm noticing from that experience is this stuff is coming out of the machine nearly pre carded what that means is when you get wool you have to have it cleaned and then it'll be you know kind of lumpy so you take two brushes very fine fine combed brushes and you brush you brush the fibers in whatever direction you need them to go so that they're all smooth and uniform that's almost what this looks like and that makes it very very easy for me to wind all of this together [Music] not adding small pieces of carded cotton candy as I go I'm just making big strands of it so kind of breaking all the rules but you know what I changed their mind no I'm not breaking any rule I might be the first human to ever attempt this these are my rules now [Music] grandmama it's me and stage [Music] we've got seven different cords here I'm gonna try twisting three of them into something of a rope Kelly's got her macrame thing she's gonna try and we're gonna see if any of them can hold together long enough to even be completed let's discuss the tensile strength real quick because it's falling apart very little I think we've now discussed it so nate is working on making one of the conventional ropes you normally see us make on this channel I'm gonna attempt macrame macrame is when you sort of weave together a bunch of strings or ropes or whatever and you get a pretty pattern now I want to explain why we're doing this by hand instead of using the Rope machine that's pretty basic this would all fall apart instantly if we tried to put it on the Rope machine so 100% so bad just so bad nate is winding things together I am time not after not after not if it works I like knowing that I do things that I'm pretty sure no one else in the world has ever done before here's the biggest difficulty normally when you're making your Opie want it to go really tight to hold itself together here's just a piece of this if we try and tighten it beyond right about there fibers are starting to break apart and it just tears right through so there's a real limit to how much you can twist this to tighten it down and that limit is not high I did it I'm not gonna cry not gonna cry but I made maxima cotton candy I didn't say it was good macrame cotton candy but guys I just wove cotton candy into every summer camps friendship bracelets that's ever existed and it broke fishing scale mm-hmm we're going to see how much weight we can put on our cotton candy rope before it breaks okay first a single strand ready [Music] we hit 15 ounces that's almost a pound it's a guppy we kind of caught a guppy almost one peso we might get up to like three pounds let's try the Macra man all right ready ready come on I saw two pounds eight ounces that's two and a half two and a half pounds two pounds this macrame cotton candy rope that's probably about two pounds more than I thought yay there we go three pounds three point that was three pounds 12 ounces oh that one only got to one pound 12 ounces so that was a weak point all right so in terms of strength we got up to three pounds 12 ounces that is three and three-quarters of a pound in terms of taste how would you rate this compared to say sisal rope or hemp rope or nylon rope no I'm not great sisal okay hemp rope I mean it gets stuck in your teeth I think this is probably your best go to snacking rope yeah oh my teeth that is how we end the video thanks again to recon for sponsoring

to check our most recent video and we'll see in the next one talk to you then [Music]", "mAZXWAuWp6E": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys welcome back today I'm gonna be showing you guys how to make nerd ropes here's what you're going to need two boxes of nerds one cup of gummy bears and some tincture the first step is to fold some foil in an accordion shape and spread it along a baking sheet then you can pour your Nerds into each fold of the tin foil make sure you have enough because if you don't the gummy make sure we'll stick to the tin foil and it'll be harder to take them out after then you'll melt you're going bears in the microwave for about 40 seconds and if you like add 1 tablespoon of ginger and stir it in I'm gonna be pouring my gummy mixture into a squeeze bottle so it'll be easier to dispense be careful not to pour too much just like I did on that first one take it slow and just do a thin line now you can top the ropes with some more nerds once they've all been filled squish the tinfoil together to make them into a tighter more compact shape then put them into the fridge or freezer I still had some remaining mixture left and instead of making more ropes I'm just gonna make some little nerd bytes by using a mold that I had on hand I also added some more nerds on top before I put them into the fridge once they've solidified in the fridge or freezer shake off the excess nerds into a bowl and then peel them off the tinfoil now some of mine came off okay but some of them I had a little more difficulty with so I decided to leave them out for about 24 hours outside of the fridge or the freezer so that they could dry out a little bit more which made them a lot easier to peel off the nerd bites in the silicone mold came out really easily after letting them sit in the freezer for about an hour [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you guys they turned out so beautifully it did take an extra day for them to drive because they were sticking to the tinfoil but after I let them dry they turned out absolutely wonderful just make sure you put enough nerds on the bottom part of the tinfoil so that you're not having issues with the going mixture sticking I can't believe how fantastic they all came out I'm so excited and they're so delicious because I have already tried some and the little bites are so few I love them so much I could have made more ropes but I kind of liked having these little ones if you just grab I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you to the person who requested me to make this video because I'm absolutely in love with these and I'll be definitely making them again thank you guys so much for watching I hope you try these out have a wonderful day", "n_gb9aO70X8": "Hey guys!

last week and now one police chief wants to warn parents that these marijuana infused treats could easily be confused by kids for the real thing Marcus solace has a story police admit it wasn't the arrest of the century an alleged low-level marijuana dealer busted in Tarrytown this week but it's more than buds that were seized there's THC in liquid form attachments for e-cigarettes and what's most troubling for the police chief edibles in the form of gummy candy I feel very strong that there is no need to put it in the form of something that's very attractive all to young children Chief John barber Len says the issue isn't whether recreational use of marijuana should be legal in New York as it is in several states and most recently in Canada his concern is the marketing of certain products containing THC there's two issues here hey is it an attraction to younger people that really shouldn't be making that decision and B what is the possibility of accidental exposure the chief points to a Journal of the American Medical Association study that found in Colorado the number of children hospitalized due to accidental exposure jumped 34% so could the sugary stuff be mistaken for something harder the similarities are striking down to the same shape and coloring of the products so if I was to put this on my counter with my ten-year-old daughter home what's to say she's not gonna pick it up and he didn't think it's a gummy worm from CBS who was to say the difference a difference he says parents should be aware of", "b8gcuTBAlm8": "how's it going ladies and gentlemen it's Mike from pokey tips and today I'm going to be teaching you all about candy in Pokemon let's go Pikachu and let's go Eevee candies are a new item in the main series Pokemon games and they let you make your Pokemon very strong by using candies you could add up to 200 in every single stat on your Pokemon so you could just imagine how powerful those attacks will be want to use candies and the craziest thing is if you use the right candies you could do this from a very low level so this level 5 knitter on I have on the screen has sets like a level 100 inner end but it's only level 5 warning if you're planning on using these stat boosts online you can but you have to choose the ruleset no restrictions for battles if you choose standard rules all of your Pokemon are gonna be reset back to normal for just online play and if you're planning on using a low-level Pokemon online well it's probably gonna get destroyed by a Mewtwo if you've played some of the older Pokemon games you might be familiar with the word Eevee or effort values the candy system in these games replaces the effort value system and instead of v's it's now called a V's or awakening value and let's go Pikachu an Eevee there are 4 different types of candy three of them are generic so you have a regular candy a large candy and an extra large candy there's a regular candy large candy and extra-large candy for each stat in Pokemon so health candy raises your pokemons HP mighty candy is for attack tough candy is for defense smart candy is for special attack courage candy is for special defense and quick candy is for speed regular candies can be used on a Pokemon of any level and when you start using them you can use them all the way until your Pokemon gets 50 additional stats or 50 AV points after you do that you won't be able to use any more of the regular candies for that one specific stat but you'll have to start using large candies now large candies you could only use after your Pokemon is at least level 30 and then you could use it to get your pokemons Xavi's or that one specific stat all the way up to 100 bonus points and then just like the large candy the extra-large candy also has a level requirements you need to get up to at least level 60 to use that one and then from that point when you're using the extra-large candies you could finally max out your pokemons stats and get it all the way up to 200 bonus points in that one specific stat so for example let's say I have a level 87 Dragonite and I want to use the mighty candies to maximize its attack first I'll use the regular mighty candy to increase its attack points by 50 once I get it up to 50 the game won't let me use any more regular mighty candies on it and I'll have to go ahead and start using the large mighty candies I could use the large mighty candies to get it up to 100 bonus points an attack and then finally I could use the extra large candies from 100 to get it up to the maximum of 200 bonus points in attack from there if I want to I could use the other four candies to maximize all of its other stats doing the exact same thing it takes 426 regular candies to bring your pokemons a V bonus points from zero to 50 then after that another 168 large candies to bring it from 50 to 100 and finally to bring it from 100 to 200 bonus points you'll need to have 445 of the extra large candies now if you really want to you could just skip using the regular and then the large candies and jump right ahead to using the extra large candies and it's only gonna cost you 100 more candies however extra large candies are more rare than the large and the regular candies so if you have a whole bunch of them it wouldn't hurt just to use the regular candies first then the large then the extra-large now like I said before there is one very special candy the species or Pokemon specific candy first off we'll use a species specific candy you can use it on the Pokemon and it will raise all of its stats at the same time not just one so let's say I have chancy and I want to raise all of its stats at the same time if I have a chancy candy I could just use it on chancy and boom it'll have a plus one in every single stat second you could use these species specific candies 200 times you don't have to use any other candies with this you can bring your pokemon stats all the way up to 2 in every stat just by using its specific candy and then finally if you have a Pokemon specific candy you can use that candy on that Pokemon at any level that means you don't have to wait all the way up to level 60 to use a certain type of candy on it you can max all of its stats at the lowest level possible by doing this I was able to get that knitter n that I showed you earlier those crazy stats at such a low level so if you can get 200 of them the best way to use these candies on your Pokemon is by using the species specific candy so you can max out all of its stats at the same time and not have to use each different specific candy like mighty candy or speed candy to raise its stats one at a time alright so now that we know all about Candy's why they're so good and why you want to use them how do we get candy first off the most simple way to get candy is by catching pok\u00e9mon whenever you catch a wild pokemon it has a chance of giving you candy generally correlating to what that pokemons main strength would be I'll have a full list of what pokemon drops what candy down in the description below but generally if I'm hunting for a specific type of candy there's six Pokemon that I'll go to because they're easy to catch and you can get lots of candy by catching them a whole bunch for health candies I like to hunt for Caterpie in Viridian Forest mighty candies I'll be heading over to route 22 to find Mitterrand mail tuff candies Geodude and mountain moon smart candies Psyduck on route 6 courage candy drowsy on route 11 and quick candy we're going back to Viridian Forest to find some wheedle these six Pokemon are great for getting those six generic candies but I would always much rather prefer having the Pokemon specific candy because once again you could use the Pokemon specific candy and it'll raise every single one of that Pokemon stats at the same time so if the Pokemon you want to use candies on is easy to catch in the wild and easy to chain I would much rather go for that then use generic candies on it while Pokemon are much more likely to give you more candy if a you've caught a lot of them already and then B you have a really high catch rate and multiplier so like always go for those excellent throws get that combo bonus and go for the joy Grips synchronized bonus that i talked about in one of my previous videos for shiny hunting but if you haven't seen that video I'll go over that method very quickly when you play let's go Pikachu and Eevee with two players and you both throw the pokeball at the same time when you're trying to catch a wild pokemon after capturing it you'll get a bonus multiplier for having two throws at the same time called the synchronized bonus when you bought your Nintendo switch it should have came with an accessory called the joy con grip if you activate your second player in the game by shaking the second joy con and put both of the controllers in the joy con grip when you throw your pokeball and it'll throw both of them at the same time and you'll basically always be able to get that synchronized bonus without actually having a second person there throwing the pokeball with you other than catching pok\u00e9mon there's a few other ways you could also get candy in this game one easy way is by transferring Pokemon you've already caught to the professor by going in your box selecting the Pokemon and pressing the send to professor icon when you send Pokemon to Professor rope you could get candy from doing that but just be warned when you send them away to the professor they're done forever and you can never get them back so make sure if you're sending things away it's something you don't care about also something cool I noticed is if you try to send the shiny pokemon to Professor Oak the game will ask you if you're sure that you want to do that because I can imagine how many people would accidentally transfer their shinies I'm really glad this check is in the game you can also play mini-games with your Pokemon in go parks to earn some additional candies and I'm sure there's a few more ways in the game that I'm not aware of right now so if you know any extra ways to get candy let us all know about them in the comment section down below something that I didn't mention earlier you can actually mix and match candies if you really want to so for example let's say you want to use candies on a Pikachu if you really wanted to you could use one Pikachu candy to raise all of its stats then use some regular health candies and then some health candy extra larges and then some quick candies but I wouldn't recommend doing that because it can get very confusing very fast remembering what candy you've used on your pokemon and how many more you have to go also one last little bonus you might have noticed that when you've leveled up your Pokemon before you'll see it golden little +1 next to the stack that little +1 is actually an awakening value like a explaining in this video and basically it's totally random you have no control over it nothing you do influences it it's just totally random so if your Pokemon got a few of those when it leveled up you'll actually need a few less candies to fully max out your pokemons stats alright my friends and that's gonna end this video on candy in Pokemon let's go Pikachu and Eevee I hope this video helped you out and if it did please help me out by giving this video a big thumbs up because it did take quite some time to make thanks again for watching and I'll be seeing you in the next one [Music] you [Music]", "H_vVwcXn3Q0": "oh what's up easy bakers so today i'm going to be showing you guys how to make your own diy infused nerd ropes so if you haven't already follow me on instagram at daverny freeman i will be doing some giveaways so you want to follow me on instagram that's where i announce all of my giveaways and if you want to be a young young young young guy go ahead and hit that subscribe button and the notification bell so let's jump into the video so this is everything you're going to need you're going to need some heavy duty aluminum foil it doesn't really have to be that heavy duty you can go get the 99 cent one whatever fits your grip baby so i'm gonna use some aluminum foil and with my aluminum foil i'm just gonna place them on a flat uh surface and you you will be putting this inside the refrigerator so boom pow now what i'm going to do is i like to create my own little mold i don't know if you guys want to go on amazon to see if they have these molds but i know a lot of people were saying they could not find any nerve rope mold so you really have to do them by hand so this is what i'm doing now i'm just making my own little molds which is just popping the aluminum foil up a little bit so it can have this barrier in between the two i'm doing that on each side so that's what i'll be doing right now [Music] and you guys do want to be careful when you're making your little liners because this is aluminum foil and it's easy to kind of tear through them [Music] so you guys i prefer to reuse these package this the packaging that comes with it so i ain't i'm not gonna buy normal packaging y'all don't play with me we're just gonna reuse these packaging what you do is you take where it's sealed all at either end of the rope and you kind of open it up like you will a bag of chips it's very easy to tear so you do want to take your time to open up the seal and once you open it up there should be a like a little cardboard against against the seal and you put your fingers in between the cardboard and the foil and you gently slide your fingers down in order to tear the packaging apart so that's what i do i do that then i set it aside and i take some nerds now this i do this all the time so i have additional nerve ropes and nerves in there and i like to take the nerves off of the rope which is very easy um so i don't have to buy a thousand boxes of nerve ropes yeah i mean i'm nerves when i could just use this now that you have separated your gummies from the nerves you're going to place them in a heat safe microwave safe bowl and place them in a small one i do recommend doing small batches at a time because if you do so many it's going to be kind of hard to control it so now you want to take your infused coconut oil i like to use liquid coconut oil instead of the coconut oil that goes back to solid and you want to use your tincture i'm using my eva clear tincture that i already infused with your cbd and they're going additional box of nurse just in case i need them but i don't feel like i will it's just whatever floats my boat and you also want to get yourself some type of piping bag or you can get a a condiment um container i think a ziploc bag is cheaper well not really cheaper but it's it works for me and i do reuse these so it's not like i throw them away because i know i hate plastic now i'm taking my coconut oil and i'm just coating this ziploc bag with the coconut oil if you do not want to use your infused coconut oil you can definitely use pam to coat this bat this ziploc bag but i'm saying if you're going to infuse something why not have everything be infused you get what i'm saying you're going to share but yeah so i'm going to do that and i'm also gonna do the same thing to my aluminum layers that i made my little molds because if you do not it will stick i don't care what anyone says in my i've been making these for forever in a day and they will stick if you put them in the freezer you put them in the refrigerator you will have pieces of aluminum stuck to your gummy now you looking at like a food like you're in third grade with goat with with aluminum foil in your mouth like it goes so yeah that's what you want to do just make sure everything is evenly coated then move on to the next step [Music] all right you guys so to my two rope gummies and six additional gummy bears i add half a tablespoon of infused coconut oil just to give you guys some type of starting point but this is definitely a trial and error type of situation so as you guys i have my tincture right here and i'm going to use five milliliters which is a teaspoon of t-shirt and i'm placing it to the side in a condiment disposable condiment container because i wanted to be you know on hand and you guys also saw that i had my liquid lecithin next to me just in case i'm going to need that as well so you want to take your rubber spatula or you can use anything that you're going to throw away i like to use this silicone rubber spatula because i could just wash it off and reuse it now i'm making sure that everything is evenly coated and i'm going to put this in a microwave for 10 seconds and it's going to look like this now i'm just stirring this around to make sure that my oil and gummies are combining together i microwave it again bring it back out stir it around and as you guys can see a little bit you see how they're the gummies in the oil is not coming together so what i'm doing is just trying to stir it a little faster and a little harder just putting a little bit of elbow grease into it to see if it's going to combine together and once it does as much as i would like for it to at this point i'm going to add my tincture to this i only add a half of the teaspoon into this at this time because you can always add more you really can't take it away so that's why it's super important to do this in small batches so you won't gotta worry about anything but as you guys can see the oil really did combine well with this so now i'm going to go ahead and add that t-shirt and do the same steps stir it around kind of be careful because it will splat it out okay y'all see what i'm saying i told y'all it'll splat out and that's nothing but my tincture splatting out honey that's why i'm like uh um let me let me try to put you back on in there girl then i'm stirring it around again just just to make sure that it is fully incorporated because if you do not do this you will have it will be set like oil and vinegar separate yeah this that's exactly what this will be baby your gummies will be to the right and your tincture will be to the left so you want to definitely make sure that it's fully incorporated microwave it again then you're going to place it in your ziploc bag or your piping bag remember this ziploc bag is already all uh down so i'm trying to give you guys a good angle but this is hot girl i'm like oh i'm about to stop the camera this is hot so you want to go ahead and pour that into there i use i try to use my rubber spatula to get the rest of it out but do what you can because it will kind of become you know it'll cool down a little fast so you will be working very quickly boo boo so once you get that together you're going to just whatever side you're going to cut it out you're going to cut it away from your workspace okay i cut it on the ground so you're going to cut it away from your workspace line a little bit of nerves just a little bit unless you want it real thick to the bottom of this pan and we're going to pipe on our gummies [Music] [Music] so you guys i am starting off with a thin layer i like to use at least when it when i like to make beans nerd robes i'm showing you guys how to make one and a half so with the measurements and things that i will put in the description box to my preference it makes one long nerd rope and kind of like um a quarter of one as well so what i'm doing now is i'm just going ahead and piping out my gummies and once i get done piping out the gummies i'm gonna take some additional nerd rope and sprinkle them on top of the gummies so they can have gummies on both sides i um really do this as a preference when it comes to how many nerds i'm actually putting on the rope so like i said this is really trial and error for some people you guys gonna have to figure out what what you like and what works best for you [Music] so all of those nerd roasts that you put on the side or if you're using a new box you're just going to go ahead and sprinkle as many nerves on this as you want to help you out you kind of want to make sure that all of the gummy is covered and go to your next step [Music] so [Music] all right so now you want to just go ahead and put your nerd roads in the refrigerator for several hours and once they harden up you're going to come back to them [Music] all right so now that it's been several hours i'm going to get my packaging my flat irons i don't use them on my head but i should use them for this okay and i get my nerd rose as you guys can see that it was covered up so you don't have to worry about anything getting on them [Music] now this is why it's super important to spray down that aluminum foil you guys see how easy they're coming out of here i'm definitely being gentle because i don't feel like anything cracking breaking or anything like that or in between boo-boos so you see how easy they're coming out but i'm just plopping them out ever so gently and now once i plop them out i'm going to put them on the cardboard that every nerd rope come with and i'm just going to place it on there and we're going to go ahead and package them so that's just what i like to do [Music] so now what we're going to do is i put them on my cardboard liners i'm going to flip them over so that the cardboard is facing up and i'm going to get the two ends of oh sorry you guys then we're going to get the two ends of the aluminum foil kind of put them together where where nestle had the glue already there so i'm just going to line them up as even as i can and we're going to heat seal them with our flat irons with my flat iron they go from like a one to a five and i believe i have them on a a two maybe a three i just want them to get hot enough so when my hand touch it my hand is not burning and i can kind of just like close it all together so heat sealing something together is really really easy you guys and that's just pretty much it you just heat seal them together and you will be all done with your diy infused nerve bros thank you guys so much for watching this video if you guys want to see any other type of infusion definitely put a comment down below and i really do appreciate you for watching this video i it means a so much so here go the little small ones that i did as well now this one i'm going to just do the same thing that i did with the longer one i'm just going to cut the nerd box so it fits this size you know what i'm saying so or you could just put them in your odorless airtight containers but you guys see how i have the little miniature one right there in front and that's pretty much all you do sorry for the noise you guys brandi and devin are outside playing tug of war with a stick yeah yeah yeah talk to you guys on my net video", "9N73Jwzco0w": "how to make 12g candy canes Candy Cane Production Line video", "BlBvFmJTDZo": "all right today we're going to repair a broken rope on a still owe to five to get started we've got to remove the starter cover there's four bolts important not to lose the bolts this starter cover slides out and here you can see what we're going to be accessing today and now we're going to remove the old rope from start of recoil pulley little pair of needlenose pulls out now we are not going to take apart anything inside the internal components we're going to leave that in place use the what's existing so we'll set this down we're going to get our new rope measure out and we're going to get the rope okay now that our rope is sin we're ready to go ahead and insert it through the starter pulley hole line up here with the hole on the recoil candy to have the needle nosed and there you have it what you want to do is go ahead and tie a small knot on the rope that's gonna basically not it you're going to put it in this little hole here so we'll tie that real small knot in your make sure you pull tight and then you're gonna pull that groove notice this is the area it's going and then you can use your needle nose to push it down you want to make sure it's pushed in all the way like so now that we have that push down we're going to take this into the rope insert through the bottom of the handle slide it through same as before we're going to tie it small knot at the top now that our rope is installed at both ends we're going to slide it through all the way the inside of the cover now that it's pulled tight we use the thumb to hold it in place right here and then we want to go clockwise and wind up the pulley and then once it is tight use your thumb hold the pulley pull the rope through nice and tight and release good to go now we're going to reinstall starter cover to the stock this little panel goes there everything's lined back up so it's important not to lose the bolts you don't want to over tighten the bolts if you're ever using the drill because this is plastic either break it or strip it what we just completed was repairing the handles rope that connects to the starter recoil pulley it's been repaired you're ready to go cut a

I get started with the video I just want to unbox something that I received from YouTube it's just insane to think that I got 100,000 subscribers and I received an award from YouTube I mean I'm at 400,000 now which is even more crazy which is like four times more Plex than this one that I have right now so here is the Box I'm not gonna show you the other side cuz that's my address I don't wanna get exposed just yet you should put it to the side and take it out of the box so as you can see here let me just grab it again [Music] a plaque from YouTube so let me go ahead and take it out of the box a nice new black box I don't think the other ones came with the black box but you know I don't watch that many plaque unboxing videos we put this box to the side and most of you know that I received this from Twitter I do post a lot of things on Twitter and snapchat so if you haven't already followed me on Twitter make sure to do that I'm not like 15k followers so if I get to 20k that'll be amazing so please follow me on Twitter and add me on snapchat if you want to get in contact with me I open up my snapchats pretty often so make sure to follow me on there and first thing we do when we open it is let me go ahead and so here it is right here you get a nice little letter I'm not gonna read it right now because obviously if you have watched unboxing videos from other youtubers of them opening their plaques that's what you receive so let me put the camera back so yeah let's go ahead and open up so here's the letter at the top and now alright I need to I need to show you guys this alrighty sorry for the lighting I'm in my closet if you haven't noticed so let me take this off let's get our first reaction oh my gosh that is so sick the new play button the hundred K plaque was changed a little bit from the old 100 k plaque because like I think the font is a little bit different so let's go ahead and show you guys again just how amazing this thing looks so let me go ahead and get a nice you can see the cameras down alright there is the 100 K plaque so let's go ahead and take it out of its wrapping here or whatever you call it let's just try to take it out I mean I it's kind of hard it's like stuck in here there it is the 100,000 subscriber plaque you can see my camera ooh so yeah the plaque is just amazing guys I cannot thank you guys enough for this crazy support looking at this plaque will just motivate me to keep going and letting me know that actually did something right and I got this award because without me not giving up on YouTube when my chin was dead I just kept going and kept going so that's a little motivation for you guys if you are not firing YouTube if you have 50 subscribers or something just keep going if you know what to do because some people don't know how to make videos but if you know what you're doing just keep going just spend that two hours of your day to grind out YouTube and that's what you get these crazy awards from YouTube so yeah this plaque is just amazing I'm probably gonna hang it on my wall right now so let's go ahead and start hanging on the wall so let me get I don't like closet cuz this is where the all right so I'm thinking of hanging this bad boy somewhere right here so let's go ahead and get so actually no right here it looks way better yeah let's please stop right there so let me go ahead and get some thumbtacks or whatever I can and I'll be right back all right well I couldn't find any thumbtacks or like something to put it onto the wall doman no I'm pretty cool hanging on my wall right here I'm the only one filming so I can't really get a film guy but I'm gonna put it right over here for now temporary and I don't have a setup yeah that's kind of weird since I have like 400,000 subscribers without a setup so my setup is literally this and me sitting on the floor or on my bed just recording so if you guys are saying I don't have a good setup so I can do YouTube well all I have is a laptop and I sit there with a microphone that I have so yeah if you didn't know what microphone or you were wondering what microphone I had I actually have a sort of the lights here it blue Yeti right here so it's gonna go right here a little bit it's with a pop filter as well just on top to make it sound a lot more crisp and this is where the box I'm gonna put everything actually back in the box let me put everything there any quick and it was actually written and signed by the CEO of YouTube which is like if you don't know what a CEO is basically like the main person of YouTube so that's pretty well not just YouTube like anything so it's pretty crazy let's put the box somewhere over here right below it and when I get my room fully like set up and stuff I will be

hey before I forget I just want to remind you guys the next Sunday is daylight savings times and there's also supposed to be a solar eclipse that day November 3rd mark your calendars alright okay man no I understand this is like there's one ladybug on my wall right there there's one on my camera right now and there was one in the house just before I came out here the only ones I've seen all summer and spring or fall whatever kind of interesting wonder what that means all right so here's the plan I'm going to taking this cover off which houses this cable which runs around to the other side to the compression release which is actually right there so when you pull on it it looks like that it just just flips like that real quick and alright now I'm not doing it so it's making it a real barrier to start so I'm gonna take those bolts out there and see if I can't finesse it back to where it's supposed to be okay well that's what it looks like when you get it out of there and it's got the little bitty screws to go around and hold this thing on here which they were just about stripped they were a bear to get out and then I want to pull this up out of here if I remember right we had a little tricking us with that goodness well bugger just doesn't lock it out it's coming but it doesn't want you and this is the end that pulls that release and this is the spring let's see it here back you see it coiled up in here and it is still in there the way we put it in there which we didn't know how it went so we just stuffed it in there any way we could get it out of the way so we could get going but that's incorrect I got to pull that out of there and get it straightened up because all wrapped up on itself it's two ways it can go this is the spring itself it can either go like that or like that and one way is right the other way will not work so I got to figure that out what it does is it catches on this rascal it just lays in here like that and it has your cable the end attached to it and the spring comes up through that slot and catches the groove in this thing and when you pull it it pulls this slider which I have in there backwards anyway let me give you the brief idea now I'm going to sort out all the details for myself okay that little finger stick through that slot right there and your cable is pulling on this thing but when you go to pull start it it catches on that and this spring twists and pulls that and then when it gets up to the end here it releases that lets it fall back down like it just did and then it comes back and re engages itself so the next time you pull it it does it again see how it's doing that well that would be the right way to do it so and I found out also it just wraps around this outer ring here and I guess it catches on these little nubbins down in there okay I'm going to quit trying to explain to you stuff I don't know anything about and see if I can make it work so we'll see I'm going to put it back together as best I can give it a try well guys I have been monkeying around with this thing for hours just spring this inside here is supposed to catch inside that slot like I was telling you and I can make it do that however the other end needs to catch in here and I can't get do that it looks like it'd be easy right but that's winding it up tighter and when you get it all in place there you can't do that because there's no room for it to go tighter has to go bigger which means has come this way and I get it all together and I try it and it won't recoil and it doesn't pull the cable and so I take it back apart I've been monkeying with this thing for well I had a little well I had a little distraction in the middle of all that had hollered at me and said the hot-water heater was blowing water out of the top of it so I had to stop and look at that and our pressure relief valve had gone bad and so we had to shut the water off to the house and turn the pilot light off and purge out the hot water and fetch a new Popoff valve I got a new drain valve while I was at it and I had to replumb all that so anyway got that done and now I'm back on this again and and yeah I didn't make any videos of that because I was just in you know when your house starts flooding thankfully there's a drain system all around the basement this little trough goes all the way around the walls of the basement and the water runs into it and it goes over the corner to the main drain which goes into the septic lines that run off into the city water power plant or wastewater system any right but you know saying when your basement starts flooding you kind of forget to grab your camera right so what I don't think it happened is I think when Steve and I were fooling with this out in the field I think it what we did is we actually got it wrapped inside itself like I don't know if you can see what I'm doing there but taking it back through itself and getting these ends to where they come up on the opposite sides I think might be I don't know I'm going to try that I'm going to try to weave it back to yourself which I just did while I was talking and see if I can't get it to go back in here because that's what's happening that bottom one is not catching in that lip and so it just wants to spin around and around and around and it's not working so I'm trying to fish this back in there one more time here I mean it looks well it doesn't look that easy actually it's a mousetrap yes but yes that looks like that did it it took me a while to think that you know why won't that go in there but I think yes it looks like it'll work now all right so give me a minute put this back together hopefully we're going to have success all right if you can see the end of this cable when I pull it let's see how it pulls that in that's what it's supposed to do however it still is not correct because it's making funny noises it's not acting smooth yeah I don't have that screwed down with the cover on this cover will go on here and then screw down and hold it in place and keep that part from spinning but I really don't want to put those screws in there until I know I got it right cuz they I spend all my time taking the screws in and out instead of actually fixing the problem here that was not right something's still not right I got to keep monkeying with it now that this is going to be a quick deal this is wearing me out I went ahead and put screws in it just to see it seems to be working the cable hesitates just for a spit sick and right it the first of the pool and then it does what it's supposed to so I'm going to put it back on the machine see if it'll work you know I got nothing to lose and I am running out of daylight so let's see what happens okay I'll set you down here you can see this is the decompression arm right here and when I pull on that rope you should see that thing flip should being a keyword there well apparently that work done yeaaaaah yeaaaaah now I'm glad of that goes that that bugging me ever since that happened let me show you something and turn that off of them I'm gonna ride or anything right now smells rich thanks to chokes that wrong box yeah I got a package today from UPS from northern tools I got you know when you buy tools from them they ask you to build an account and you end up putting your email address and stuff like that in there and the next thing you know there we go not great rattling that thing next thing you know you're getting emails from them and they're telling you all about their sales well you know it's like going to the candy store you always look you know I see something you want it don't really need but this time they had something that I really did need and the price well I just couldn't beat it and this is just for all my machines I have sitting outside over there collecting rainwater and crap I got some tarps man don't you dig it ain't foot by 10 foot standard duty lightweight cheap tarps you know but I didn't want these machines sitting out in the winter again they did that last year it's not good for them and every time it rains I think aw man there goes my nuts and bolts they're all getting resident they had these on sale here's the here's the story I got five of them okay the story hey guys I was just in the house putting this movie together and I realize I lost the footage where I was going to tell you that story about what happened so I decided to stop what I was doing to come outside here and shoot this little clip and took it fill you in on the rest of the story what happened was I ordered them they were on sale on a one day sale for 250 apiece they were normally like four bucks or something which is not a great savings but some enough to make it worth my while to go ahead and get them right now you know which I've been wanting to do that for a long time anyway so anyway it said calculate shipping so I typed in my zip code and hit calculate and it said ah we can't do that right now call us and gave me there a header number then it gave me the option to go ahead and place the order and instead that it would not charge my credit card until they emailed me the following day and told me how much is shipping would be and I can authorize the transaction well that's fair so cool I'll go ahead and do it because it's a one day sale I didn't want to miss that boat and so I went in process the order well the next day I didn't get an email and I was kind of like why I was weird really screwing up you know and then the next day I did get an email and it said your package is shipped I was like wait a minute what the so I went over there and I looked at my bank and see how much they draft it out of there and they just took the 250 apiece plus the tax they didn't take anything extra well that's weird so I went back to Northern Tool on my account and pulled up that order and they just charged me the 250 piece plus tax and nothing else and it still said to be determined on the shipping I thought well this is weird well it's been several days now and I actually received them as you know and still nothing has come from that I would never was advised so how much the shipping was going to be so I guess is just gratis you know it's like well cool you know hey free shipping so I just want to go ahead and tell you the rest of that story while we're telling stories and it was just way cool you know I just didn't like the way it all fell down or fell into place you know but it was way cool in the end but you know if they had charged me 50 dollars for shipping I wouldn't have done it you know and the way they did it they could have so yeah anyway just want to share that way so you guys thanks for watching today's events and hanging out with me and stuff I really like it when you come by and check things out and thanks to all my new subscribers thank you very much welcome aboard all my viewers hey guys and keep those comments coming man I love it I love it with you guys you

that we have the wine glass we have to think of a bunch of like weird funny challenges places I can already think of a place let's go we just got to the chick-fil-a drive-through we got our water ball up here so we're gonna get some food and ask him if they could fill up our water bottle and then hand them this yeah is this a good idea will work yeah you're gonna be able to fit that out the window I don't know testing it fits it fits yes also it's wondering if you need fill up my water bottle what if I haven't like used it yet oh I see that rise but I love it you should totally it might fit in my bed you are you try it yes how about that because you called it a water bottles did you specifically need water in it no Philip the toilets I didn't totally fill it up with a suicide of notice oh yes okay perfect yes words yes yeah okay can you carry it Andrew yeah I got it go park boy get this thing out of here my hands falling asleep this is heavy oh you gotta take a sip your first sip out of the beverage container in this thing [Music] you look so awkward drinking fishing what have you ever seen the tsunami trick what's that check this out good night bro now what do we do with this water the plants thanks chick-fil-a for giving us all this but we can't drink it all we still have other things to do all right we're at the coming cold gas station we got to go inside and ask them if we can bring our own water bottle to fill up beverages see what the site yeah because sometimes gas stations and places let you bring your own container and it's recycle five bucks fill up whatever size so yes can we bring our own container for the filler upper of the photos how much would that be all right so they said we could bring in our own container but I don't know how they're gonna price this yeah oh yeah let's see on the box how many ounces it says it is it's 46 ounces it's 46 - I don't care we're back [Music] honey man Steven no we're just getting some big gulps she charged us for three one hundred ounce refills yes how much how much I have so five bucks so we do it spero Dedes that's over time to decide should we go with like a beverage or a slushie swashy all right slushy pickle that's a serious job I think that's gonna vary yeah man so we're gonna be here wild guys this is frozen and fun [Music] [Music] how heavy do you rate that 50 pounds e alright so now we need to construct a mega straw [Music] Bertie the slushies melting [Music] right 80 bucks yeah it's totally worth it [Music] we're gonna go and try and see a movie and this is gonna be our snack and beverage we can't fit in the car so we're gonna have to walk there which it's way over there so let's go if we tried to travel this thing this it would spill literally all over the car okay guys Adrienne I've been walking forever our biceps are about to blow up well we have made it to the movie theater check it out hopefully they'll let us in otherwise this was a big waste of time but if they do it's gonna be the best movie yeah we're here for a movie what movies are awesome Oh watch the straw but take a seat time to go see a movie ha ha you're tired of carrying that yet but what are people gonna think when they see you okay what is that psycho doing like a 24 hour challenge I don't know you need to stay up all night I always bring my own things sir hmm what so we finished it guys yeah I brought the

"oqTOlrF-lgQ": "what's up guys welcome back today I have a very exciting video we're going to be making infused flamin hot cheetos now only RV is going to be absolutely amazing they are also the easiest recipe you're ever going to come across on this channel and it only requires two ingredients what you're gonna need some flaming hot cheetos tincture or infused butter or oil the first step is to spread out the cheetos on a baking tray if you're using tincture like I am you'll pour it into a little spray bottle I like this bottle because it does a really nice fine mist if you're using oil or butter you'll need to make sure it's warm enough to be liquidy and use one of these oil mister bottles like this I'll post a link for each of these items in the description box below now all you have to do is spray your Cheetos with the tincture or the oil if you're using the tincture you can just leave them out to air dry and they should be good after a half an hour to make them even stronger I'm gonna flip them all over and spray them again you can repeat this process and spray them as much as you like to get the desired strength just make sure not to use too much so they don't get too soggy if you're using oil or butter you'll need to put them into the oven for five minutes at 200 degrees I left my note to dry for about a half an hour and they're ready to put into bags now they've dried out they're ready to eat today obviously tastes amazing thank you guys so much for watching I hope you guys try this out if you enjoyed this video please give us a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe have a wonderful day [Music]", "d92ZQmSOWGE": "In today's video, we're taking really thin sheets\nof aluminum, and see if we can twist them\ninto something stronger, a metal rope. [Music] On YouTube, Skylar Parks asked, if we can make a rope\nusing aluminum foil. Skylar, that's an\ninteresting question. As most people know, aluminum foil is\nnot terribly strong. It's made of metal,\nbut it's so thin that it shreds apart easily. This is definitely not something you would think\nof as holding any support. Even when we take sort\nof a bunch of it at once, it's pretty easy to bust\nright through it. So can we take this super\nthin flimsy material, and turn it\ninto something stronger, a cable or rope that we can actually pull\nagainst with some strength. Here's the basic idea. In the past, we've used uncommon\nmaterials to make rope. Today, we're going to take\nsomething really light and thin, and see if we can get\nthe same result. We've made rope out of some uncommon or weak\nmaterials in the past. We've used soda bottles\ncutting into strands. We've used pretty weak string\nto make a fairly strong rope. We've used coconut fibers that we were able\nto twist together into long continuous pieces. All of those were able to take\na fair amount of strength. Our rope made out of paper towel\nwas able to hold my weight, and pull a car. So we know that we\ncan take something weaker and bind it together\ninto something stronger. Today, we want to see if we can make that work\nwith aluminum foil. The aluminum does present\na few challenges that other materials\nwe've used don't have. Most of the time, when we've tried to make\nany sort of rope involves taking long strips or pieces of the material\nand twisting it together. However, with the foil, sometimes we run into a problem\nthat if we keep twisting it, rather than getting stronger,\nit becomes brittle, and just breaks right apart. I believe this is mostly because rather than being\nstrands or fibers that are really strong\npulled one direction, the foil is sort of uniformly\nweek in every direction. Easy that direction. Easy that direction. Easy at an angle. It just rips really easily. So, it's not the same\nas others materials we've used. Even paper towels, which aren't very strong\non their own, we were able to twist into something\nthat made a pretty strong rope, because it is\na fibrous material, and twisting it together\nhelped it bind even stronger. With the foil,\nit's a different beast. Before we get started\nwith the whole rope, we at least want to see if we\ncan have a proof-of-concept. Can we take one sheet of foil and make it stronger\nby changing the shape at all? [Music] Two sheets of foil\nabout the same size. Now, we want to attach one of these sheets of foil\nonto our scale to see how hard we can pull on it\nbefore it breaks. To try and make sure that we're pulling evenly with\nthe whole width of the foil, I'm going to take a dowel, and I'm going to tape\nit to either side. That should make it so that when pressure\nis being put on one spot, it's transferred to the whole\nsheet at the same time. Let's test this out. [Music] Now, I'm going to hold\nonto the dowel on this side. I'm going to pull\nuntil something breaks. And hopefully, we're using the whole strength\nof the foil here. [Music] I think I saw\nthat get 28 pounds, which is surprising. I really didn't think\nwe were going to be able to get that much force\nout of one sheet of foil. Hard to know exactly\nwhere it did fail, but we can see that it did tear\nalong this whole taped edge. So I imagine it gave out\nin one spot first, and then quickly\nspread to the sides. The question now is\nif we take this sheet of foil, and we modify it, maybe by rolling it up,\nis it going to get stronger or weaker than the whole sheet\nof foil spread out wide. I'm going to start\nby wrapping the piece of foil around this wooden dowel to make\nit into a nice tube shape, and then I'll twist\nit from there. I'm going to take this end, fit it into the chuck\nof a drill, hold on to the other end,\nand just let it spin. [Music] Wow, that's a lot shorter. Okay. Now this looks more like a rope. Obviously, this is more rope\nshape than the sheet of foil. Let's see what strength we\ncan get off of this thing. [Music] I've got the foil attached\nat both sides, and hopefully, we'll get all of the strength\nbeing put into the foil, and not too much into the tape\nand stuff like that. I think it's going to work. We may have to adjust\nif it doesn't. Now, one thing I noticed, just as I was putting\non here and testing if I had any tension at all,\nit started spinning. Our foil is coiled\nup really tightly, and when I start putting weight on it, it starts uncoiling\njust a little bit. Let's see what happens. I might end up stretching\nthis foil back out as it twists a bit. [Music] That gave out early. The scale got up to 9 pounds. It took some pressure off to try and hold the scales\nso the camera can see it better, and then it seemed to break it about 7 pounds\nwhen I was pulling on it again. This highlights another worry\nthat I had about the foil. If you've ever held\na little piece of thin metal, like a paper clip, and you bend it back and forth, you may notice\nthat it starts to get brittle, it loses its ductility, and you can't bend\nit as easily anymore. And then when you put pressure\non that twisted spot, it just wants to break, because you've already made\nthe metal a little bit weaker. Our first test shows that a stretched-out piece\nof foil laid out flat is actually holding more weight\nthan a twisted up piece of foil. A flat piece of foil\nmay in theory be able to hold more weight, but it's\nhorrendously impractical. You never want to try and pull\nanything with a sheet of foil. So I think we can still turn\nour twisted aluminum foil into something that can still\ntake quite a bit of pull. There's a few different\nthings I want to try. The first is sort of making\nthe foil into a rope, a little bit more the same way\nother ropes are made, that's with thin strips\ntwisted together, and then twisting\nthose thin pieces together. The second is I want to try\nusing our rope machine. You've probably seen\nus use this before. You put some strands in, you atttach drill\nonto the back, spin it. It twists everything up,\nand coils them together. Will this machine\nwork with foil? That twisting effect\nthat makes it brittle and break is something we've\nalready seen happen by hand. It could be even worse\nin the machine. But even with that,\nI still think we'll be able to twist pieces together\ninto a strong rope, whether we use this or not. To cut nice long strips\nout of the sheet of foil, I'm going to fold it\nover a few times, so I don't have to cut in\nthe whole length over and over. This way, I'll be able\nto cut much shorter length, but still get this strips\nrunning through the whole length of the sheet. Before I cut it though, there is one other\nthing we have to do, and that's to put a layer\nof paper towel in between foil. If you try and cut foil, fold it over without\nanything in between, it tends to bind to itself. So here I've got a piece,\njust folding it a couple of times in half. That's four layers\nthick right there. Now, if I cut through,\nI have this strip of foil, but the edges have sort\nof curled over each other, and they don't always\nlike to let go. [Music] I don't think the drill is\nthe way to do this. [Music] We've got a much more\nstring shaped piece of foil. Maybe now, it will twist nicely? [Music] Twisted better than before, but I think we're actually getting a better result just\nby rolling it in our hands, so it's not actually twisted up, but it is still rolled up. [Music] We now have three decently long fairly round strands\nof the aluminum, and the goal is to see if we can twist these together\ninto a stronger cord. [Music] We've now got a cable made from three strands of\naluminum foil twisted together. Attatch to the scale, pull test. Oh, getting a lot of spinning. And it broke. Very low stress test\non that one. Oh, I think it just barely maxed\nout at about 6 pounds. What do you think? Are we going to get any better\nluck using our rope machine? [Music] Here it goes. Oh, well, we got three or four\ninches of our rope, and then our individual\nstrands just snapped. That's not a lot of rope,\nbut it's a little bit, so we can try and take this,\nand put it on the scale, and see what is measuring at. [Music] Hey, our tape gave out. Let's reinforce it\nand try again. [Music] There it is. We got to 56 pounds. That is something that is definitely a higher\nresult than the 28 pounds, of course, we had\nwith the plain flat sheet, and this is still one sheet\nof foil just cut into thirds, and then rolled up. So we finally managed\nto get a little better than the plain sheet. However, we did use\nour rope machine to do this, and then, all\nof our cables broke. So the rope machine itself is not a very effective way\nto keep making this rope. I want to scale that up. We're just gonna use\na lot of aluminum foil, we're you use whole\nsheets this time, and I think I'm going to try\nand do three wrapped together, and then three\nof those wrapped together, so nine total sheets. I lost about two feet\nin length doing that. Let's do it eight more times. We've got nine chords\nlaid out now. So we're going to start\ntwisting them together. We're going to twist 3 together,\n3 together, 3 together, and then we're going to twist\nall of those together, and make ourselves sort\nof a big monster cable, see how it works. [Music] Now we've got three cables, and we need to twist them all\ntogether into one giant cable. Let's turn it\ninto one big ol rope. [Music] Giant foil rope. Oh, that's great. Question is, does it have\nany strength to it at all? About 3 feet, 4 inches long. Each sheet of foil\nbefore we started was about 6, maybe 6 and 1/2 feet long. So we've lost almost 50% of our foil length\nin turning it into this rope. We got to see\nhow much weight this can take. All right cable, rope foil,\nwhatever you are. [Music] It holds. [Music] It's not the most\ncomfortable rope to hold onto. It does hold its shape\nbetter than most. Today, we've got the truck, which is got like 4 layers\nof paracord attached to our foil rope. I unwound the rope\njust a little bit, and I sort of braided\nthe paracord in there. And then I've got a lot\nof layers of tape after braiding the rope back around it. Same thing on the other side,\nattached to our scale. This is hooked onto\nthe tow hook of a car. And so now,\nwe're just going to test. We're going to have\nMark drive away very slowly, and we're going to see\nhow our foil rope holds up. See how many pounds of pressure it takes\nbefore it just tears open. [Music] Broken. That was a very relaxed break. It just like... Gone. All right. There we go. Our rope broke. It was not a very\nenergetic breaking. I thought that maybe\nit would just pop and catastrophically\nfail all at once. But really, it just\nwas pulling and pulling, and then just was like, I'm out, and just let go, and everything\nkind of fell down. But I'm quite sure I saw\nit over 200 pounds. I think I saw it about 215 or 225,\nsomething like that. Overall though, that's definitely a rope\nyhat was doing something. Skylar Parks, thank you\nfor your suggestion.

"mshCOJ3f8WI": "Walt Disney World was always more than just\ntheme parks. Even back in the 70\u2019s when it first opened\nit offered guests other activities like golf, camping, and boating. It was just a way to round out a vacation\ndestination. However once the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s rolled\naround, that attitude changed. People were making Disney World one stop out\nof many on their Florida vacation, but why not change that? Disney\u2019s thinking was that if people were\ncoming to Florida for other experiences, they could offer their own Disney version of that\nexperience and keep them on property. Local night clubs? Pleasure Island. Beaches and waves? Typhoon Lagoon. Cruises? The Disney Cruise Line. Timeshares? The DVC. Many people made trips out to Daytona for\nthe Daytona 500. Well, Disney had an answer for that too, and\nit was the Walt Disney World Speedway. In the mid 1990\u2019s, there was a rift in the\nworld of racing. A man named Tony George felt that Indy racing\nwas getting too expensive. He argued that the variation between oval\nand street tracks, along with the lack of standardization among the cars lead to this\nsort-of arms race of increasingly expensive vehicles. It reached the point where the average IndyCar\nseason cost a team as much as fifteen million dollars to participate. He tried to work with CART or the Championship\nAuto Racing Team to change the series to help, but they were unable to come to an agreement. So in 1995, he started his own series. IRL was the Indy Racing League. George claimed that it was going to return\nthe sport to it\u2019s true form by lowering the number of races, focusing on oval tracks,\nand limiting the car specs to lower the costs to participate. He claimed his league would lower that $15\nmillion cost down to $3 million. Now George wasn\u2019t just some random fan. You see, he was the president of the Indianapolis\nMotor Speedway, home to the world famous Indy 500. So he not only had the resources to make the\nIndy Racing League a reality, he had the pull to give IRL racers preferential treatment\nwhen it came to the next Indy 500. The qualifying rules of the Indy 500 were\nchanged so that 25 of the 33 car spots were given to participants of the IRL. The racing community didn\u2019t like this. His goals were noble, sure, but to many it\nfelt like a kid taking his ball and going home because he didn\u2019t like the rules of\nthe game. Many big name drivers spoke out against the\nchanges to the Indy 500 and pledged to not partake in the IRL. Some were just contractually bound to the\nother IndySeries anyway and couldn\u2019t switch over even if they wanted to. CART countered by establishing the US 500\nin Michigan to compete with the Indy 500. So it looked like regardless of public outcry,\nthe IRL series would be moving forward, though with a shortage of big name racers. This is where Disney enters the picture. The Indy Racing League partnered with The\nWalt Disney Company to build a 1.1 mile tri-oval track just south of the Transportation and\nTicket Center in order to host the inaugural Indy 200 in 1996. It might not have been the first thing people\nexpected out of Disney, but it wasn\u2019t much of a stretch either. Disney World had moved more into the world\nof sports those past few years with their own marathon, bike tour, and even mini-Olympics. So racing didn\u2019t feel far out of place. General manager of Disney Motorsports, Michael\nWaggoner, claimed that he had been pitching the idea of moving into racing to Disney for\nfour years before it finally happened. By hosting the first of the five races, Walt\nDisney World would lend a novelty to the new event. On the flipside, by kicking off the series\nin January, the event would benefit Disney by bringing in more guests during what was\nnormally their slow season. Disney sold package deals for hotel stays,\npark tickets, and race tickets for the event, and later claimed that most of the attendees\nfor the race were from the Midwest and purchased said packages. The Speedway itself was a barebones facility. It was built in under a year at a cost of\njust $6 million. There were no permanent bleachers or sky boxes,\nnor were there any garages for the cars. It was more or less just a track. That track was made up of 3.2 million paving\nbricks, including one cornerstone brick from the famous Indianapolis Motor Speedway, often\nknown as the Brickyard. The track in Disney gained the nickname of\nthe Mickyard. Using temporary bleachers and sky-boxes able\nto seat over 55,000 guests, the first Indy 200 was slated for January 27th, 1996, with\na prize purse of $1 million. As expected, the series struggled to attract\nmany big name racers, but according to Disney that wasn\u2019t a problem. They claimed that their research showed that\npeople were going to the races for the cars and competition, and less-so for notable racers\nthemselves. And it seems that Disney was right, as the\ninaugural event was attended by over 55,200 guests and was broadcasted on ABC, which Disney\nhad just acquired over the previous six months. The race itself went well, and averaging 139\nmiles per hour and winning by just .866 seconds, Buzz Calkins was the first winner of the Indy\n200. Over the following 4 years the Walt Disney\nWorld Speedway saw continued use. The Indy 200 would take place there up until\nthe year 2000, and a couple of NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series races would be held at the speedway\nas well, not to mention a number of smaller supporting races for both events. After the IRL race in 2000, Disney and the\nIndy Racing League failed to settle on an agreeable date for the 2001 race, causing\nthe IRL to go with a different venue. Disney didn\u2019t know it at the time, but it\nwould mark the end of professional races at the track. With the rise in popularity of stock car racing,\nand the continued rift between the IRL and CART, the racing scene was starting to struggle. However that wasn\u2019t the end of the speedway\u2019s\nuse. Introduced in 1997, the Walt Disney World\nSpeedway became one of the permanent homes to the Richard Petty Driving Experience. The experience allowed guests to pay anywhere\nfrom $99 to $1250 to get into the passenger\u2019s seat of a stock car and experience the speeds\nof the vehicle firsthand, or even drive it themselves. Eventually the offerings expanded to the Indy\nRacing Experience, and the Exotic Driving Experience. So what happened to the Speedway? Well, the very decisions that made it a low\nrisk investment for the Walt Disney Company also made it really easy to get rid of. The facility had only cost them $6 million\nto build and didn\u2019t involve any large permanent structures, and it was squeezed right below\nthe TTC parking lot in order to avoid laying new utilities. As the popularity of the parks continued to\ngrow, that land found itself becoming more valuable for extra parking space, and without\nany professional races, it became harder to justify keeping around. So it was decided in early 2015 to close and\ndemolish the track in order to expand the parking facilities at the TTC. With the announcement there was virtually\nno surprise. If anything people were more surprised the\nspeedway had lasted as long as it did. The Walt Disney World Speedway was one of\nthe more interesting projects for Disney in the 90's. It certainly wasn\u2019t the only instance of\nDisney trying to dip their toes into a new venture, but usually when they did it either\ninvolved a major investment, or extreme success, or extreme failure. The Speedway had none of that. It was built on the cheap. It saw some professional use, but that just\npetered out without any fanfare. The use after that was small and sparse, and\nthen one day it was just removed. It felt like an afterthought, not just for\nguests who visited, but to Disney as well. But even as an afterthought, it was a testament\nto how willing Disney was to try something new.", "RwnN2FVaHmw": "- We are doing four last to leave videos, and the winners of each are\ncompeting in a fifth one for one million dollars.\n(cash register chimes) You are currently watching\nvideo number two of this series.

I don't know if you're out there, if they swing and just touch\nyou with their toenail. - Like that? - But did you? - Yes! - Jake just got touched! Hey, I won't move yours as far. We'll put his right here. And I think it's time to move his back.

(growling) - Hut, hut, hike! Give him more! Give him-- He got him! Chandler, are you ready? - Hey, no! - Hike! - Ow, fumble! (beep) - To hike 2.0. - Ooh! - He hurt to himself. So, the punishment is you have to lay under your contestant for five minutes. - I feel like my ding dong's\ngonna get kicked any second. - Oh, this kinda nice, actually. - You know what? - I'm a great motivator. - So now that you guys are\nall laying on the ground, this leads perfectly\ninto our next segment.

Just don't think about it, just keep swinging. - Aw. - [Troy's Mom] Just go with the flow. - How's dad doin'? Is he getting any better? - [Troy's Mom] Yes, they\nshocked his heart to restart it, and then that makes him\nfeel back to normal. So, I'm gonna go and\ntell him what's going on. Just concentrate and then\ndon't think about, like, oh, I'm tired, or something. Just don't think about it. - No. - [Troy's Mom] Just hang in there, baby. - Oh, now I want you to win. Omar, get out!\n- No! - Okay.

Omar's about to call his sister. We're just gonna fill her in. - Hey!\n- Hi, homey! - Hey, hey. So I'm currently swinging. I'm doing good, slightly sore, but I'm mostly good. - If he wins today, he competes for a million dollars in a challenge in a few weeks. So, if he plays his cards right, he could become a millionaire. So I want you to just encourage him and give him some motivation. I'm gonna hand him back. - Keep swinging, keep going, it's just, uh, however long it is. - [Omar] Don't worry about it. Talk to you soon. - Call me after. - Yes, I will. - Everyone just got a\nlittle bit of motivation except for Payton. - You know what? We're swingin'!\n- Yeah! - So just keep swingin'! - Yeah! - [Coach] Whoo! (smooth hip-hop music) - Chris, my brother, can you\ncart Steve onto the court? - Uh-oh. - If you get out now, you\ncan have all the presents. (shouting) Marcus! Marcus is asleep.\n- Sound asleep. - Hey buddy. You know how we're recording these? See how do y'all rate? - You did the best you could do. Appreciate you comin' out\nhere, you know what I'm sayin'? - Me and Marcus had a\nlittle bit of up and downs during our challenge today. - Yeah, we did, we did, we did. - But I think we overcame\n'em when Marcus fell asleep. - I think you're right.\n(laughing) - They've been swinging for 12 hours. - 12 hours, 12 hours! (bursts) - Ooh, that was nice. I have a feeling you're\nboth gonna go a while. Would you say so? I guess we'll just do a time lapse! (smooth hip-hop music) So the last to fall challenge came down to Jake's contestant and Chandler's. So this is the exact same thing. On top of that, Jake was still here at nighttime, Chandler wasn't. Change history, though, Troy. I believe. - I will change it. - I don't know you guys do this. I'm tired.\n(chuckles) (smooth hip-hop music) It is six AM. I now you guys have to be tired. - I'm feeling great, Jimmy. - I don't get how he feels like that. - I feel great.\n- At six AM in the morning. - I feel great, dude, I feel great. - You could've gone a day.\n- Yeah! - Troy, you still gonna go on? A little off, guard the table, but that's where you are, or are you just dragging? - I'm going off beat. - Lemme consult the team. I wanted to consult with the team, but the team's asleep. I might offer some money, you know, to see who takes it. Okay, let's try Chandler. We're offering them money to see if anyone wants to get out. Do you wanna come talk\nyour guy into staying? He's like, asleep. Okay. So we woke up Jake, and\nwe woke up Chandler. Now let's go offer them some money. (squealing) - Congratulations, you're awake. - You know how we do things. Sometimes people just need a little bit of a nudge to get out,\nwould you agree, Chandler? - Yes. - For the next 30 seconds, if someone gets out, $10,000. - 10,000.\n- That's a lot of money. - Omar, I know you want this $10,000. - Nah, I don't. - What could you buy with it?\n(laughing) - I don't want it.\n- No, I don't. - [Omar] I'm going for the million, and I decided that from the start. - What's going through your mind, Troy? - [Troy] I wanna get that one mil, man. - You wanna get the million? But even if you win here, you still have to win\nanother challenge after this. You could not win that and be in the same scenario, but with way less suffering. - [Cameraman] Yeah, Omar,\nyou've had a smile on your face this whole time. - Yeah, why not do it with\na smile when you're winning? - [Cameraman] Would you\nhave taken that deal now? - C'mon Omar, just let me win, man. (laughs) - Bruh, I'm not leaving 'til tomorrow, you can stay if you want to. Trust me when I say this,\nyou're wasting your time, I'm not leaving. - [Jimmy] The energy you have,\nI want that, I need that! (laughing) - [Chandler] Are you givin' up? - Dude, I'm breaking right now. - [Chandler] Do not, dude, don't break. - I am physically, like, hurting so bad. - Troy. How are you feeling? - I'm hurting. - Okay. I can tell you're hurting. So if someone gets out\nin the next 30 seconds, I will give them $10,000 in cash. - I'm gonna give him one\npercent of my winnings if I win the million. - Oh, I didn't hear that!\n- I told him that. - If Omar wins, he's gonna\nface up against Akira and the winners of the\nnext two challenges-- - And win off this thing.\n- For a million dollars. You get 10 grand, and you can potentially\nget another 10 grand. - Dude, I could go for\nat least one more day. (laughing) - Troy, all right, give\nhim another 30 seconds. - A million, you heard it, I need it. - [Jimmy] This is\ndetermination right there. - [Chandler] Keep fightin', keep fightin'. Omar is--\n- I'm surviving. - All right, Troy. Stick it out and go, or you could walk away\ntoday with 20 grand. I know that would help\nyour family greatly. So Omar has now offered two percent on top of the $10,000. - And since some of you\naren't that good with math, if he wins a million dollars, two percent might not seem like a lot, but that's still 20 grand. - I'm not feeling so good. - If he gets up, okay, 100% up to you if you wanna keep going or not. (applauding) Omar is the winner! Let's have a draw! - You didn't-- - I don't even know what to say, man. You killed it. You got guaranteed 10 grand. If Omar wins, you get another 20. And I know that'll help for sure. So, I'm proud of you. Everyone's proud of you. Your mom, your family's gonna\nbe proud of you for sure. - Yeah, I feel better up here. I really wanted to win\nit to break, you know, the losing streak.\n(laughs) - That's why? That's why? Well, I appreciate you trying for me, man, but that was awesome. And you're gonna get that $10,000 now. - Gotta give thanks to\nmy fans, and my family. - I'mma give you that $20K, for sure, bro, 100%, you'll gain that $20K. (murmuring) - Jake, Akira won.\n- Yes. - Omar won, you're two for two. - Two and oh. - Which means two of the\nfour people competing for a million dollars will be your guys. - Honestly, one million means a lot to me. And like, my family has\ntaken care of me all my life. And all I want to do is\nlike give back to them, and this seems like\nthe perfect opportunity through, like, getting a million. - Based on the comments\nsection up in the last video, people really like Akira. Well, we'll see how they\nrespond to you, Omar. And we'll see you in a few weeks. (explosion) \u266a Oh MrBeast 6000 \u266a \u266a Oh \u266a\n(Explosion) \u266a MrBeast 600, yeah, you know his name \u266a \u266a He changed it once or twice \u266a \u266a But I think it's here to

much so somebody asked me a few weeks ago if I could do nerds ropes and to be perfectly honest had no idea what those work so I googled those little puppies and found out that they're a gummy candy covered in nerds who sew off my kitchen I went a little experimented little tickety-boo and look at what up I can make your it's ropes so I am going to bring this recipe to you so without any more in further babbling here let's jump right into those ingredients what we're going to need and then let's get these guys made alright so the ingredients that we're gonna need for our nerd candies so this recipe is basically my W candy recipe with the cooked syrup and the reason that we're using the Kochs syrup is is going to help with those candies to stick better than just using the gelatin one so with that set you're gonna need about three or four boxes of the large nerds or about seven or eight of those small ones that are the two flavored ones you're gonna want one to two boxes of cornstarch and don't worry you can reuse it we just sift it up and you can reuse it over and over and it doesn't go bad so not a problem plus it's not expensive you're going to want two boxes of the small gelatin the three amps or the 85 grams two of those want three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin or three or three packages of the Knox a quarter teaspoon of kaurav cannabutter and we're going to melt this 1/2 a cup of either kanna syrup corn syrup or you can use inverted syrup if you don't like invert sugar if you don't like corn syrup and we're going to split that quarter in our gelatin part quarter in our candy syrup we're going to need 1/2 a cup of we're going to need 1/2 a cup of liquid so I like to use the kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters ones because it gives it extra flavor than just using water and it's pretty much like using water so you don't have to worry about things going bad so these are great to use so I'm going to use use a half a cup of this to bloom our gelatin and a half a cup for our mixture then for additional flavoring I know I feel I know these could be a little bit difficult to get is I use two tablespoons of drink crystals so I get these at the bulk barn Jurek from spring onwards they have me during spring in the summer during the winter they don't carry them or other box stores the stores may carry them otherwise you can just use the Lorena's oils if you want to add some additional flavoring but it's not really required because of all the nerds on it so it's not that big of a deal and that's everything that we need for the gelatin part for our cooked syrup we need 1 K 1 cup of sugar and again if you've got candace sugar you can divide that up a quarter cup of can of sugar to three quarters of a cup of regular sugar as long as you equal one cup of sugar it doesn't matter a quarter cup of water and a quarter cup of our corn syrup and or kit canister that's it for our syrup oops sorry and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid goes into our cooked syrup as well then for the glue that they that they used to stick on top technically they're nerds the Nerds use confection confectioners glaze unfortunately being in Canada wasn't the easiest for me to get but an alternative for an edible glue and glaze is to use tylose tylose powder and water so I'm going to show you how to do that and this is what you're going to need to this stuff a day before but it's super easy it just happens that time to do whatever it needs to do but it works great if you can't get the confectioner's late and for and then to make our clear to make our edible glue we're also going to need one cup of water that is all the ingredients that we are going to need let's get into that equipment there so there's a little bit of equipment this time so let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made alright so the equipment that we're going to need is a double boiler if you don't have a quote double boiler you can always just use a metal bowl that will fit securely into the pot and has enough room on the bottom for water without touching you're gonna need another small or saucepan a small medium saucepan for our syrup point you need a candy thermometer digital or the one that you hang on doesn't matter a couple of spatulas gonna need you're gonna need a pastry brush and I'm gonna use a funnel for putting it into our molds you can get these candy funnels or if your pot has the little specks on it and that will work as well or you can always put it into a measuring cup or something with a spout anything to make it easier to pour cause we gotta pour into some skinny guys offset spatula is something to be able to smooth out our corn starch and you're going to want to get some dowels so I got these at the dollar store in the craft section they're 12-inch by just slightly under a half inch size dowel so you want about half inch sized dowel by about 12 inches as I said dollar store craft stores usually how these pre-cut like so otherwise you cannot just buy one of those read it on once and cut up your own so we need basically one if you can is many has many dowels as you want to make ropes now this recipe probably makes around 10 to 12 I'm only going to do part of that today and the rest of the stuff I'm just gonna make regular gummies and I'll explain why when we get to making them all so if you want a bunch of those dowels a cookie sheet or doing them on and you want to line it with parchment paper another pan that we can use to press down the cornstarch with or something flat that's that's kind of heavy a drying rack and then another pan or something that you can use and we're going to put Phillip put the skittles in to cover them up later on once we get the glue on them so it makes it easy if you've got some kind of pan like that so basically all our equipment you know me I always forget something but let's jump right in and let's get these made so if you go and I'm using the tylose powder as your glues your edible glue what you're going to want to do is to bring one cup of water to a boil once it's come to a boil turn the heat off and then we're going to add in three-quarters of a teaspoon into into our boil water you're gonna whisk that around and you're gonna see it's gonna lump up and it's not all gonna dissolve it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for it to fully dissolve all right so my water's come to a boil I'm going to turn off the heat gonna remove that oh remember that thing that I always tell you I forget yeah it was the whisk one whit so we're gonna add in three-quarters of a teaspoon these are quarter teaspoons you want to kind of story sprinkle it around like so and then you're gonna whisk it and it's gonna stay lumpy a little bluffing like that for a while and every couple every two three minutes you're gonna come back and whisk it around and you'll notice every time you come back more and more will be dissolved and as I said it takes about 15-20 minutes for it to fully dissolve once it has you're going to put it into the refrigerator sorry you're gonna let it cool first then put it into the refrigerator overnight and the next day you're good to go and it lasts for up to six months so you can use this over and over not as well as for your any other projects edible food products projects that you have that you need glue fork so I'm just gonna continue to do that to stir that I'll show you once it is clear and next we're gonna make up our starch molds alright so here's my tylose my edible glue all clear now and dissolved so just gonna pour it into a jar and once that's cool I'm gonna cover that up put it in the fridge overnight alright so now we're gonna make our starch folds and starch molds are what they use in candy manufacturing so there's not a whole bunch of people on the line pop and they've silicone molds they use these huge place with corn starch they stamp in the pattern fill up the molds once they set the plate opens all the candies fall in Iraq all the corn starch falls to the bottom and they reuse it so we're going to make our own makeshift version at home so as I said you need about one to two boxes depending how large betray your you see because you do want it almost look for sickness of your cookie sheet whatever lip on that so carefully pour it into your pan and you want to do it on parchment paper because it's going to make it a lot easier when you need to put this back into the box as well as to get it thin too sifting and again you want to be very careful otherwise it's going to look like Scarface's come through your kitchen this stuff it gets messy again you want to carefully move it an offset spatula works really well so that you can move it and spread it out around your pan evenly so I'm just moving it around here so that is all trying to get it relatively all even so that our moles will all be about the same size and you want to have enough room as I said to be able to make them a little bit deeper there and you don't want to be going all the way to the bottom so once you've got it relatively smooth out gonna Mimi and stuff everywhere so what we want to do is to take another little piece of parchment paper and you want it to be able to fit over top doesn't all stick to our pan place it down on top and then use your pan to press down don't press down too firmly but a little bit just to get that compressed and the parchment will stop of the cornstarch from sticking to the bottom of your pan in defeating the purpose of trying to make a flat surface carefully pick this up so we're good like that there so now you want to take your dowels and that's why I said you want to try and have as many as you as you were going to make because your we're gonna press it down so you take the one with a your dowel and you press one down and rock it back and forth so that it makes a little bit of a wider crevice here or so it makes a little wider it up a little bit wider of a trench and then just leave it and then use your next one just go over a little bit button in half an inch or an inch and again you're gonna do the same thing gently press and work it down so the reason you say you want to use multiple dowels is if I go and I take this out if I took it out and push the next one in it pushes some of the cornstarch into the one that we just made so the multiple dowels will help you from avoiding that problem so I'm just gonna pull the camera in over top here so you can actually see it up close all right so it's that you just go over a little bit here from the other one about an inch is good and just gently roll it into place now if you don't have as many inch you're going to like you can see like I'd oh I'm now gonna take my first one so grab it from end to end with your fingers like so so that you don't interrupt your Bowl and now I can move that one there without interrupting that one and then the same thing carefully take this one and here how're we gonna get one of our box the Nerds I've just put them into a bowl or something for you to make it easy we're gonna fill up our little trenches here with our nerd on here a bowl here no jar from a bowl today and just grab some with your fingers and gently drop them fill out the trench chair you just gonna drop them along the bottom don't fully fill it up we just want to line the bottom of it and then anywhere where there's naked spots that we miss don't worry cuz we're gonna glue glue bunch on afterwards so going along do that my trenches removing the dowels grab them use your fingertips in the end to gently pull them up then once you're done filling up your molds there with nerds you're going to carefully place the tray into your freezer so we're gonna make our mold nice and cold nice and cold so when we drop our candy syrup it's gonna start to solidify and grab onto those candies really quickly but you want to be very very gentle because it'll fall easily and yeah you don't want to do this all over again so first case scenario you make a mess him if you have to redo it just to sift out your cornstarch and your nerds and just redo the process so the first thing that we want to do is bloom our gelatin so I've got 1/2 cup of and this has got to be cold but liquid needs to be called 1/2 cup of our I use the kool-aid jammer and then you're gonna sprinkle evenly on your gelatin all over the top and this is to prevent clumping and then you want to mix it in until it's all dissolved and while you're mixing it'll start to bloom and it should call right automatically kind of go to the texture of applesauce if it doesn't your gelatin is not is not very good it's lost its Jo so you don't want to add a little more or get new stuff so we're just gonna set that off the side until we need it God needs about five at least five ten minutes to bloom so the next step is going to be our gelatin side that we're gonna do you're gonna turn your heat on to medium low you're gonna boil a half a cup of your liquid so I used a half a cup of the cooling water pour that in and you're gonna stir to dissolve your jello and then just note for your double boiler don't forget to put your water in and also you your water should never touch the bottom of your pot so I said you just gonna stir this up until that just starts to dissolve and if you're using flavor drink crystals I this is where all added in as well so it can dissolve at the same time I add about two tablespoons as I said if not you can use the Lorraine's oil and you add that more at the end so we just stir this until it's all dissolved until it until it starts to dissolve then I'm gonna add in our corn syrup and our citric acid now that my syrup is mostly the sugars not have mostly melted I'm gonna add in 1/4 cup of my can of syrup or as I said you can use corn syrup or inverted sugar and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and the citric acid and the syrup they are both for preventing crystallization well the can of syrups add a little extra but regularly corn syrup or the inverted sugar is to help prevent crystallization so again I'm gonna mix that stir that well until it's all combined and everything's melted together in the meantime make sure your can of butter is melted and you're going to get your hand blender ready to so we're gonna need that shortly and you're gorg um so now that our syrup our gelatin and that everything's dissolved now it's time to add in our can of butter and our corn gum so you're gonna take your melted can of butter throw her in mix that around just a little bit then we're going to use each ordered teaspoon of fargo and you're going to spread gently sprinkle it try and do sprinkle it evenly over the top please let it sit for just a moment get your hand blender and we're going to blender up [Music] so you're gonna let that blend that up for about probably about two minutes you want to make sure it's something it's a really wild ball supply then once you're done just let it sit for a couple of minutes for about a minute or two and see if any oil comes to the top raises to the surface and you'll be able to tell that the air the bubbles will start to dissipate and if there's any oil if it's not fully emulsified the oil will come up to the top and you will notice kind of little oil slicks if you do see any kind of little oil slicks just add a little bit more Gorica no more than about an eighth of a teaspoon and re blended with the hand blender until that's gone so you should have one uniform texture and then just turn off the heat on your gelatin mixture here there is enough warm water in in your pot here to keep your mixture liquefied now on to the candy side the candy syrup side so for our cooked syrup you're going to add in your one cup of sugar or I said or your mixture of sugar and can of sugar get add in a quarter cup of our can of syrup or corn syrup as I said use that inverted sugar and our quarter cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid mix those together and you can turn your heat on to high heat so you're just going to continue to mix stir this until it begins to boil once it starts to boil you're gonna stop stirring that and we're gonna cook it till two hundred and eighty degrees so now that it started boiling just do it's just start it just around the sides here I'm gonna stop stirring at this point and then I'm just gonna check my temperatures every once in a while till we hit two hundred and eighty degrees so I'm gonna need to check it right now because obviously we're not going to be there I'm gonna let it boil for a couple of minutes and then I'll check its temperature so I start my syrup has been boiling for a couple of minutes so I just want to see where it's sitting right now because we only use a quarter cup of water and we're cooking a high temperature it will get to the 280 very quickly so already at 270 almost there just after 2-3 minutes 280 once it hits your temperature pull it off and allow it to cool for until it hits about 240 so why I like to set it on a stone on natural stone like granite or any natural stone it helps to pull the heat out thicker or if you've got a trivet that helps as well so said just let that sit until it hits 240 all right so my temperature my syrup now is at the correct temperature it's down below just below 240 so now I'm going to and the reason you want to do that is if it's higher it's going to break your gelatin so we don't want to do that so now we are going to pour our gelatin syrup into our candy syrup if that well mixed well together and if you found that your candy syrup has solidified on the bottom or along the sides you can put it on to low heat just to melt that so you're just going to mix this for about a minute or two till they're both combined and make sure to get right on the sides it does like to harden up there see and once everything is all nice together and all melted well together we're going to treat our unflavored gelatin and I recommend kind of break it up into smaller pieces if you can plop her in there see this way again your syrup is not going to be too hot to break your gelatin and this way we get the gelatin all through everything kind of binds there both of those together so you're just going to gently stir that until the gelatin is completely melted so now here's a way that you can kind of give a kind of little pretest to know if your syrup is going to gel up well because on gummies were okay because we can always read about those but these a little harder having all the Nerds stuck to them so we want to get it right the first time just take your syrup take your spoon and allow it to drip off if it starts to solidify in midstream like it'll start to solidify and gel right up while it's dripping you're good to go if it continues to drip like mine is it's going to need more gelatin so what I'm going to do to make sure that that's going to work is I'm going to add another tablespoon of blooms gelatin so I'm just going to go bloom another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid let that bloom and then add that in and that will take care of that problem there all right so I added one tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of my cooling water and I bloom that for about five minutes and added it in and now you can see how much it's thicker and how it'll start to solidify find a mid stream and it'll it'll hold there that's how you should that's a kind of a quick test for you to be able to see if it's going to gel up correctly in your moles before you actually cast them so now we wait to pour it into my little funnel here well shoot and then just line up with your trench and you're just gonna fill up the trench I have to say this funnel makes it really really easy well I needs you then try to free pour it let's go just go along you fill up all your little trenches little cavities and then you take your Nerds actually found it's easier to pour and break from the box so don't bother putting them in a bowl it's just easier to pour them from the box just take off a little lip there so it doesn't get your way and just kind of squeeze it together so you have a little bit of control it'll all come flying out and then you just fill up the box alone and you just want to be gentle with it go easy because otherwise they'll come flying out and don't worry about all the excess that goes off into the cornstarch there we're gonna sift the cornstarch when we're done and we'll be able to retrieve all those I just give it a very very gentle pat you don't look like literally just feather touch it down there you go so we've got our ropes like that so you're gonna put them into the fridge for them to set up anywhere from about a half hour to two hours it can take for your gelatin to set now that our candies have set you're just gonna take them out of the starch mold here and just lay them on to a harsh line drying rack parchment paper drying rack and you're gonna set those out to dry overnight and I'm putting the start my topside is good with the amount of candies and stuff that are on it so I'm gonna I lay them with the starch side up and that's the main side that I'm gonna add any additional candies to that they need you the sec so I'm gonna let those set stay out overnight for them to dry before we apply our glaze all right so now why are candies for setting so you don't want to waste all that cornstarch and all those nerds that are stuck in there so you grab your um your corn starts with your parchment paper inches pull it up like so take a strainer take a strainer and pour it in a little neater than that and you're gonna slip your parchment paper paper back underneath and sift it back onto the parchment once you got all that all the cornstarch sifted through just drop your candies off into a hole here and then you can get your cornstarch box add your parchment again or back in the box and you're cute most of it and once your candies are dry take them off and just slip your parchment paper underneath it's just gonna catch the excess gonna catch the excess glaze so I've done this recipe a couple times using the tylose so I would recommend out of the two I would recommend going with the glaze and the reason is the tylose because we use water it makes them very well make sure candies very wet it does dry completely and that's not a problem but they are very wet they're very sly mean it makes them difficult to kind of work with and sticking the extra candies on so I think the glaze would be a lot better this you can definitely use if you can't get the glaze but I think they set the glaze would be better so a little bit so what you can do is you're going to grab your pastry brush dip her in and just kind of take off a bit of that access and you're going to go along and you're gonna dab it on your candies on your rope and you want to dab it you don't really want to brush because it will take the color off of the nerves their wallet water soluble so I think again using the glaze would help that with that issue once you get it get it blazed on you can fill in the little spots that are miss then just gently put them on and don't try and bustle it too much because I said it'll just kind of slip and slide off but just leave them like so and again we're just gonna dab that on and you don't get one they're wet you don't want to move them because if your ropes can fall apart they can break apart so but I said once they're dry they're really they're good so I know before I said okay we could use a pan to roll them in I found that method didn't work so well because I said after one or two it gets really wet and it makes it difficult to roll in so I found just pouring the freight from the box but is not the best method once you're happy with that that me and again you're gonna let those dry probably about 12 hours to overnight once they're dry they're good to go do not store your candies in ziplock baggies if it's especially for gummies it's not good you either want to store them in glass jars or in cell bags or the miler Ziploc bags those work really well so instead I'm gonna let those puppies dry overnight and I'll show you the finished product and here's our finished product so check them out look I hope they look just like the real things as I said we don't have live here so I don't hundred percent sure but looks like it from the pictures it looks like a lot of fun alright guys so I hope you enjoyed that recipe if you have any other questions or comments please don't hesitate to put them you know where and thank you so much for joining me today you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]",

around on top of the soda Cup on each one of these this one's a doughnut stop believing and then this one is you baked me crazy and then of course it's got the little lip balm underneath inside the little cup so freshest these are like my favorite whenever they like make cute little designs like this then you want to remember when this one fell off in the video so I don't have that one anymore I had it in here but it just became too like impossible to use it so I just keep it for the container oh we got another little num noms in here this one is a little grape flavor name just put that one with its little buddies so we have in here oh we see unicorn and mermaid this mermaid clamshell is one of my newer ones you guys saw me review this in my Dollar Tree haul video mmm that coconut smell is so unreal it's really really pretty then I got this little unicorn head and then the lip balm is right underneath in here soda cans how sweet are these ones too so we've got cherry cute go bananas and naturally sweet full of pineapple in with these little sodas it looks like you would just open up the lid and just kind of pop it open but actually they just kind of twist open like that and then now you got your little lip balm and it does twist at the bottom so you can get your little bullet balm out from the top there absolutely a favorite these are so cute I see some ice creams so we got these little ice cream flavored balms this one is so pretty look at that cone looks like it's dipped in like raspberry sugar but it's just glitter of course and then you open it up and right in the cone there you go there's your gloss and then these ones too you just unscrew the top here and you got your little ice cream you guys also just saw these ones these really cool ones I got at the Dollar Tree that are like triangle shaped from LA Colors I love that they're actually like triangle they're actually triangle on the inside that's bubblegum that smells like bubblegum I got this little lip line around Valentine's Day from the Dollar Tree it smells just like roses exactly like roses and then I have this little star shape so here is this one doesn't look all that great on the inside looks like my nail accidentally pressed on in there hmm but still has a really nice sweet smell I like that one we've got a couple more in here that are still in the package these are really cool I'm happy I found these I believe these were also another Dollar Tree find either Dollar Tree or Walmart roof or maybe even target those are the three places I shot that all the time so I get confused sometimes which one I get things at these four that I still have in the package but this is what they look like I had these two open basically get two in one and you can layer them these are little layer at lip smackers so one side we've got a berry gloss and then on this other side we've got a cream bomb so you can apply on one side and then like glitter gloss on the other side so I think those are so cool but of course lip smacker has the best-tasting lip balms hmmm again strawberry starbursts strawberry starburst that's what it smells like so that's what these are about alright I have a whole bunch of these covergirl these Oh sugar these are so so amazing not only do they add like a tiny little tint to your lips but they smell really good so I've got them in all different flavors cupcake caramel sprinkle jelly and gum drop just kind of open them up and you can see I've really been using that one a lot so what about this jelly ones yeah see I've actually been using that jelly one a lot too these are so nice eventually I've used all of them a lot look at that sprinkle one I almost used this sprinkle one all the way up actually Oh same thing with this cupcake I've used a lot of it I do have some of these like classic lip smackers so I have these and a whole bunch of different flavors so we've got the strawberry lip smacker mmm that one this one is in Marsh mellow crisp oh it smells so marshmallowy this one okay this is not an official lip smacker but it looks like it's a Smarties cherry flavor mm-hmm yep smells like cherry medicine lip smacker this one is in gum drop this one's in pralines and cream this one is in ribbon candy and this one is in creamy peppermint I think this one was on a Christmas set they get a couple of these wearing a Christmas set and then this one oh okay this one I believe I got from Target from like the dollar spot this it's supposed to smell like pizza oh it does not smell like pizza it does not smell like pizza I have one that also smelt like I think french fries too and I don't really remember that one but I do not like using this one my lips dry out really quick whenever I use it so it's not my favorite but because it's got these cute little pizza slices on it I keep it around okay I am addicted to cuteness oh there's another lip smacker that one's in raspberry jelly and then this one too not an official lip smacker this one is from the Dollar Tree I think this is funny because it looks like you can like color your lips with like a Crayola but it's just of course a lip balm hmm YUM everything smells bubble gum to me right now so I think that's funny for like pranks it's really cute looking looks like we're kind of coming down to ant here all these are cute look at the little Claire's sodas these are so precious - looks like a little orange soda bottle this one's in the flavor of mango and then the pink one strawberry and then this one is flavored and it's that donut pineapple oh yeah cotton candy I think I remember saying that that it's really weird that it shows like really that looks like a doughnut pineapple right it doesn't look like a pineapple looks like a donut but yeah it says flavored and cotton candy and all you have to do what Oh pop the top and there is your lip balm under there let's smell sugary all right looks like we got some random things in here oh yes glitter gloss oh okay I need it use this more this is beautiful sparkly man is that justice Burt oh yeah it looks like it does have some sparkle oh I'm so excited yes I think I found my new favorite glitter lip gloss alright there's some random things in here like this covergirl gloss a color is really pretty let's check out this one oh it just has like a regular makeup II smell but nice little pink gloss got a little two-faced sweet peach I love the little peach face right on the cap this one I think I got for free I think this was like one of their little freebies very peach smelling but it's kind of like that artificial kind of peach but that also kind of a shear kind of gloss a little peachy to your lips and then the last one I know it does not look very good but I actually really love this one it looks like it's kind of separating a little bit in here this one's made by wet and wild I love this this one metallics looks so good on my lips I love a metallic so kind of mix it up a little bit and this oh it still smells so good it's smells so good I don't know if they sell these anymore but this smells like watermelon like watermelon candy it's so sweet it's so delicious so I love this one oh wait give it a little swatch there we go look at that look at that metallic lips will look just like candy all right that's everything that I've put inside the French fry and now I also have this gloss up here I think this was another Dollar Tree find I just love the fact that it's all rainbow it does look like it's starting to separate in the middle but hey the rainbow color is still basically there does this have a smell I don't know I'm still smelling strawberry now we can check out over here I had a couple extra things that I definitely keep out on a shelf at is this pack we've got for sweet little macaroons and these little lip balms that are in here and then I have these two lip smackers out because these are the ones that I currently have on my nightstand and in my purse and in my backpack so I reach for these the most vanilla lip smacker and my strawberry frosting lip smacker these are actually almost done you can kind of tell because they feel a little bit light because I've been using them so much so I'm almost done with this one I'm really proud but I'm also kind of sad at the same time because then I won't be able to smell it anymore oh but that's okay I can start another lip balm and then the last two items are these and these are my peeps I love peeps you guys you guys know that it's no surprise I love foods with faces if a food has a face on it I'm probably gonna love it so peeps are cute little animal foods they look like a little chicks of course I got both oh oh so there are two doubles so I got two of the pink peeps two of the or yellow peeps but this one is a blue peep and then this one is a purple people so there we go there is my lip-balm collection mixing with some random lipglosses I hope you liked this video stay

I'm sure yeah so I was in Jamaica and my friends there was like 15 of us got all guys we decided to take brownies one day and like the crew range from guys who smoked weed everyday to guys who had never smoked weed in their entire lives but everyone was no pun intended pot committed to taking these brownies they're like this big I took one we all went to the beach and then like all of us were hit with this ridiculous wave to where everybody was I can't even like astronomically high like I wa I couldn't even cross the street like I was trying to cross the street at this pizza place with my two friends and I couldn't I kept backing up and I can I finally sat down and got food and then we ordered buffalo chicken pizza and I was enjoying it and then my friend said like ma'am I've gotta get out of here like I think like the walls are like coming in and his friend was like a very like he was like the guy who would get so drunk and not feel it like he was like the big type of dude who wouldn't get freaked out and he got freaked out to freak me out then all of a sudden I just woke up and what happened was apparently I woke up on the ground with like ten Jamaicans standing over me and my friend said that my eyes started wrong in the back of my head they thought I was joking they slapped me in the face and I fell off and like I guess essentially having a mini seizure and since then I haven't taken edible it was the only time I've taken edibles and I just have I mean the ruined edibles for me I'm not doing it man it's crazy we went to bed at 4 p.m. that day it was a complete waste of a spring break danger you", "d9xNtm9gWP0": "[Music] for this project you are going to need to choose a type of candy to put on your lay so the candy should have these twisty ends of the wrapper so that it will be easy to attach it to your leg to attach the candy to your lay you are going to need packaging twine as well as a ribbon so that you can attach your candy to it to create the lay the ribbon should be a cloth ribbon so that you can easily attach the candy to it and make it a comfortable way to wear [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the number of candies that should be in the layered be about 150 to 200 candies and all [Music] [Music] [Music] and so now I finished stringing all the candies on to the ribbon it took several days considering that there's so many that you have to string on and can string it on in any pattern I just did it by color and group them together like that you thank you guys so much for watching this I hope you enjoyed

spider tamer achievements this is to grind out your spider kills I recommend doing this in level 3 foil box on part 11 there's gonna be two spiders here as well as two strings all you do is make a straight cut across this will also help you with grinding the cutting the ropes as well as the loose the candy achievements so you get a three grindy achievements done in this one but this probably the best place to do it because you are killing two spiders instead of one at a time so make sure you just keep at it it should take you no longer than 20 minutes and once you get your last one you should get the achievement for 15 gamerscore there's also another one but you probably already got that in the story for 5 gamerscore and that's all there is to it", "jHHsK2hHkg8": "[Music] [Music]

guys I beat the chaos gauntlet finally took me three episodes whatever we're moving on I mentioned in the last video guys that we had almost 500 diamonds and now we're even closer to 500 diamonds I just need another two diamonds 498 then once we get that we can go to the guy who's somewhere in the game and you're like hey I want to go to your shop and he's gonna say sure you can go to my shop because you have enough diamonds now so I think what I'm going to do guys to get the last two diamonds is try this level right here it's the current daily level it's called out of the dark by wolf and GD it's harder and you get eight diamonds if you beat it there's also a bonus four times down here so I guess you technically get 32 if you beat it I don't know if I beat it I just want to get the last two diamonds alright download the Sun and plant attempt number one okay I got a ball that's all I wanted oh yeah it's going to be super easy to get these diamonds bro I just got to get like 25% through the level right well I've gotten like 10% through the level so that's looking good I even I even recognized that little ooh that's what that's what I did to you I even recognized a little - thing there guys but then I jumped into a little chandelier of death you know you don't you just hate those chandeliers of death always trying to kill you and stuff okay so drop down and then up we go and then we should almost have the second one not really we're still pretty far away from it oh my god oh okay alright I got four thousand and six hundred of those I got four thousand and six hundred of those balls guys and I'm thinking I'm going to buy something in that new shop once it opens you know cuz the other shop doesn't even have that much stuff in it I bought it I bought the things that I wanted and now I'm just kind of waiting for more things and I don't think more things are going to come into the shop but the new shop should have more stuff in it so that's why I'm going to spend my [ __ ] today on that just got to go upside down here no big deal no big deal just upside down and right side up and upside nope that's all right side up but that's okay because I just got that one diamond and I got a robot I don't know what that robot was for maybe because I hit 500 diamonds I'd love to try this level again but but I stuff to do okay I got a shop to check out it's through the store through the store thing over here and then there's a little thing right here and you go hey it's scratch that's the guy oh the diamonds you found them alright come in quickly before someone sees you he looks super skeptical of me who the hell is this guy I don't even know man you never know who might be watching okay welcome to the shop oh boy that's stock music I've heard it so many times in so many games in videos and such all right you got some cool looking stuff here bro let's take a look and oh look at that huh it's a little UFO but it's got a face with a tongue this thing looks kind of cool as well what else you got bro Oh for ten thousand you get this that's a death animation right and that's a pretty cool looking what's this one you want to buy this trail no no I don't I don't want to do that or do I what the hell happened to you bro okay so I have a difficult decision guys I don't have trails work I mean it sounds kind of cool sounds like something I might enjoy having like a little fire trail but I also like damn it what the hell are you doing bro what the hell is wrong with your shop I would also like to get this thing which is just an icon but maybe maybe we'll go with the trail because I'm curious how that's going to look for thousand-man orbs here you go bro I work really hard on these so this better be good scratch all right the trail has been applied guys I don't really know what it does that's okay we got to go to this thing because I want to get this new robot because he looks dope AF um anything else I want to change while we're here oh that's a cool one hmm I love this ball right here not switching out because it's got multiple colors not just two but four all right now there's a ton of choices right here guys I'm not really sure which one I want to get hit I use this one before because this guy is like super creepy I'm not really sure if I've tried at mount alright so you have a ton color let's make your tongue pink and then what color we're gonna make you you're going green bro your green guy with pink tongue alrighty well uh I hate to say this guy's but I think we might have to try the demon gauntlet now I don't have anything else left to do I've been slowly going through these gauntlets and thank God they've taken me forever so we didn't have to get to the demon gauntlet but here it is it's a cave and it's a demon cave and I'm going to cry it's no use that count was locked well thank [ __ ] the demon Guardian was the only one who could open it not sure what happened to him he always was a bit crazy so you're telling me that I can't get this demon gauntlet until I figure out how the hell I unlock it and there's a guy in your basement so you think that has anything to do with it where's basement guy where's where do I go get basement guy oh here's how you get to the basement guy alright so down we go and here you are hey bro how do I they tried to hide it from me but I had my spies second key is locked away in a secret chest I'm like fifty secret chests to claim the key that's going to take forever thing thanks a lot for that information the third key is hidden well even I have not been able to find it I suspect it's guarded by the gatekeeper rub-rub stress the pet to claim the key must fool him I don't know how you will find the gatekeeper at the end of the world touch the ground beneath the promise and the door will be revealed but alright alright hang on a second hang on I gotta look this up how to get the keys in the basement in geometry dash or something alright so there's some weird stuff going on in this game guys apparently if if you go and do the challenge which I've done you click on the orange key and the guy says some stuff you which you just did you then need to go to the coming soon page of the main level screen and tap below said notice in the center of the screen it will reveal a door leads to secret room but will be locked tap below said notice hey look at that I did it the gatekeeper who disturbs my slumber rub-rub is that you I cannot see in this light show me the master emblem and I will let you pass what the hell is that come back who disturbs those over all right so master emblem a apparently the master emblem is in scratches shop that I was just at a second ago this scheme is so convoluted is that the master emblem that looks like it could be a master emblem you know it looks all cool and [ __ ] I don't know that's that's all I can see that would really be it God what the hell is wrong with the shop I'm gonna buy this thing bro I'm gonna go get a whole bunch of stuff and I'm gonna buy it okay don't you look away from me don't you look away from me all right I'm going back to the ED of the dark level okay the daily level I'm gonna I'm gonna do this all right let's go into practice mode I'm gonna get a whole bunch of I'm going to I'm going to beat it I'm going to get a whole bunch of wins the good news guys is a lot of the levels in this game the main levels I don't have completed again and there's a whole bunch of orbs waiting for me once I at once I do them again because obviously the orbs weren't a part of the game originally and then they added a manatee to complete the levels over again to get them which is lame but I understand you know just give me a little bit more to do cool I like the way this spaceship looks looks like bubblegum or something you know whenever things are watermelon flavor they usually have those two colors and now I just want watermelon flavored things damn it bro come on we can do this it's not it's not even hard we're like no we're through this level right now but it's okay we can do it that's the practice about this [ __ ] I'll get it don't worry little hop what do I need to do a bigger half or am i doing too big of a hop it's at home okay this is really dumb guys got a jump in and do that and then this and then [ __ ] come on try it again jumping it did jump again to get yet nope nope nope jump and then up in it but hey that was a lot of attempts I'll be honest there that was kind of gross that took me five minutes just to get through it huh do it again for better all right I can't let too many mistakes get me here guys because I've done this part a good many times watch me epically fail this one part a million times now okay that's well okay it's what four times that I've failed it that's good almost at a million jump and then jump and get that and then oh no oh you almost had it can you can you hold there if you hold there will it work or will it not let me see it doesn't work you got to tap twice I don't want to have twice tapping twice is too much work look at me look at me screwing it all up go okay oh but don't worry I got past it that's probably the most confusing part in the level it's not that bad all ah all have it under control no time guys don't worry about me yeah yeah look at that look at me look at me do that and then and out happen hop up lie down right side up damn alright I practice it again look at that see how practice makes perfect guys I'm just trying to show you I'm just trying to motivate you in your life to keep doing whatever it is you love and just get better at it okay it is possible ladies and gentlemen I am the master of practice mode Wow seven attempts but it doesn't stop there no no I could go right into this now guys and probably beat it on the first try definitely maybe but one more practice alright it's still not good enough for me I need to be perfect nobody's perfect guys remember that as well okay that's the whole point in practice you wouldn't need to practice if you were perfect now would you I just died three times on this one part gotta love it got a freaking love I gotta redeem myself by not dying on that part right there oh yeah okay what did the held up no new new new new okay I screwed everything up I just screwed everything up my game capture is all out of whack oh god well some bad things just happened but five attempts overall let's do it for real now guys okay let's do it for real watch this crap no mistakes because now I got the music on my side alright none as that boring old practice mode crack now I just got to feel the music okay the music is going to guide me to the end of this level safe and sound one it at zero attempts why even bother having one right yeah uh-huh it's much better when you can hear the music guys much better oh and I didn't just do that I just want the balls give me the balls and no one gets hurt you know the smart thing to do will be to log on every day and get some balls I wouldn't even have to play the game yeah that's the easy way out guys that's maybe maybe that's what I'll do for the next video when I inevitably give up on trying to get all these balls and they'll just I'll just I'll just wait like a week or so make another video I have lots of balls in and aah stupid freakin black orb [ __ ] come on this stresses me out stresses me out what the fight is clicked a little bunch in the game decided to just freeze a little bit it's not first time this happened today guys I don't know what the hell is going on man hey computer start computing all right I did it I got past it now what I kept saying that was the hardest part guys so will I screw anything else up I don't know if I will because I've gotten this damn it froze on me what a fun day it's been friends what a fun day in the geometry dash it's been friends yeah yeah I did it and now I'm going to shut up and win the level - prepare to be amazed and pus oh wow yes I am the master of that part now after doing it twice in a row boom down do that fence again and then and then hold and then bounce and then bounce bounce bounce hold bounce bounce now they okay okay almost screw that up now just follow the arrows buddy follow the arrows the arrows will guide you good oh I didn't follow that arrow but it's okay I'm still going still going not exactly doing what the arrows are telling me but it doesn't matter guys it does not matter because this level is over whoo that was another 12 minutes of my life damn the drain I'm gonna go open up that thing with the key and then I'm gonna go [ __ ] off okay I'm I am rattled I'm rattled right now okay is that fine is it okay to be a little bit pissed off that the game decided to freeze after took me that line to get past that thing SOPA not this one you better have something good in you yeah you do hmm all right you know what you know what okay um let's I'm gonna do a little bit more I'm gonna do a little bit more back to the main levels look at this look at all the orbs they're offering me here guys what if I just took a level I never did before and got a few orbs I will need a hundred orbs look at the theory of everything only 109 at a 324 collected bounce bounce bounce bounce oh this this is easy this is easy stuff right here okay I'm a master now whoa yeah uh-huh oh yeah can't screw me up bro can't screw me up bro can't screw me up bro I'm actually I'm really surprised that I'm doing this right now Wow how far do I get before cuz I won't need a hundred like I said all right okay all right that wasn't even a record really I've already gotten that far in the level god of course I have of course of course I've gotten that far I why would you want to give me any orbs right what why look at me go look at me go oh yeah I'm just collecting orbs right now guys as I speak oh yeah yes that should be enough right oh yeah nice so break where I don't have to do anything okay that wasn't enough that was only that was only another 50 all right you know there's another level I could do instead because that could just forget it right you know I only got only got 68 on electro man adventures let's get a couple more of those ones this is my favorite song an entire game I'm pretty sure it's just so it's so fun okay that was 30 thank you very much good stuff good stuff next level please next level that Club SEP I haven't even tried this one I can just basically just just go through it one time and probably have enough orbs from it so yeah that was 26 what you've enough all right I really wanted to just end that video guys or in this video but no I got a I got to do it now I got to go to this idiot hey idiot wait hang on a second I know where you are there you are hey how you doing hey have you been this is not where I need to be hey buddy hey what's up can I have this master emblem please thank you ah this shiny thing excellent choice I found it a while ago yes I don't is a good word not sure what it does if anyone asks you didn't buy it here I mean might where okay now I go here he's like the master emblem Lord rub rub I will open the gate for you please come in coming in wait you are not rub rub you seem to be skilled in the art of deception but it does not matter your trickery ends here leave now before you cause more problems now I'm open up this what's in it what's in it oh it's the it's the orange key guys I actually got it alright why have you been awoken who cares get out of here I don't need your [ __ ] I don't need you hey buddy it's me I got an orange key for you you find a second key impressive only one lock left and to get this one I need to get another twenty chests like 18 or something they don't have like 30 something done so it is going to take a little while but um eventually we'll work up to it okay I'm going to end this video here thank you guys so much for watching if you enjoyed this video don't forget to leave a like and I'll see you next time

playing jumanji already it's enough who opened pandora's box who opened pandora's box any other questions about my crafting about my acting about my whatever life i am an open book steve did it yep steve helped a lot he got a lot of steve from tumbleboy turnings or whatever he um just like gave me a shout out on his channel which was so awesome and i know a lot of of you guys are here because of steve so thank you steve taco bell taco bell what does that mean i don't understand i can't see like what i'm doing here taco bell i need some i don't do any of these things to give it some height that was flipping scary you can see the fire and the explosion i know it was horrible now they said it was a fireworks fireworks maybe firearms but fireworks i mean and lucky thing lucky thing it was on the um it was on the um port because it wasn't imagine if that was in the middle of the city what films have i been in i have been okay you guys gotta understand i'm an indie film actress so um i've been on a lot of indie films that you probably wouldn't know but that's okay um i've been in like 45 different film projects uh productions they're usually short you know around 20 minutes 30 minutes or so um i have been in a couple now here's the thing now i have been in a couple of those big movies but this is the problem if you don't get an actual speaking role you're pretty much just like a human prop in the background which is great because they pay you really well they pay you well they feed you well um but outside of that i mean as an actor you really don't get any you know it's not challenging it's pretty much yes that's explains the indie part actually my name indiana jones started because i started a blog reviewing um it was for a local drive-in and it was a blog to talk about you know you're gonna watch tonight you're gonna watch you know uh an 80s movie like you know back to the future i remember when and i would be like reminiscing and talking about the film and just you know recommending the film and recommending that the place so i thought oh my gosh indiana jones another a film director friend of mine he was the one that said oh my gosh you should do that it's so perfect that's a perfect name for you trump is calling it an attack oh nitrate also okay i still i don't know i'm still on the fence about it i'm not paying attention to what i'm doing but it's still turning out okay so yes has halloween always been your favorite well you know what as as a child it's always been right oh and then the other thing about my indie acting i started acting right after my husband wasn't sad but true it just it was i wasn't like i went out of my way to do it it just happened it came to me and it was a perfect timing because honestly i was not coping very well with him you know leaving so it helped me really i mean i was going through therapy and stuff it was really bad it was really bad never took drugs thank god but if you need to take drugs to trust but i didn't have to and um it helped me to process a lot of the pain and a lot of the emotions i was going through and it was just what by character acting so um was halloween always been your favorite yes ever since i was a little kid i loved halloween what happened i'm out of the loop um it's my 200th episode tonight lenny so that's why i'm all dressed up we don't need an attack we don't need anything else no no no no they're saying fireworks i think it was firearms i don't know and it was on a port so i i don't know i don't want to talk about it i want to talk about it talk about happy things you like the colors you like it yeah it seems suspicious stay tuned yes but i've always loved halloween as a child and of course when i had my own children i enjoyed making their costumes and trying to dress up with them and you know dressing up the house we have we're we're in a very active neighborhood oh i gotta like release this ah it was holding me in okay let's be happy yes um and i live in a neighborhood where since i moved here like 22 years ago it's always been a very happy neighborhood a lot of kids come by and what's really cute is like kids that came by 22 years ago imagine 22 years when they were two 10 years old now they're 32 and they they still come by they remember this house because i would decorate it and it was always fun and i would dress up

the youtube thing seriously the end of 2017 and why am i by myself uh so it was uh actually i started it on a lark i was retiring at the end of 2017 and i thought you know it would be cool if i could maybe share some of the things that i have picked up over the years with uh new turners out there that are trying to get into the end of the hobby and that and so that my grandchildren might have some kind of a record of uh this is what your granddad did i have 17 grandchildren two grapes and so and the rest pretty much is history and i just keep doing it because i like doing it now i'm back i'm back i just wanted to give billy the spotlight there no not really i screwed it up i got myself out of the studio i'm sitting here thinking oh crap now i'm the only one on and i was like now i'm just giving him time go ahead and talk about it he's like i'm talking about myself because he worked because i wasn't in there [Music] so you have how many grandchildren 17. how many kids i missed five kids three five kids 17 grandkids and two great grandchildren dang you guys catholic or something no and it's man and people always tell me that i look 10 years younger than i am and i keep telling them it's my grandkids to keep me young oh that's sweet that's where's my bowl um that is sweet i mean you would think with that many kids and grandkids you would have like you know more gray hairs but yeah well that and that and santa claus has to look young you know are you do you play santa claus because i have a friend that plays mrs claus do you do santa claus for your town or something no and well i do i i have several santa t-shirts and and because it's just too hot here for the real thing a friend of mine is a member of forbes a fraternal order a real beard santas he's in minnesota

got some t-shirts that look like santa but or santa's outfit and i carry a i carry a leather a small leather it's just kind of a backpack looking thing that i keep candy canes in in december and i hand them out to kids when we're shopping or when we're at the store or whatever but can i tell you something with what you do you should do this you know why because how cool would it be for you to dress up like saying i'm talking to the camera even though you're over here but i'm talking did you dress up like santa and make like wooden toys during the season i would still watch it have you done that no and no i i have not done that i do like jeans and red suspenders and just you know go in there with like a lumber lumberjack kind of shirt and just like start saying hi i'm santa you know you

looking at me and i said who do i look like and they said the little boy said santa and i said shh i'm on vacation and so i ran into him i ran into the same brother and sister a little while later in the elevator again and this time this 12 or 13 year old really bratty girl gets on and and there's a 16 year old i don't know i'm guessing 16 year old girl behind me anyway the the 13 year old girl the door opens up and there's uh two older ladies standing outside of color and uh she said and they and the the ladies said is there room for more and there was right and naughty girl said no we're full and i stopped the door and i said yes there's room y'all come on and one of the ladies just looked at me and shook her head and she said no we'll wait and i was i that was just people just kill me sometimes but so we go on to the next floor bratty girl gets out and i looked at the two little ones and i said she's definitely on the naughty list oh good and the 16 year old behind me just fell out that is a good story i know there are some nasty people out there there are and people are not raising their children right now it just kills me kids do they don't have manners i know i don't know

the next one cuz uh you don't get that W [Music] [Music]", "NiaPli8UDB0": "welcome to episode 4 of mmm medical edibles I'm chef Tynan Nicole chef and culinary nutritionist and today we're gonna make flavored candy also known as Jolly Ranchers this episode is sponsored by fat bull and the new ill-mannered film series custom agents check it out on our channel in our playlist section the following are the ingredients you'll need to make the candies okay today's ingredients are sugar light corn syrup flavored oil food coloring water vegetable oil Keith and confectioner sugar for this recipe will be using Keith if you'd like to learn how to deke are pure Keith you can go ahead and watch episode 3 this Keith is from this tangerine dream are you high for today's recipe what you'll need is a candy thermometer a pastry brush and several spatulas I prefer silicon some candy mullets metal measuring spoons and a large saucepan start with your large saucepan our first ingredient is 2 cups of sugar and I like to sift the sugar in case there are any large lumps that's annoying next we'll add 3/4 cups of water which I've already pre-measured here for this next part I recommend you pre grease your container with a little bit of vegetable oil spray that way the corn syrup won't stick to it and you'll get the correct measurement oh yeah got any grease yes I also recommend you do this with your spatula as well and your measuring tool I'm just gonna use this to make sure it's all coated okie dokie for this we're using a 1/3 measuring cup all of the tools have been sprayed with vegetable oil now we're going to measure out the light corn syrup we need 2/3 of a cup so we'll measure 1/3 of a cup twice you can see that the syrup is not sticking normally you have to fight for it to come out we're gonna do this again now that we've measured out our corn syrup we'll just add it to the rest of the ingredients and you can see how easily it comes out of the bowl now we're going to take this over to the stove this next part of the recipe is going to take some time so you want to make sure that you can really pay attention to the saucepan on the stove you want to watch what you're doing make sure you're not on the phone or distracted you don't necessarily have to attend to it in terms of storing or mixing it but you were going to be watching the temperature because we want to make sure that we get the right consistency for our Jolly wrenches it can go from soft candy to hard candy to burn candy the mixture can easily burn and then the taste is going to be really off you'll still be able to eat it but probably will not be enjoyable so make sure you have time to pay attention that way you won't have to start over from scratch and waste your batch you want to turn the stove on to a medium heat you're gonna stir your mixture until the sugar dissolves you can see that it's sticking a little bit so just put some elbow grease in it oh that's greasy that's really [ __ ] I said yeah it's greasy get in the corners because sometimes the sugar tends to clump up together on the bottom and then once you see the sugars pretty much dissolve you can just leave that alone we're gonna use our candy thermometer and you want to make sure that you don't put the bottom of the thermometer to the bottom of the saucepan because then they'll give you an inaccurate reading I put a little bit of water in here what you're gonna do is you're going to take your pastry brush and just dip it a little bit in the water and then I'm gonna wash down the stuck sugar crystals onto the mixture you don't want that to interfere with how the candy comes together you can see that the mixture is coming to a boil and that's perfectly fine we're waiting for it to reach 260 degrees so once the temperature of the candy reaches 260 degrees you're going to add your food coloring okay you can get this at any grocery store and we're actually gonna do the mint green color for the green apple flavor that we're doing today and that's just following the instructions on the box start with nine green drops and 3 yellow drops and then we'll see what that looks like and then adjust the color accordingly if we need you we just need about one or two more degrees some more and then we can add the food coloring one two three nine well once you've added the food coloring you're not going to mix it at all you're going to just let the boiling action mix it itself it looks like it's a nice bright green I added a little bit more yellow because it was just a little bit too much of a grass green than a green apple green I passed on grass all the time the minty green gives more of a green apple tone to it we've pulled the pan off the stove at 300 degrees we're gonna add green apple flavoring to this I'm adding a full tablespoon you want to keep all of the essential oil with in the saucepan and now we're gonna add our Keef as well now remember this has already been decart so we don't have to worry about that and we just need to get it off the paper there we go star very quickly you don't want the essential oils to evaporate completely this may smoke so I have my lid ready and because we're using Keith versus BHO you may not have the same uniformity but this came out really really good all right we're gonna lift the lid on and now you're gonna take your candy moles and spray them with vegetable so the color looks really good I try not to over pour it if you have someone that can help you they can kind of shimmy the candy tray so that all of the portions are pretty equal I've done this several times so I have a pretty good grasp on it the colors of these Jolly Ranchers look really really good they're really bright and green they have a uniform texture to it you can't see the keep at all I can't even see it in these when you pour these you want to have a very steady stream and a steady hand the higher you go the smaller the stream will be but just remember that the candy cools very quickly you just want to make sure that each one has about two-thirds full these green Apple Jolly Ranchers are for Bernadette price we'll be seeing her later in New York what would be filming a video for the new Sean price out and they have compressed show senator so they don't we'll put a link to it in the description I hope you like them you want a lot of these two completely cool for this recipe we made 200 pieces using five grams key so I use all silicone tools because as you can see the candy is all on it all up on it so I usually just run it under hot water along with the saucepan and any other tools and I find that it cleans very easily some of the mixture fell onto this silicone pad that I have here and that's actually completely cooled it cooled we're gonna stack the candy rolled trays just the silicone mat with confectioner sugar and then we can pop them out of the candy molds that will prevent them from sticking to each other I also have a container with the lid that also has confectioner sugar on the inside and then we can store them into the freezer [Music] by spraying the moles with vegetable spray it allows that the candies come out very easily you can see that there are really nice bright green the Keef is evenly distributed throughout the candy you really don't see very many speckles at all if any I like to sprinkle in between now let's go grab a sandwich bag and use it as a glue here we are green Apple Jolly Ranchers if you want to make these sour candies you can just add some citric acid to the bowl and shake it you want to make sure that all the powdered sugar is coated on each and every one of these so what I like to do at the end is put a bunch of powdered sugar on the top put the lid on and just shake it vigorously before I put it in to ensure that they're all individually coated this is episode 4 of mmm medical edibles please subscribe comment and give us a green thumbs up that was awesome [Music] I'm rolling up all your good and all your gun [Music] this is not for you no chocolate for your dog you", "O9wOZxRgPRc": "welcome to specific gloves today we're gonna show you how my dad made his own backyard zipline I wanted to ride on a zipline for a long time but just never got around to it so I decided to build one from my backyard I first looked around for the best area and found two trees which are on a small hill the trees are about 80 feet apart and large in diameter which will make this location fun and sturdy i next gathered some heavy-duty parts to keep this safe the galvanized steel wire is 5/16 inch in diameter which should be strong enough for my use and to hold the wire I'm using some 5/16 inch stainless steel u-bolts now to protect the treaty's I constructed a simple wrap with some old carpet and two by fours I cut the wood to roughly 7 inches and use my router table to make a groove in the middle of each I then lay them out and attached a strip of old carpet to the back of them with some screws I then repeated this process so I could wrap both trees to help minimize the riders from bumping the ground I chose to install a cable about ten feet up the tree which made installing the wrap a little more dangerous I flipped the carpet around the tree and evened it out and then added a few nails to hold it in place this should protect the tree from the constant rubbing of the cable I then repeated the process on the second tree next step was installing the cable which turned out to be a little more challenging than I expected I first started with wrapping the lower tree making sure the wire went into the wood grooves and tighten it up with the u-bolts and during that time my wife stretched out the rest of the cable I then moved up the hill to the second tree but the weather quickly changed on us and I had to wait until the next day the next morning I used that nylon toe strap and a cable puller also known as it come along to take the slack out of the hanging wire this is a little dangerous to do on a ladder so be very careful if you use this process now picked up three of these u-bolts here that should give it plenty of strength on this end I've done the same on the other end to also have a little piece of a wire comes back and straps to the tree right back there so that way as people are getting ready with the roller they can hook a carabiner here just do that a little extra out of security said they don't immediately roll down and that way they can have a lot of fun safely next I needed a braking system to keep people from hitting the bottom tree so I grab some more scrap two-by-fours and connected them together with four screws I then drilled a hole where the two boards met I then draw the second hole through the side of the two boards just slightly offset the first hole goes around the wire cable and the second was for a heavy-duty I bolt I then loosen the screws and secured it around the cable over time this break will need to be replaced from where and it will be easy to make another one to secure the break I use a spiral ground anchor and some heavy-duty bungee type shock cord now for the handle I use some one-inch PVC pipe that I drilled on the ends and added some strong paracord the pulley setup was a heavy-duty version I purchased on Amazon and I'll put the link to that in the description below and it was now time for testing test number one I hope this goes well at this point I realized the handle was way too low and I almost dragged across the ground so I lifted it up and tried again alright I've raised this up some and now we're going to test number two and now my son wanted to give it a try now the process of having fun with a zip line on here my son sometimes an issue trying to get this handle backed up to the starting position was actually quite funny I caught a little footage for you right here so that keep him from getting hurt trying to sling this up we added an additional string right here just to make it a bit easier it hangs down a lot lower so that he can easily pull it up now also in the process of building this my wife asked me to make some type of a seat so that she can sit on it and write it down so I took an old piece of whatever it covered from another playground and I glued two layers together to give it a lot more strength then I drill a hole through the center and I attach a large heavy-duty rope through the center and attached it to the carabiner now she can have a lot of fun going down a zipline now when it comes to building a zipline I am NOT an expert at this I built this at a safety standards I felt it would be safe for my family to do it on my property now if you're planning on building a zip on make sure you do a lot of research find out what the standards are in what you should do to make sure that it is safe for you and your family because you don't want anybody to get hurt with that said let's test out this seat and the seat worked great and one more thing if you've noticed in these videos all we're using is they ladder to go up the tree to get on the zipline and if you're gonna use that over and over again that can be a little dangerous especially if it ever falls so in the next video I'm going to be building a short little tree platform that goes right in that location so it's much easier to get to that zipline you can have a lot more fun a lot safer now if you liked this video make sure you click like button and tell us what you think about it in comments I also have a couple other videos here that go along with their backyard upgrades to make sure you check those out you", "gc_eMWk55ZI": "[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "qpTEisrvjNM": "oh we

it's on fire if you look inside it's like this gushy boozy substance over there I think we broke it you see that as weird so it does not become chronic candy I thought it would because it's a powder oh it's just what we eat to make herself feel better Oh ding so if you heat up this I guess medicine packet and centrifuge it and then just turn it like this not the most appealing thing but then again medicine it's not the greatest thing either I mean it's good but it's nasty does the emergency cotton candy yuck right next up we have warheads this is one of the sour is candy you can buy in the store we grind it up a whole bunch it looks like this pretty pretty look at that it's kind of cool but my question is will it become cotton candy well let me just take one warhead will let me come corn candy yes look at this look at the color though it's like yellow this looks our just looking at it like look at that I can't believe it I cannot believe this wow I can't believe it so it looks like this has a little bit of yellow texture pretty cool what does it taste like is it sour let me find out yeah pretty shower dude looks pretty good though it's like it's weird but it tastes like warhead just sound like we're heads but it's calm candy so this war has become Gong candy yes next we have Jolly Rancher who wind it up it looks like this it looks absolutely that pretty look how nice this is it's like you're going to a crystal plant in and you're just like happy look at that so let's take some of this Jolly Rancher that has been grinded up alright well calling Rancher cotton candy here we go three two one yes it does but it's like it's slow it's more like spider webby I guess the consistency of it made it really really silky it's nice actually it's pretty cool whoa Jolly Rancher oh look at this whoa what the you ever watch Dragon Ball Z oh it's like a tail and you can squish it and it's like literally you can put it in your back and it's like a tail look at me I'm a good boy good boy hey your breath stinks you want some tic tacs we grind it up a whole bunch of tic tacs it's just a breath mint er will take tax become calm candy three two one yeah okay oh it does but it's not as sweaty and silky as the Jolly Rancher it looks kind of spooky like what you see in Halloween whenever you go trick-or-treating and you see all like this step on it put your face in it and like oh shoot the spider you die alright anyways a spoonful that only generated up to this taste why is it probably tastes really good here we go oh this is gonna whip us the texture is still there except it melts in your mouth except it's thick is that make sense it's thick but it melts in your mouth at the same time tick-tock yes I need your help we have a rock candy if you think in okana candy it tastes like it will because it's straight-up sugar except it's hardened sugar if you grind up rock candy it looks like this pretty cool so we're gonna use the rock candy as the conch and stick rock candy will it become con candy three two one yes it does look at that if you twist it like left in the ride rather than around around kind of gives you this like flat top what look at this what do you think this looks like let me know in the comments this looks like a brain this looks like my brain specifically is it good mm-hmm next up we have this one whether is original you can find this at trick or treating I'm a lot of people throw this away when they see it this is a candy like to say yuck but will it become con candy let's find out so we crushed up a bunch of these weather's nasty ones just curious okay it has a little bit of like milk products in there here we go well weather has become calm candy let's go and go oh what does oh okay cool this was a little bit brown now okay I guess if it's mostly sugar it doesn't matter how much milk is in there but as long as it's like sugary enough it will become con candy look at this this is probably so gross though woah look at it it's a little bit Brown kind of cool okay here we go don't get me wrong yes it's good well it's kind of bad yeah alright next up we have cough drops okay this is another kind of medicine basically just candy medicine okay well cough drops to calm con candy what better way to get rid of your cough that's econ again right but the question is we saw what happened to the other medicine oh dang let's see what happens with the cough drops here we go oh alright I was a little bit unsure at first but uh good cough drops specifically Ricola if you have a calm candy machine and you have Ricola and you have coughs try it here we go oh you don't know what we call a cough drops are well we got another coughs job we have hauls a more poplar ran hauls cough drops this is the orange flavor I mean by the looks of it it might because you see some crystallization going on but it is medicine and it will catch on fire that's why we have no fire extinguisher because we trust this con can you so much we could literally just pull you up okay so hulls can become corn candy as well it's just so cool look at that look at that okay this is all we got I still have it next up we have fun dip okay you guys know this you dip your in fun in the dip okay we have this stick what people usually do they go like this and then they go like that and they use their spit as the stick glue but will it become gone guarantee let's find out here we go we're pouring the dip here nothing next up we have Tang orange flavored drink powder well this become fond candy I don't know I really don't know if this one will but it's worth the try here we go oh yes it does but it's like little like speckles of it look it's on the microphone look at that maybe bad the microphones are great you hungry next up we have a lollipop so we grind it up a blue version of this it's probably gonna work Wow it works let's put some tic-tacs for a little bit of a warheads put all the Jolly Ranchers might as well just do everything yeah all right so if you compile everything it turns into cotton candy which is it okay guys it's been about like a minute it's still going I don't know how we managed to get a bowl here but we have a bowl yeah let's see what this tastes like if I combine all of these flavors together I really don't know what it'll taste like oh my gosh it's still going on just put more oh my goodness it gave us you bet Bowl anymore look at my hands it's so dirty all right my question is what does it taste like [Music] tastes like cough drops sour skittles lure heads it's a some real thanks for watching eat", "BEymcUrUC94": "what's up guys it's Shelby and I haven't made a video in a while and I have a lot of monster I'm not sponsored by monster but I might like to be that's not a twitch I'm winking at you anyway I know that you guys love to watch me torture myself and all sorts of creative ways so the warhead challenge so basically what I'm gonna do in my version of the warhead challenge I'm just gonna put them all in my mouth and see how long I can keep them in there I am completely unprepared and I have nothing to split them into so this will be really interesting because these candies are salad I pull another it's like neighbors can hand me what song is that even anymore we don't know I there's no way I'm the only person I can't even open these all right so a lot of these melted and it's just a mess look I can't even open half of them so here I have 10 sour warheads and I'm going to shove them all in my mouth whoo I'm dropping things already this is going great for your and enjoy dude then move on now ready ohhohh okay [Music] oh my god [Music] ah [Applause] I have literally tears I can't even feel my mouth Wow guys that was a fail I've seen people actually do this challenge where they eat solid 50 of them and I can't even imagine how bad that would hurt because literally just keeping the ton of those in my mouth for as long as I did burnt my tongue so bad like uh literally left sores on my tongue there's stuck to my leg but this results in it the comments and thumbs up and make a video response and share it on all of your social networks and do all sorts of things that make me really excited and do all these Qian gestures if I can't stop low weight", "nWh-clmBWsc": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] hi guys this is the first year I'm gonna try solar Christmas lights and I'm gonna try these out so that you don't waste your money if they're not any good so I've had these things sitting out here they got a couple hours of light last night before the Sun went down we've got them all up here charging we've got lots of sets as you can see I've got one set that's multicolor I plan to put on my mailbox out front because there's no access to electricity out there and we're gonna see how they do how long they last the different modes they have they have solid mode and they also have blinking modes all right guys there's 72 feet with 200 LED light bulbs on this thing these are multicolored I'm gonna put it on this mailbox setup we got here see how that goes all right we've got a little stand here a stake that will point the solar panel in this direction that we need it to point [Music] slides right in here like that got your on/off power switch and your multimode switch and our Sun comes up this way [Music] okay guys here we have it we're all done I've got the lights spiraled around from bottom all the way up and wraps around there too all the way up to the top lamppost now we'll see how that works out come back out here as soon as the Sun Goes Down see how bright these things are and then we'll come out through the evening through the night and see how many hours we get out of these things another thing I got this year or these uh box of clips I think there's 500 of these I didn't realize the quantity I was getting I didn't know it was gonna be this big of a box but I'm glad it is I can use these all around the house and as I add more lights year after year I can resort to these to help hang the lights up you can use them in all different types of ways they've got a description here on how you can use these things hanging from your gutters all sorts of things from your shingles so I'll leave a link to these below as well hey guys I want to show you how these hooks work on the gutters work really well just clip the one like that snaps right into place right over that lip of the gutter and you can hook your Christmas lights down on the lower hook or on the upper hull to here they work really well [Music] alright guys I'm getting the lights up there going really well I'm starting on my second string so in this section alone from here all the way down this is how long one string is with two hundred lights ends right there so now I'm running another one right along over that one so we're gonna have a total of 400 LED light bulbs we're gonna test these solar lights out I got them running all around my house here right up there it's starting to get close to dusk my landscape lighting is on and I got to come around the front of the garage and I also put some out here along the top edge all along here of the fence and I've got a total of four sets weaved in and out of here there's two solar panels right here and they're aimed right at the Sun the Sun sets over that way it comes up right through here so those will get the Sun during the day and I got two other solar panels like that on the other end and they're weaved in and out the top posts there so you figure there's 200 per solar panel we've got a total of 400 LED lights strung up on there these are all the white twinkle lights and then out there at the mailbox I've got multicolored out there at the mailbox alright guys I'm gonna go see if we have any light jet about six o'clock and you know since we've turned the clocks back it's getting dark earlier now hey guys look we got some lights up there alright guys we have our fence solar lights up working and finally I didn't have it turned on our mailbox post light this one is multicolored solar lights it's looking really really good here it is with car lights driving by so they're still pretty bright you've got a lot of them this is just one string of 200 bulbs and as we look back at the house from this distance and there's some lights the garage lights are on and stuff but you can still see them you can see them up on the roofline and down the sidewalk the fence [Music] [Music] I've got the house lights on a different mode [Music] and let's look back in the mailbox [Music] alright guys one more time we went out here to check on our solar-powered Christmas lights [Music] everything still looks good [Music] still impressed and we're going about three to four hours after the sunset now remember they say these could last up to 10 hours or more so if they last like this up to 10 hours or more I'm good I like these there's our mailbox post light [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "5-gIY7HuJNo": "they honestly turned out so good and I'm also going to show you guys how to make a coating on them that's like sour and fizzy kind of like on like the root beer ones you can buy at the store so these are actually like legitimate gummy bears instead of just like Harding jello like a lot of recipes have let me just show you them so you can see the texture of this is like really sticky this is what's making your gummy bears actually be like real store-bought guy bears and not just jello so here's the texture of the gummy make sure when it's still warm so you can really see that string yes this is just like candy nothing like just hard jello that you see recipes for so you know this is gonna be a good one so chewy just like the ones you buy in the store like they're so stretchy just like a gummy bear and like they're fizzy when you eat them so good hey guys welcome back today I'm going to show you how to make Mountain Dew soda bottle gummies I'm going to be using coconut oil to infuse mine but you can use butter or a tincture all three of those options will work for this recipe you're going to need some soda you don't have to use Mountain Dew you can use whatever flavor you like you'll need some jello I chose line because it's the closest to Magic Mountain Dew without like over powering and I'm do flavour some gelatin citric acid corn syrup lecithin potassium sorbate mixture which will keep your products shelf stable so you don't have to put it in the fridge you can just keep it in a drawer or in your car or whoever and I'll post the link for how to make this and some coconut oil you can also use butter or a teacher I actually would prefer to use a tincture for this but I don't have any right now so I'm just going to use coconut oil I made them last night and they turned out really well with the coconut oil I feel like you can taste the coconut oil flavor a little bit more than if you were to use like a tincture but whatever you would like to choose you can use because I made quite a bit yesterday for this recipe I'm going to do a smaller amount in the description box below I'll put the measurements for what I'm doing today but you can make whatever amount you like just multiply the recipe I have it below to make this recipe we're going to have to reduce our soda so that we can get the flavor without too much liquid we need half a cup of soda and then we're going to reduce it to a quarter cup alright we have half a cup here we're going to put on a stove on high and we're going to move let this cook for however long tanks to do half of the mixture so I'm just kind of going to have to eyeball it and see where it is and when it looks like it's a little bit lower I'll pour back my measuring cup and see where I'm at so we started with half a cup so we wanted to be 1/4 cup this will probably take about like 15 minutes now that we have our soda on the stove reducing we're going to prepare our gelatin so we're going to put 1/4 of a cup of our soda into a why dish dish so 1/4 cup and we'll just pour it into a dish and then we're going to put our gelatin on we need one and a half tablespoons of gelatin alright so we put 1/4 cup of soda into this bowl and then we're going to sprinkle a tablespoon and a half of gelatin on top so we're just going to sprinkle it lightly over so we can get as much much coverage as possible so that's one tablespoon and then we're going to do half tablespoon for a total of one and a half tablespoons then we're going to add 1/4 to 1/2 of a jello of flavored jello pack so yesterday I made these with more regular gelatin and no jello pack I need these ones here and while he turned out good I felt like the flavor wasn't strong enough and it needed like a little bit more flavor so I thought this time around I would add a little bit of jello so it can be anywhere between a quarter and a half of this depending on how much flavor you think you want so you can always take this out and measure it but I can just eyeball it we're going to sprinkle this on top so it may be like a third of it and then we're just gonna leave this we're not gonna stir it in we're not gonna do anything with it we're just going to leave it here and by the time you get back around to it most of the gelatin will have absorbed absorbed into the soda now we're going to add an a quarter of a teaspoon of this potassium sorbate mixture again I'll put a link down below this is gonna help it so you don't have to keep it in the fridge you can keep this outside in the fridge it's just like regular got me to buy from a store and then we're going to do a quarter teaspoon of citric acid the citric acid is not necessary it's just if you like them a little bit more sour if you don't have citric acid you could crush up vitamin C tablets and those who work as well so we're doing one quarter teaspoon and then we're gonna add in a teaspoon of lecithin I only have the pill capsules cuz that's what was cheaper for me to buy but if you can buy the liquid kind it would be a lot easier because it'll save you from having to bust these open now my coconut oil already has less of shin in it so I'm not going to add too much this mixture but if your coconut oil doesn't have less its it lecithin in it then you might want to add a little bit more of this so I'm just gonna do one for mine if I had the liquid kind I could just pour oh I probably would just do a quarter teaspoon so this is gonna help bind the coconut oil together with the gelatin liquid mixture so that our coconut oil doesn't separate from everything else and like I said I have more of this already in my coconut oil so I don't need too much in here but if you don't have any in your coconut oil you're going to want to add a bit more to your jello mixture and I barely even got out any with the pills really actually just by the liquid all right now let's check in on our soda we started with half a cup and you need to reduce it to a quarter cup so I'm just going to pour it directly right back into my measuring cup and see we're at all right looks like we're exactly a quarter cup which means I probably should have checked on this sooner that way I couldn't have reduced it too much but if you do end up reducing you too much just throw it away and do it again soda can always be replaced all right so I'm just going to pour my reduced quarter cup of soda back into the pot and then I'm going to add a quarter cup of corn syrup now this is the most important thing for your gummies to be like a real store-bought gummy so corn syrup helps but will helps the most is having the sugar heat it to a high enough temperature to get it almost to the softball stage so I'm gonna use a candy thermometer for that I know most people aren't going to have one of these but if you are planning on making gummies often I usually just purchasing one they're probably like something like ten dollars and they can be very helpful with making your dimes so I'm trying to put it on here and we're going to try and eat this to 230 degrees Fahrenheit now because you guys most of you guys won't have a candy thermometer I'm going to try and see if I could help you out by just telling you the time so I'm going to turn this on high and I'm going to set a timer on my phone or a stopwatch so I started to now and we'll see what time rats when this is got into 230 degrees Fahrenheit all right so we're four minutes in and we're at 180 degrees Fahrenheit and we're waiting for this to go to 230 degrees Fahrenheit so it looks like it's starting to thicken a tiny bit but it's still pretty much all liquid it will started thinking a bit when it gets closer to 30 now you want to be careful to not go over to 30 that's why having a candy thermometer it's good because if you don't have one you can easily within 30 seconds to a minute go over temperature and then it becomes too hard so while having it to that higher temperature we'll give you that real kind bear consistency if you don't have the candy thermometer just ear on the side of not too long because you don't want to ruin it but luckily this is just sugar and soda so if we wreck this mixture and just throw it away and that's why we add the coconut oil after so that we make sure that this mixture is perfect before we add our coconut oil or a tincture or butter that way we're not risking wasting it all right we're at 210 degrees and it's moving up fast so we got to keep an eye on it now now I'm not gonna leave I'm not gonna leave this unattended I'm just gonna watch it up until the moment it gets to 230 Thunder 8 minutes and we're at to 3000 or at 2:30 so we have to take this off now take that off the heat immediately see how fast that happens holy yeah eight minutes on high heat okay this is getting a little too hot so I'm gonna go hold it by the fridge so it doesn't heat up anymore all right so we see how fast the temperature can go up so if you don't have a candy thermometer be very careful to really not let it get too hot you do want it to get as high as you can safely without your candy thermometer because that is what gives a texture the gummy bears but it is hard to do it with other thermometer so I just took this off the heat and left it for about like five minutes so I can demonstrate to you guys what happens here so you can see the texture of this is like really sticky this is what's making your gummy bears actually be like real store-bought guy bears and not just jello so this is the key out this they're just going to be like hard and jello so that's kind of like what it looks like and this is gonna melt back down when we put it back on the stove and mix in our coconut oil now I'm going to turn the heat on like medium I'm going to add two tablespoons of my coconut oil so have some medium heat and stirring in the coconut oil with the soda and corn syrup mixture that we just brought to 230 degrees now we don't want to add in the coconut oil right after it hits 230 we want to take it off the heat we want to let it cool for a little bit like I would say five minutes is fine because we don't want to be adding the coconut oil for something that's 230 degrees because that's too hot all right we're just stirring this in and you can see that it's not actually combining so there's the oil and there is the corn syrup mixture so we're going to need to get a whisk to combine this a little bit better now we're just going to try and stir like this we don't want ki to be too high medium or medium low is good now we're gonna add in our gelatin mixture which is gonna help bind this okay this is getting too hot you can see so I'm gonna turn the heat down to low just take that off for a minute so don't have that I'm too high I would say medium low will be perfect now we're going to add in our gelatin mixture so clearly I had that too warm I should not be bubbling that much so I know I said to put it on medium heat do not put it on medium do medium low or low okay now we just have to be patient and let it melt a bit more so this is the hardest part is getting this all to combine because the texture of the corn syrup might stay chunky and then it won't mix properly but if we keep it at a low enough heat and mix it in with the whisk we should be able to properly combine it and you do want to make sure you have the lesser thin to help emulsify it so this is going to take a while probably going to take about five minutes with me stirring this all in make sure you're patient and you don't turn up the heat trying to melt this fast because that just won't work out well so just keep it at low or medium low to stir this in and do it slowly and by slowly I don't mean whisking slowly but just take your time you can see the chunks are less stuck together now it's starting to combine now you want to make sure before you do this you have your molds prepared so just lay your molds oh and put them on a tree that way as soon as this is done you can pour them in the difference with this and most of the gumming recipes you see online is that this one has a different texture using that corn syrup and heating it up to that own soft ball point so it does harden really fast it is really sticky so once this is done and we're going to want to put it into the molds as soon as we can so I've been stirring this for close to 5 minutes now and almost everything has combined just a couple chunks left on my whisk so I'm just going to push those out with a spatula she's looking really good you can see it has that stringy texture it's not just like liquidy so it looks like it's just about all mix perfectly - that one little chunk there and this took about ten minutes of slowly stirring incorporating on low heat so now we're going to put this into our molds I'm using one of these to put it into my mold but you can also use the little droppers that works fine I just find that this is easier and if you're making a lot of gummies this is really useful overtime to spend like five dollars or whatever it was now I'm going to turn the heat off and pour this mixture right into my little squeezy container if you're going to use the little dropper you can put this on a hot pad and do it directly here whatever works for you okay now use ones I guess that's just a snack for me so that's alright so here's the texture of the gummy make sure when it's still warm she can really see that string yes this is just like candy nothing like just hard jello that you see recipes for so you know this is gonna be a good one so chewy just like the ones you buy in the store alright so I just wrap a towel around here because it's a little bit hot and it's right off the stove and I'm just going to put these into all of my molds you can also just use any molds going bury molds or find you now let's just put these into the fridge it shouldn't take too long probably about 10 minutes all right now we'll just take them out of the mold they were in the fridge for about 20 minutes you can see how they're kind of different than regular jello gummies like they really have that like that sticky gummy bear texture and that stickiness will go away after they dry out for a bit and we put their coating on you all right so now for coating on them I did in three different ways I did one with sugar coating one with a fizzy coating and then some with no coding so the ones on the top here I was just sugar so I just shook it in a container of sugar and put it back on the tray and then for the fizzy coating it's one third of a cup of sugar one teaspoon citric acid and then I'm going to say 1 teaspoon baking soda but that was too much baking soda so do half a teaspoon baking soda instead so here's that teaspoon of baking soda but like I said we're going to use half a teaspoon not a full teaspoon like I did you could taste it too much and I'm just gonna mix that up quickly once I just shake that up I'm gonna add the gummies into it shake it again and put them back on the tray the one thing I do want to mention with this recipe is you can put them in their sugar or citric acid mixture as soon as they come out of their mold whereas with some of the jello recipes you need them to drive it first these ones you don't need to do that so you can put them on right away in that way you can make sure they really stick whereas if they get too dry they won't the sugar won't stick to the outside of the gummy and if that does happen to you you can just spray them with a little bit of water and just wipe them off so they're a little bit damp and that stickiness comes back and that should work for you quite honestly I kind of enjoyed them with nothing on them the most but I really did enjoy the fizzy sugary coating anyways that's all you guys I hope you enjoyed this video please comment if you try it out and if you did enjoy it please

old in 936 he started an elective monarchy which somehow always elected the oldest son his son harold bluetooth yep bluetooth unified denmark and converted to christianity in 1375 mcgregor the first the only other female monarch unified denmark sweden and norway into the colomar union 200 years later christian iv built things fought sweden a whole bunch and nearly bankrupted denmark along the way by 1660 fellow iii decided that elections and girls were stupid and declared an absolute hereditary male-only monarchy but in the 19th century there were no more male heirs and a succession crisis culminated in fedor vii giving up absolute power in a new constitution in 1849. christian the 10th tried to bring back absolute power in 1920 but failed only to regain popularity as a symbol of danish resistance during world war ii in 1972 the current monarch joining migrated to annan became queen in her family is her husband henrikh who died in 2018 and two sons felik and joachim prince jocom has two sons with ex-wife countess alexandra prince nicolai and prince felix and kids with current wife princess murray prince henrik and princess athena chrome prince felix is the heir apparent and married to crown princess mary from australia they have four children prince christian who's second in line for the crown princess isabella and twins prince vincent and princess josephine while i catch my breath how about you guys go ahead and subscribe to our channel and be sure to hit the bell icon so you get notified every time we drop new videos on thursdays derek take it away now i'm not going to say anything bad about the brits but when it comes to denmark the royal family members are extremely accomplished let's start with her royal majesty queen magaletta she speaks five languages she studied at cambridge the sorbonne and the london school of economics she's also an acclaimed artist and has had her work displayed in galleries and on postage stamps did you know that she even illustrated the danish version of the lord of the rings that's right she used the pen name igahil grathmer and sent her artwork to jrr tolkien he was blown away by how much her illustrations matched the style he was going for for the book speaking of books she's also an accomplished translator and has even translated works from french and other languages into danish with all of her leftover spare time she's even designed costumes for the royal danish ballet and other stage performances way to go another thing about the danish royal family is they are absolutely passionate about athletics and sport the family often attends the olympics and conference felik is even a member of the international olympic committee he has a personal connection to the olympics as well having met khan princess mary at the sydney olympics in 2000 the family has even won an olympic medal as the queen's niece princess natalie won a bronze medal in 2008 but when it comes to athletes in the royal family there's few better than crown prince frack although he never made it to the olympics himself he's an avid sportsman he's participated in iron mans and marathons and long-distance cross-country events in his youth he was a frogman which is the danish version of a navy seal and to celebrate his 50th birthday he organized what's known as the royal run where he ran five different races in five different danger cities and now it's become an annual tradition another great thing about the danish royal family is they never ever worried about the skin color of their future danish princes now one of the biggest things that came out of oprah's interview with prince harry and meghan markle was that somebody in the british royal family allegedly questioned what the skin color of their baby would look like now the danish royal family got over this a long time ago because the queen's youngest son first wife was alexandra and she was biracial way before meghan markle was even on the scene in britain in fact she was born in hong kong and is of mixed-race chinese and european descent and trust me when i say this nobody ever worried about what their babies were going to look like and i'll tell you one thing the answer was good their oldest son prince nikolai you may have seen walking on the runways in burberry's fashion shows he's 21 years old and his 18 year old brother prince felix is already a teenage heartthrob and another cool thing is that both of them have the title of prince so they're already starting out a little bit better than baby archie another fun thing about the danish royal family is that when countries need a monarchy they call on the danes denmark is the kind of country that everybody loves and that's been true throughout european history and geopolitics as well denmark is big enough that it matters and has some influence but not so big they can upset the balance of power now let me explain for example in the 1860s the greeks overthrew their monarchy because they were tired of their german-born king but they still needed someone to lead their country and they weren't quite ready for real democracy so this is how the danish-born prince william became the great king george the first he got to move up in the world from being the second son of the king to being king of his own country and fun fact he's actually the grandfather of prince philip norway took a similar approach when norway gained his independence in 1905 they also wanted a monarch for their own and that's how prince carl of denmark became king hawking vii of norway he offered the norwegians three important things a little bit of norwegian blood a british wife and most importantly a son who is ready to be an heir and denmark not only provides kings but queens also the king christian ix was known as the father-in-law of europe because of his six children four of them set on a throne to his kings to his queens his oldest son of course became the king of denmark and we already mentioned his second son george the first of greece but two of his daughters got to sit on thrones also one married the eventual tsar of russia and the other the eventual king of the united kingdom in fact he would love to have his family come back and visit him during the summer and when that happened that meant among his grandchildren there were five future monarchs of europe playing in the fields of the royal pals were the future kings of denmark norway russia the united kingdom and greece now another reason to get into the danish royal family is the awesome australian crown princess mary now mike already mentioned that she met her husband prince frank at the olympics in sydney that was in the year 2000 before william started dating his commoner princess kate middleton i guess princess mary was the original princess diaries sorry kate another reason that mary is such an icon is the amazing charity work that she does it's all done through the mary fonda or the mary foundation her charity work has impacted the lives of school kids all over denmark from ages 0 to 8. it fights bullying and is even being implemented in greenland iceland and estonia her other charity work includes helping families and victims of domestic violence and fighting loneliness throughout denmark i guess she's been a little bit busy this year she's also the first royal anywhere to be an official patron of world pride it's going to be held in copenhagen this year in 2021 thanks girl another neat thing about denmark's royal family is they truly are a symbol of the nation now for derek and i as americans there's still a lot of novelty living in a monarchy after all we come from a place where our leaders are politicians and so you always have a case where half the country isn't happy with who's in charge but we think it's really nice having a national figure that can float above politics especially in times of crisis an example of this was during world war ii when king christian the tenth became a national symbol of defiance in the face of german occupation every day he would ride his horse jubilee through the streets of copenhagen without a guard additionally danes would wear pins with his royal cipher a scene an x on them as a symbol of danish patriotism in the face of occupation now these stories are true but many legends grew out of king christian the tenth rule during world war ii for one it's been often written that christian the tenth were a yellow armband to be in solidarity with danish jews now this story isn't true for one danish jews never wore any yellow armbands or yellow stars because they were never required to during the occupation but for certain king christian and the danish government made sure to protect the danish jews and in fact organized a heroic operation to rescue them into sweden a great story for another video another example of this occurred in 2020 when kane vega went on tv to tell all of us to wash our hands stay apart but make sure that we're in this together again showing the power of a good monarch to help keep a country together in a time of crisis now another thing that the danish royal family has over the british royal family is well popularity and support there was a recent poll that showed 82 percent of danes support the monarchy now i'm assuming that the ones who don't will definitely find this video and comment below but overall that's a pretty good popularity rate for anybody in any country now i know that any type of monarchy seems a bit antiquated and unnecessary in the modern age but when it comes down to the danish royal family they somehow seem a bit above all of that while seeming also very down to earth and the danish people like this that's part of the reason why when newspapers cover the danish royals it's not quite as sensationalized as it is in the british press but one big difference between the way that the danish press handles this and the british press handles it is that these things are taken mostly out of curiosity and almost a little fun rather than the british press who makes everything a scandal one of the biggest displays of the queen's popularity occurs each year on new year's eve at 6 pm she delivers a speech from amelia book palace and the entire nation shuts down to watch together in this speech she offers her new year's wishes to the entire kingdom she reflects on her summer travels to greenland and the pharaoh islands and offers almost grandmotherly advice to the entire nation to be kind to one another and pause and reflect for the new year and she always ends the same way goldberg denmark god bless denmark so oprah now what do you think of the danish royal family see oprah we told you and for you guys who liked

i'm doing it um trying to lose a little bit of weight but having fun at the same time so yeah you guys should definitely try this challenge if you're trying to lose weight but don't want to really feel like you're exercising just wanna you know let the pounds come down um naturally and you know on its own but having fun at the same damn time now this can be a little bit difficult but at first but keep going hey you guys so i um just got finished um [Music] exercising and uh well i'm not done exercising i actually i'm starting the jump rope challenge well it's a challenge for me um because the actual challenge is like a thousand jumps um every day for like seven days and then after seven days i think you still do a thousand but you add on like a hundred and the next after that you add on another hundred so look yes i used to jump rope all the time when i was younger um my double dutch you know from up north so i don't know um who all know what double dutch is but yeah but now girl it kicked my ass i probably did like maybe 200. maybe a little over 200 um jumps um so now i am getting i haven't eaten anything um i did take my multivitamin and i took a goalie um that is mainly what i do every day and if you guys want to see the vitamins that i take i take these the ali women's multi the perfect women's multivitamin i take these silk gummies i do my goalie apple cider vinegar um gummies as well so i took two of those i took one vitamin one goalie um so now i am getting ready to hold on getting ready to make me some so i'm making me some lemon and elderberry tea i am just warming up about eight ounces of water in the microwave making it really really hot um i don't have a teapot i need one but that's the brand of elderberry elderberry tea that i like to drink i normally drink this first thing in the morning whenever whatever time it is that i wake up um so this was a late day and i just so happened to you know be this is like the first thing that i would drink lemon and elderberry tea early in the morning after taking my vitamins or you can just do lemon water as long as it's warm warm or hot lemon water it's a detox so i wanted to make my smoothie and um i love the mix fruit um the mangoes the pineapples um the bananas strawberries and i like to use orange juice however orange juice is very high in sugar so if you don't want to do so much sugar you can use almond milk you can use coconut water you can use whatever is best for you orange juice is what i had on hand so i went ahead and i just used my orange juice now sugar excuse me fruit has its original sugar in it it already has plenty of sugar so honestly you don't really need to add any you know more sugar to it um but whatever i added my orange juice and i'm also going to get my greens in because i don't eat enough greens during the day so i wanted to add just one scoop of my superfood powder that contains like radishes carrots spinach kale all the type of you know green leafy things you can think of great smoothie by the way um so it is time for my dinner and i wanted to just do some cut up some peppers and string beans you guys will see that i'll be cooking that as well and i will be mixing my peppers and my string beans together now this recipe i got from another youtuber um she was you know like if you like if you don't really like string being she was trying to like figure out tell you a way to cook your string beans and it worked out so you basically buy your fresh string beans cut them clean them then you put them in a pot with the butter as you see i did that and then you sprinkle some lemon pepper seasoning on it it's really really good i thought it would be like too much but since the first time i started cooking this i am just blown away it has such a great flavor and of course you add a little bit of olive oil to your liking um you can also add other spices if you like i do add garlic to this recipe however i didn't show that in this clip but i did add garlic later on so i like to cook my string beans first because the peppers they cook pretty fast so i cook my string beans first and then i'll add in my peppers and add everything in together and yeah that's some grilled chicken that i'm making along with my veggies um and so you can have any kind of chicken you like this is some salmon veggies and brown wild rice and this is some shrimp and veggies thanks guys", "zZHZ3GcHElI": "hey Squidward I'm your new employee mr.

everybody welcome back it's Master\nBlaster we're back at Johnny's green extractions and today we're in the\nkitchen we're gonna make gummy bears today and we're gonna infuse them with\nshatter we're gonna make 100 gummy bears here we're gonna use half a box of\njell-o two packs of gelatin maybe a tablespoon or two of our vegetable\nglycerin and we're gonna use our shatter here there's seven grams in here this\nshatter has to be decarboxylated which means it has to be heated to change the\nform of it from a THC a to THC so that you can get a medical effect from it and\nwith that being seven grams that will break down into point forty five\nmilligrams of shatter in each one of these gummy bears so they're going to be\nquite strong because they are for our own personal use and basically a medical\nused to help you sleep etc I just want to stress the point here that these are\ngummy bears and if you do happen to make something like this it is so important\nthat if there are children around whether it's grandkids your kids nieces\nnephews friends that have kids any kids that come over you can't just hide this\nstuff you actually have to lock this away because if a kid did get into it\nand they do seem to find things they will be hospitalized so everybody keep\nthat in mind and that's with all all edibles that you make that are THC\ninfused okay so our first step here is we're gonna decarboxylate this shatter\nwe're gonna put it in the oven at 200 and\n50 Fahrenheit for half an hour all right that's our first step here all right everybody we decarboxylated\nour shatter we melted our jell-o mixture it's warm remember everything's in low\nheat now we're just going to melt our shatter right into our liquid here slide\nit over to the heat pretty sticky   okay go we're gonna mix that in here now ok we got our hot liquid here we\nadded a teaspoon and a quarter of food glycerin just to disperse the shatter\nin here now this is a little tricky to do so we've got to

youtube channel and i am obsessed with her instagram because every time i watch i get great ideas for simple diys easy to put together but they look gorgeous each and every time and i'm just like man i wish i had thought about that but why do i have to think about it i can just watch her channel enjoy the video and get some great inspiration so after you watch my video i want you to head on over to diy beauty on purpose and check her out okay guys it's time to craft for my first diy i'm going to show you how i do my faux wood finish now i love using this finish on dollar tree items because i can take any plastic material that i get there and make it look like wood now even though this is white i'm going to go ahead and paint it with this white chalk paint i just find it easier to do this technique when i have more of a matte finish also if you're going to do a transfer which i will show you later you'll also need to go ahead and paint a layer of white even if your original material is white once my paint has dried i'm ready to do the next step i'm going to take this waverly wax in the color antique and all i'm going to do is go in vertical or horizontal strokes whichever way you're looking in whichever way you want the grain of your wood to look like it's going the point is you want to go all in the same direction now anytime you change directions you're going to get a little bit of a buildup of the wax there that's a little bit darker and you're going to use that to your advantage to make it look like knots and imperfections in the wood so as you'll see i kind of do a little swirly and then kind of paint over that and just leave a little bit some of the lines i'm not doing perfectly straight and the point of that is just to get that sense of movement in the wood and once that's done you're just going to set that to the side to dry while i'm waiting for my cutting board i'm going to grab some of these boxes from dollar tree to finish out this project now even though these seem like they should be the same size they are not exactly the same size so make sure you line them up at dollar tree and get two that are as close to the same size as you possibly can now i'm only going to use the little inner portion of these little wooden drawers i'll use the outer portion in another diy but for right now i'm just going to take these and i decided to paint these with black chalk paint of course you can use whatever color fits the decor in your home once those are dry i'm going to add some lettering to it now stenciling is not necessarily my strong suit but i really like the look of it so i keep trying um to perfect my craft when it comes to stenciling letters onto things now i do like kind of an imperfect stamped looking effect so i decided to use this white chalk paint and i just dabbed my paint all over and this made it so it was not perfectly solid but it also made it slightly more forgiving if i made any mistakes and i like that imperfect stamped look so that was perfect for me now i'm going to go ahead and use my dryer in between layers so that i can dry up that letter before placing my stencil down again to do the next letter [Music] i decided to put herbs on the side of mine of course if you're growing something specific you can go ahead and put cilantro basil whatever you'd like now i'm just gonna follow along behind and fill in any gaps or mistakes that i made i'm also connecting those letters because i prefer them to be connected and you guys this is why i like that stamped effect it doesn't have to look perfect for it to be beautiful now i'm going to go ahead and grab my cutting board which is dried by now and my two boxes which are ready to put together and attach to my cutting board i'm just going to go ahead and line them up at the bottom of the cutting board and i just want to make sure that they're even and that my cutting board can stand up on its own so i want to make sure that those boxes are basically sitting on the counter top so that it's not top heavy or it's not kind of lopsided now i'm just going to use a little bit of hot glue to glue them together and i'm also going to use hot glue to attach them to the cutting board now these are just going to be kind of decoration for a kitchen but if you're getting any heavy duty use out of anything that you make from dollar tree products i definitely recommend using a stronger adhesive than hot glue like e6000 or gorilla glue and if you're going to sell this i would recommend going ahead and finishing out the inside and painting it i just left it open i styled this with some faux greenery but you can drop a little pot in there for your little window gardens and this is a beautiful way to make a planter using this faux wood finish technique [Music] up next i'm going to show you how i did transfers before i had a vinyl cutter and honestly i still use this technique from time to time i used it on this dish that i made with a little three dollar tray from walmart i also used it on this piece of farmhouse decor that i made and this christmas decoration also using this technique so for this project i'm going to go ahead and use those outer boxes that i didn't use for my little kitchen planter and i'm just going to glue one on top of another to get some height now if you want this to actually be as deep as two boxes you can go ahead and remove the bottom of the first box but i just wanted the look of it not necessarily the height next i'm going to go ahead and paint this white and actually with this with a wood texture like this you don't actually have to paint this white for this technique to work if you're doing this on plastic you definitely do but on wood you can do this transfer method directly onto the wood if you want that wood finish to stay there next i'm going over to google and i want this to look like a mosaic tile so i'm gonna go ahead and find one that i like by doing a simple google image search and i can't tell you guys exactly what rabbit trail i went down to find this pattern just get on play explore and find a pattern that you like once i've decided on one i'm going to go ahead and measure my boxes to see the size that i need it and i simply put it into the word processor on my computer to expand it to be the size that i needed it to be if you're going to do one of the projects like i showed you before which i will link down in the description box you can just go to your word processor print out joy or the little blessing that was on that farmhouse piece and print it out and do the same technique right onto your project once you have your graphic or your lettering printed out you're just going to flip it over and color all over the back of it with a pencil you want to get nice good coverage i've seen this done actually with chalk as well which may work i find a pencil to be easy enough because i always just have one lying around once that's done you're going to go ahead and use some painters tape and tape this right onto your project exactly where you want it to go and then you're going to come back through with a pen or a sharp pencil and you're just going to trace over the lettering or the pattern that you've chosen you can draw right over that tape it doesn't really matter because all we're trying to do is press that pencil onto the surface that we have beneath so that we can go back behind it and paint now i will tell you for other projects where i just do lettering this is much quicker than this one where i decided on this slightly complicated pattern to put it on a box with four sides so this was a process for me to finish i absolutely love how it came out though and if you don't have a vinyl cutter this is a very affordable option to get exactly what you want onto your projects so now that that's finished i'm just gonna go ahead and remove this from my box and as you'll see the entire image is transferred onto my project so now i don't have to be creative have any kind of artistic ability or calligraphy skills i can just go back through with a paint pen i usually use one of these oil based ones and just fill in that outline and have it look beautiful and after i've finished all four sides this is what it looks like i wanted this to look kind of like a tiled box and i think it just looks gorgeous i'm absolutely in love with this piece i made this one to give away but i have a feeling this one will be hanging out at my house for a little while before it becomes a gift now this next project is a classic project that i've done in the past but it's the perfect example of how to create a faux metal look so i'm going to start out with these pet scoops that i got from dollar tree and we're going to use this metal painting technique to make them look like aged farmhouse metal feed scoops so i'm going to start out using this magic eraser that i have you could also use a makeup sponge and i'm just going to peel off some of the corners to make it more of a rounded inorganic shape next i'm going to use a light gray and i'm using this um waverly chalk paint and elephant to do this layer and i'm just gonna dab my makeup sponge or my magic eraser all over whatever it is that i'm painting now for the back i did have to use a sponge paint brush just to get in those crevices but you're not going to see that in the final product so it's okay if it does not look perfect as you can see there's some of the color peeking through but that is okay so after this first layer of gray we're going to need a darker gray so i don't have a darker gray on hand so i'm just going to add a little black to the elephant color that i was already using folk art also has a metallic paint line that has a color called gunmetal gray which is a nice dark gray that you could use at this stage as well so we're going to use our sponge once again and we're just going to dab all over whatever it is that we're trying to make look like metal now i'm using this sponge so that you don't see paintbrush strokes but instead you see all these little speckles of color going throughout and that's what's going to create that texture to make it look like metal so this is where it really starts looking like metal i'm going to use a metallic color and this is the folk art metallic sterling silver color and once again i'm just going to dab it all over whatever i'm painting and when this dries it's an amazing transformation it's going to look just like aged metal i absolutely think it's amazing how real this looks now because i'm going for the farmhouse theme i'm going to age this up a little i'm going to use a little brown and a little burgundy you could use red as well and i'm just going to make a rust color and use the dry brushing technique to just speckle some rust all over my scoop so all dry brushing means is i'm going to get a little bit of paint on my brush i'm going to brush most of that off onto a paper towel and then i'm going to lightly just dab that all over my scoop and that's it and a few easy steps we have our faux metal paint completely finished this really does look amazing guys and you can use it on a variety of different items to make different decor so what i want to do with this pet scoop is to put some candles into it so i'm going to make a little riser using these tumbling tower blocks that i got from dollar tree now this was the box that had some of the blocks that were already painted brown and some that were the natural wood color if you can only find the natural color you could easily stain these a darker color or use the natural wood that would be really pretty as well so i'm going to take five of my tumbling tower pieces and just glue them together try to make them as straight as i can and i realized that i needed a little piece in the back to make better contact with the pet scoop so i went ahead and glued that on after a few failed attempts of putting this in so i'm just going to put a few dabs of hot glue onto the parts that will touch the scoop and i'm going to hold it even until it dries i did add a little bit of extra hot glue right onto the parts where it connected i wanted to make sure it was nice and secure now guys i wouldn't recommend using real candles with this just because this is plastic even though it looks like metal and so the candles that i'm putting on there will not be very heavy and i really think that this hot glue will hold and it has i've had this up for a while and it hasn't been a problem so next i just want to decorate my candle holder a little bit so i'm just gonna grab some ribbon and make a cute little bow and i'm going to glue that onto my pet scoop now guys when you're gluing anything onto this with the pet scoop or the project that we're going to do next make sure that you put your glue exactly where you want it if you try to pull the ribbon off or anything else all your paint is going to come with it so you really need to be sure of where you want to stick things before you glue them on i'm going to add some greenery right under my little stand and that's it this is finished i think it is absolutely gorgeous and i just put my faux candles right on top and i have this beautiful wall sconce [Music] [Applause] [Music] so i'm going to use my other scoop to make another really cute idea for some wall decor that will match that farmhouse style i just grabbed a little scrap of ribbon that i had i love this burlap with the lace i think it's really pretty but this would also look really cute with some ribbon with some buffalo check on it or really any burlap anything you'd like so i'm just going to make a little pleat in the middle of my ribbon and that's just so that it will go around this rounded piece a little more easily i went ahead and glued that in and then i just followed the edge of my scoop around with the glue and i'm going to glue my ribbon in there nice and flat i did need to cut off some extra on each side just to make sure that it looked nice but it was really easy to get in there [Music] now i'm going to do the same thing to the other side now guys if you're not sure of how your ribbon is going to lay you might want to try once or twice just putting it into place before placing your glue because once again if you glue it and you're not happy with it and you try to take it off all of your paint is going to come right along with the ribbon just because of the type of plastic that we painted onto and it's that easy i think it's super adorable but i just wanted to add a little bit of ribbon to make it match the other sconce that we made so once again i just snipped off a little piece of ribbon and this time i added a little bit of twine couldn't help myself i love this stuff so i just tied my bow and i did a loose tie and then before it was completely tightened i just put a little bit of twine right into the hole and this is just a little detail that i'm sure no one will notice but i will i think it's cute so i wanted to add that once i have that completed i'm ready to just add a little bit of greenery inside and it's just another cute idea for some farmhouse decor and this really only cost me a dollar not including paint and glue because i had all the rest of the scraps already at my house [Music] up next a really simple and affordable way to make your pieces look like they've been glazed so i'm going to use another one of these dollar tree boxes for this project and i'm going to go ahead and paint this white now i wanted to kind of get a watercolor effect going and i wanted it to fade from dark into a white color and that's why i'm using this white as a base of course you can use whatever color you'd like to to create this effect once this is dry and i still need to paint the inside i did that afterwards but once the outside was dry i'm going to go ahead and create my watercolor effect so using this black paint i'm going to put just a little bit into some cups and i'm going to add a little bit of water to that and mix it now my first one i wanted to be just pretty thick but not quite as diluted as my second because i wanted to have kind of an ombre effect so i just put a few drops of water into that first cup and then for my second cup i used even less paint and even less water so that it was almost completely diluted but because it's black you could still see that that color and pigmentation was there to put onto my project so i'm going to start out with that lighter more diluted color black and i'm just going to go ahead and use my sponge to spread it all over my box and i'm just leaving a little bit of that white up there at the top because i wanted it to fade into that white now once that layer was dry i'm gonna go in with my other black which is also diluted but a little bit less diluted so i'm gonna get a darker color out of that and once again i'm gonna go through and just use my brush to paint it on making sure to make kind of highs and lows to give it some visual interest so that the two layers of color are kind of playing with each other as far as the level and how the waves looked this was really fun to experiment with and you can really make it your own there's no real way to make this look bad now i decided it needed an even darker layer so i took my paintbrush which was still slightly wet and i just added some undiluted black paint right onto it and i used that to make another layer of black onto the bottom of my watercolor [Music] now once that's dried it looks like this beautiful ombre effect with the watercolor paint and you can really do this with any color paint you'd like now this is the secret to making it look like glazed ceramic i'm going to use this triple thick rust-oleum glaze spray paint and i'm just gonna go through and paint the entire box now i did actually three or four coats of this and i'm a little bummed you can't see exactly the detail on the camera for this video but this gives it this beautiful glazed look and it really does look like a ceramic glaze when it's finished now you can use this on any project where you're using chalk paint i have tried it with my oil paint pen and it ran and it did not look quite as beautiful but definitely try this out to make a faux ceramic glaze look next up another classic diy and one that you guys have asked me about over and over i'd love to use this in my house i'm going to show you how i made some vases using this faux ceramic technique this diy i'm going to start with some vases that i got from dollar tree i love the shape of these and i thought they would be perfect for this project i'm going to use chalk paint and just paint a layer or two of paint over all of them making sure to get all my brush strokes in the same direction because i want that to look nice and smooth when i'm done now i didn't worry too much about the coverage on the bottom because i'm going to be covering that up in the next step now i'm going to use a technique that i saw on tiktok to make a really cool textured effect in your paint so i'm going to use some chalk paint and i went for this light brown color and then i'm going to add some baking soda to that and combine it completely until it's kind of smooth but a very thick version of chalk paint now you can add as much baking soda as you would like to your mixture that's just going to change the texture and what it looks like when you put it on your face so i wanted mine to be pretty thick because i wanted to get the most drastic contrast that i could between that smooth plaster colored chalk paint that i put on there and this textured color next i'm going to use some painters tape and just tape off where i want the line to be between my two colors and textures of chalk paint now this vase is kind of curved so you really have to work with it to get that line to be straight the top of your tape is going to be a little wrinkly but that's okay you want the bottom of your tape to be nice and smooth because that's going to create a nice clean line when we're done with our project and i'm going to do the same thing with the other vase but i thought this one would look pretty cool with an asymmetric look so i did a high low effect with my painters tape in order to add my texture onto the vase [Music] once everything is taped off i'm ready to play and experiment with this mixture of paint now i decided to do more of a stippling effect on the bottom because i wanted it to kind of look like plaster or mud or like it had been shaped um just by clay or earth i really liked the idea of that smooth and chunky but when i put it on there it was kind of flattening out a little bit on me so i added some more baking soda and that fixed it right up it was nice and thick and all those little peaks and valleys from the stippling really showed up so just play around with it guys see what it looks like as you go add some add some paint just see how you like it so once i got everything covered came the most satisfying part of any diy which is taking that painters tape off and revealing that nice clean line you guys i love the contrast between that smooth light chalk paint and that textured effect on the bottom i think these came out so beautifully they look so high-end and you would never guess how quick and easy they were to put together [Music] and the last faux finish i want to show you guys is how i make this faux marble look you can also use the same technique to make a faux concrete look i'm going to start out by using this box once again from dollar tree and i'm going to paint it with a layer of this elephant colored chalk paint if you want to make it look more like concrete than a darker marble you can go ahead and use a lighter gray finish or kind of mix this color with white and make this lighter but use the same technique and it'll look more like a concrete mixture once i have the entire box covered i'm going to make a mixture of light gray and dark gray now i didn't have any on hand and if you do that makes this step a lot easier but what i did was i took the same elephant chalk paint and i added white to one little drop of it and black to the other so that i can make sure and make a lighter and darker color next i'm just taking a kitchen sponge and i believe this is one that i got from dollar tree as well i have wet this up a little bit so it's not dry but not dripping wet it's just kind of damp and i'm also going to take it and kind of tear off any corners that are there because i don't want any hard edges in my paint and i'm kind of breaking it up in the middle as well so that it can be kind of a looser spongy look now this is another project where it doesn't have to be perfect these are my favorite kind this is kind of an abstract thing that you're making so if it's not perfect don't worry that will add to the look of it so first i'm just going to sponge on some darker color and i'm also going to sponge on some of the lighter color now i'm not doing this in any you know particular pattern or rhyme and reason i'm just kind of trying to get that color all over but to avoid major brush strokes that will be a little harder to cover up later next i'm coming in with that a damp sponge and i'm just kind of smearing this all around so i want to mix that light color and that dark color and just think of what marble would look like you kind of get those swirls of colors in there now because we kind of stippled it on earlier i don't have to worry about any huge globs of black or white i'm just kind of trying to swirl it all together and get a faux look of some kind of stone now if you want to do concrete i've found that if i kind of do a lighter gray and then do more of the lighter stippling than the darker that really does make it look like concrete but you can just go ahead and play with it right here i squeezed a little water on there out of the sponge so that it kind of smeared around more and gave me more of that marbled look just have fun with it and make this your [Music] own [Music] after i've done my marbling effect i'm just going to go through and very lightly put some little flecks of light and dark in there this just reminds me of kind of those little pebbles and flecks of color that you often see in stone i've also done this where i've done this with a little bit of a gold tone which is also really really beautiful now you can go ahead and seal this with a matte spray if you want it to last you a little bit longer but i love the look of this and how much fun it can be to play with the different colors and make this marbled effect all your own okay it's really hard for me you guys to choose a favorite out of today's diys and that's simply because there's something about like getting uh something simple from dollar tree like a wood box and by the time you're done just have it look completely different and so anytime i do like these transformations with faux finishes i just really love the way they look because you would never guess that they started out as a dollar tree wood box or vase or anything like that but head down to the comments and let me know which one was your favorite and in the spirit of making things look like other things i have a diy treat for you today that i made from my girls they recently had dr seuss week at school and so i made these faux green eggs and ham for them and so i'm going to show you how to make this quick easy faux treat okay guys it's time to eat for this faux green eggs and ham i'm gonna start out with these pretzel snaps of course you can use any shaped pretzels and it will taste delicious but this shape lends itself to the effect that i'm trying to get here of eggs and toast or eggs and ham so i'm going to start out by getting a cookie sheet lined with some parchment paper and i'm going to put down my pretzels you can make as many of these as you'd like these are perfect for a party because they come together so easily next i'm gonna go ahead and take some of these candy melts that i got from the grocery store and i'm going to place one on top of each square now i did notice after i made it that if you kind of put the little candy melts slightly off center and not perfectly in the middle it really adds to the effect of the eggs and toast next i'm going to take those and set them aside and while i do that i'm going to take my package of m ms and i'm just going to sort them out now i'm trying to make green eggs and ham so i'm going to take the green ones out i'm also going to take the yellow ones out so they'll look like regular toast with eggs of course i had like a thousand blue ones that i did not need so i had another pack of m m's on hand just in case now i put these in the oven on only about 200 and i left it for about four minutes i wanted my egg whites to just be a slightly melted but not to start to drip off of the pretzel and when i take them out i'm going to immediately place the yolk of my egg right into my egg whites now once again i did notice that the ones of these that i did that were not perfectly in the middle really added to the effect so embrace your creativity and your imperfection on these because that will make them look just adorable i added all my green yolks and then i added my yellow ones and that was it you guys these are salty sweet super whimsical and i just love that kind of faux effect of a candy breakfast i hope you enjoyed the diys i had for you today please don't forget to

that's really designed to kick-start your health and wellness journey and really get you on track to live a healthy lifestyle so without further ado let's jump right in so the objectives today is to a live a healthy lifestyle lose weight how to boost your metabolism and how to really jump start your fitness so those are going to be some of the areas i cover today so first off i want to talk about some success tips um the number one tip that i have learned throughout my last super focused year of fitness has been to a work at your own pace you know you don't always have to overdo it you can modify exercise you can modify food modify any you need so listen to your body um injury prevention is more important than through your workout and your body will thank you later and secondly don't give up you know keeping up with the diets and the workouts will be definitely a challenge but it's not too difficult so if you want to feel and see changes you definitely have to put in the work and really commit to yourself to be dedicated for at least an entire month and and remember not to be lazy so it does take work and you'll see as i talk how much of what we learn in in bible study what we learn in our sunday service they all tie in together as one big happy lifestyle balanced so you'll hear a lot of the same things we hear on sunday and as it relates to fitness third tip would be to find an accountability partner working out is sometimes more fun with other people so try to find someone to do with you maybe you know your wife husband significant other your kids teammate etc so but if you're going to do a program solo at least maybe let someone know that you're doing it so they can check in with you and and keep you accountable keep you in check and pumped up and motivated throughout the week next tip for success would be to have fun don't make this just about working out or just about eating clean make sure you're having a good time doing it you know you want to create an atmosphere that will allow you to do that you know whether it's dancing around the way i do whether it's singing your song whether it's being outdoors whatever environment you like that brings you joy i would i would focus on that and last but not least you can do this so just bring remember that believe in yourself surround yourself with people who believe in you and if you have any questions you know feel free to to email someone like myself someone like larry or or anyone that can keep you motivated and keep you on the right track to to reach your goals so my information you'll see is on every slide here if you want to contact me i got you okay my next slide is probably where i'm going to take most of the time talking so i have been surrounded with sports and fitness my whole life you know as a as an athlete as coming from a family of athletes um my my dad was an athlete and coach so you learn all these things you you grow um i worked for equinox for years so you you know all of the scientific things you know the food pyramid but what i really learned this last year was the relationship aspect of food and eating that's what really changed for me that was different so let's talk about it um food for thought yes i'm corny uh relationship status so you you focus on your relationships with people you focus on your relationship with god and you put work into so in a similar fashion think of food as a relationship so what is your status is it healthy right now is it toxic is it an abusive relationship you have with food so really sit there and unpack that and be honest with it and the same way we have therapists and we seek um help and in other areas of our relationships we might need the same with food you know that relationship didn't start just today just yesterday so just be mindful of that that it is a work in progress and an ongoing relationship that you will have to work on um next is really know your why so a why are you why are you eating why do we need to eat so i had to really change the way i thought about food i would run to food as a comfort because it tastes so good that melted cheese got butter that bread and i thought you know it was making me happy so when i kind of switched my mindset to think about food as really fueling my body and giving me the energy i need to perform daily life functions just understanding the effect that food had on me mentally physically my energy just how i carried myself so it's definitely work in progress but i i shifted that so when you take your car to the gas station you know you're not going to just put diesel gas in it or if you're driving around in your bins and it calls for 91 you're not going to put 87 because you know that's not the type of fuel that your car needs so that really made a light bulb go off in my head and like okay so why would i opt to eat five snickers instead of something a little bit more balanced or you know or a whole peach cobbler when i have a little bit you know it's it's it's it's a it's a work so you i do love my sweets anyone who knows me knows i i can definitely um devour uh a lot but um i've helped to control that and balance that again that word balance um next is really respecting your temple you know we focus at least on sundays on being you know being mindful of of of the temple of god that that and your body is a temple and we we talk about ear gate we talk about your eye gate but what about your mouth gate like what are you putting inside your body you have this beautiful home you have these nice cars you wear these pretty fancy clothes but what is the inside of your body looking like so just just just think about that so it really starts the next point is my internal transformation it starts from the inside and what we eat really really matters it it affects everything so all of those things we've already talked about what's done in the dark comes to the light what you eat in the dark and what you eat in your secret room and you know you pull things out of your pocket that you probably shouldn't eat um it will show in some some shape form or shape or form it might be physically it might be emotionally um so it definitely shows so there's no there's really no no way way to hide it um my next point is really be honest with yourself you have to tell the truth to you first like look in the mirror that is not an easy thing to do so just speaking from experience uh when i started my journey i didn't realize how hard it was to be transparent about what i was eating i still felt this feeling of of shame um working with with my coach and not wanting to say oh um yeah i i kind of ate not one piece of pound cake i might have ate the whole cake so it really helped helps help me to realize why i was doing that and and what i was getting from it and and and then i realized it really wasn't that big of a deal like once i started talking about what i was doing that's where i could start okay i can meet you there i can meet you um if you're honest well we can work from where you're at so i think just being honest with with yourself um is a great starting point so you know where to go but if you aren't honest um you're only fooling yourself every someone's gonna know that you are not doing what you say you are doing um next uh really make a decision make that choice and be willing to do something different that you've never done before and you will get those results um i was very very stubborn i'm like no i will work out you know ten times a day if i have to i'm gonna eat my in and out and as much as it was ingrained in my head you can't outwork um the kitchen abs are made in the kitchen i was like yeah yeah yeah um tyrobank said i could eat a little bit of everything so i'm gonna eat a little bit of everything um but i never got the results i've gotten now um until i finally made a decision to stop running from nutrition and making a change and stop saying that no i just don't eat that i don't i don't like black beans i don't like brown rice no i have to eat white bread so making that choice and sticking to it has really um made a huge difference in my my life um practice discipline and obedience some days are easy some days are hard but if you are disciplined and obedient you will reap the benefits self-love and self-care very very important but can you truly love yourself and feed yourself toxins you know it's it's tough i know this is the this is the tough part everything else is fun but i think these roadblocks these mental robots are really what stop you from getting started we we love to say we love ourselves but are we really making decisions that show that that we love ourselves food can really affect your your your organs your your livelihood your mobility these things you know either can extend your life or it can shorten your life you know the choice is yours so um all that again i say um comes with balance we want to live a balanced lifestyle um mix it all in you have to have fun you guys know i love to have fun so just just just even it out okay so next so next speaking of balance we've all seen this i won't spend a ton of time um talking about what's on your plate but really what is on your plate you know is it stacked up with macaroni and cheese or is it stacked up with something that's going to help your digestive system so um this is kind of things that we've all we all all seen before but i'll review it and it's just about balance you're going to balance some exercise in there you're going to balance your carbs carbs are good um you they are a source of fuel they help satisfy your hunger they help lasting energy but just make sure you have fiber in there and we can talk about you know what type of fiber we're going to go over a shopping list in a second so the fiber helps with your digestion hydration water water water water water is is essential and you must drink it period point-blank there's no game around that at least eight glasses um so we'll talk about tips on how you can drink more water um even fats you still need fat in your diet but you know think of the good fats that's why the omega-3 fatty acids um are there that really help support your cardiovascular health and some places you can get that or like um from olive oil avocados egg yolks nuts or ocean caught fish and you want to make sure you have your vitamins and minerals i really suggest a multivitamin for everyone on here um just so you're on a cellular level um your body is um converting the nutrients to energy and absorbing them um in a good way um there's also you should be eating plant-based things uh that's not on here but get some phytonutrients some things that grow from the ground everything should you really shouldn't eat processed foods um but i know that's easier said than done um exercise it doesn't have to be intense you're not going to go from 0 to 100 you know you start where you're at so if that just means you you walk every day for 30 minutes that's that that's a start but just moving around a little bit every day will make a big difference and i think a big area that people miss and don't understand the importance of is rest you must really rest your body um at least six hours so it can rejuvenate and rebuild you want to get to that rem sleep so again just making sure your plate is balanced you have your protein on there which i don't think i talked um deeply about protein but protein is probably one of the most important building blocks of the body to help build your muscles and maintain your muscles and and give you that energy so when you make your plate i'm i love to go for my carbs first but try to eat your protein first um before you eat your other things that's because otherwise i eat all my rice i'm like i have this little chicken left um but keep your keep your plate balanced yeah so self-explanatory and everyone could have a copy of this as well i have a pdf form of this so next was the shopping list i was like okay well just tell me what to buy and i'll buy it um this this is what i started with and it's not the end all be all lit is a guide to to jump start like i said kind of a cleanse and and tell you where you can start and then you can add things in as you see how your body reacts to it so i know you all can read so i won't go down the list but i think these are a great starting point for your proteins here's a list of where you can start your good fats your non-starch carbs basically your vegetables but you have to be mindful on your vegetables because in me i was like oh i'll eat corn but corn is not on here and corn is not technically um one of these fiber rich non-starch carbs so this is a great start here and then for your basic starch starchy complex carbs are going to be anything brown even some jasmine rice oatmeal the sweet potato not candy yams but just a sweet potato so just be mindful of the sugars and the salt as well those really really make a huge difference so pick up your pepper pick up your red pepper use the savory seasonings before you use the salt you will thank me um who i was i grabbed salt for everything i grew up in a household where you know i go cut an orange and the first thing we ask is oh where's the salt and like put the salt on there like i love salt so if i can do it i know you can um so also with brown rice a trick that i have found is i still don't know how to make it from the bag but they sell these amazing little packs in the store like by kroger and you just put them in the microwave for 90 seconds and they're fluffy and good and they taste yummy so if you were scared of trying brown rice you should look that up and and try that out and then fruits we know they're good however everything on here you have to eat in the right portion so you can't anything too much of one thing is always is is not a good thing so with your fruit you're going to limit that you remember seeing that pyramid but i would say like two servings of these a day because fruit is a natural sugar so you can't necessarily overdo the fruit either because it tastes so good you know we all love good apples and and pineapples but don't go overboard with that um also on the bottom um you'll see a supplement list that i suggest that that's something that i have been using um for the past year so if you have any questions or want to know more about a personalized program for me for you then you can definitely reach out to me and we can talk offline about that but i use that in conjunction with these foods and the next one okay so the next thing i want to talk about is really the timing of your meals this is also very important a lot of a lot of us have built got our body clocks off a lot of us get up and just start the day and you know that breakfast is the most important but do you know why um so i recommend eating within the first hour of waking and at least hydrate your body to get your body going you know as you eat and your body starts the digestion process you know it's burning calories and you know we're like a machine and if that machine has stopped moving that's why you feel like you're not hungry and your body kind of goes into um starvation mode and survival mode and it's not going to work it's going to hold on to all of those calories so at first this might seem like oh my god this is so much food but it it really gets gets your gets your body um going so i'm going to kind of break this down a little bit i gave a sample time as if you woke up between six and seven and like your first meal was at seven so i break my day down into five um five meals a day starting at seven a.m with breakfast or a meal replacement of your choice and then your portions would be as follows refer back to the shopping guide if you stick with one cup of protein one cup of a non-starch carb like a vegetable and a half a cup of complex carb you'll know that you're basically having a balanced meal so go back to that list and think oh well what can i actually i'm going to go back to it because and think what can i make for breakfast okay well maybe my little bat oh there it is so let's look at protein what kind of protein would i want for my breakfast okay maybe turkey bacon great let me get that oh i love scrambled eggs for for breakfast great let me get some of those eggs for the fat maybe not five eggs but you know limit your eggs and then you can you know go on and so forth into you know maybe put some spinach in your eggs and then let's look over and instead of regular potatoes or you could have a potato um you know put some potatoes in there and then some fruit and there's your breakfast you know so you can mix and match and stay healthy so that's breakfast and then you're going to want to eat between two and three hours between two and a half to three and a half hours um in between each meal so then my next meal would be suggested to be at 10 a.m to be a snack and that snack could be a fruit and nuts my go-to snack is one green apple and i'll han a handful of um raw almonds from trader joe's it's simple quick and it gives me the energy i need to sustain throughout the day because if i miss a meal i get hangry very hangry so there's different options too you um you know as long as your nuts are a fourth of a cup lightly salted no salt if you can do it would be better um two two two boiled eggs and veggies one cup of greek yogurt so things like that you can mix and match with your snacks too to make make healthy snacks and then and so on and so forth one o'clock would be your lunch four o'clock would be your snack and then seven o'clock would be your dinner um and then if you get on that schedule you'll start to see the the the changes and and really um get your party's engine working like you should like it's like a train going down the tracks chugging along and then once you get going it just goes and so that's been exciting and then um for me but what i do i live by my calendar i have my water on my calendar so i have a a alarm when it's time for me to drink water and i have an alarm when it's time for me to eat all these things like you you do what works for you to stay on track and then remember and keep throwing that in drink a gallon of water a day and yes it seems like a gallon um it's not as much as you think you know it's really just eight water bottles a day um so if you drink a glass before every meal there's a there's there's five down so just throw in three more so um that is that all right workout plan uh so i try to do a little bit of exercise every day this is just a suggestive plan um i know we were all in quarantine so a lot of all of these were just some body workouts that body weight workouts that i was able to do in my living room um you can do them outside you can do them on the beach you can do them in your gym anywhere you go again it's really all about balance so this was um each exercise i would do one minute per exercise and have a complete three to four sets and this is where it would help to to have a coach to make sure you know you have the correct form make sure you watch videos and you're mindful of that so you don't injure yourself but a lot of these exercises we have grown up doing or seen before and there's lots of different videos you can see me doing them you can see others doing them or or look them up and and go from there but that's that's it you know i it seems so simple and i'm like i this has been holding me back like it almost almost takes minutes really to complete one cycle so you start where you're at so if you can give 10 minutes do 10 minutes then if you can work up to 30 great if you need to work out for an hour later like you're gonna just keep pushing yourself where you where you are but again the balance so you can start say monday with like a upper body tuesday go back to your abs and cardio wednesday lower body thursday it's always on rotation maybe friday a full day of full body work saturday abs and cardio again and then sunday you need to rest rest is so important again you know maintain your sabbath take your time you must rebuild you can't just go go go you will break down so um take a break and and honor yourself and rest um so that that is definitely um very very crucial next we're going to talk oh there we go so next we're going to talk a little bit more about some more weight loss tips and how this all goes together just in review so the number one thing um that really helps you is building muscle so building muscle requires you know more effort to maintain so that makes you burn more calories um build more muscle burn more calories pretty simple next is really using compound and full body exercises this really exercises that cross over more joints use more muscles and burn more um calories like squats lunges burpees push-ups bench presses um etc um especially like working your leg muscles like your biggest muscle in the body um just it it helps burn throughout the day um even myself i kind of slapped off um after my birthday and i was at a plateau for a while you know just maintaining you know happy but i started a challenge at the beginning of the month and i really focused again on my workouts and i was able to cross over that plateau because my muscles started working again and really burning um when i wasn't working so i was very very happy to see that um i was not stuck anymore so that was great you're welcome okay next thing i think someone came off the mute hello hello all right so the next thing is eat early and eat often i know we reviewed the meal schedule but just want to reiterate the importance of that so it takes energy calories to digest food eating reasonably portioned meals and snacks every two to three hours will put your body in a constant burning state due to constant digestion also eating slow digesting foods like complex carbs will extend the calorie burning um digestion so when you hear when people talk about empty calories those are calories that do nothing for you they just take up space so yeah a diet coke might have zero calories but it's also not doing anything for you whereas you know a 100 whole wheat piece of bread um has a lot of things that nutrients in it that your body's going to have to break down and burn and work um in in and turn into energy and really work for so keep that in keep that in mind eat within an hour of waking up to jumpstart your metabolism breakfast is the most important meal of the day for a reason and drink plenty of water one gallon one gallon one gallon and one gallon most of us really retain water due to dehydration because we don't drink enough water so again the trick of drinking one full glass before you eat will really help curb your appetite a little bit as well maintain a calorie deficit that means consume less calories than you burn and you will lose weight you know it seems like simple math you know a 500 calorie deficit per day will generate about one pound of fat loss per week there are calorie counters out there but beware you know i we all might have that lose it app on our phone i got stuck on that lose app for maybe three years like well you know it says i have 1400 more calories of the day let me just eat um a double double and one snickers and then i'm good um so you you need to be mindful because then you might be hurting your engine if you are not eating on a regular schedule and you will not see progress because i definitely didn't see progress that way and i have friends who use that so you have to make sure you keep a balance of your proteins carbs and and fats and make sure it matters where your calories come from so not all calories are created equal um keep keep that in mind um so you can definitely keep using those to help you help get you started but if you want to take it to the next level then you could you know hire someone like me to help you um or someone like mr larry and we will get you where you want to get and last two rest rest is one of the most optimal fat burning periods happening when you're asleep your body's actually repairing itself metabolizing while you rest so you really want to optimize your weight loss get some sleep at least six hours if possible and make sure it's good sleep rem sleep um and stress we all know that stress kills so whatever you can do to really relieve stress on a weekly basis at minimum but even a daily basis really having your me time something like i said that brings you joy because stress really breaks down your immune system causes your body to stop working properly results in high blood pressure migraines we all know what stress does and it doesn't feel feel good so find your outlet like i said mine is dance you guys i'm sure have seen me dance all around on here and uh i love it and i'm going to keep doing it it makes me happy it brings me joy so i hope you find something to do that brings you as much joy as dancing brings me so um that's definitely definitely helped me um throughout this yoga massages you can go to burke williams spas are opening now stretch breathe breathe stretch shake you know just have have a good time and um that's that's it for me thank you so much for your time if you want to contact me here's my contact info you can email me you can private message me and we can set up a one-on-one consultation to get you started on your journey and we'll have questions at the end so thank you again thank you thank you sister fania uh i'm sure everyone got something out of that wonderful presentation uh like she just stated if you would just write down your questions at their end of brother larry reid's presentation will be able to open up the line for you to ask your questions to both uh sister fania or brother larry let me turn it over to brother larry reid for his presentation good morning everyone let's take the time to give sister fania a thunderous round of applause even through video screen go ahead and give her a clap wonderful information really appreciate it i also want to appreciate everyone who's online taking their time out of their schedule um be with us this morning we really appreciate it you guys see my screen yes thank you thank you so the gist of what i'm going to talk about today is master your nutrition and how to build power um key emphasis your i try to be as prescriptive as possible and talk to you a little bit about the soft science of nutrition and building up power power is basically strength over time so that's basically what we'll be talking about today during the presentation i found it very interesting though today uh if you guys don't mind me sharing um i do a daily bible verse and this morning it just so happens my daily bible verse today was um ephesians chapter 2 verse 10. and what that verse says is god planned for us to do good things and to live as he has always wanted us to live this is why he sent christ to make us what we are and i just found that interesting i can't make it up again that was just my bible verse of today but again god planned for us to do good things and to live as he has always wanted us to live so again that's why highlighting our nutrition and learning how to build up some some of our strength in terms of muscle development it's just very important it's vital information so again thanks for being with us today my name is larry reid um my catchphrase is t2p and that just means whatever you're doing in terms of training your body your mental health you just want to be able to perform that might be able to perform on the job site um just coming home performing your day-to-day activities it might even just be interacting with your children um and then you can take that to a higher level if you want to compete in sports and stuff like that so again it's just t2p so what i'm gonna talk about is just trying to get yourself how to train to perform so today i would like to discuss with everyone some nutrition plans and i'm gonna discuss three of them um but to me the key is just drinking half your body weight and water on a daily basis and that's if you can you always want to progress up if it starts with six bottles of water start at six bottles of water um if you can get all the way up to a gallon you can get to a gallon but the soft science says as long as you're getting half your body weight in water daily um you'll be okay so why that's important for me um i'm an athlete so i need a little bit more hydration um so what i do is i add bcaas and i'm gonna break that acronym down but i add bcaas to my water because it number one it just gives it some flavor i'm gonna just keep it real meat drinking regular water um i can't really do anywhere close to half my body weight um so that was just the first reason i started to take an interest in and drinking bcaas in my water and so what bca bcaas are they're your branched chain amino acids and so people say well what's important about that so we all talk about having protein in our body um and basically the building blocks of proteins are amino acids and then the branch chain amino acids are the three most essential of those so again let me break that down for you the building blocks of protein are amino acids right and then the bcaas are the most essential of the amino acids so what these amino acids do is number one they increase muscle growth two decrease muscle soreness three reduce exercise fatigue four prevent muscle wasting what muscle wasting is a there's something that occurs when your protein breakdown basically exceeds your muscle synthesis which is the process of your muscles building itself up so basically you're taxing your body is what we're saying so bcaas um help with all of those things but for me the number one thing it just added flavor to my water so i can have my daily intake of at least half my body sizing water level one of the nutrition plan you just want to get to a point where you can master your own macro intake you need to be able to master your own macro intake what macro is is your protein which should be 40 of your calorie count for the day your carbs which same thing should be 40 of your calorie intake for the day and then your fats which should be 20 so don't let anyone tell you that on any nutrition plan you're not supposed to have some fats in your diet and for you if that's dark chocolate if that's your thing again your body needs 20 of that on a daily basis so again don't get mad at yourself when you take 25 because again we're all humans and this is just a soft science um and a lot of us we're walking around anyways with our job we might be walking up and down stairs um some of you guys might take lunch break walks just walking around just because you have three kids at home but a lot of us are already doing some form of exercise because we're walking right and if you're not and you're sitting down all day you can still do stuff like yoga um you can do dumbbells so if you're not on a percentage you're okay just get to a point where you're close to those percentages but you need to master your macro intake and it can't be mine has to be yours and that's based on your body weight and we'll get into that a little bit later so level one of any nutrition plan learn to master your macro intake again you get 40 protein 40 carbs 20 fats in your diet on a daily basis level 2 which i'm going to discuss today is using your macro information and using that and then slowly reducing your carb intake right slowly reducing your carb intake as you're still taking in your protein and your fats and then adding on the workout a specific workout we usually allow uh people to use like an eight-week period um and after that eight-week period you can come back and recalculate your numbers because usually you might have lost five fixed three um pounds and so that way your numbers are going to change slightly if you lose 10 15 pounds your numbers are going to change a little bit more but again you give yourself eight weeks to master your macro information right and then slowly reducing your carbs and that known to work out level three which i'm going to discuss is what i'm currently in the faith of trying to go plant-based um all things work in progression i'm gonna show you a plan on how to progressively get to a place where you are more plant-based than bringing in your animal protein um i'm not gonna try to sell you on to going into having a plant-based diet but the soft science said animal protein has heme iron in it so you want to try to avoid as much hemet iron if you can so what hemi iron does is it slowly starts to reduce your epithelial tissue which is wrapped around um your muscles um which again that's where our blood is flowing through um so you're basically just starting to restrict your pipes it's almost like having a huge ficus tree in the middle of your yard and at some point you know it's going to get underneath and grow long long strong roots and those roots are going to uh start to damage your pipes you're just going to start squeezing them squeezing them squeezing them to where your water flow in your house isn't running properly so that's the same thing hemi iron is doing with our blood and our body and oftentimes we think certain diseases such as diabetes is genetic and the soft science says it's really not genetic it's our diet that is we genetically take on from our parents or we watch tv and try to figure out what they're eating and so we intake that into our diet and so diseases like diabetes cardiovascular diseases is usually happening because of our diet and dramatically is happening because of the hema iron that we're in taking into our body so those are the three nutrition plans i'm going to speak with you about today um again the first part of any nutrition plan is drinking half your body weight in water um if you're like me you want to add some flavor to it go ahead and add those bcaas some people do coconut water i'm a huge fan of coconut water and again i'll jump into that a little bit later but coconut water does have 70 more electrolytes than gatorade level one of our nutrition plan i'm gonna discuss is matching your macro intake level two using that macro information to reduce your carbs slowly and adding on the workout and then level three plant-based um avoiding hemi iron let's go ahead and jump into level one master your mic macros right so your macros again are protein carbs and fats that we intake on a daily basis protein you need to take in as much grams of protein to match your body weight so if your body weight is 200 pounds you need to intake 200 grams of protein on a daily basis why protein what protein does is it grows and repairs our muscle tissue right again so as you're eating your protein what that's doing internally is growing and repairing your muscle tissue um protein that i used to intake and i still intake a little bit at this point on the salmon chicken breast turkey breast ground beef black beans protein pancakes and if you ever want to get to a point where you're mastering your macros one gram of protein equals four calories for my calorie counters one gram of protein equals four calories so let's say let's take something like chicken breasts chicken breast depending on the size of it but let's go with one that has 25 grams of protein in it 25 times 4 that's going to be 100 calories you're intaking for the day at some point you will need to get a food scale if you want to start to master your macros i know a lot of us just like to do the eye test but it's way better if you can use a scale and actually start to really measure your intake of your macros it's very important there are other proteins out there um but again i just try to be prescriptive to my information the ones that i like to intake um with famine chicken breasts turkey breast ground beef black beans and protein pancakes carbs there's a lot of information out there saying people going low-carb diet no carb diet you do not ever want to go no carb diet but you do slowly want to reduce your carb intake if you are trying to lose weight if you just want to maintain your weight and usually for us if we're going over our macro count if you just learn to master your carb count you'll you'll start to lose weight as well and again your carb intake is just like protein it's going to match your body weight so again 200 pounds you're able to take in 200 grams of carbs on a daily basis and your body will not grow in terms of adding on 10 pounds if you're mastering your macro account i mean adding on your proteins and your fats so again a lot of information is out there that you have to go no carbs um i don't i don't recommend that the science says your body does need 40 of carbs every day why carbs carbs with fuel for hard exercise um but again it's just few for your engine for your tank for your body right um but if you want to get into exercise you're definitely need carbs for the energy that's why most people before going to the gym they have an intake of carbs to give them themselves a natural energy so that way they'll have the energy to burn off as they're working out and they just have the energy to work out as they're working out again what i like to intake for carbs were pasta beans so you see beans appearing in both lists protein and carbs and a lot of foods do potatoes i used to like the red potatoes but if you're just getting the big old stack of potatoes those potatoes that's all you need um whole wheat bread fruit oats oatmeal um i used to as a kid they should really really like oatmeal i've kind of gotten away from it but now that i've gone to a plant-based more diet um i have been adding in my oats and i'm gonna continue to add in my oats but again that's just oatmeal again one gram um equals four calories so you're able to intake that based on your body weight so again if i'm 200 pounds i can take in 200 grams of carbs which times four i can get 800 of my my calories from carbs that's a lot of calories of carbs so again i don't want to scare anyone off they think i can't eat this i can't if you if you master your macro account you can almost eat anything you want just in moderation and use it as a progression to master your macros um fats fats is the third category of your macros again you have protein carbs but fats um there you can have 30 of your body weight this is on a daily basis right you don't get to match it per body weight but you get 30 of your body weight so that's important and i'll break that down a little bit further later um why fats because fat helps you um your body vitamin absorption plus hormone production right those are two vital things it's helping your body break down and absorb the vitamins that we intake and that's through food some of us do the pills some of us do the liquid protein but it's helping our body absorb the vitamins that our body naturally needs on a daily basis plus it's creating hormone production so those are two vital things that our body needs and on a daily basis as social beings we need both how i like to get my fats in is guacamole whole eggs nuts so again you feed nuts appearing again in the category and then peanut butter guacamole whole eggs nuts and peanut butter um as a kid i never even tasted guacamole but always thought i didn't like a real funny story is i'm in my household i'm called little larry i am larry junior my dad larry senior he never ate onions so just because my dad never ate onions you know what sign me up to you dad i'm not eating onions either but as i started doing more research and just growing and maturing a little bit for my own nutritional plan right for the last month and a half i have been consuming onions and actually i'm a huge proponent of the taste and the flavor that he gives to food um i often tell my girlfriend that she's making my bake my bagel vegetarian sandwich i say please give me some more onions so again just a funny story anybody's nutritional information knowledge and daily intake can change um that's what makes us all lifelong learners don't think just because you weren't willing to do something two days ago um if it's healthy if it's scientifically proven that it's gonna be the best for your body and your nutrition plan right i added on um onions i have not added on coconut right because i don't want to touch coconut but you can change as you get older as you gain more information but make your nutrition plan about you that's the biggest thing i want to harp on for level one mastering your macros make your nutrition plan fit your body your needs um your ones level two level two is the same as level one you wanna master your macro count right again for your protein you want your forty percent but you do wanna slowly right slowly reduce your carb intake um try to do it on gradually like every two weeks it's way easier um when you first start off your level two plan you actually want to just master your macro count and stick to that for the first two weeks you don't want to reduce any carbs first two weeks go ahead and give yourself the chance just to master your macro account and for some of you guys it's gonna take about four weeks maybe even a year it could take five years just to master your macro account but that is level one get to the point in life where you can master your macro count because again what we intake in terms of nutrition is going to definitely affect our bodies um and we want to live through him and we want to be on earth as long as we can to be able to live through him so we can share the information of him and we all know what we're talking about but again how you attack can help is mastering your macro account and level two you just want to start to reduce your cap your carb intake you still get to have your fats on here it says 20 um because the 20 here is different than the 30 of your body weight right so i don't want to cause any confusion this is just 20 of your daily intake maxed up at the 40 and 40 was equal to 100 right so this is more about your calorie intake not about the grams of fats that you're gonna get because again i don't want to cause any confusion because some of you guys might be writing notes or some of you guys might be visual learners you saw 30 percent um for mastering your macro account in here saying 20 you just want 20 of your calorie intake for it which would be 30 grams of your body weight also attached to level 2 um i just kind of wanted to put some numbers behind it so that way you can see what those numbers look like here i use a person i'm 190 pounds um i went away from the 200 pounds because i just kind of said that but here visually i want to break down someone's mastering their macro account on and they weigh 190 pounds in the chat um if you would like for me to do this for your body weight but we'll do it in secrecy um you can email me and i'll drop that information in the chat and i'll send you your own macro account so that way you don't have to do the numbers yourself right so again protein 190 pounds that means you need to take in 190 grams every day of the program every day because again protein that's going to rebuild your muscles and your muscle tissue so you need your protein again that's just the soft science of white protein is very very important um you want to start off with your protein taking that early in the morning um protein is thermogenic i just received this information this morning um as my girlfriend saw me preparing for it for today's um workshop she drops a little bit more information on me and i'm always blessed because she always comes with a wealth of information but she was telling me that what protein is is thermogenic right what does that mean it's going to help us speed up our metabolism and if you want to speed up your metabolism by 20 right by taking in your protein you want to take it first thing in the morning if you can get to the point where you wake up and your first nutritional intake is protein within the first 30 minutes you're going to speed up your metabolism by 20 again we're just talking soft science um but i always want to put the why behind the what so again if you're really trying to reduce weight or just maintain weight and you want to learn how to speed up your metabolism and again this is based off science just know in taking a protein within the first 30 minutes of your day right that's going to help you speed up your metabolism by 20 20 that's that's big specifically if you get 190 grams of it if you're at 190 pounds you're at 150 pounds you get 150 pounders 50 grams of protein to intake so why not get a jump start your carb count so this is according to our eight week schedule um we have the carbs which is one gram for the first two weeks then it reduces to 80 of your body weight so weeks three and four you would only take 80 of your your body weight in grams of protein um the next two weeks you would take in 70 and then the last two weeks which would be week seven and eight you would take in 60 of your carbs never drop below 60 of your carb intake on a daily basis because again carbon is going to give you that energy that fuel that your body needs so again in terms of numbers week one to two you want to take in 190 grams of carbs week three and four 152 grams week five and six 133 grams and then seven and eight 113 grams and again if you send me your email i'll calculate all of this for you if you send me your information in chat all i need to know is how many pounds of body weight do you have your fats you get 57 grams of every day of the program but you kind of want to stick to eating the healthy fats and again this is based off someone that's 190 pounds but you get 57 grams of fats every day of the program you don't have to reduce that you don't have to reduce your fat intake um if you learn how to master your macro count and that's why mastering your macro count becomes a little bit easy um because you start to figure out you don't have to cut out everything right allow yourself to eat whatever you would like to eat just know how to put it on the macro scale and then progressively get to where you're only having that amount of grams per day and you'll be followed workout program um again i kind of based this off of me but again this is just some of the soft science i do three days on one day off that one day off is vital it just allows me to recharge um just unplug get away from working out um because when i am to three days on i am on um so attached to level two as you're mastering your macro account and reducing your carbs weeks one to two 45 minutes of cardio consecutive that can be a brisk walk that can you be bike riding um walking upstairs doing heel sprints whatever your level of athleticism is whatever level of your physical activity the first two weeks 45 minutes of cardio there are some cardio that you can do while sitting down you can do dumbbells um you can do a lot of other things by just sitting down um and again send me an email if you need more information on how to sit down and continue to do exercise to be physically active um i'm gonna drop my email in the chat so i can help you out again first two weeks just get to a point where three days consecutive you're doing 45 minutes of cardio then one day off week three to four um you want to step it up just a little bit you want to stick with that 45 minutes of cardio because again i try to promote mastery so giving yourself four weeks to stay on that 45 minutes of cardio but now you want to add in weight lifting the weight lifting is going to be important because weight lifting does start to chisel your body and it does help reduce calories for sure some of the weightlifting um you can think about doing and some of these things are cardio as well um body squats try to get to 500 of them um bulgarian split squats those are really good 100 each leg um or forward and reverse lunges 50 steps each leg in each direction forward and reverse lunges and again these are all things that you don't need any weights for um so that's why i kind of scripted this one first push-ups 300 you can do that throughout the day i know a friend what he tries to do he just try to do 20 per hour right um so he's up at seven o'clock he goes to bed about eight o'clock um so that's not bad if you're trying to just get started um planks try to build up to total of three minutes just doing your planks and again you don't need weights um you don't need uh a gym membership to do any of these body squats that's this you standing there sitting down in the squat position standing back up you definitely want to try to keep your back as straight as possible as you're doing your body squats if you need help um you can get yourself against the wall um in basketball we used to call it wall squats that was a punishment usually by the basketball coach but it promoted healthy development of our quads um so body squats is all you really need don't think because you're sitting there body squatting without any any weights that it's not a good workout um again some basketball coaches usually use that just as a form of punishment so you know it's definitely a good workout bulgarian split squats um if you need to youtube it get a video um so that way you can see what that looks like but those are very very beneficial um 100 each leg forward and reverse lunges 50 steps each leg each direction um push-ups planks if you can't fully do a push-up just try to sit in the plank position right um that's the that's the progression of being able to do a push-up is just being able to get into a plank position that's why i kind of try to match those up push-ups planks because you can use the planks to progressively get to a push-up week 5-6 60 minutes of cardio so you want to bump that cardio up by 15 minutes from doing your 45 minutes um and then add on the same weightlifting that you were doing um on the week three to four so in this phase you just stepping up your cardio 15 minutes the last two weeks 60 minutes of cardio fame weightlifting plus adding on 500 jump ropes um my soft science for jump ropes is always try to give uh kids that i talk to and ask that i talk to a visual i always say probably the most violent sport that we have is a box with boxing um and often times we see them in the gym they're doing a jump rope boxers don't lift a lot of weights um because again in order to be strong you want to get strong through the hips so that's why the diet is important because that's going to reduce the the muscle or the fat around the hip area um so if you just stick to your push your jump ropes that'll slowly start to reduce that for sure um it would definitely if jump rope is probably one of the best ab workouts out there it's definitely a whole body workout but doing 500 jump ropes is beneficial to week 7 and 8. i often try to promote this with women a lot of women when they were little girls they did a lot of jump roping some of them did double dutch bring that jump rope back if you can if you can't do a full jump rope um there are some other things you can do um you can get a little small plyo box or just the side of the curve and you can step on the curve and off the curve and on the curve and off the curve but again your body going up and down um will start to produce sweat um as long as you progressively and consecutively i mean you'll start to shaping up the ab area that's the workout program attached to level two of the nutritional account where you're reducing your carbs for my accolades who really really really want to get into some more in-depth knowledge of the science behind burning your heart rate um here's a heart rate calculator if you only want to burn fat this is the fat burning heart rate at the following heart rate your body will only burn fat let me say that again at the following heart rate your body will only burn fat sometimes i see people in the gym and they are burning muscle right i'm not sure if you necessarily want to do that um if you're in the gym working out so this is how you only burn fat this is the formula basic number 220 minus whatever your age is and that's why i left that blank so whatever 220 minus your age you want to get that number and then times that by 70 that's going to give you your first number and then take that same number 220 minus your age whatever that number is times it by point 80 percent and that's going to give you your window of your heart rate for those of you guys who don't have a watch that can burn your heart rate um and you just want to know if you're doing it as you're exercising these are three points that need to happen to know you're possibly burning fat only you want to be slightly out of breath right you're going to start to notice a thin film of sweat on your back and it's going to be hard to talk without stopping to draw breath that's when you know you're getting into your fat burning heart rate so here are some examples and again if you email me i will run the numbers for you so you don't have to do it yourself at age 30 right your fat burning heart rate is between 133 to 152. so if you get your heart rate in between those numbers at that stage of your cardio you are only burning fat at age 35 your numbers are 129 to 148 at age 40 your numbers are 126 to 144 at age 45 just in my age my fat burning heart rate if i can get my heart rate to 122 to 140 140 i'm only burning fat at that point i'm not burning any muscle i don't want to burn muscle i want to build muscle so that's why your fat burning heart rate is very important if you only want to burn fat while you're doing your your cardio my weight lifters um because again i just wanted to build a program that was progressive um what i like to do i like to talk about lifting for power right power is strength over time what does that look like in the weight room you want to move the bar quickly but still under control with as much weight as possible i love to promote lifting as heavy as possible but you want to lift it by using power if you can't lift it don't lift it right but if you can lift it with power which means you're moving that bar quickly and under control with as much waste as much weight as possible you're going to slowly start to create athletic movements um if you are a parent and you have a kid that is interested in athletics please start teaching them how to live for power because that's what creates athletic movements again i don't want to get into too much depth of what athleticism really defiance of it um but you want to live for power not for strength right at some point you do have to live for strength to create power but as you're focusing yourself in the weight room three out of four of your weight room um days you want to lift more for the power um you want to move that bar quick and you want to lift heavy heavy heavy as you can um what does that look like um i like to deadlift i like to squat me personally i like the basketball squat i'm not really a deep squatter but deep squatting does burn more calories during your um cardio um bench press pull-ups dips power cleans lat pull-downs you want to do your curls i always like to mess with people when i see them doing curls i tell them that's the smallest muscle in your body so of course they should grow but if you just want to get a quick hitter do some curls small muscle farmers walk um a lot of us we've been doing farmers walks our whole life when you had to go to that car and you had to get them groceries out of the car and then groceries had to have within that ralph bag and you tried to carry five six seven men at a time you're doing a farmer's walk um i often promote farmer's walk also because um one of the greatest athletes that's ever walked this planet lebron james that's one of his favorite exercises he loves to do the farmer's walk um a thousand jump ropes if you can it just kind of helps you stay fluid and flexible um again this is it for my weight lifters and my my original program level two i talked about 500 jump ropes for my weight lifters if you really really really want to get to the point where you're becoming more athletic a thousand jump ropes if you would just jump rope a thousand times five days a week you would get way quicker faster stronger and your core area hips through your belly button would develop um a lot a lot of muscle mass so again as a parent and you have a little five-year-old at the house and he looks like he wants to be a basketball player football player or she wants to be a cheerleader start her off jumping rope just get her to about 300 to 500 a day and you will start to slowly see her athleticism improve dramatically at the end compound movements are very beneficial um compound movements are some of the things that i highlighted squats your bench press your power cleans um some people say well why compound movements right you're going to burn more calories you're going to improve your intra muscular coordination that means your muscle groups are going to be working together a little bit quicker um and more under control elevating your heart rate we already talked about if you can get your heart rate to a certain stage um your body's only going to burn fat so that's why you want to do compound movements um it's going to improve your flexibility um it's going to improve your strength dramatically and you're going to gain way more muscle mass so that's why compound movements are very important a lot of people like to do stuff in isolation and that's fine for your muscle group development but if you want to see more gains if you have limited time to be able to work out you want to do compound movements because you don't have to do as many of them level three plant-based again i have progressively got into a plant-based diet i would like to say i've been doing it pretty much 80 percent of my day since march 3rd i started off very slow for a month i just um just tried to get more specific about taking in my vegan protein um my vegan protein i get it from a website called the protein works it's based in australia um but it's it's a vegan protein that tastes really well doesn't have an aftertaste and just kind of helped me get into eliminating the animal protein out of my diet so instead of trying to take in my 200 grams of protein through eating chicken breasts salmon um eggs i slowly started to move into the protein shake taking that more on a daily basis so i can get my protein intake through that um and then i just gradually started getting to the point where i was only eating animal protein at night for dinner um and i was just kind of just so i could have something big as i went to bed um and just kind of reduced the anxiety and my anxiousness of not having the animal protein in my body or just in my diet because a lot of your diet is just what we think our body needs but it's not actually what our body actually does need um so what i did i just progressively reduced my animal protein and again why the soft science i wanted to reduce my heme iron right and again what hemi iron does is it collapses the epithelial tissue which again is going to restrict your blood flow here's some numbers um it reduces cancer and type 2 diabetes by 500 by getting away from animal protein i'm gonna repeat that it's gonna reduce cancer and type two diabetes by 500 those are some incredible numbers that struck me specifically because my dad did passive cancer right so i always thought man genetically that means i'm predisposed to probably getting cancer right but again a lot of these things are not genetically passed on it's not in our dna if our diet that's part of our dna that's causing these things to happen to us some number another soft number for you within three weeks you can reduce inflammation by 20 percent just within three weeks you can reduce inflammation by 20 percent a lot of us might have inflammation in various areas that doesn't get a lot of blood flow um so going to more of a plant-based diet would be very very beneficial for you um for me i get a lot of inflammation in my elbows and that's just a place where you don't get a lot of blood flow through your elbows right why because your elbow is usually hanging below your heart right and the key to getting blood flow is elevating that body part above your heart and i'm gonna get into that too as we talk about recovery but my elbows have started to reduce this inflammation um i can't say 20 percent but there is a definite reduction in my elbows a lot of us have inflammation in our ankles which isn't going to get a lot of blood flow or in our hip area um and so in order for me to just trust why going plant-based um it's going to reduce your inflammation by 20 percent some people say well if you want plant-based how are you getting your protein in so again my protein how i'm getting it i use my vegan protein powder i get it from a website called the protein works um it doesn't have an aftertaste they have many flavors i stick to the to the vanilla um but it's it's a very flavorful taste i use it with almond milk i moved away from drinking the vitamin d um milk and then a two percent milk i slowly got into drinking almond milk um and so i mix my almond milk with my vegan protein powder and that's usually how i get probably about 60 70 of my protein intake for the day i eat plant-based yogurt um the first time i had it i didn't like it it tastes grainy um for the second day i was able to add some blueberries and strawberries into that plant plant-based yogurt um and it still didn't taste all that well um but i like the fruit so i just ate it i just finished it by the third day my palate my tasting patterns um was able to absorb the plant-based yogurt and at that point it was just weird like i didn't even really need the fruit anymore but i kept the fruit in it and i still keep the fruit in it but i can now eat plant-based yogurt um and my palate my taste it it does it's not thrown up throat thrown off um dramatically um ezekiel bread um as a great bread to eat as we want to absorb our protein i'm a very healthy um again it's plant-based um evictio bread on the packaging i think that i forget the verse but it's pretty much considered god's bread um almond butter um i moved away from peanut butter to almond butter um i eat a lot of black and pinto beans when i go to chipotle they usually kind of look at me funny when they ask me what do i want and i say white rice and they say where's your beans i say both um because i do like pinto beans um but i've slowly learned to eat black beans why black beans black beans have the most protein in them sofritas um again when i go to chipotle um i don't get the chicken anymore i don't get the carne soda anymore i get to se free this bowl um so again that's how i get a lot of my intake of protein and through my protein powder and the sulfurites that i eat um lately we've been using soy riso you can get that at ralph's um to me it tastes like souffles but i haven't done the research to say it is sofritas um but if it's a good quality meat um that's vegan that i like um actually last night we had some so these still tacos um just with some some white rice and some guacamole and i'm telling you it was quite delicious tofu i don't eat tofu but that is a protein intake you can get if you're um on a plant-based diet tempeh i don't eat tempeh as well but it is a a really good source of protein and it's a very lean protein that your body can then take if you're looking at going plant-based edamame beans lentils satan chickpeas i like protein pancakes green peas spirulina spinach quinoa soy milk oatmeal wild rice nuts broccoli asparagus sweet potatoes brussels sprouts i just want to give people a list of things you can take to get protein as you're trying to get to your protein count if you go away from the animal protein quickly i just want to talk about recovery um the phases of recovery first one is you got to get that that sleep sleep is the main recovery that we can get that's why we should be doing it at least six to eight hours on a daily basis maximum if you get eight hours of sleep um your body's gonna naturally recover stretch because it's gonna keep your muscles muscle groups really flexible um that's a very important um way to recover it's a healthy way to recover you don't need any money to stretch you don't need any money to sleep um those are two things you should definitely definitely try to start your day off by doing um coming off a good great sleep getting a nice stretch rest um as i'm working out i always rest days in between muscle groups um for my bench press on monday i'm not going to bench press again until wednesday most likely for me my best day is gonna be if i bench press monday thursday if i go ahead and get my full two days in between the same muscle group and do the same exercise um what recovery does um if you want to use some items listed below is you want to create blood flow to the sore area we talked earlier about why we have sticking points in our bodies such as our ankles our hips um and our elbows because they're all been underneath our heart um the first part of recovery is you just want to get whatever that muscle group that is sore above your heart so if you just slowly elevate that muscle group over your heart right that's going to slowly get blood to drip down we are all alive because our blood is flowing so that's another key piece of recovery you see some people using a foam roller um some people get massages some people do the massage gun um one of my favorites is the tens unit um it's a very inexpensive item you can get it from like cvs it's like at like 60 bucks you can pay 100 bucks for it for a bigger more expensive one but you can just get a basic tens unit for like 60 bucks um it's gonna create blood flow right to that area um normatech boots um recently um we have got purchased the normatec boots my daughters who run track they've been using normatec boots for like the last five years it's just a suction massage um but it's going to create blood flow in that area that is if the suction is on um you can do cupping some people think cup cupping hurts um for me when i got cupping it didn't hurt cupping the benefits of cupping is going to start to slowly bring those toxins those bad toxins up to the blood and release it out if you want to do the ice heat ice cycle um always end on ice so that's why i bolted ice because sometimes you can just ice right but as long as you end on ice not on heat as long as you end on ice you're going to create blood flow um and reduce the inflammation and whatever that body part is but if you want to maximize it you want to put that body that body part over your heart um some people do ice baths some people do cryotherapy crowd therapy is just nothing but an ice bath without having to feel the wetness of the ice um but those things are going to create blood flow um and it's key parts to recovery before working out right have your carb intake right because if you just need energy which is part of recovery that's why you want a recovery to create energy um just have carbon intake before you work out or black coffee remember black coffee only has five um calories in it it's usually the stuff we add to our coffee that's going to create the calories so black coffee is not bad and it could definitely be a pre-workout after workout if you can try to take your protein within 30 minutes why because during that 30 minutes you've taken in your protein after your workout is going to be absorbed by the fresh blood cells and those fresh blood cells will travel to your muscle groups that are being repaired liquid protein gets you the bloodstream quicker than food so if you can try to have liquid protein but if you need to eat a meal like chicken breast um or salmon or eggs try to do it 30 minutes after your workout because those are gonna do that that um those grams of protein are going to go to your fresh blood cells which again travel into your muscle groups that are being repaired um again my name is larry reid i'm gonna drop my email in the chat if you have questions we're gonna be around for 20 minutes to answer some of those questions but again i just wanted to give you guys just a little bit of the soft science behind creating a nutrition plan that's more valuable for you i'm not about me um so again that's why the presentation we start off saying master your nutrition right yours is based off your body weight again thank you for taking the time really appreciate it come on let's give both our speakers a round of applause go ahead and clap your hands go ahead and and just be appreciative of the wisdom and the knowledge uh the scripture says and all that i didn't get an understanding and so we just praise god for sending these two wonderful vessels here to pour into us uh now we're going to play this unmuting thing and i'm not going to unmute everybody because that's just opens up the door for mass chaos and so if you have a question would you just unmute yourself and ask either sister fania and brother reed the question and then if you don't mind i want to um at the conclusion of that i want to pray us out that god may continue to cover us and then uh we'll be free to go on this day so let's spend like 15 minutes or so asking any questions that you may have for either sister fania or brother reed if you would unmute yourself we would all be able to hear hi i have a question hi everyone good morning good morning i have a question for uh brother larry and sister uh for fania for my my sister all right well um but larry um good great job to both of you guys this was very uh informative um i wanted to ask you larry because you mentioned a lot about workouts and things like that um i've recently been in the accident so i got to be careful with my um my workouts right now it's all about stretching and yoga i wanted to know your thoughts anthony is too if you are if you have uh experience with the exercise ball but not just the exercise ball but the desk like it's like uh you use it to work like at your workstation but you can also use it to work out supposed to help with your power correct that's what i was gonna say i don't have much um knowledge of it um i i do have the the the big um round ball that i often use um just by sitting on it sometimes that's going to develop um your muscle your core strength um because it has no balance to it um so just stuff like that sticking to your yoga um yoga definitely of the strengthening activity um yeah just sitting down i will just stick with those but they definitely work because it's going to create core stability thank i had a you question about you mentioned corn i don't know if i missed broccoli i heard recently broccoli's not like it's like a hybrid or it's not a real vegetable or so i don't know i heard it somewhere and um i wanted to ask you about broccoli and avocado well avocado is still a good fat um wasn't sure what your question was about avocado just make sure you're limited porsche portions uh so i love avocado but i know it's good for you but it's too much yes i would say again you can i like to do a quarter uh a quarter of a cup per serving if i'm going to eat it maybe like twice a day so i would say a half of avocado maybe or if you do a whole one you're going to make sure you're balancing out with your exercise if you want to get into the nitty gritty we can use the formulas that that larry shared to get your macros of how much fat you can have so that way we can see if you want to use all of your fat grams on avocado then then that's you won't have room for anything else so we can we can work offline to get your your your number so we can understand how much you can have in your intake and yes you are correct as far as the broccoli being a hybrid so again you can just make your choice of what you want to eat of um of vegetables you know a lot of people still like to eat broccoli but yes it is as a hybrid of the um i'd have to get those get the exact things they're hybrid of but there are other options out there so just that has that's definitely true thank you i have a quick question uh for you guys both so i know that a lot of the things that you guys covered was kind of about like losing healthy weight but what tips do you guys have for gaining i'm trying to kind of gain like more muscle weight and just like healthier weight all around so any tips for gaining any weight for sure um that's the stage i'm in um usually if i'm not lifting weights um i am naturally anywhere between 182 and 186 um and i'm six foot five so um i just have a natural slim build currently i'm at 202 because i do do exercises um that build up muscle mass so i'm not sure what type of equipment you have access to um but if you have access to a weight room you definitely want to do compound movements um dips pull-ups um squats dead lifts stuff like that will build muscle mass um and hit multiple areas in terms of muscle groupings um so just do some research on compound muscle movement if you don't have access to a weight room push-ups planks sit-ups um those will all start to develop muscle and so what what i tell the athletes that i work with again the people that are on tv they're strong from the naval to the hip area um and push-ups dips um planks all strengthen those areas so it could either start to shred but it also as it's shredding is building muscle muscle around it if that makes sense i think everything he said is is perfect i would just add to make sure you have enough you are eating enough protein i think as women we don't eat enough protein so just being very adamant on you know you know your chicken waffles but make sure you add on some more chicken sounds good i have a question um it's trey shawn hall baker uh my question is first thank you for promoting jump roping that is like the new black i love it love it love it and then if you don't have a jump rope um jumping jacks are also good my question is about intermittent fasting i heard you both say you should eat right away in the morning and i'm just hoping i'm not damaging anything because i do intermittent fasting and i do make sure i have a 12 to 14 hour gap between dinner and breakfast and i get up really early in the morning at about 4 45 to be at work by 6. so um am i am i doing damage because i'm not eating within an hour from waking up i'm just curious that's my first question and either of you could answer and then the second question is also i live by squats but i'm noticing that my butt is getting really big um much bigger than i wanted to get how do you get around that and still get the benefits of squatting thank you i'm trishan hall baker and i'm done speaking so um unfortunately yes the squads are going to build up that muscle group um so i'm not sure how you'll be able to get away from that um maybe reduce the pounds that you're squatting um or try to do them a little bit quicker so your squats turn into more of a cardio in terms of the intermittent fasting um i kind of went through that stage as well um i'm in i'm i'm an administrator at my um day-to-day job so just and this wasn't in a healthy format but i would go to where maybe i might have some yogurt in the morning for breakfast because i was trying to get to work early um and then i wouldn't have another meal um until maybe like three o'clock and i was again waking up after about six to eight hours of sleep so i was just doing intermittent fasting without trying to do intermittent fasting and i know you said you do about 12 to 14 hours but intermittent fasting just kind of goes in favors but i think that just kind of naturally kept me slim but i wasn't building any muscle because i wasn't getting my enough protein or usually i was binging a one big old meal um and that one big old meal your body cells at some point has to absorb all of these things that they need to intake um so it just made them bigger and bigger and bigger so i was producing more fat as opposed to muscle mass um thank you brother larry if i could add trey shawn um with the squats like he said they're going to build that but maybe you can aside from just the how quick you're doing your squats maybe look at your feet placement as well um how how their place could put a different area of of your butt um change the focus a little bit so maybe we can look at that and with with the intermittent fasting that's something i saw that both you and sharon asked so we'll definitely look into that but i don't i don't see it as being damaging but if you don't currently have the results that you want maybe it's it's worth looking into sometimes i don't eat right away and i do a fasted workout but i at least drink my water right away to get my body at least going and something in there and then i might do a workout and then eat so that's the only time that skip um eating as soon as i wake up you know thank you for that just it out one more thing you're right i do drink almost half a gallon before i eat anything so that is the first thing that i do when i get up as soon as i get up i get a you know my first um ounces of water um but going back to uh mr larry um the 12 to 14 hours are only between dinner and breakfast and then it's it may be two hours at least two hours in between for the rest of the day so i just wanted to clarify that and thank you both i i appreciate um this was great no for sure and again if you're using your intermittent fasting to control your um caloric intake on a daily basis then it's basically it's working for you so i would definitely stick to it we'll take about like for like five eight more minutes uh any questions i have a question what about keto i'm trying keto you guys have an opinion on keto no i i i prefer a more balanced uh approach i i haven't tried keto i've noted some people who who have done keto but i think the biggest thing for me is just really being able to sustain something for a long period of time so if you want to sustain that and continue with such restrictions then that could work um but i think at the end of the day you want to pick something that you'll be able to sustain and maintain and still um i i personally wouldn't i don't like as many restrictions because i don't feel great and i feel like it's more of a chore and i haven't really met a lot of people on keto who are happy while going through the process but you know if you are enjoying it and brings you joy then you know i would do it but um i think it's i personally a more balanced approach i have a question this is deborah russell can you hear me you can okay great um my concern is i well i thank you both is very been very informative and i really thank you uh i'd like to know about you said you need rest uh sleep i don't get eight hours asleep i don't get a good six hour sleep i was wondering if you had some tips on how i can get more rest or you know what i can do as far as getting some real good sleep uh i would say probably about four months ago i was i was i was only getting about three to four hours of sleep yeah um per day so i started off by using melatonin um and and that worked a little bit um but it just wasn't it wasn't getting me to the six or eight hours of sleep that i really really needed um so lately what i do try to do is i try to have like a heavy meal before i go to bed um and and to be honest i just have learned to reduce my anxiety and anxiousness a little bit in the morning um so when i first wake up around 4 a.m i usually just get up but now i just try to have control um my urges to get up and i just stay laying in the bed um and i and usually within about 25 to 30 more minutes um i am able to fall back to sleep so i just had for me i had to just conquer a little bit of my anxiety and my anxiousness about not just wanting to be the first person up um or just waking up opening my eyes and just trying to get up get up out of bed so that was some strategies that work for me um i do try to um give myself um the benefit of a doubt if i only sleep four hours i will try to just catch a nap later on during the day um but that rest cycle was important and like um sister fenia talked about earlier if you can get to that rem sleep that that's even more essential love too okay i even tried a sleep class and it just didn't work so i'm looking for ways and i did do the melatonin as well it does not help me well i think you should maybe think about all the things you do in the day maybe keep a diary keep a journal of what you're eating so it might be a food that you're eating that's giving you extra energy kind of what you're feeling as well like as your mind just racing did you exercise in the day was it someone you talk to like just really pay attention to what you do all day and can you adjust anything in your daily schedule to get your body on another track because right now your body is used to what it's doing if it's used to not sleeping it's going to keep not sleeping unless you do something deliberate to change that pattern so i think it's first understanding what's happening to see what you can tweak daily and to try something different thank you thank you and sister russell put on the bible app right before you go to bed okay sounds good okay okay with jesus on your mind amen amen all right i wake up when i wake up with him on my mind six a.m that's it all right uh mr reed i just like to say to you you guys you and pania did a fantastic job and i was wondering how could my friend and another man be named the same larry reed and you explained it and you explained it i was a very good friend of your father who passed the way of cancer who belonged to jackie robinson american legion and was the best dancer i know we were partners for years so um just want you to know i had a good job i'm very bad at dieting dieting is something i'm i'm not very good at doing but i really know i need to do it and exercise to stop shaking your head your name uh and i know i need to do it so i'm so glad that you guys had this format and possibly this can lead me into a better lifestyle so thank you so much no thank thank you um and just do everything in progressions just start slow um again try try to start what you can maintain um so just start off slow to go fast at some point but definitely start off slow and just use progressions and when you're not able to do um your goal for the day don't don't don't get down on yourself just just know that you have another day um to get back to it thank you agree and then uh joyce i would just say yes make sure you give yourself grace you know where no one is perfect and no day is perfect so some days you might want to have an extra treat or eat a whole pizza or or you know some days some days you don't so just know that i don't i don't look at it as a diet i look at it as a way of life slight changes to just keep keep doing it's a lifestyle it's not a it's not a diet because if you do a diet then you stop you go right back so something that you can maintain and enjoy so it's just finding ways to um to to change your lifestyle slowly but make it work for you thank you hi this is oh doctor just want to know what is uh bcaa to put it in the water yeah so is it is your branch chain amino acids again i use it more for flavor where do you get it from um i get it off amazon um the brand i use is called extend extnd okay um also you know i i do i do um have bcaas on some on my website i do sell herbalife and i use bcaas from there and i use aloe in my water um for my digestion i didn't get to all those details but if you want to okay from me so i'd be happy to review those with you if anyone has any questions about that as well um but you're welcome to buy them anywhere you please oh okay send me a bottle trying to lose weight it's been over a year that i have not been eating what i want to i have been cooking like i want to i've been trying to eat healthy more vegetables my question is since i'm older it's taking forever anthony i'd like to know how when you say stay motivated stay positive it's hard staying positive when you are walking in place and and walking and doing what i'm supposed to do and i know women lose slower than men and i know um age has something to do with it but my because my knees aren't good and i can't do squats and i can't do lunges i don't i'm having a difficult time staying motivated it's almost like well why don't if i'm only going to lose two and a half pounds in the whole month of why don't i just eat and just say okay this is what i'm supposed to look like i understand i i mean i understand and i think it's really having us having a sounding board so you know you i don't know who you're comfortable with but say you're comfortable talking to me you could call me and say you know this is how i feel today and we could we could kind of review the week and what was it that you did and find your wins i think really finding the small wins that might not be on the scale it might be wow i ate clean all week and did you did you feel how was your energy was your energy increase like look find the increases because they are somewhere you know oh well i motivated my my family to to eat better so that's a win so think all those small things add up and yes it's going to take time but there might be other things like you said if your knee is hurt you can't um exercise hard that you're going to hurt yourself so just find the things that are working to help motivate you and don't tie everything to weight because if you're so focused on the scale it's not going to move either because that's another stressor that you're putting on yourself and your body's going to hold on to that weight um and so you saying that you know you're not eating the things so it's like as you're eating you're mad at it so it should still be an enjoyable process so let's figure out how we can take away some of that feeling that this is not a good thing i don't want to eat this let's make it more more enjoyable so maybe we can maybe we can talk and tweak something so that way you're having a great time okay thank you so much you're welcome real quick real quick are there any more questions real quick um if not i had one question pastor okay um first i just wanted to say i don't know funny if you were on your um on the herbalife mission yet but just in adoration of you you guys she is an excellent person to talk to um she has helped me understand what i needed to do to get my metabolism going because it is a problem of mine i've been obese my entire adult life um but in knowing what you need to do for your body because growing up we didn't learn like you taught us mr reed about our body where diabetes is not hereditary it's the processes and the ways that we've ate in family functions that have encouraged us to continue that diabetic life but pania has taught me i now carry almonds with me i carry um a lunch with me where i was eating only one time a day i completely took everything out of my drink life than water my question about um metabolism how am i or what should i be eating more so to encourage my body to eat up the fat that i'm eating and not hold on to the fact that i'm storing i guess it's where i was actually going with it and joyce i wasn't shaking my head at you i was in that's me thank you both and i'm gonna be off uh i i would say just start with with with the balance you you know the protein right away you know your meal i know you and i speak often about it but waking up and having that balanced meal i think just starting with having your proteins carbs and and fats is really making sure every meal is balanced and i think it will it will it will happen and um just just try be consistent um as consistent as you can be for as long as you can be to really make that change it's going to be a process but i i would just say stick with with the the balanced portions and and you will you will get there um so i think we'd have to talk about um what what's actually happening but i would i would just say stay consistent with the proteins no and i agree great point to stick with your proteins um normalized um eating eating from your three categories your protein fats and carbs and try to get the healthier versions of those if you can into you um and just stay on your journey and stay consistent and persistent one more question anyone have pastor this is david i wanted to know if it was possible i can uh make a comment um fania uh thank you for your challenge because i've accepted the challenge and um i gotta admit um the one thing that i was hiding from was accountability and with me doing the challenge um and having fania as an accountability partner she does tell me the truth um in love even though i didn't want to hear a lot of the stuff but the nutrition is the one that stepped up my metabolism so i've already seen like immediate changes within the seven days no the eight days that i've been doing it um and i have the evidence to show it later down the line so thank you for this forum um i have a lot of energy as you can see i'm already outside that's the background noise you hear me walking as i'm watching it so that's become a lifestyle so just thank you cedar david pastor dimiko and the forum for allowing us to learn it and now we just have to apply it so thanks again thank you any other questions no well let's give our um let's give our two panelists of sister fania and brother larry just a hand clap of of kudos and accommodations and appreciation i am so gifted and blessed i feel that god has sent uh these type of individuals who love god and then have love for people and so we praise god for bringing these vessels to us that we might benefit from and and share with and so i praise god i want you to write and i want you to meditate on this journey psalm 118 verse psalm 118 verse 17 and the psalmist declared that i shall live and not die and declare the wondrous works of god and notice the scripture says i shall live i shall live and not die i shall live i shall live on this side and not just exist it does not say i should exist i shall live and so my hope and my prayer is that you got information that would allow for you to make better choices that you might live shame on us if we leave this life and it's only said that we existed when the goal should be that we lived jesus hung on a cross that we might live and so i i salute and ask you to write that down as you hold yourself accountable with the information that you have received i want to use this time also to announce to you that our next conversation at the city will be april 17th if you recall we brought dr tama in february and the discussion was so rich that we thought it'd be prudent that we bring her back that she might feed into us about our mental our mental health is just as is is as it works in concert with our physical health and how we might relate one with another and so if you would mark your calendars on april 17 from 10 30 to 12 we'll have our next conversation at the city let's pray out amen if you don't mind and i pray that you have a wonderful day and once again i thank you sister for me and brother larry for how you are poured out and we will be sending tangible expressions uh for the time that you have committed to us both of them shared their contact information i pray that you uh have their contact information and you wrote it down that you may speak with them offline in order for offline conversations let us pray merciful god we thank you for this day we feel truly god that this is the day that you have made and we will rejoice and be glad in it it's a day unlike any that we have ever seen or ever will see and so god i pray that you help us to maximize this moment god created all of us a clean heart and renew a right spirit god i pray and i believe by faith that the steps of the righteous are ordered by you and so we're not going to lean on our own understanding god in all our ways we will acknowledge you and believe god that you will direct our path thank you for these two individuals god that have poured out unto us you have used them in a mighty way god and they have served you and served your people god and so i pray right now god that you would return back to them a double portion of that which they have poured out meet every need in their lives god bless them abundantly all that they set their hands to and god i ask as we leave this call that you would convict us that we make better choices god that we understand life is about choices you gave us free will god and so we ask that you make we make better choices related to our diet make better choices god related to our health god god i pray right now that you would convict our hearts to give us the discipline to to see any progress as progress and that we put one good moment on top of another good moment and soon god we shall build a monument that you would find glory i pray right now god that you have your angels to attend to every one of our needs be a hedge fund to protection all around us thank you for every participant thank you for the families and the dreams that are connected to them bless both abundantly and we will give you and you along god all the glory all the honor and all the praise we love you god and adore you in jesus name amen amen thank you much have a wonderful day and i pray god's blessings upon your lives not only this day but in this season", "2A1Rf747ncI": "Hey guys!

into the elevator behind me he smelled of smoke and cheap wine and life on the streets without soap his beard and hair were half gray and very dirty he was wearing sunglasses and a long dirty coat hung down to his knees he looked fat probably because he had all his clothes on in the winter in washington the street people wear all their clothes all the time they can't leave any of their clothes at home because they don't have a home the old man didn't belong here everything here was expensive the 400 lawyers in the building who all worked for drake and sweeney were paid an unbelievable amount of money i knew that because i was a drake and sweeney lawyer myself the elevator stopped at six the man hadn't pushed an elevator button when i stepped out and turned right he followed me i pushed the heavy wooden door of a big meeting room there were eight lawyers at the table inside and they all looked surprised they were looking behind me so i turned my friend from the elevator was standing there he was pointing a gun at me put that gun down said one of the lawyers at the table his name was rafter he was a hard man in a courtroom maybe the hardest lawyer that drake and sweeney had suddenly a shot hit the ceiling rafter's eyes opened wide and his mouth shut lock the door the man said to me i locked the door of the meeting room stand against a wall we all stood against the wall the man took off his dirty coat and put it carefully on the large expensive table in the center of the room he had five or six red sticks around his waist tied there with string i had never seen dynamite before but they looked like dynamite to me i wanted to run and hope for a bad shot when he fired at me but my legs were like water some of the lawyers were shaking with fear and making noises like scared animals please be quiet said the man calmly then he took a long yellow rope and a knife from the pocket of his pants you he said to me tie them up rafter stepped forward listen friend he said what do you want the second shot went into the wall behind rafter's ear do not call me friend said the man what would you like us to call you i asked him quietly call me mister i tied the eight lawyers with the yellow rope one of them barry nuzzo was my friend we were the same age 32 and we had started at drake and sweeney on the same day only our marriages were different his was successful and mine wasn't he had three kids claire and i didn't have any i looked at barry and he looked at me i knew we were both thinking about barry's kids we could hear police cars outside and noises as the police entered the building mr pointed at the dynamite around his waist i pulled this he said and we die for a second we all looked at each other nine white boys and mister i thought of all those terrible shootings you read about in the newspapers a crazy worker returns to work after lunch with a gun and kills everybody in his office there had been killings at fast food restaurants and playgrounds too and those dead people were children or honest workers who would care about us we were lawyers time passed what did you eat for lunch today mr asked me breaking a long silence he spoke clearly and from the sound of his voice he had had a good education he hadn't always been on the streets i had chicken and salad i said surprised alone no i met a friend how much did it cost for both of you thirty dollars mr didn't like that thirty dollars he repeated for two people you know what i had for lunch no i had soup free soup from a shelter and i was glad to get it you could feed a hundred of my friends for thirty dollars you know that yes mister call your boss there was a phone on the table i called arthur jacobs 800 lawyers worked for drake and sweeney around the world but at 79 jacobs was the oldest of the partners here in washington he answered at the first ring of the phone mr jacobs michael are you okay wonderful i said what does he want from us i spoke to the man what do you want mister soup with bread said the man get it from the shelter at l street and 17th they put a lot of vegetables in the soup there one soup with bread i said into the phone no said the man get soup and bread for all of us mr jacobs i said i heard i can hear him a shelter for street people does carry-outs mr jacobs please just do it he has a gun and dynamite i put the phone down you said the man he was talking to me what's your name michael brock how much money did you earn last year don't lie i thought quickly i didn't lie a hundred and twenty thousand he didn't like that how much did you give to poor people i don't remember my wife does that thank you mr brock mister pointed the gun at the other lawyers he asked all of them the same questions nate malamud the only partner in the room earned more than a million dollars more than a million mister said to him i know you you walk past me when i sit on the sidewalk every morning you'll never give me any money why can't you help poor people homeless people nate was a big man with white hair he had been with drake and sweeney for 30 years he was red in the face with embarrassment now i'm sorry he said who did the eviction said mister suddenly and again who did the eviction nobody spoke none of us understood him but mr wasn't looking for an answer he looked out the window maybe he was thinking maybe he was dreaming maybe he was watching the police out there our soup and bread arrived half an hour later there was a knock on the door and somebody outside shouted through the door your food mister shouted back if i see a policeman out there i'll kill these men then he pointed the gun at my head the two of us walked slowly to the door unlock the door and open it very slowly mister said there was nobody outside the food was on the floor near the door as i stepped outside and bent down to pick it up i heard a shout stay down a policeman stepped quickly out of the office opposite and shot mister through the head mr fell without a sound and my face was covered in blood whose blood mister was lying on the floor half his head had gone but the sunglasses still covered one eye his hands were nowhere near the dynamite policemen came running from all the offices are you hurt one of them asked me i didn't know i couldn't see there was blood on my face and shirt and a liquid that i discovered later was part of mister's brain chapter 2 devon hardy who did the eviction mister had asked but i guess he already knew the answer to that a policeman led me to the first floor of the building where friends and family and doctors were waiting the doctors crowded around but where was my wife six hours in a room with a gunman and she hadn't come to see me it was funny really because my wife claire was a doctor herself at one of the biggest hospitals in washington i lay on a table for 10 minutes while doctors examined me to make sure i was all right then my secretary polly arrived there were tears in her eyes as she put her arms around me where's claire i asked her i called the hospital she's working paulie knew there wasn't much left of the marriage are you okay she asked i think so i'll take you home i was pleased someone was telling me what to do my thoughts came into my head slowly it was like i was underwater we left the draken sweeney building by a back door there were police cars everywhere and ambulances and television vans even a fire truck i'm alive i'm alive i realized smiling for the first time i'm alive i looked up to heaven and said a very big thank you when i got home to our apartment on p street in georgetown claire wasn't there i sat in the empty apartment and thought about her we had met the week after i moved to washington i was just out of yale with a great job she came from one of america's oldest families we were in love we got married but drake and sweeney make you work very hard the first year i worked 15 hours a day six days a week i saw claire on sundays and we went out together when i wasn't too tired for the last five years i had worked about 200 hours a month that's eight hours every day for six days with two or three hours on sunday but young lawyers at drake and sweeney don't complain about long hours fewer than one in 10 become partners and everybody wants to be that one in 10 because you earn at least a million dollars a year claire was good about it for the first few months but then she got tired of having a husband who was never there and i didn't blame her there are a lot of divorces at drake and sweeney long hours at work each hour paid for by a client are more important than a happy wife by the end of our first year together claire was unhappy and we weren't talking together very much she decided to go to medical school and i thought that was a great idea drake and sweeney were telling me that i was a possible future partner i just had to work even harder when claire was studying i didn't feel so guilty about that but claire didn't just study she worked unbelievably long hours she had decided she wanted to be a great doctor soon we were playing a crazy game called i can work harder than you and another game called my job is more important than your job because i'm a doctor lawyer my boss arthur jacobs of course was on my team he had become a partner in drake and sweeney at the age of 30 the youngest ever partner and he would soon be the oldest ever working partner the law was his life all three of his divorced wives could tell you that i woke up suddenly i had fallen asleep in an armchair at the apartment and claire was sitting in a chair next to me where were you today i said at the hospital at the hospital nine of us are in a room with a crazy man and a gun for six hours we get lucky and escape eight families come and see their relative because they're interested in whether or not he's alive and how do i get home my secretary drives me i couldn't be there oh no of course you couldn't be there how silly of me i couldn't be there because the police asked all doctors to stay at their hospitals until the situation at drake and sweeney ended they always do that when there's a possible shooting oh did you call i tried i guess there were a lot of people trying next morning we made breakfast together we ate in the kitchen watching the small television the six o'clock news showed the drake and sweeney building and you could see mister looking out of the window the television news said the dynamite wasn't real the sticks were made of wood and mr had painted them red the gun was real enough though it was a 44 stolen mister's real name was devon hardy he was 45. he had fought in vietnam he had been in prison a few times for stealing but he wasn't a big criminal and he was homeless with no known family that morning's washington post had more details according to someone called mordecai greene the director of the 14th street law center devon hardy had recently lost his job then he became homeless he was living in an old warehouse this wasn't unusual a lot of homeless people move into empty buildings because they have no money for their own place devon hardy had recently been evicted from the warehouse as an illegal squatter lawyers are responsible for evictions who did the eviction mr had asked but i guess he already knew the answer to that and now i knew it too drake and sweeney had thrown mr into the streets chapter 3 mordecai green mordecai green was a warm caring man whose work was on the streets he was a lawyer with a heart i had told paulie i would be at work today the day after mister came into the office but for the first time ever i didn't go to work when i was well enough to go just as it started to snow i got into my car a lexus and drove through the streets of washington the snow came down harder and harder i just drove paulie's voice came over the car phone she sounded worried where are you who wants to know a lot of people arthur jacobs wants to see you you have clients waiting for you i'm fine paulie tell everybody i'm at the doctor's office are you no but i could be i drove around georgetown not going anywhere just driving the clouds were dark the snow would be heavy people were hurrying through the snow on the sidewalks i saw a homeless man and wondered if he knew davon hardy where did street people go in a snowstorm i called the hospital i wanted to ask claire to meet me for lunch but the hospital said claire was busy and they couldn't contact her that was the end of our lunch together i turned and went northeast past logan circle into the gang area of the city and drove until i found the 14th street law center i parked at 14th and q certain that i would never see the expense of lexus again the 14th street law center was in an old tall red brick house that had seen better days the windows on the top floor were protected by pieces of wood over the glass the door wasn't locked i went in slowly out of the snow and entered another world it was a law office all right but there was no expensive furniture here not like at drake and sweeney i stepped into a large room which had three metal desks each covered in files there were more files on old pieces of carpet on the floor the computers and the only photocopier were 10 years old there was a large photograph of martin luther king on one wall the office was busy and dusty and interesting looking for somebody asked a woman at a desk with the name sophia mendoza on it she looked mexican she wasn't smiling but i did it was funny nobody at drake and sweeney would talk to a visitor like that they would lose their job but i would soon learn how important sophia was to the 14th street law center i'm looking for mordecai green i said but just then he came out of his office sophia went back to her work green was an enormous black man at least two meters tall and very heavy he was in his early 50s with a gray beard and round red glasses he shouted something about a file to sophia and then turned to me can i help you i want to talk to you about devon hardy i said and gave him my drake and sweeney card he looked at me for a few seconds and then looked quickly at sophia who was speaking in fast spanish into the phone mordecai green walked back into his office and i followed him in the office was a small room with no windows and the desk and floor covered in files and law books sit down he said that you might get dirty what do you want i sat down i was in the room with devon hardy when he was shot i said i couldn't think this morning i didn't want to go to work so i came here any idea why he did it because of the eviction said mordecai green a few months ago he moved into an old warehouse at the corner of florida avenue it wasn't a bad place for a homeless person it had a roof some toilets water who owned the warehouse mordecai pulled a thin file from one of the piles on his desk it was exactly the one he wanted he looked at the file for a minute the warehouse was owned by a company called river oaks river oaks lawyers are drake and sweeney probably is that all no i heard that devon hardy and the others got no warning of the eviction but you can evict squatters with no warning oh yes you can't evict tenants without a warning though was devon hardy a squatter or a tenant i don't know i thought of another question how did devon hardy know about drake and sweeney who knows he wasn't stupid though crazy but not stupid i had taken enough of his time he looked at his watch i looked at mine we exchanged phone numbers and promised to stay in contact mordecai green was a warm caring man whose work was on the streets protecting hundreds of nameless clients he was a lawyer with a heart on the way out sophia didn't look up from her conversation on the phone the lexus was still there covered by an inch of snow chapter 4 mom and dad welcome to the world son you think the guys in factory jobs like what they're doing you're getting rich they aren't after i left mordecai green's office i drove around and around the city while the snow fell as a lawyer with hours to work which my clients paid for i couldn't do this sort of thing just moving with the traffic not going anywhere but i was doing it now i didn't want to go back to the empty apartment i didn't want to go to a bar either i'd probably never leave so i drove i went through poor parts of the city i had never seen before then i went back to drake and sweeney and went up in mister's elevator again walked along the hall to my office and sat down at my desk for the first time i wondered how much everything in my office had cost the expense expensive old desk the red leather armchairs and the persian carpets weren't we just chasing money here in this building why did we work so hard to buy a more expensive carpet or an older desk was that a good reason to work was this the life i wanted in my expensive room i thought of mordecai green giving his time to help people who had nothing i had about 10 pink telephone messages from clients on my desk and none of them interested me i didn't like this work my clients were big companies and i worked on their lawsuits against other big companies the lawsuits continued for years maybe a hundred lawyers worked on each one all sending paper to each other paulie came in and brought me cookies she put them on the table with a big smile before she left for home for the day a couple of lawyers came in said how you doing and left again they were probably on their way home too alone in the office again i picked up one big file and then another one which lawsuit did i want to work on today i didn't want to work on any of them i couldn't do it it didn't make any sense to me now i went to my computer and began searching our client files river oaks was started in 1977 in hagerstown maryland it was a private company so it was difficult to get information about it river oaks was the client of a drake and sweeney lawyer called braden chance i didn't know the name but i looked again in our computer files braden chance was a partner in real estate on the fourth floor he was 44 years old married and went to law school at duke there were 42 files for river oaks four were about evictions river oaks had bought a warehouse on florida avenue on january 27th some squatters were evicted from the warehouse one of them as i now knew was devon hardy the file on the eviction itself had a number next to it the number meant that only braden chance could open the file i wrote down the file's name and number and walked down to the fourth floor when i got there i saw a legal assistant and asked him where braden chance's office was he pointed to an open door across the hall although it was late chance was at his desk looking busy he didn't like me just walking in from the hall at drake and sweeney you phoned first and made an appointment but that didn't worry me very much chance didn't ask me to sit down but i did and he didn't like that either you were next to the guy when he got shot he said unpleasantly after i said devon hardy's name yes i said terrible for you huh it's over mr hardy who's now dead was evicted from a warehouse was it one of our evictions it was said chance but he didn't look at me as he spoke i guessed that arthur jacobs had looked at the file with him earlier in the day what about it added chance was he a squatter of course he was they're all squatters aren't they our client just got them out of the warehouse are you sure he was a squatter not a tenant chance looked angry what do you want could i see the file no why not i'm very busy will you please leave if he was a squatter there's no problem why can't i see the file because it's mine and i said no how's that maybe that's not good enough he stood his hands shaking as he pointed to the door i smiled at him and left the legal assistant from the hall had heard everything and we exchanged looks and smiles as i passed his desk the man's a fool he said very quietly i smiled again yes but what was chance hiding there was something wrong and it was in that file i had to get it i went back to my office to think the phone rang it was clear why are you at the office she spoke very slowly and her voice was colder than the snow outside i looked at my watch i remembered we had arranged to have dinner together at the apartment i uh well a client called from the west coast had used this lie before it didn't matter i'm waiting michael should i start to eat no i'll be back at the apartment as fast as i can i ran from the building into the snowstorm but i didn't really care that another evening together had been ruined a few hours later claire and i were having our coffee by the kitchen window the snow had finally stopped i had an idea let's go to florida i said she gave me a cold look florida okay the bahamas we can leave tomorrow it's impossible not at all i don't have to work for a few days why not because i'm going crazy and at drake and sweeney if you go crazy then you get a few days off you are going crazy i know it's fun actually people are nice to you they smile polly brought me cookies today i like it the cold look returned and she said i can't and that was the end of that i knew she couldn't do it she was a doctor people had appointments with her but also she didn't want to go with me okay i said then i'm going to memphis for a couple of days to see my parents oh really she said she didn't even sound interested i need to see my parents it's been almost a year and this is a good time i think i don't like the snow and i don't feel like working like i said i'm going crazy claire got up and went to bed well call me she said over her shoulder i knew that was the end of my marriage and i hated to have to tell my mother my parents were in their early 60s and trying to enjoy not working for the first time in their lives mom had been a bank manager dad had been a lawyer in atlanta they had worked hard saved hard and given me the best of everything dad always wanted me to be a lawyer like him i rented a car at memphis airport and drove east to the rich part of the city where the white people live the blacks had the center of the city and the whites the area outside sometimes the blacks moved out from the center into a white area and then the whites moved further out my parents lived on a golf course in a new glass house you could see the golf course from every window i had called from the airport so mom knew i was coming what's wrong she asked me when she saw me nothing i'm fine where's claire you guys never call as you know i haven't heard her voice in two months claire's fine mom we're both alive and healthy and working very hard are you spending enough time together no are you spending any time together not much i saw the tears in her eyes i'm sorry mom it's lucky we don't have kids to talk about something else i told her the story of mr are you all right she asked the look of shock on her face of course i'm here aren't i the company wanted me to take a couple of days holidays so i came home you poor thing claire and now this later that afternoon my dad and i played golf dad i'm not very happy at drake and sweeney i said i don't like what i'm doing welcome to the world son you think the guys in factory jobs like what they're doing you're getting rich they aren't be happy he was happy he was winning at the golf ten minutes later he said are you changing jobs i'm thinking about it why don't you just say what you're trying to say as usual i felt weak and like i was running away from something i'm thinking about working for the homeless i said as a lawyer i added quickly dad didn't stop playing he hit a ball into the distance i'd hate to see you throw it all away son he said you'll be a partner in a few years we walked after his ball a street guy's killed in front of you and you have to change the world you just need a few days away from work is that all chapter 5 lonte burton inside were a young mother and her children all dead the mother had started the engine of the old car and left it running of course the apartment was empty when i returned friday night but there was a note in the kitchen just like me claire had gone home to her parents in providence for a couple of days i knew claire wanted to end the marriage too i just didn't know how badly i went for a long walk it was very cold outside with a strong wind i passed beautiful homes with families in them eating and laughing and enjoying the warmth then i moved on to m street friday night on m was always fun time the bars and coffee shops were full and people were waiting in line to get into the restaurants i stopped at the window of a music club listening to sad music with snow over my feet watching the young couples drink and dance for the first time in my life i didn't feel young i was 32 but in the last five years i had worked more than most people do in 20. i was tired those pretty girls in there would never look at me now i went back to the apartment at some time after nine the phone rang it was mordecai green are you busy he asked to do what to work the shelters are full we don't have enough helpers i've never done that kind of work can you put butter on bread i think so then you're the man for us we're at a church on 13th in euclid i'll be there in 20 minutes i changed into the oldest clothes i had jeans and an old blue jacket and took most of my money out of my wallet as i closed the apartment door behind me i was excited and i didn't exactly know why i parked the lexus opposite the church the attack i half expected didn't happen no gangs the snow kept the streets empty and safe for now i went into the church down into a big room below it and entered the world of the homeless it was unbelievable how many people were in that room volunteers were giving out blankets and apples mordecai was pouring fruit juice into paper cups and talking all the time a line waited patiently for food at a table i went to mordecai and he said hello like i was an old friend it's crazy he said one big snowstorm and we work all night he showed me the bread the butter the meat and the cheese it's real complicated you do 10 with meat and then 10 with cheese okay yeah you learned fast then he disappeared i made 10 sandwiches quickly then i slowed and watched all the people most of the homeless looked down at the floor most of them said thank you to the volunteers when they got the food then they ate slowly even the children were careful with their food mordecai came back and started making sandwiches next to me where does the food come from i asked him food bank people give it tonight we're lucky because we have chicken usually it's just vegetables how many shelters like this are there in the city this isn't actually a shelter the church kindly opens its doors when the weather's bad when the doors close they go out again i tried to understand this then where do these people live some are squatters they're the lucky ones some live on the streets some in parks some in bus stations some under bridges usually it's okay but they can't stay out in the open tonight it's too cold they have to go to one of the shelters how many shelters are there about twenty two were closing soon no money how many beds about five thousand and how many homeless good question they're a difficult group to count maybe ten thousand i thought about that then i asked mordecai about himself you have a family yes a wife three sons one's in college one's in the army and and we lost our third boy on the streets ten years ago he was killed gangs what about you married no kids mordecai disappeared again a helper brought cookies i took four of them and walked to a corner where a young mother was asleep with a baby under her arm and two small children half asleep under blankets the oldest boy's eyes opened wide when he saw the cookies in my hand i gave him one his eyes shone as he took it and ate all of it then he wanted another one he was small and thin no more than four years old the mother woke up saw the cookies and smiled what's your name i said to the boy after two cookies he was my friend for life ontario how old are you he showed me four fingers four i said he said yes and put his hand out for another cookie which i gladly gave him i wanted to give him things anything he wanted where do you live i whispered in a car he whispered back you got more apple juice sure i went to the kitchen and got him a cup of apple juice and more cookies the mother was sleeping again like many homeless people she moved a lot in her sleep she was cold i took my jacket off and put it over her then the baby cried and woke her without thinking i took the baby smiling at the mother all the time she was happy to let me hold it so she could get some sleep i stayed there until three in the morning the next day was saturday since tuesday when i met mr i hadn't worked even one hour for drake and sweeney i lay in bed i hated the work at drake and sweeney i didn't want to go back ever i had breakfast at a cafe on m and wondered what ontario was having for breakfast then i went shopping candy and small toys for the kids soap for the mall warm clothes and lots of children's sizes i'd never had so much fun spending 200 and i wanted to spend more i wanted to put that family in a hotel for a month i wanted to start a lawsuit against the person who had made them homeless i couldn't wait to have ontario's family as my clients i went back to the church leaving all the toys and clothes in the car but ontario's family weren't there i asked mordecai where they were who knows homeless go from kitchen to kitchen shelter to shelter next morning sunday i had the small television in the kitchen on while i ate breakfast but the tv news stopped me from eating i heard the words but i didn't want to believe them i walked toward the television my feet were heavy my heart was cold my mouth was open in shock and disbelief sometime around 11 pm washington police found a small car near fort totten park in a gang area in the northeast of the city it was parked on the street inside were a young mother and her children all dead the mother had started the engine of the old car and left it running to keep the family warm the air in the car poisoned them while they slept they gave the mother's name it was lonte burton the baby was tamiko the other children were alonso and ontario their candy and toys and soap and clothes were still in my car chapter 6 a new person now i too carried my photograph of a 22 year old black mother who had died for nothing in a car i was at the 14th street law center how much would a funeral cost i asked mordecai i don't know are you interested i want them to have a good funeral okay then let's arrange it now we got into mordecai's old ford taurus the burton family's bodies were in the morgue of the general hospital mordecai entered like he owned the place i'm mordecai greene lawyer for the burton family he informed an anxious young man behind the desk a doctor from the hospital arrived and mordecai pushed open the big metal door inside the white room were lines of bodies covered in sheets their names were on little pieces of paper tied to their toes we stopped in a corner lonte burton said the doctor and pulled the sheet down to her waist it was ontario's mother all right in a white dress she looked the same as when i saw her alive a few days ago she looked like she was sleeping i couldn't stop staring at her that's her said mordecai in a confident and loud voice like he'd known her for years only one sheet covered the children they were lying in a line with their hands by their sides like little soldiers i wanted to touch ontario i wanted to tell him i was sorry i wanted to wake him up take him home give him some food give him everything he could ever want that's them said mordecai i looked up to heaven and i heard a voice in my head say don't let it happen again the doctor took us to an office we helped the assistant make a list of everything that had been found with the family my old blue jacket was the best thing they owned do you want it back mordecai asked me no i waited outside in the car while mordecai arranged the funeral in another office he told me the price would go up if they saw my expensive clothes in less than a week i had seen five dead street people first mister had changed my life now ontario had broken my heart there was a knock on the car window i jumped it's five thousand dollars all four mordecai shouted through the closed car window yeah yeah i said and he disappeared back into the hospital soon he was back driving fast the funeral will be tuesday at the church here at the hospital the newspapers will be there and television it's a big story thanks mordecai i said after the funeral there's going to be a march a march to the government buildings on capitol hill for the burton family television is going to film it the newspapers are going to write about it are you okay no i called in sick tuesday at 10 i left for the funeral it was a very nice church beautiful it didn't open its doors to the homeless and i could understand why i sat alone i could see mordecai with two people i didn't know the tv people were in one corner i could also see the coffins the baby's coffin was very small ontario's coffin and his brothers were bigger but not much bigger lonte burton's parents were dead but her grandmother was there she put flowers on the coffins and for a terrible second i thought she was going to open them i had never been to a black funeral before and i didn't know what to expect but i had seen old film of coffins open at funerals after the funeral there was the march to capitol hill there were big photos of lonte burton everywhere and under her face the words who killed lante on capitol hill mordecai spoke to the people he didn't talk about the homeless he talked about the last hours of the burton family he talked about the baby's last meal in the church he talked about the cookies the boys had eaten he described how the little family left the church and went back onto the streets into the snowstorm where lante and her children lived only a few more hours mordecai described things he didn't actually know had happened but i didn't care and the crowd didn't either when he described the family trying to get warm before they died i heard women crying around me if this man mordecai green could make a crowd cry like this he must be a great lawyer when mordechai finished we marched to the capitol the government building carrying the covens i had never been on a march like this before rich people don't march their world is safe and clean and there are laws to keep them happy but now i too carried my photograph of a 22 year old black mother who had died for nothing in a car i wasn't the same person as i had been before mister and ontario came into my life and i could never be that person again so i accepted when mordecai green phoned me a few days later and invited me to a restaurant near dupont circle and when he invited me to join the 14th street law center i accepted his offer of a job too we can pay you 30 000 a year smiled mordecai you'll be a partner let's see drake and sweeney beat that i smiled too i nearly told him about the file i needed from drake and sweeney the file that would give us the story of devon hardy's eviction but i didn't that night i told claire my news it was almost 10 and we were sitting in our favorite chairs with glasses of wine after a few minutes i said we need to talk what is it she asked i'm worried i'm thinking of leaving drake and sweeney oh really she either expected this or wanted to seem calm i had told her all about lonte burton and her family yes i can't go back there why not the work's boring and unimportant i want to do something to help people i told you about mordecai green his law center has offered me a job i'm starting monday how much did he offer you 30 000 a year that's 90 dollars a year less than you are now you don't do work for the homeless for the money as young law and medical students we had wanted to help people we told ourselves then that money was not important and now i'm tired she said she finished her wine and went to the bedroom the next day she visited a divorce lawyer i promised to leave the apartment by the weekend chapter 7 brayden chance and river oaks the note read top key is to chances door bottom key is to the file drawer under the window i went back to drake and sweeney for my last day they didn't want me to leave there was a lot of work and they didn't want to find someone new i was invited to breakfast with arthur jacobs in the partner's private dining room on the eighth floor how could i turn my back on a world of breakfasts in the partner's dining room that was the idea over breakfast arthur suggested that i could stop working at drake and sweeney for a year and work pro bono at the law center he said that drake and sweeney should do more pro bono work he offered to pay the difference between the law center's 30 000 a year and what i earned at drake and sweeney i smiled i would be drake and sweeney's pro bono boy for a year and they could all feel good about themselves during that year a partner would take my clients i would return after a year happy and take my clients back actually i didn't say no immediately they had at least tried arthur often talked about pro bono work though clients and their paid hours always came first but i thought about the offer and then i said no by now i hated my old work too much to go back to it i didn't like the old me that had done the work very much either i was trying to explain to arthur that i was a different man now when braden chance sat down at a table not far from ours he didn't see me at first but then i saw him staring at me good morning brayden i said loudly arthur turned around to see who i was talking to you know him he asked quietly we've met i said he's a fool said arthur very quietly it was the same word the legal assistant had used about chance when i got back to my office there were two files on my desk they hadn't been there before my breakfast with arthur in the first one there was a list of names headed people evicted river oaks number four was devon hardy number ten was lonte burton and three children i sat there for two or three minutes in silence why would anyone put something like this on my desk if the information wasn't true at the bottom of the page someone had written a few words in pencil the eviction was wrong i opened the second file there were two keys in it and a type note the note read top key is to chances door bottom key is to the file drawer under the window i put the files away i had to do some work i also had a working lunch that day working lunch meant that the client was paying but the law had never seemed so unimportant and boring i got through the day only because i knew it was my last at drake and sweeney it was almost five before i got a few minutes alone i said goodbye to paulie and locked the office door from the inside i took the files out again and began to think and make notes i had an idea who had sent the files the young legal assistant who had called chance a fool legal assistance did the evictions and it was his job to put documents in the file i phoned another legal assistant and asked him for the name of chance's assistant the guy was called hector palmer he had been with drake and sweeney about three years all in real estate we met in the library on the third floor hector palmer was very nervous did you put those files on my desk i asked him there was no time to play games what files his eyes went around and around the room looking at everything except me the river oaks eviction you were there right yeah he said what's in the river oaks file bad stuff tell me i have a wife and four kids i need this job you'll be okay you're leaving what do you care i wasn't surprised he knew people talked i was news so before i leave you want me to go into chance's office and take a file and i can't be sure what's in it do what you want and he ran out of the library i went back to my office and made some more notes i would lose my job if i was caught taking the file but i was already leaving it would be much worse if i was caught in chance's office with a key that wasn't mine i didn't like the idea at all then there was the problem of copying the file some drake and sweeney files were very thick i would have to stand in front of a photocopier for a long time and also our photocopiers worked from a plastic card that had our names on it drake and sweeney knew exactly who copied what i could use a photocopier somewhere else but it was illegal to take the file from the building and i was a lawyer but couldn't i just borrow the file i only needed it for half an hour to photocopy it i could take it to the 14th street law center photocopy it and bring it back immediately that made me a little less of a thief it was now getting late this friday night i was starting work with mordecai on monday it was now or never but i hadn't got a key to the 14th street law center i looked at my watch it was half past six i drove to 14th street my partners were still there sophia actually smiled at me but only for a second welcome to your new job said mordecai seriously like i needed all the luck in the world how about this he said pointing at my new office the best office in the area beautiful i said stepping inside my new office was about half the size of the one i just left my drake and sweeney desk would be too big to go in there there was no phone i like it i said and i did i'll get you a phone tomorrow said mordecai it was dark and sophia wanted to leave mordechai and i ate some sandwiches he had bought he made us both coffee i looked at the copier it was about 10 years old but i knew it worked what time are you leaving tonight i asked mordecai with my mouth full of sandwich i don't know in an hour maybe why i'm going back to drake and sweeney for a couple of hours i have some last minute stuff they want me to finish then i'd like to come back here late would that be possible mordecai was eating his sandwich he reached into a drawer and threw me a key come and go as you please he said will it be safe no so be careful park as close to the door as you can walk fast then lock yourself in i walked fast to my car at 7 30. the sidewalk was empty my lexus was fine maybe i would be ok on the streets the drive back to drake and sweeney took 11 minutes if it took 30 minutes to copy chance's file then it would be out of his office for about an hour and he would never know real estate was empty i knocked on chance's door no answer i used the key to his door and went in should i turn on the light it was dark i would have to i locked the door turned on the light went to the bottom file drawer under the window and unlocked it with the second key i found the riveroakes file and was reading through it when a voice outside shouted hey and i jumped a conversation started outside two guys were talking baseball i turned off the lights listening to their talk then i sat on chance's sofa for 10 minutes i could put the file back if they saw me leaving chance's office nothing would be done it was my last day but if they saw me taking a file that was very different be patient i told myself after baseball they started talking about girls i think they were a couple of young legal assistants working late then finally it was quiet i locked the drawer in the dark opened the door and went out hey shouted someone behind me i ran i ran to the back of the building got into the lexus and drove off that was stupid i thought why did i run why didn't i talk to the guy i still worked at drake and sweeney didn't i that was my last thought before the lexus was hit by a jaguar speeding down 18th street i remember a voice saying i don't see any blood and then i remember claire sitting by my bed at the george washington university medical center chapter 8 hector palmer michael you won't be a lawyer when they've finished not here not anywhere you're going to lose your license i woke up at seven in the morning and a nurse gave me a note from claire it was a really sweet note it said that she had to go to work and that she had spoken to my doctors and i probably wouldn't die claire and i must look like a happily married couple to the doctors and nurses why were we getting a divorce my left arm was blue my chest hurt when i breathed i looked at my face in the bathroom there were some small cuts but nothing that wouldn't disappear over the weekend a nurse told me the jaguar had been driven by a gang member who sold drugs welcome to the streets i thought as i tried not to breathe too much the doctor came at 7 30. no bones were broken they wanted me to stay in hospital for one more day just to be safe but i said no i had to find a new apartment the first real estate office sent me to an apartment at adams morgan north of dupont circle it was three little rooms at the top of a house everything in the bathroom worked the floor was clean there was a view over the streets i took it that evening i went back to my old apartment to see claire we ate a chinese carryout our first ever meal together had been a carry-out and this was our last meal together as husband and wife claire had the divorce papers waiting for me on the table and i signed them in six months i would be single do you know someone called hector palmer she asked halfway through the chinese dinner my eyes opened wide yes he called an hour ago said he had to talk to you who is he a legal assistant with drake and sweeney he wants me to help him he has a problem must be a big one he wants to meet with you at nine tonight at nathan's on m street why a bar i said half to myself half declare he didn't say he sounded strange on the phone suddenly i wasn't hungry i finished the meal only because i didn't want to look worried in front of claire but it wasn't necessary she wasn't even looking at me i walked to m street parking is impossible on a saturday night it was raining and my chest hurt as i walked i thought about what to say i thought of lies i could tell after taking the file it seemed easier to lie hector might be there for drake and sweeney he might be wired to record what i said i would listen carefully and say little nathan's was only half full i was 10 minutes early but he was there waiting for me at a table in the corner as i came in he jumped up from his seat and put his hand out you must be michael i'm hector palmer from real estate nice to meet you huh didn't we meet in the library we sat down he started kicking me under the table i understood he was wired and they were watching a waiter came i ordered black coffee and hector asked for a beer i'm a legal assistant in real estate hector explained as the drinks arrived you've met braden chance one of our partners yes i said as they were recording everything i said i would say as little as possible i worked mainly for him you and i spoke for a minute one day last week when you visited his office if you say so i don't remember seeing you he smiled and i kicked him back under the table we both understood the situation now listen i asked you to meet me because a file is missing from braden's office and you think i took it well no but it could be you you asked for that file when you went into his office last week so you do think i took it i said angrily well go to the police hector palmer drank some of his beer drake and sweeney have already gone to the police he said the police found an empty file in your desk with a note about two keys one to the door the other to a file drawer they also found your fingerprints on the file drawer i hadn't thought about fingerprints drake and sweeney took everybody's fingerprints when they joined the company but that was five years ago and i had forgotten about it we might want to speak to you about all of this again later said hector palmer i picked up my coat and left i spent my first working day at the 14th street law center getting the file back from the wreck of the lexus mordecai helped me we had to go to georgia avenue where the police keep wrecked cars i told mordecai that the file was important but not what was in it back home in my new apartment i looked at the file river oaks was a real estate company they wanted to build a new mail office for the washington post office and then rent the building to them they had bought the warehouse where devon hardy and lontay burton lived and they wanted to pull it down and start rebuilding they were in a hurry they wanted to start pulling the warehouse down in february on january 27th hector palmer visited the warehouse his note about that visit was on the list of documents in the file but it wasn't actually in the file somebody had taken it out almost certainly chance after mr had visited us on friday january 31st hector palmer returned to the warehouse with the police and evicted the people who were living there the eviction had taken three hours hector palmer's note about it was two pages long although he tried to hide what he felt it was clear that he disliked being part of the eviction he described how lonte burton had fought with the police my heart stopped when i read the mother had three children one a baby she lived in a two-room apartment with no bathroom they slept on the floor she fought with the policeman while her children watched in the end she was carried out of the building i drove to 14th street and copied the file then i went back to my old apartment claire was at the hospital i took my sleeping bag a few suits my radio the small tv from the kitchen my cd player and a few cds a coffee pot a hair dryer and three blue towels i left a note telling her i was gone i didn't know what i felt i had never moved out before i wasn't sure how it was done as i drove away i didn't feel happy to be single again claire and i had both lost back at the 14th street law center my first visitor was my old friend barry nuzzo he sat down carefully in the chair opposite my desk he didn't want to get dirt on his expensive suit was he wired like hector palmer maybe they had sent barry because he was my friend and also one of mr's guests that tuesday afternoon so you're here for the money he said joke of course you're crazy they're gonna come after you michael you can't take a file you mean a criminal lawsuit for theft probably and they talk to the bar association rafters working on it michael you won't be a lawyer when they finished not here not anywhere you're going to lose your license i wasn't ready for that i have the file the file has plenty of information about drake and sweeney in it you can't use the file michael you can't use it in a lawsuit because you took it from our offices and that's theft i said nothing i didn't know what i was going to do but i knew i couldn't give the file back now i had nothing else in the fight against drake and sweeney barry stood up to leave will you phone me some time michael he said at the door sure chapter 9 the homeless i'm michael where do you live ruby here and there the building had been a department store many years ago now the sign on it said samaritan house it's a private shelter mordecai said 90 beds the food's okay some churches in arlington got together and they pay for everything we've been coming here for six years inside we used a bedroom as an office this is a good office mordecai said we can be private here what about a bathroom i asked they're in the back you don't get your own bathroom in a shelter i could hear radios people were getting up it was monday morning and they had jobs to go to is it easy to get a room here i asked mordecai although i already knew the answer nearly impossible there's a long waiting list how long do they stay maybe three months this is one of the nicer shelters so they're safe here after three months the shelter tries to find them an apartment and our clients all come from shelters i asked half come from the shelters mordecai said the other half from the streets we take anybody anybody who's homeless the people here at this shelter have jobs but they don't earn enough to pay rent for an apartment so when they get one they lose it again one missed paycheck and they lose their homes my first client was called wayleen aged 27 two children no husband her problem wasn't complicated she had worked in a fast food restaurant she started to tell us why she left her job but mordecai said that the reason didn't matter she hadn't had her last two paychecks because she had no address the restaurant had sent the checks to the wrong place the checks had disappeared and nobody at the restaurant cared will you be here next week mordecai asked waylene wasn't sure maybe here maybe there she was looking for a job she might move in with someone or get her own apartment we'll get your money and we'll have the check sent to our office said mordecai he gave her the address of the 14th street law center she said thanks and left call the fast food restaurant mordecai told me tell them you're wayleen's lawyer be nice at first if they don't send the checks stop being nice if necessary go there and get the checks yourself i wrote down everything mordecai said like it was complicated wayleane's paychecks were for 210 dollars my last client at drake and sweeney was trying to get 900 million dollars but i was happy enough when i got home at the end of the day my new apartment now had some old chairs in it and the tv was on a box i smiled at my furniture my mother had called i listened to her voice on the answer phone she and dad wanted to visit me that evening i watched basketball on tv and had a few beers at 11 30 i called claire we hadn't talked in four days why shouldn't we talk we were actually still married i thought maybe we could have dinner soon the phone rang and then a voice said hello it was a man i couldn't speak i had been gone less than a week and claire had a man in the apartment at 11 30. i almost put the phone down but then i said i'd like to speak to claire please who's calling michael her husband she's in the shower he said he sounded pleased with himself tell her i called i said i walked around the room until midnight then i went for a walk in the cold why did our marriage go wrong who was that guy was he someone she had known for years and i didn't know about him i told myself it didn't matter we weren't divorcing because of other people we were divorcing because of us and if she was free to find another guy then i was free to find someone too yeah right at 2 am i was walking around dupont circle stepping over people sleeping in the street it was dangerous but i didn't care after a couple of hours i went home and got some sleep then i wanted to work i got to 14th street before 8 that morning ready to start as i walked through the snow making my way to the law center i thought of my clients by now i had a few there was wayleen and her paychecks there was also marvis like me marvis wanted a divorce his wife was on drugs she had taken everything he had including their two children marvis wanted them back how long will a divorce take marvis had asked me six months i told him marvis was clean he didn't drink and he was looking for work i enjoyed the half hour i spent with him and i wanted to help him another client was a 58 year old woman her husband was dead and the government was sending her money to the wrong place i could get all her money back and then get it sent to the right place a lot of my clients had problems like that they were just not getting money often from the government that should be theirs when i reached the law center a little woman was sitting against our door the office was still locked it was below freezing in the streets when she saw me she jumped to her feet and said good morning are you a lawyer yes i am for people like me she looked like she was homeless sure come in i opened the door it was colder inside than outside i made some coffee and found some old cookies i offered them to her and she quickly ate one what's your name i asked we were sitting in the front office next to sophia's desk waiting for the coffee and for the office to get a little warmer ruby she said i'm michael where do you live ruby here and there she was between 30 and 40 dressed in a lot of old clothes she was very thin tell me i said i need to know do you live in a shelter not now she said i live in a car i sleep in the back i poured two large paper cups full of coffee and we went into my office what can i do for you i asked with both hands on the coffee cup to keep warm and without looking at me she told me her story she and her son terence lived in a small apartment when terence was about 10 she went to prison for four months for selling drugs terence lived with her sister those four months but when ruby came out of prison they had lost the apartment she and terrence slept in cars warehouses and under bridges in warm weather when it was cold they went to the shelters she couldn't stop taking drugs a few years back she had worked for a couple called their children were grown and away from home ruby offered to pay mr and mrs rowlands fifty dollars a month if terrance could stay with them the rolands weren't sure at first but in the end they agreed terence had a small bedroom at the roland's house he started to get good grades at school the rolands were good people ruby was allowed to visit terrence for an hour each night with great difficulties she managed to pay each month as agreed she was pleased with herself until she went to prison again she couldn't stop taking drugs and now terence didn't want to talk to her he wanted to join the army mr rollins was an army man one night ruby took some drugs and then went to the roland's house she screamed and shouted and the rolands and terrance threw her out the next day the roland started a lawsuit they wanted terrence to become their son ruby wasn't allowed to visit him until she stopped taking drugs i want to see my son she said i miss him so bad you won't see terrence until you stop the drugs i said trying to say it nicely i had to get her onto a drugs program sophia knew where ruby should go sophia knew everything and everybody she made a phone call and then ruby and i were on our way to naomi's women's center on 10th street it opened at seven closed at four and between those hours helped women with a drug problem i spoke with megan the young woman in charge of naomi's we had a long talk it was the first long talk i had had with anyone in a long time chapter 10 chicago there's going to be a lawsuit hector i said against drake and sweeney you can't hide from that i was sleeping on the floor at the apartment i liked it down there and it helped me understand my new clients in the middle of the night the phone rang it was claire the police were in her apartment wanting to search it for the file i looked at my watch it was 1am i'll be right there the door was open and i ran in there were three policemen in there and i shouted at the nearest one i'm michael brock who are you lieutenant gasko said the policeman not very nicely claire i shouted get the video camera there's gonna be a lawsuit lieutenant gasko lieutenant gasko showed me a document it's signed by a judge he said and it says we can search for the file but he knew i was a lawyer and he didn't look very happy the file's not here because i don't live here i said now give me your names and then go claire was filming it all with the video camera their document was fine and i knew that but the three policemen gave me their names and then left can they come back asked claire no that's good did you tell him where i live i asked her michael i don't know where you live you just gave me a phone number i said good night without touching or kissing her i knew that was what she wanted i thought hard now i had to tell mordecai everything it was possible that the police would come to the law center looking for the file next morning i tried to phone hector palmer from the law center his secretary said he had left the washington office i put the phone down now what i stared at the ceiling mordecai came into my office i started my story my wife and i aren't together i moved out of our apartment i'm sorry said mordecai what else could he say don't be early this morning the police tried to search the apartment where i used to live they were looking for a file that i took when i left drake and sweeney what kind of file the devon hardy and lonte burton file i'm listening i don't think that devon hardy and lontay burton and the others were squatters i think there were tenants and if there were tenants the eviction was illegal it sure was candid tenants without warning but do you know are you guessing i told mordecai the story of the river oaks file i told him that something probably a note dated january 27th was missing from the file and what do you think is in this note he asked i can't be sure but i think it's a note from hector palmer i think he knew they were tenants and he said that in the note but river oaks wanted them out quickly so they could start pulling the warehouse down they wanted to start the new building for the post office in february i think hector palmer's note of january 27th was removed from the file so drake and sweeney could evict devon hardy and lontay burton and the others as squatters good said mordecai so we start a lawsuit for the family of lontae burton and the other people who were evicted yes i said that way hector palmer has to tell the judge what he knows i'll contact lontae burton's parents mordecai said they would be our clients in the lawsuit her parents are dead but she has a grandmother fine she'll be our client but first we need to find hector palmer i think drake and sweeney will keep him in the company if he leaves the company they lose control of him but they want him out of washington i think he's working for drake and sweeney in another city probably a new job with more money sophia shouted mordecai loud enough to be heard on capitol hill sophia we're looking for someone sophia came in with paper and a pencil i know she said i heard she turned to me i can help tell me everything you know about this person i told sophia hector palmer's name address and job i described him and said he had a wife and four kids age maybe thirty how much did he get a month at drake and sweeney as a legal assistant three thousand he has four kids so one or more will be in school he can't send kids to a private school on thirty-five thousand we start with the schools then the churches she went back to her desk and she was on the phone for an hour each time she said hello in english asked for the person she wanted and then the conversation was in spanish an hour later she came back into my office they moved to chicago do you need an address but how did you don't ask a friend of a friend in their church they moved to chicago last weekend i can get you an address but it will take longer i don't need an address i've been to drake and sweeney's chicago office a couple of times two days later i was there again but i hadn't flown first class as in the old days i waited outside the drake and sweeney building from seven in the morning while 106 lawyers the third highest number after washington and new york arrived for work at 8 20 hector palmer arrived and i followed him into the building he got off on floor number 51. there was a phone there i phoned mordecai and told him about my progress then i phoned megan at naomi's women's center ruby was still there doing okay hector palmer wasn't going anywhere for the next 10 hours so i had another long talk with megan there was a list of partners names on each floor i chose one i have an appointment with dick healey i said loudly as i passed the desk and then i walked past the desk down the hall hector had his own office in chicago hello hector i said as i walked in so how's chicago what what are you doing here i sat on hector's desk there's going to be a lawsuit hector i said against drake and sweeney you can't hide from that i didn't feel as confident as i tried to sound and who's starting this lawsuit lontay burton's grandmother and later at the other people who were evicted when we find them hector just looked at me you remember alante don't you hector she was the young mother who fought with the policeman when you were evicting everyone you felt bad about it because you knew she was a tenant so you wrote that in a note dated january 27th and you put that in the file but braden chance took your note out again that's why i'm here hector i want a copy of that note why would i have a copy because you're smart hector you knew that drake and sweeney's evictions were illegal you knew how important your note was maybe you even guessed braden chance would remove it hector thought about that i guessed he wouldn't be happy hiding in chicago the evictions were wrong and he knew it he had tried to help me once before meet me at 12 in front of the building he said he was there on time i have four children please protect me he said as he gave me an envelope i thanked him got a taxi and opened the envelope the note was dated january 27th it said that the tenants were paying 100 a month rent on the 15th of every month to a man called johnny there was even a copy of a receipt signed by johnny saying that he had received 100 rent from lonte burton on january 15th it couldn't be any clearer they were tenants the eviction was illegal at chicago o'hare airport i faxed copies of the note and the receipt to mordecai then i caught the next plane back to washington a taxi from the airport took me back to 14th street where mordecai and sophia weren't looking as happy as i had expected lieutenant gasko was in the office waiting for me as he took me out to the police car sophia was phoning fast and talking fast first in english than in spanish but she and mordecai couldn't stop lieutenant gasco taking me to central police station like any other criminal drake and sweeney said i had taken their file and that was theft chapter 11 megan her eyes held mine for a second and i thought no wedding ring on her finger it was friday afternoon i knew mordecai could get me out on bail but some very bad things could happen to a good-looking white boy in prison over the weekend in the police car to central i tried to think about all the great people who had spent some time in prison like martin luther king but then i thought of my parents their son in prison would be the end of their world my friends already thought i had ruined my life i didn't know what claire would think especially she had a new man now at central gaskell led me like a lost dog they took everything i had in my pockets and i signed for it then my photograph and fingerprints were taken there were police everywhere but only one other white face a man who was very drunk we were walking to the cells i was scared can i get bail i asked i think your lawyer's working on it gasko said the cell door closed behind me there were five other prisoners in the cell with me all black all much younger than me i sat on the floor in the cell opposite i could see the drunk white guy and hear him shouting two large black men had him in a corner of the cell they were hitting his head minutes passed one of the young guys in my cell walked over to me this was the end nice jacket he said touching my jacket with his foot as i sat on the floor thanks i said trying to sound like i meant it he was 18 or 19 thin probably a gang member who had spent his life on the streets i could use a jacket like that he said giving me a kick with his foot you shouldn't be a low-life street gang member then i thought would you like to borrow the jacket i asked i wasn't gonna fight back if i did the other four would help the first one what did you say i said would you like to borrow the kick caught me in the head and i shouted from the shark my friend said he could use a jacket like that said one of the other four a gift would be nice i quickly took off my jacket and held it toward the young gang member who had kicked me is this a gift he said taking it it's whatever you want it to be he kicked me again hard in the head is this a gift yes thanks man i sat in a ball on the floor my face hurt the floor was getting cold what would happen when i needed the toilet nice shoes said a voice above me i gave them to him mordecai got me out on bail at 7 pm my bail was 10 000 my friends at drake and sweeney had told the newspapers about my stay in prison lawyer out on bail was it theft i read the next day they took a photo of me when i first joined drake and sweeney and that was there too they were trying to ruin my life i wondered which client was paying for all the hours rafter and arthur jacobs were spending on me a client was definitely paying a client paid for every hour of every lawyer's time river oaks probably i went into work at 14th street ruby was asleep in front of the door why are you sleeping here i asked she didn't answer she was hungry i unlocked the door made coffee and went to find the cookies the phone rang it was megan ruby had left naomi's are you taking drugs again i asked ruby she didn't look at me no she said yes you are don't lie to me ruby i'm your friend and your lawyer and i'll help you see terrence but i can't help if you lie to me now will you go back to naomi's yes good i'll take you okay she took another cookie her fourth on the way back to naomi's she said you were in prison how did you know you hear stuff on the street when we arrived megan took ruby into the women's group and then asked me to stay for coffee she threw a washington post to me bad night huh she said with a smile there was my photo again it wasn't too bad what's this she asked pointing at my face a guy in my cell wanted my shoes he took them she looked at my shoes old nikes those yes good shoes aren't they how long were you in there a couple of hours and i got my life together i'm a new man now she smiled again a perfect smile her eyes held mine for a second and i thought no wedding ring on her finger she was tall and a little too thin her hair was dark red and short and well cut her eyes were light brown very big and round and nice to look at she was very attractive and i wondered why i hadn't noticed it before i told her about me she told me about herself her father was in the church in maryland he liked baseball and he loved washington as a teenager megan had decided to work with the poor it was a job but a job she liked i told her the story of mr and how i had started working with the homeless she was very interested and asked lots of questions then she asked me to come back later for lunch if the sun was shining we could eat outside i like that i thought it was romantic you can find love anywhere even in a shelter for homeless women chapter 12 the washington post the photograph said it all because of drake and sweeney these poor people were dead the file was thick rafter had worked very hard it was my copy of drake and sweeney's complaint to the bar association in one sentence i had stolen their file so now i should lose my license but it was a shock drake and sweeney wanted blood my blood it was frightening since i had started law school 10 years earlier i had never thought of any other kind of work what would i do without a law license but there was one thing drake and sweeney didn't know yet tomorrow morning at nine o'clock mordecai and i were starting a four million dollar lawsuit against them for the death of the burton family i went into mordecai's office what do i do i said he smiled same as they did call the washington post i was at college with tim claussen he's one of the best journalists next morning we told tim clausen about the lawsuit against drake and sweeney the burton story was already big as a result of the march and my night in prison and this made it even bigger he asked us a lot of questions and i was happy to answer drake and sweeney went to the newspapers first the story was in the newspaper the next day for an old law company like drake and sweeney it was the worst thing in the world arthur jacobs photo appeared next to devon hardy's there were also photographs of lonte burton taken from the march you didn't even have to read this story the photograph said it all because of drake and sweeney these poor people were dead the next day it got even worse for drake and sweeney the post office didn't like all these stories in the newspapers and they didn't want river oaks as their real estate company that left river oaks with nothing river oaks told the washington post they didn't know the evictions were illegal a million dollar lawsuit for lost business by river oaks against drake and sweeney was becoming possible arthur jacobs phoned mordecai at the law center he wanted to meet mordecai at drake and sweeney's offices to talk about the lawsuit without me mordecai smiled at me this could be the meeting he said maybe i replied my future could depend on mordecai's talk with arthur jacobs that night i couldn't sleep mordecai was enjoying himself he told me afterward that he couldn't believe arthur jacobs was nearly 80. the old man told mordecai immediately that braden chance was gone he didn't choose to leave drake and sweeney they told him to go chance had been the only one who knew those people were tenants i believed that mordecai showed arthur jacobs the missing note from the file and the receipt rafter was at the meeting too with some other lawyers and for a long time none of them said a word then arthur jacobs made a suggestion he said he wanted to meet with us and a judge with the judge there we could decide everything on one day the burton lawsuit the theft of the file lawsuit and the bar association complaint the judge would be judge diorio who mordecai knew was a fair judge what do you think mordecai asked me what do you think i say we do it i'll call judge diorio in a range of time chapter 13 burton against drake and sweeney you put this family on the street you've told us you did and that's where they died we were in judge diorio's room but this wasn't a court there were two lawyers from river oaks from drake and sweeney there was arthur jacobs rafter nathan malamud and barry nutso why malamud and nutso who were not going to speak for drake and sweeney then i understood malamada had gone back to work after that tuesday with mister they were fine so why wasn't i judge diorio said good morning and then gave mordechai five minutes to make the complaint against drake and sweeney in the burton lawsuit mordecai needed just two minutes he explained clearly how drake and sweeney's illegal eviction led to the deaths of lonte burton and her children arthur jacobs spoke for drake and sweeney he didn't disagree with mordecai about what had happened to lantai and her children but he said it was in part her own fault there were places for her to go arthur said there were shelters open she spent the night before in a church with many other people why did she leave her grandmother has an apartment in northeast why didn't this mother do more to protect her little family why was she in the street at all diorio asked and i almost smiled stayed calm the eviction was wrong he said we are not arguing with mr green about that we are saying that events after the eviction were partly the mother's fault how much of it was her fault asked judge diorio at least half that's too high we don't agree judge diorio mr greene mordecai stood shaking his head in disbelief like arthur was a first-year law student these people have nowhere to live mr jacobs that's why they're called homeless you put this family on the street you've told us you did and that's where they died we could go to court would you say the same thing there stand up in court mr jacobs say it was the mother's fault her family died arthur and the rest of the drake and sweeney lawyers looked scared enough at the idea of telling a court full of black people that the burton family's death was in part lontai's fault drake and sweeney are guilty of an illegal eviction said judge diorio that's clear i wouldn't advise you to blame the mother in a court mordecai and arthur sat down we had won the burton lawsuit without going to court now we would discuss how much drake and sweeney should pay rafters stood up he talked about how much money you usually got for dead children in lawsuits he had read a lot of these lawsuits across the u.s he offered fifty thousand dollars for each child he became pouring he started to discuss the amount of money lontai had lost because she died and so she didn't go to work that was added to the money you usually got for dead children in total he offered 770 000 is that your final offer mr rafter asked judge diorio he looked like he hoped it wasn't no sir rafter said mr green mordecai stood again we do not accept their offer judge diorio sir this talk of the value of each child means nothing to me i know how much i can get if this comes to court and the people of washington decide and that is a lot more than mr rafter is offering these children were of course homeless black children mr rafter you have a son at private school would you take fifty thousand dollars for him rafter looked down and didn't reply i can walk into a washington court and i can get a million dollars each for anti-burdens little children that's the same as any child in an expensive school in virginia or maryland the defense team looked at each other they all had kids in expensive schools in virginia and maryland mordecai then talked about the last hours of lonti burton and her family as he had at capitol hill he was a born storyteller and he had a good story to tell his voice went up and then down in anger at the end he pointed at the drake and sweeney lawyers speaking for them those people in that warehouse he shouted they're just a bunch of squatters throw them out he asked for four million dollars it was silent in the room when he finished judge diorio made some notes the next thing to discuss was the file do you have the file judge diorio asked me yes sir will you give it to me yes sir mordecai gave judge diorio the file and we all sat and watched for ten minutes while the judge read it when he had finished he said the file has been returned mr jacobs there was a criminal lawsuit about its theft what do you want to do now if we can agree on the burton law suit we will stop the criminal lawsuit against mr brock for theft of the file mr brock is that acceptable to you yes yes sir it is next we have the complaint to the bar association by drake and sweeney against michael brock mr jacobs arthur stood up again he talked about why it was wrong for a lawyer to steal a file from his own company he didn't seem to be enjoying it and he didn't take too long about it but i had been one of them and then i had damaged them they wouldn't forgive me for that the complaint to the bar association wouldn't be stopped i wasn't a criminal arthur said so they would stop the theft lawsuit but i was a lawyer and a good one and so the complaint should go to the bar association the lawyers from river oaks didn't speak but it was clear they agreed it was of course their client's file i had taken and arthur spoke so well that actually i agreed with them too mr brock said judge diorio do you have anything to say i hadn't prepared anything but i wasn't afraid to say what i felt i looked arthur in the eyes and said mr jacobs i have always had a very high opinion of you and i still do i was wrong to take the file and i am sorry i did it i was looking for information and i was going to put the file back but all that is no excuse i apologize to you to drake and sweeney and to your client river oaks mordecai told me afterwards that he knew immediately drake and sweeney would agree to his next suggestion the anger had gone out of the situation mordecai suggested twenty five thousand dollars each to all the people evicted by drake and sweeney when we could find them he suggested three million dollars for the burton lawsuit paid at 300 000 a year and after a lot of talk we agreed that i would lose my license for nine months only chapter 14 a new life i'm thinking about my new life i said and we both smiled early friday i was happily helping homeless people at the 14th street law center though not of course speaking as a lawyer when arthur jacobs suddenly appeared at my door i said hello nicely though i couldn't imagine what he wanted he said no to coffee he just wanted to talk arthur said that the last few weeks had been the most difficult of his 56 years as a lawyer drake and sweeney was okay again now but he still couldn't sleep he felt guilty about the deaths of the burton family and he would never forget it and he was tired of chasing money i was too surprised to say much so i just listened arthur was suffering and i felt sorry for him he asked about the law center and the work we did how long had the center been there how many people worked there where did the money come from this gave me an opportunity and i took it i told arthur that because i couldn't work as a lawyer i was starting a pro bono program i was going to use lawyers from the big washington law companies these volunteer lawyers would work a few hours a week and i would tell them what to do we could reach thousands of homeless people arthur liked the idea as we discussed it the program grew larger after a few minutes he was talking about sending all 400 of his washington lawyers to do pro bono work for a few hours a week would 400 lawyers be too many arthur asked no i said but i'll need help from inside drake and sweeney i know someone he's at the chicago office but i'm sure you can get him back as i had guessed arthur knew nothing about hector palmer or how he had helped me get the river oaks file hector would be back in washington in a month working with me arthur stayed in my office for two hours he was a much happier man when he left he had a purpose in life i walked him to his car and then ran to tell mordecai the good news we could help as many homeless people as we needed to megan's uncle owned a house near fenwick island right near the ocean a perfect place for a weekend break we left washington friday afternoon i drove and megan told me where to go and ruby sat in the back seat eating cookies excited by the thought of spending a few days outside the city megan had told me very clearly that there were three bedrooms in her uncle's house one for each of us it rained saturday a cold shower that blew in from the ocean megan and i sat and watched it out of the window sitting close together on the couch where's our client i asked ruby watching tv what are you thinking she asked quietly everything and nothing 32 days earlier i had been married to another woman living in a different apartment and doing different work i didn't even know the woman whose head was now on my shoulder how could life change so much in a month i'm thinking about my new life i said and we both smiled you", "Mi6VE77Hpbk": "a portion of this video was sponsored by\nGoogle

Good to see you too JT. It's cold out there. Long walk from\nSouth Africa. Well it is Canada. So you got one month to make spider-man's web-slinger's you already did a great job with the Just Cause\ngrappler okay I think we knew some of the design principles that you used on\nthat yes to make actual working Spiderman web-slinger's and we'll\nactually able to swing from the rafters at the shop. Think you can do it? I can. You know what? I've always wanted to do that. So, sounds perfect. Awesome. Let's get to it. this portion video is sponsored by\nGoogle Play.

Big thank you to Google Play for sponsoring this portion of the video. so one of the main challenges in making\nspider-man real is that you have to be able to release the webs while they're under\nhuge amounts of tension. Now instead of designing a mechanism I thought I would\nuse an archery release. I was a little skeptical if it would hold my weight, so we\ndecided to put it to the test. Let's swing bigger! you touch it...and it goes.. There we go. That was not me. literally just snaps under 150 pound load. Let's\nget some of that rope and use this and tie it around instead. think it will hold? Spiderman! Was that you? I don't know. so that was not really according to plan.\nWinded me a lot. hopefully my knee's ok. in retrospect that should have been a\nbit more expected... but oh well now I just need to make sure that the next design\ndoesn't let that happen so I'm going to use this instead it's called a snap\nshackle they use them on sailing boats to be able to release under high loads\nand it's just a lot stronger and more reliable than the archery release. Now I'm\njust gonna need to design and build a mount to go on my wrist. Let's go do it I'll just use a servomotor here to be\nable to electronically actuate the pin on the snap shackle. So, in the comics and movies, spider-man's webs can stick to anything with infinite strength. But since that's not possible we're gonna use grappling\nhooks instead. however grappling hooks can be big and heavy and kind of\ndangerous if they fall and hit you in the head. So I've designed something\ndifferent. I don't know if anyone's ever built something like this before but what I've made is a specially designed grappling hook that just fastens to its\nown string. This means it's going to be safer as well as smaller and lighter.\nWhat I've done is I've built three of them and an overhead bar here and we're\njust going to test out which one's the best   so it looks like this one is our winner\ndidn't work every time unfortunately but I was still impressed how often it did\nnow all I've got to do is make it out of stainless tube so we can launch it out\nof our Spiderman gun. so now we've got these cool grappling\nhooks we need to make some barrels to fire them off of. James gave me an amazing fancy solenoid valve so I've made a little test gun to see how well\nit's going to work it's a barrel welded to a nut tightened to an adapter that I\nput in the valve and then a nice wooden handle a battery that activates the\nsolenoid that opens the valve so let's test it out on safety chicken right so now we've loaded our cartridge we'll use this test grappling hook I made with no\nhooks and see how well it works. Safety chicken this town ain't big enough\nfor the two of us. so, to keep the wrist launchers as\nlight and streamlined as possible I decided to put as many components as I\ncould onto a backpack now the whole thing runs on compressed air and this\ngoes into a valve assembly I made which fits into the backpack like so. This\nsplits the high-pressure air into four separate streams and these valves block\nthe air until you put current across the solenoid here which will open up a\npiston and allow air to rush through to the barrel of the wrist launcher. These\nare the electronics and the smarts of the project. You plug in a battery here\nand that powers the solenoids here with the valves as well as the servo motors\nhere it also powers a regulator which takes the voltage down to a level that's\nsafe enough for the processors to use the processors are the logic of\neverything they primarily control the shooting and releasing so that when you\nshoot the first time it will open up valve number one to shoot the first hook\nand when you shoot again it will then shoot the second hook it does this by\nsending signals through these pins here and it does it when you give a signal\nthrough these wires here. The signals are sent by this glove that I made right\nhere. You plug it into the processor this allows you to control the web-shooters\nusing hand signals so by bridging any two of these contacts that I've made on\nthe glove such as the classic spider-man hand gesture you're sending a signal to\nthe microcontroller to fire the launcher and once everything else is assembled\nyou cover it all up with my custom spider JT logo. To see exactly how JT's\nelectronics work check out our circuit diagram on maker.io. alright, so last time when JT fell, it wasn't that safe. let's try it again this time with mats. ah this is sweet, JT you gotta try this so unfortunately at the last minute we\njust run into some problems that I can't solve in my time left here so we're\ngoing to do a paired back test with just two hooks see if I can swing once shoot\nthe other one and get it to hook all in one go not quite would you mind reloading that\nfor me almost. well we'll call it a day that\nwas a bit of excitement no no no no well I guess I'll live here forever now alright so that was freaking awesome one of our most most common fan requests is\nto make spider-man web-slinger's and as you saw in this video so far it is not a\nsimple task JT's been working out for about a month now his entire internship\nhere and we got so close to making it work so much of it worked\nflawlessly and then just a few small things ended up causing big headaches\nbut if I had a little longer it could be so much better. on the plus side there\nare a few design revisions that we can do to hopefully get rid of those\nissues and make it working either way JT is going to be taking these parts back\nhome with him to South Africa and you can follow him on his channel built IRL\nto see the future of this project we're still going to use this one and\nhopefully get two swings in later on in this video. but we gotta get to the\nairport yeah I'm literally leaving in like three\nhours sorry okay mmm I probably want to change how security is not gonna like\nthis right now Security's gonna be mad right now\nokay As you saw at the end JT's test he was stuck hanging well I guess I live\nhere forever now the release mechanism wasn't actually working that well it\nturns out once this is under load when you're actually hanging off of it it\nmakes it much harder to actually release and I won't be able to release either\ncuz it's not working So, that's what we're gonna work on fixing and then\nwe're gonna see if we can do two webshots two swings and a release now since we're only going for one swing we don't actually need both of these quick\nreleases anymore so what I think the easiest solution to get us to a working\ntest would be we remove one of the linkages and then we can use the full\nrange of motion at a closer point which means the servo motor will have more\ntorque to open just one of these instead of opening two so we can actually swing like\nspider-man all right so we've got a pile of weights here to simulate JT's weight and we've got our revised servo string so let's test it out oh boy\n160 pound lift... I feel weak... huh. my knot came out. and my string broke alright that didn't\nquite work so well so we've done a few more changes we actually added a brass\nfitting over the bolt to reduce the friction in the rope so let's try it\nagain holds the weight. No problem. 3,2,1 sweet alright let's try that again to\nmake sure it just wasn't a fluke sweet all right third time's the charm if it\nworks I'll be ready to swing from this thing sweet let's test it out for real\nthis time I've hooked the first beam which means\nit's time to swing for the first time JT if you're watching this I really hope\nthis works alright that was freaking awesome but\nanyone can swing once if you really want to be spider-man you've got to be able\nto swing multiple times before letting go   okay this is a little unnerving but I'm\nhanging from two webs the next step is to release my right hand and I'm gonna\nswing and then release with my other hand even though my glove is moved okay\nhere we go three two one one more swing. spider-man all right so swinging like spider-man is\njust as hard as it looks everything being said that was pretty cool I did\nliterally hang from two webs and I was kind of able to swing. big thank you to\nPursuit OCR for providing these awesome air mattresses because otherwise I\ndefinitely would have broken something if you guys want to see this project\ncontinue check out JT's channel Built IRL because I'm not touching this thing\nagain", "Sfsbq2CyiYo": "hey you guys welcome back to my channel my name is ashley with fitnessfits ashley bringing you some fitness talks and follow along work out i feel like i need to change that introductory but we're gonna roll with that for now today i'm going to be discussing more so in a story form on how i lost 60 pounds after i had trailing of course this was in 2013 many many moons ago but i just felt that this would bless someone either who is looking to be a mom and that is afraid um a pregnancy ruined her body or someone who has had a child and feel like they can't get the weight off from their child so if that's something you're interested in definitely stay tuned okay so let's get into it so trailing was conceived march of 2012 and i gave birth to him on december 29th 2012. now fun story a funny story uh trailing actually due date well you know you get an extra week after your due date well his extra week was june january 30th i mean january 3rd and which is my sister's birthday alicia so she was like really excited about that and i'm like i'm not keeping him in me until 2013. i need to file him on my taxes because if if you don't have your baby by january 31st of that year you can you got to wait to file the next year so i was like i want to find him on my taxes he was fully developed y'all so don't feel like oh he could have stayed in there one more week you carry them then that one more week because i wasn't but um i want to kind of talk before i get into after birth i want to talk about before i had him so um trailing was my first pregnancy my first child i never knew what pregnancy felt like for me i never knew what if i could fully carry or not working for the department of social services in south carolina i have worked with so many families where women have either constantly miscarriage or were having difficulty getting pregnant so one i felt like oh my god i can get pregnant because i've never gotten pregnant before so that let me know i could get pregnant and then two i wasn't sure if i could carry now miscarriages from what i know isn't big in my family i'm pretty sure it has happened but it's not something that's hereditary where i've noticed like most of the women in my family with miscarriage before they could actually um deliver a baby so i just wasn't sure and i wanted to take precaution so i ate very clean for the first six months of my pregnancy that be it i was a big fruit eater a big big fruit eater during my pregnancy and um of course alice and i just ate really really clean when i got pregnant the at the time i got pregnant i was a hundred and i want to say 73 pounds so i was a pretty sized woman i'm just 5'3 so 173 pounds on a 5-3 woman is a nice size i was nice and thick i did not like my weight and it's crazy because i was actually like talking myself up to starting a workout because i'm noticing like my weight is really getting out of control my case load at dss was getting high so i was always on the go but even before that i was a mountain morning mountain dew person and snicker snack person every day that was just my thing so uh it was it was just me not really taking care of myself at all before the pregnancy but once i got pregnant and me not knowing how i was going to carry i started to eat healthy um and my weight actually started to come off me i was actually losing weight in the beginning of my pregnancy which was fine because i didn't need all that weight on me knowing that i was gonna get bigger anyway six months into my pregnancy i was really not really really slim but you could tell i had lost some weight i felt like i had lost some weight but of course i was growing at the same time so the scale um eventually kind of just was consistent um i don't know how much weight i lost i really can't remember weight loss wasn't the goal at the time so i don't really remember how much weight i lost but i could tell i had lost some weight even though i was growing a human inside of me but i remember being able to look pretty slender from the back and then turn around and i was belly i wasn't big belly at six months but i i was i did have a belly um and it was crazy because i did not tell a lot of people that i was pregnant until i was six months because like i said i didn't i didn't know how i carry i didn't want to get like social media and people's hopes up high that i was having a baby and then miscarriage and not only have to deal with the miscarriage but also deal with you know people just feeling so sorry for me i'm not though i'm not the that type of person that want a lot of people feeling sorry for me um i just don't work well with that i'd rather you know my main family and me deal with it by myself so anyway um so six months hit um i started to kind of pick up on the sweets i kind of started letting go of that idea of just eating healthy probably because my conscience was a little bit clear about um carrying trailing he was gonna be fine he was gonna be healthy um so my diet changed tremendously where i believe over the first the next two months i had actually gained 20 pounds i remember the doctor telling me and of course some of it was trailing but i had gained so much weight i think i had gotten back into sodas and i gained so much weight so i did like a month where i did no sweet snow sodas i was kind of doing a fast in the middle of my pregnancy man trail and dad had split and i was also trying to gain strength on becoming a new mom and a single mom at the same time so i did a fast and i never forget i was in the middle of my fast and i was telling my sister alicia and she was like you know you should um give him a middle name isaiah because um the book of isaiah is very powerful especially when it comes to fasting mind you i did not read the book isaiah but i got uh but i named trailing trailing middle name is isaiah so um i have read scriptures out of isaiah but i have not read the entire book of isaiah but that is on my to-do list um so approaching last month of pregnancy um that that one month of fasting from no sweet sodas breads like that that helped my diet and my me carrying trailing a whole lot the doctor was really proud i honestly cannot remember i believe i lost maybe six or seven pounds but i don't trailing was still being carried healthy in a in a healthy manner so here we come the last month i'm practically done done done with being pregnant i didn't want to be pregnant anymore i thought trailing was gonna be huge i thought i was gonna have this juicy juicy juicy juicy baby um but my diet just plumber it it went down so i started craving steak and i love this place in colombia called yamato's it's not the most fanciest hibachi eating type of place but i just i think it's the sauce the yum yum sauce i was addicted to um like the steak and shrimp um and rice hibachi mix i ate that i think twice a week my last pregnancy that's all i wanted to eat me and traylin paternal grandmom we would go and sit at that place now she would eat some put hers in a container eat it at home and then i'm sitting there eating all my food but um i'll never forget that but i ate horrible the last month and i blew up you could see it in my face my face was a lot swoller than it should the day i was i went in to deliver where i ended up having to have a c-section i wanted to have trailer natural um i ended up having to have a c-section because um the pitocin they were giving me it was making his heart beat drop so they didn't want to continue and i didn't want to continue with it either knowing that so i decided to get a c-section which i was okay with and uh but i just remember having my mom take a picture of me before they um gave me medicine to numb me from the waist down and i was huge i weighed in on december 29th at 200 pounds even even 200 pounds i have never seen 200 pounds before um i have not seen 200 pounds since uh praise god um but i remember the doctor saying you're 200 pounds so i'm thinking never having a baby okay so trailer gonna be what 12 pounds easy six pounds i think seven ounces or 12 ounces trailing was all length i thought that this baby was going to be so juicy because i was huge i was so huge i'm like that's not fair so when i weighed my when they weighed me before i left the hospital or during the visit i'm not sure but i remember getting weighed before i left i had only lost what trailing um his pounds maybe an extra pound maybe i lost nine pounds you know the placenta and fluids and stuff um but they also put fluids in you at the same time so leaving the hospital as far as my weight very very discouraged very upset with myself because i allowed myself to consume so much food that last month regretting that i did that telling myself that i was eating for two telling myself oh i'm pregnant i can eat whatever i want to eat um it doesn't matter you know people expect for you to be become humongous when you get pregnant so enjoy and those are the things that i was telling myself to be able to eat more when actuality like i said i was in the middle of a separation or a split a breakup and i was just trying to emotionally and if you know my story you know a lot of my weight gain is from emotional stress where i emotionally eat because i'm introverted and i prefer to deal with things by myself then sharing it with my community which i have now so i was dealing with that and i was using food as a comfort so december 29th weigh in with trailing 200 pounds push him out leave the hospital i'm about a hundred and 92 pounds 91 pounds not excited at the time my mom was personal training and um she coached me a lot i had already decided once i had pushed trailing out the fast food was gonna stop the sodas was gonna stop the sweets was gonna stop i'm not a big candy eater but i will snack you know if somebody got some i might grab one that was gonna stop potato chips anything processed no frozen meals i'm not a single person anymore i'm eating food i mean i'm i have these two of us so i did a lot of frozen dinners uh don't do those it's so much soda in front i don't care how healthy they presented look at the sodium it's horrible so fresh foods i had a plan and because i had a c-section i was really worried about being able to work out like i don't know if that was selfish of me or not because i was a new mom and i was trying to breastfeed but i was worried like i'm not gonna be able to work out for like six weeks from this c-section to heal it properly now i'm a reader and i've read where women's stomachs would literally bust back open because they were doing too much trying to get back into a normal routine so i or just wasn't caring for themselves in a healthy way in their incision got infected so it was so many crazy stories but i knew that i in order for me to get to the workout i needed to be healthy enough to be clear from the doctor so that i could work out now the doctor did encourage me to press a pill up against my stomach as much as i could you know especially when i laugh or cough or anything and try to walk around the house so myself and my mom was really good about making sure i was walking around the house i was eating healthy like i planned and y'all the weight was just coming off and then i breastfed for a whopping 14 days 14 days trailing was so greedy he was so greedy it took about three days for my milk to come in and it just like it was never enough i remember one night i was breastfeeding he was literally going from breast to breast i wasn't sure if he was just pacifying on me or he just wasn't getting full so i broke down and popped those you know they give you some milk before you leave the hospital i popped open one of those little milks those little formless already made you just have to add the nipples through the nipple on gave him one of those he fell asleep i think i tried a one um breastfeeding the next day we had the same type of night and my mom i remember her waking up in the middle of the night i don't know she had to get something to drink and she looked over at me and she was like actually it's okay to give him milk like it's it's okay and i wish i would have got some extra help with that so any new moms or some to be moms don't give up on the breastfeeding it's so good for the baby i really feel like treylin was able to flush his yellow jaundice he was born with yellow jaundice as well he was able to flush that out of his system trailing is a pretty healthy baby to this day and i honestly feel like it was because of those two weeks of breastfeeding so kudos to the women who breastfeed for a year two years three years um five years like it can go for a while so kudos to you ladies who are willing to do that for your child it's the best thing that you can do in the bonding is so so amazing it's very unique um it's just it's just a good thing but i wish i would have stuck in there and kept with it but i decided to just give him milk and um continue the process of just simply eating healthy and walking around the house so six months i'm in six weeks i'm clear i'm feeling myself it took every bit of six weeks to heal from that c-section for me um not a minute shorter every bit of that six weeks i needed every bit of it to heal to feel normal again so i was accustomed to walking around the house i had my eating habits was immaculate like i didn't even want it i was so disgusted with the way i look i didn't even want to eat burger king or anything now mind you like i said my mom was training and um she gave me some tips um just you know like if i did have some sort of craving or something she was a big hundred calorie type of person she had hundred calorie snacks i don't even see those no more um they may be in regular grocery stores i'm a big walmart gore so if you see those like and you just want you still dealing with snack issues those were really great and um and that's what i did so i stayed with my mom after i had trailing and then i moved i'm not moved i went back to south carolina and lived on my own it was just me and traelyn and i did a lot of walking and a lot of typo i worked at um jcpenney's in a season of my life which um i enjoyed and i remember for christmas the taibo dvd collection came out at the and as seen on tv was really big it was like a really big thing then so we had a whole as seen on tv um section in jcpenney's and i remember seeing that tai bow and i got it and i enjoyed every bit of it i still have it i really need to go back to it because the ab dvd is amazing but i did a lot of walking taibo and once a week this i really feel like this was the the secret ingredient for me to lose that amount of weight in six months every month and i have just chose the second week of the month every month the second week i would do a what my mom would love to put her clients on when she first met them is a detox not for weight loss you will lose weight on the detox but to clean your system out and that detox is fruits and vegetables only and i recently posted in my stories where i was on a detox and i feel amazing i i was gonna do it for seven days and i ended up doing for five days because i started craving meat and i didn't want to just relapse on some kind of burger one day because i would you know because i was out and about so i decided to end the fruits and vegetable diet on the fifth do a detox on the fifth day and i just resumed with putting meat back into my routine um so and i feel amazing like it's still work like like the blood of jesus it's still work it's still good so um i did that every month um the second week of every month i drunk a lot of water during during that time because you will get hungry from the fruit so this time that i recently did a week ago i was more on top of my vegetables than i did fruit because i knew the fruit would make me hungry so i lost 60 pounds in six months i had a goal to lose to get to like i think my goal was 40 or 50 and i ended up losing an additional 10 20 pounds from my goal so not only did i lose my baby weight i also lost the weight that i had on me before i got pregnant all from walking so this is the i don't know oh that was a piece of hair it's a lash or something but um so all from walking walking y'all you can lose weight just from walking and eating right do not feel like you have to go in the gym and kill yourself um i felt amazing at that time i looked amazing but now that i know what i know now this is the bonus to this video the one thing i wish i would have done after when i was going through my transformation and losing weight and walking the one thing i wish i would have done i wish i would have lifted weights my mom told me over and over she kept saying ashley you need to lift some weights my mom voice has never gotten booked this high she her voice will get stern and i remember her saying one day ashley you need to lift some weights and i didn't do it i think i tried a little bit with some five pounds but you thinking i need to lose weight and we automatically go to cardio for most of us or those who don't know we thinking we trying to lose body fat you lose body fat when you're walking running jogging doing jump rope something that has your heart rate up i didn't understand at the time that weight training also burns fat but not only does it burn fat you develop some curves y'all i was what straight up and down when i say straight up and down i didn't have a curve on me oh i hate i did not y'all don't know how bad my body was i had a very teeny teeny waistline and i believe i can insert a picture right here of myself very very skinny and the locks that you see that's my first that's my first set these are my second set so i was very very skinny compared to um my comparison picture i was in a club that was still in my club in days um looking very voluptuous i will put it that way but i lost a tremendous amount of weight and you can definitely see it in that picture so i wish i would have weight train you guys if you are in the process of losing weight and you're afraid of the waist do not be afraid of the weights the weights is your friend weights have you looking great with no clothes on cardio has you looking great with clothes on so always i never forget i heard or seen somebody posted a years ago and i didn't not understand it but you're gonna see curves you're gonna have nice thighs you're gonna have a nice little round but maybe not a big bodacious but it just depends on how much work you could put in those booties could be naturally grown nice toned arms nice develop jawline like just nice so please incorporate weight into your workout regimen because that was the one thing that i wish i would have done and i didn't so you guys that's the story of me losing weight after having trailing um as you know my weight journey is always been on a up and down sparrow until i hit 2018 i no longer gain the 30 40 pound weight gain typically um that i don't even say most but i just know for me that was my thing every year i would gain 30 lose 30 and of course that happened that weight loss transformation happened in 2013 so you guys know i had gained a lot more weight even after that transformation so 2018 brought on my new way of thinking and learning not only how to lose the weight because back then i was like i i'm just gonna lose away i didn't it never dawned on me that okay you got to keep it off once you lose it you think the hard part of fitness is losing weight wait till you get to where you want to be and try to maintain it that's the hard part so that's where i am now i'm at a place where i'm no longer you know gaining the weight that that 30 40 pound weight um i recently posted on my instagram of my 13 pound weight gain since over this past year once kobe hit i plan on losing that and more and sharing that story with you guys on youtube i can't wait to do that so if you want to lose weight and keep it off i'm a personal trainer my company is fitness fits you letting women know that fitness fits you that could be water aerobics lifting weights heavy lifting boxing swimming whatever that thing is for you fitness fits you always remember that [Music] me hey", "howDFMkLSUg": "Hey

i'm gonna share with you guys what i did today friday um it varies when i take care of my plants but usually on my days off it's a day that i do a lot a lot of extras sometimes repotting sometimes fertilizing plants definitely checking what plants need water making sure there's no pests um so let me just take you along and see what happens today okay i know some hoyas need some tender loving care so i'll share that with you guys some prayer plants overall some living room plants and see which ones need some some more care today um i hope you enjoy i hope you learned something and i hope this is just beautiful plant eye candy i love seeing you guys as plants and learning tips on how you take care of plant your plants in and just sharing this plant world with each other it's always fun and i'm relaxing hopefully so come along with me and let's take care of my pets what's taking shade underneath this beautiful regal shield let's check it out oh the hoyas are having a spa day aren't they okay guys let me show you what i have going on here so i always love these little plastics they come in so handy you can pick them up um lows but i think i know my nursery local nursery has a better price for them this one's a really really big one um and deep two well and it helps for the water there um i am butter watering these plants and these are yes as you can see and they're getting a little extra treatment and let me explain how and why they the water actually as you can tell um it's a little murky looking ha oh no um it um has some fish emotion and um i'm gonna give them a little bit more of fertilizing and watering normally when i water them they dry off really really fast and this is a prime example um you can see how dry it looks and i watered it probably a week ago i'm working on this one and i'll work on it right now um but anyhow um so the what this kind of soil composition that it's in it has a lot of pearlite and it has orchid bark and it has the regular soil but i wanted to make sure it was nice while draining obviously you can tell this is a hoya carry eye and it's the green hearts but it's growing a big long shoot one way so it's unbalancing the plant i'm gonna have to work on this in just a moment and um so because these soils dry off so quickly i have felt that this hindu rope crinkles pretty quickly and i have not seen any growth in it well there's a little little little bit of growth but um i i wanted to give it a little boost look now let's just see a little bit of growth there yay so what i'm doing is i'm just gonna i'm sitting it on here and it's been maybe here for 15 minutes and i was thinking of waiting for about an hour i just want to make sure it soaks in very well with this water and fertilizer so it can not dry off too quickly and be fed this fish emotion fertilizer somebody gave this recommendation and i wanted to go ahead and try it and see if this helps these are my variegated hindi ropes i don't know if you can see there's a little bit of white on the edges here and they have not done much that one i really don't see any new growth points and i've had this for maybe three four three months and yes it was winter but still i feel like i need to do a little more sorry some water feel on it so i am going to see if this little fertilizer treatment is going to help it grow a little faster they're supposed to be already rooted so now this is my hoya obobata which is known for its round leaves and this one does have i ordered this one online off of etsy and i have seen new growth i want to say at least two or three leaves since i've had it and there's a new little shoot coming out so i'm very happy to see that there's some roots there this one has been sitting in my ikea greenhouse this one has been my ikea greenhouse and now back here i have a variegated hoya carrier which is the one that has the variegated hearts with the white in it let's take this off so you won't get mixed well actually this is a nice comparison you see the one is not very grated has green leaves and this one the variegated one has white since i've had it i've gone through a little drama with it at the beginning i lost like three or four leaves immediately when i brought it home i put it in um my plant room and i actually repotted it maybe that was a mistake and uh it it it started getting like some kind of fungus and it lost like four leaves with this little mushy dark areas i was so so scared uh but i've left it alone and look this sleeve here is new since i've had it so at least it's stopped doing what i was doing and now i've got a new leaf so let us work with this little this little plant that's having little issues off balance and i'll talk to you more about it okay guys so i'm back i have put a bamboo stick on this hoya carrier as you can see here i've actually added a little bit more soil to it and i'm i put some water from the top but i'm going to leave leave it here for a bit so it can really soak up that water and um what i wanted to tell you about this one is that when i bought it which is a good i don't know eight months ago it already came with this big stem out of it but it was not it didn't have this heart this heart just appeared maybe um in the last three weeks which i'm very excited about again it was kind of like frozen in time and i was getting kind of regretting buying it because i like plants that have growth because that's i feel like one of the most exciting parts and now it gave me this so i don't know if there's going to be little leaves coming out of that or it's going to be a peduncle not sure but there's life happening of course it is getting closer to spring so i guess that's why there's more happening and uh so yeah so that's what's going on with my little ho yes and yeah part of planet care is making a mess so after planning care comes house chores which is not that fun but it's gotta get done okay so right next to this i we have just watered these pepperonis i don't know if you guys remember seeing these from a video that i went shopping to gunther's greenhouse and i can go ahead and give you a little update on how they're doing this is the pumpkin pepperoni and this other pepperoni remember the name is rugosa and what happened is that when i got these home they uh maybe a week later this is one of those plant stories that after you get them home you they they end up showing other signs of pests so maybe a week later they were like full of mealy bugs so what was crazy about it is that where the leaf new leaf is coming out like inside of like there when it was more closed up it was full of mealy bugs babies so it was so much that and i was doing the q-tip with alcohol and removing it but it was so much that i ended up just spraying it also with alcohol and i went at 100 on call and between that and maybe the mealybugs there was some leaf damage as you can tell that was probably one of the leaves that was forming like a baby when all that happened so it was eaten up and it was damaged um i feel like it's now controlled this has been a few months and you see all that little growth coming out so i think this one usually gives a lot of growth but it was winter and it was recovering from all of that but here it goes we'll see how it goes i'm learning how to take care of it and basically i want to say it's a typical pepperoni care it does not want to dry out completely so i feel like this one here shows a lot more leaf damage immediately if i let it dry out versus this one this one is see staying a little more impeccable and this paper whatever goes that is gorgeous but the new growth is not doing that great so i think it's from that damage from the intensive spraying of alcohol that i did for several times um i there is little white little spots but that's part of the neem oil spray that i sprayed at some point that dried up that way so i don't think it has any more mealy bugs but i always have to be watching these and yeah usually i don't let it touch other plants but yeah these these are getting some butter water butter bottom watering okay so another plant that i have right here might not seem like a big deal but there's so much happening here that i'm so so excited about um this is the varicosum some of you guys wanted to have an update of what was going on with it this is the one that came from hawaii and it was basically dried up and and broken um so this is what's happening a new growth point isn't that exciting so i just kept it in the pot and the soil came in and i put it in my ikea greenhouse and i have bottom water it when when it's getting too dry and look that's happening but not only that do you see here the soil there's another growth point coming out i am thrilled and then right right here there's another green little spot there's another little growth point happening so this is a varicose um that means wow this spring and summer there might be a lot going on by the way guys these are the little yellow stickies that uh some of you guys that are newer into plant care um have asked about what to do about the nets and nasty nets well these little butterfly yellow stickers usually are in my description are great i got them from amazon and usually they're full of nets this is a fresh new one in here but that really has helped capture them so that's what's going on this one got watered already this program got watered already so we're good here i do have a fiddle leaf getting watered this one i just took it out measured it i always measure it so i can see if it needs water does not need water this one's good that one's good let's go check out some more plants this is kalithia um i think it's the silver something this one needs some water and like i tell you guys is what i do yes i i grab it like right now it it's a little heavy so in my thinking i would think ha i think it's medium it's not dry and it's not wet that's what i would think just with my judgment of holding it and yeah you stick it in here first two inches are dry um so usually an akalithia you wanna water it or a prayer plant but i always use this i go ahead and kind of double check and see it's measuring dry one two three means red and that means dry so yes this baby needs water this one is getting dry very quickly so i'm realizing that it needs water um easily once a week and then i have my trio star which i watered both of these the same day last week but i'm just gonna stick this in here and check it really quickly and see what's going on here and look this one is at five six so i go all the way down that's a seven in the middle it's about four five the top is a three so this one obviously has more water in it than that one um but i think i might just go ahead and bottom water it let it soak up whatever water it wants for today just because it is a prayer plant they do want more water you want to stay moist a little more than other plants so yeah let's give these babies some water so i'm gonna go get some plastics um to put underneath and they can get bottom water i got the little plastics underneath i'm actually not gonna just bottom water it i'm gonna put water from the top um but i'm gonna let it sit here for a bit so that way it can um soak up that water thoroughly and usually these like um to get filtered water that's what i do um and filtered water give it just a second and um i did put some fish fertilizer on this one this time because i don't think i've fertilized these in a long time i don't keep an actual um calendar i guess where when i fertilize my plants i started to do it but then i stopped writing on it so i kind of just especially because i'm using fish for fertilizer emulsion i know it says it won't burn plants so i just do very minimal like i do like one teaspoon in this pitcher and it's like two quarts so so far so good my pants have been happy so then that way i don't i don't stress about i do it like once every it depends right in winter i wasn't doing it very often like i haven't done it i haven't given them any fertilizer the whole winter so it's getting ready to be spring but even though guys this trio store has not stopped putting out new growth it's been so happy and i know this trio star doesn't normally want to get wet it's leaves wet so i kind of just get the soil wet um some of the damage i think it already came with some damage when we bought it i haven't seen it grow a lot but i'm gonna trim this up maybe so so look even prettier but yeah there's some water bottom water in the bottom and you want it to soak up and that way you'll know it's going to get enough water so i'll come back and check it thinking to put more water in this one but i'll come back and check him in about 30 minutes to an hour and then whatever water stuff though we're going to dump it and if it soaked up all the water it means it really needed some watery i'm gonna get some more water now that i'm at my prayer plants i'm gonna check this medallion over here let me get my little thing to measure the water and let's see this one's been kind of frozen in time at least during winter let's check it out it's always a good time to make sure that there's no pests okay um because they are kalithias they're more known they can get spider mites so what i'm gonna do here is take a look i always check really quickly to make sure there's no spider webs anywhere i don't see any spider webs it's always good to check in this little area right here where the leaf joins the stem that's where you tend to see the spider webs when there's spider mites and usually guys and i just wanted to share with you guys spider mites have very compact webbing okay and then you see little dots moving around it's different than a normal spider web of a regular spider you know i kind of had i was freaking out every time i saw any webbing but sometimes it could be a regular spider in your plant so as you can see i've cut some of the leaves off the past few months because they got a little ugly but it's actually i'm happy because it's almost the end of winter and look at it it's still more for the most part the leaves are there and they're complete and they're not browning so not too much damage so now we're gonna check okay so yes it needs water because that's a four five and that needs a water okay so let's measure because this is like prayer uh galithia it also doesn't wanna go to the dry side you wanna keep it moist so now i'm gonna water this one this one um is in a catch pot and this is a little plastic pot so i can actually water here as long as i don't over water it it shouldn't spill over so i'm gonna do this again i have my filtered water in here i'm just going to do something like that that should be good and again later on i'm going to come in and throw away all the excess water but i'm going to let it sit here so it can really saturate the soil i already checked my prayer plant over my never never plant here um and i'm amazed that it's made it through the winter because when i got it and maybe it was fall and all the new growth was coming out a little bit of brownish and i have a friend that bought one and hers kind of died so i don't keep this i've had this in my living room and i did not have a humidifier going the whole winter so the air was dry this is a new leaf it came out nice and i just saw it the other day i was giving these new leaves and they were coming out great normal color so that was happy about that so this one made it um so i don't think this one's so picky and i will tell you this i have not changed the soil it came in from lowe's and i've just measured it and it usually stays on the wet side for two or three two or three weeks and i've water i water it like once every three weeks but it stays wet for a good amount of time and i did not repot it because i was afraid uh my cousin that also got one she repotted hers quickly because that's what she was advised by the guy at lowe's and hers shriveled up so i was thinking i'm not going to touch it whatever happens happens and uh it survived and it's it's pretty good so i guys i recommend these are pretty aren't they i think they're stunners and they're not very expensive so i've been happy with that one my crocodile fern is still looking pretty good and it is a fern you know these can dry off kind of quickly but this one um it's been doing good and uh i just measured it earlier and it is i've watered not too long ago so that one's good um this is my fiddle uh fiddle philodendron or i like to call it a horsehead philadelphia um this one's doing good and this one has also got some watering right before you i started this video so both of these are sitting in a little bit of excess water that i have to dump out in a moment this is my mykins this is trailing up look how beautiful that looks and this is my philodendron frantianum and look at that it's been doing good no problems that i know of so i'm happy with it um yes the new leaves come in small i hear some people complain about that but i think if you let it it just starts growing in and getting bigger with time so i don't pay that too much attention and let's see what else who else needs some tender loving care and let's go around and check him out okay guys and i also wanted to share with you something that just arrived in the mail um just yesterday when i came home this had arrived there was a package so it's a humidifier and i wanted to try it um and then like homes reached out to me and let me try one um so i could review it for you guys so i'm happy to do that um they even let me choose the one i wanted so i did want another humidifier because i currently already have one at the lee boat i think and it's in my um plant room but after having bought that one i've realized what maybe i wanted for my second humidifier and um they allowed me to choose like i mentioned so i chose a big one because i think it's good not to be have to refill the humidifier because it's just you know it's a hassle at work so this one it says here it's 6.5 so it's a large capacity and it can go up to 800 i'm square feet of humidifying and another requirement that i had for the one next one that i chose i wanted one that would be top fill because the other one is bottom fill so it's a little more complicated to fill it and you know we get let me see it and someone didn't have a lot of time so um just unpackaged it yesterday and i'm playing with it i'm learning about it and i wanted to share with you guys okay so this is the model and to turn it on oh first to fill it up with water you just pull this off and the tank is right here and you can just put some water bring it in a little container and i'm using filtered water just because i don't want you know it has less calcium and minerals so just pop it like that there is a control if you wanted to use the control but i'm going to press the on button and look at that mist so pretty simple pretty simple to use and and then in the house you can do uh max or minimum so let's see how that changes okay you see here the lines are changing so i guess that's max oh no that's even more and that's less see the little lines um i think normally i would keep it on a lower mode because i want the water to last longer no reason to blast it i guess right now we are in spring the humidity in my house is not very bad i want to say it's staying in the 60s um but especially in winter humidifiers come in very handy if you turn on the heat in your house and your air gets drier and then humidity loving plants like the ones that i just put around here um might suffer a little bit so i'm happy to know i have this back up in my living room so i can always pop it when i want to make my whole living room be an ikea greenhouse why won't we um humidity does great with ones it helps them push out more leaves for them to come out better um even bigger and i can see that from ikea greenhouse how great humidity has been for plants so if you can add it um it's always a plus um let's see what else it seems like you can do heating so if you wanted the mist to be warm you can do that um so pretty simple pretty simple and easy to fill and i think that's what i was looking for easy to fill in a big tank so um yeah um that's it in the end so i just want to share with you guys and i will put a link in the description you guys you know shop around um but look in the link and look at their models they have look at the prices maybe they'll have some sales going on and it might be a unit that you'd be interested into so i just want to show that so let's continue with our plank here okay so here in my living room i also have this hydan sony eye and um i'm always you know concerned about this one because if i let it dry out one day the leaves turn yellow like this like this i've heard a lot of people complain about that too and i'm a little sad because this plant came with huge leaves at the beginning and now i have more medium-sized sleeves but it still keeps putting on new growth like you see here so i guess it's not the end of the world and it's still gorgeous but i have to check it constantly so again yes i could stick my finger in there but i like doing this okay so this one's measuring six so still on the moist side um seven that's all the way down bringing it up a little bit more for four and a half so just knowing that this one's a little picky like i mentioned i'm gonna go ahead and give it some water and um some of you guys mentioned how do you keep the moss pull wet well i don't keep it wet it's dry right now but i need to do better so one thing i can do right now very quickly is spray with water and i think that's what i'm going to do and then i want to give it a squirt of water down here um this catches the water no actually it has a drainage hole so if it was a nice warm day i would take this outside and maybe hose it so it could get you know the leaves could get washed and that moss pill could get wet but i'm just gonna put another plastic little pot here on the side and i'm gonna water it let's do it guys i got my water and i have all my little outside plants that i keep on my porch inside because it got cold on us yesterday and today so they're here in the entrance of the house but i normally don't have them there so yeah um i did put some fish emotion in the water like i mentioned earlier just because like i said it's getting to be springtime and yeah this is a good time to remove dead leaves okay and my video my normal got my normal guy that helps me record this it's not available right now so i'm having little issues i guess i guess i could use a tripod but i'm just doing this okay and i have like a balls on top it doesn't mean it's in actually you know like i just put it on top i don't know it was crazy one day and i thought it would look cute so i put like a bolt on top but no not that i suggested because i don't think it makes a difference i don't think it makes it i don't know i'm thinking like will they help prevent nuts but i didn't even have that in this plant but i just popped them on there i might need them for a plant later on but see like i mentioned look at this leaf look how big it is look at those big holes but like i mentioned it's very sensitive and it yellows pretty quickly but i mean i think compared in relation to the leaves that i'm getting i'm doing okay um one day it's going to fill up this moss pool so yeah overall looks pretty healthy doesn't it okay i guess that's it i went around my living room and checked my plans in my living room so that's where i'm gonna leave this video at just my living room and now i'm gonna clean up my living room okay so that is all that i'm gonna do today in my living room plants i think they're all doing pretty good it's always good to go around check them my ikea plants are doing pretty good um check those about a couple of days ago um so i basically go around my house and i'll choose maybe a room or a type of plant like if i'm doing hoyas i go ahead and check around my house all my oh yes if i'm doing my prayer plans i usually go and check around all my around my house all my prayer plans usually um it's not always the same 100 but i try to keep a mental order of when i've done what plans um sometimes i plant well in my kitchen i'll do it one day i'll do all of them so that way i don't lose track of one one plant here or there i mean it happens from time to time but normally not but um i hope you guys got some tips it helped i just wanted to share because you guys did for me to share so hopefully um you guys enjoyed seeing some of my little plants in my plant care okay thank you for watching don't forget to subscribe and give it a thumbs up if you enjoyed this kind of video thanks bye", "P9nR3mMG7Ds": "hello everyone welcome back to another game if you can see video end game uh assassin's creed this was gifted by or lent by emil so thank you so much i felt like giving him a search out i've never played this game before i don't know what to expect but hopefully it should be fine and hopefully you guys are excited for it because i have no idea we'll call this save like um we'll call me john straight up used to be when people talked about the end of the world we lock them up or laugh them off sometimes both but we never took them seriously maybe we should have but right better to start at the beginning with the abduction of desmond miles this boy had no ambition no direction no plans for the future what he did have was a heritage one he chose to deny it nearly cost him his life he was captured and imprisoned those who took him believed he could help them find something the apple one of several artifacts we call pieces of eden bits of ancient technology scattered across the globe some hidden some found all of them dangerous most are held by a single group sir above my camera being individual desmond i'll fix it we know them as the templars as the enemy we've been fighting them for thousands of years i'll just oh my face can't miss all up in the top never mind i'm sorry for it a device that allows us to enter and experience the lies of our ancestors it holds the power to change everything to show his history the way it really happened up until its creation to the victor when he spoils us when the truth we're trying to fix that the free minds and bodies both but there's only so much that we can do and the templars have the upper hand but something larger than the assassins and templars is approaching bigger than all of us and if we can't find a way to stop it these next few weeks will probably be our last everyone's last in the end it all comes down to him to desmond through the animus he discovered his heritage explored the lives of his ancestors and uncovered their secrets when that was done he trained he used another ancestor to provide decades of experience in the span of a few days it worked we think we hope though soon we'll know that ominous date fast approaches december 21st 2012 none of us knows what it'll bring only that this is where they want us to be when it does they've been guiding us in their own fractured frustrating way these voices from the first civilization the ones who came before a precursor race of immense power and uncertain motives they're the ones who made the pieces of eden this is where they've led him and through him us he stands at the entrance to this long lost place armed with the knowledge of altair and the abilities of ezio he holds in his hands the apple of eden and we stand at his side ready to support him however we can i want to eat that is desmond miles and he has brought us to the end that looks kind of tasty i'll be honest so how how do we do things now i have have never played a game like this so this will be interesting that cutscene was quite good um again i've never seen or played this game but the graphics looks fine hopefully my pc can handle it with recording if it's laggy as hell then rest in peace is me but we'll give it a look so first of all we start in the beginning it seems after a little while i'll just pause and see if it goes smoothly on the recording because i don't want this to mess up look at the graphics though the graphics are quite fine and i'm happy that my pc can handle it let's go so yeah let me just uh pause real quickly and uh beer it seems fine it seems fine so let's just walk um yeah i just checked the recording if it worked finally and uh it's dead so now we're just walking down can i even use no this is just to change the thingy so hopefully this isn't too laggy i didn't see any lag so yeah should i just go in front or let's see my pc isn't really the greatest so should work hopefully no hope poop whoa that looks cool that's the apple of eden showing its magic i don't think i want to eat that either way i'll poop like lightning poops yeah let's put it in there and what will happen it's cool they're like tagged and stuff like painted [Music] yeah i might adjust the game volume in the next episodes it might be a little bit low for you guys i will actually turn it up a little bit for you guys there we go yeah sorry about that it should be better now volume anyway oh what the hell that's like a new map fish thing now we're in a cave where are we going i can't really run at all they're just standing there hey sup dude how are you doing can i can i jump can i attack oh so now i know how to run i know i draw now i just hold my right mouse button that's quite handy that i've pulled right there in the movie it also was quite important i saw the movie i kinda know the story how it goes not this one but i don't know how to attack or anything though i guess we'll find out will i be the only one that's going here so i can't all right i see i look kind of cool doesn't that don't i wish i looked that cool in real life all right so what's up now let's see i'm just i just like the graphics the graphics looks good it looks fine enough i have seen better but still let's see here what's the dots there well then that's quite a power source wow that's cool well then um that's not bad looking you guys heard from have probably seen this before you must find the key what um that's just a memory here we go again seems to have been experimenting it again experiencing do you hear us yeah what happened the temple triggered a bleeding effect you collapsed and entered into a fugue state so naturally you dropped me into the animus instead of i don't know making sure i was okay you weren't in any danger besides the temple appeared to be communicating with you and i didn't want to risk severing the connection at least not until we knew what it wanted right of course i get it and i know what i'm looking for by the way it's a key there's no idea where it is though all right juno dad she's talking to me i don't know who juno is oh okay so we're the animus right now visiting constantinople we picked up a software update for the animus i'd like watch the marker over there the green alright so now i'm holding that sparkly let's practice climbing on these objects how do i climb uh to start climbing um where do i climb then here wait a minute where can oh i can climb up here right wait a minute so i have to go down there all right i see now right that was quite easy well let's see now now i have to get up here and now can i climb on that so now where did i go now um i don't know is it over there drop i don't want to drop there we go all right now i understand i thought i had to do some difficult stuff and move to free run all right that was kinda easy let's freerun a little bit i suppose that was quite cool um where do i go now now it's climbing and stuff that's a constraint these are optional objectives that raise your synchronization rate right sorry for being quiet and kill the two templars there we go let's uh right all you have to do here is whoops all right let's jump the gap there did i fail can't take it up again oh wait what right here we go um here we go that was close that was close holy [ __ ] this is starting to become tough already and i'm just at the beginning course let's just climb up here this is kind of stiff but he seems to be able to walk it there we go there we are i think i made it levels you should be able to build the world oh look at me look at me look at me i'm cool um let's get here just look it's building itself look the world is literally building itself wow can i like walk here everything all right sir yes fine i'm just preoccupied that's all after this is loaded i think i'll end episode 1 here because i have the ghost very soon so yeah and be quick about it don't expect to be here can things just load please i'm just walking here with this guy what's up dude how are you doing you like my hats i kind of like my hats i'll be honest it's kind of cool yeah i can't really run right now this is e here we are now things are loaded-ish um yeah all right can we save this now um does it automatically save current game session and dna tracker sequence one all unsaved progress will be lost how do i save them but here perhaps um how do i save uh i guess we'll do mission one then we'll see if it's saves or not i don't know invitation please shall i take your coat sir well um ladies and gentlemen you are requested to kindly find your seats look how badass i am right now no i have no idea all right this looks good good evening sir this way please i want to just save it though [Music] like yeah tickets been saved already all unsaved progress will be lost sure how can i just save the things then reload last checkpoints notification dnr tracker controls graphics graphics is fine uh hud is fine controls general max volume blood subtitles whatever i guess i can add subtitles for you guys there on already all right um [Music] if i lose this progress it's not too much right council also waits now i want to go there i want to quit sure here we go exit the desktop thanks guys for watching if you enjoyed hit that like button i will continue probably tomorrow or something this was very fun so like seriously i'm excited for this game i just can't make this video very long because i have to go soon thanks for watching like subscribe if you're excited for this series i sure am and i will talk to you guys next time goodbye [Music] you", "Xc4xYacTu-E": "Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. Down here. But which way is down? And how much does down weigh? Well, down weighs about a 100th of a gram per cubic centimeter. It is light and airy, which makes it a great source of insulation and buoyancy for water birds. But if you let go of down... It falls down. So that's which way down is. It's the direction gravity is pulling everything in. Now, for someone on the other side of the Earth, my down is their up. But where are falling things going? Why do things fall? Are they being pushed, or pulled, or is it because of time travel? First things first: let's turn the Sun into a black hole. We can do that using Universe Sandbox 2, this simulator will blow your mind. I love it. In fact, I love it so much I put a code to get the game for free in the current Curiosity Box. If you're not subscribed to the box yet, you are missing out! Okay, look, for the purposes of this video, we want the Solar System. And here it is. Notice that everything's moving pretty quickly around the Sun. That's because we currently have the game set so that every second that passes for us, is 14 days, almost, in the game. If I change this to one second, we're looking at the Solar System in real time. You'll notice that it almost looks like it's frozen. Even though the earth is traveling around the Sun at about 30 km/s, it barely appears to be moving. That is how vast space is. Anyway, let's go back to 14 days I like that motion. Now look at the Sun It is not, currently, a black hole, but we can change that. What we need to do is compress the Sun. So let's lock its mass so that it doesn't change while we make its radius smaller. Let's make its radius as small as we can. And, oh, where'd it go? Well it's still there, it's just become a black hole. Pretty spooky, but now, let's look at the rest of the Solar System. Alright, zooming out and- huh. Nothing's... changed. I mean something's changed. It's colder and darker, but nothing's flying off into space or getting sucked in. You see,  by shrinking the Sun, we didn't change the direction of down for the planets. They're always being pulled by gravity towards its middle and making it smaller didn't move where the middle was. But also, the strength of that force pulling them to the middle of the sun stayed the same. That gives us a clue as to what down is. The clue is the other thing we didn't change: mass. Mass is a measure of how hard it is to accelerate something; to change its motion. Now right now, these two balls have zero motion relative to me. Slapping around this hollow plastic ball is pretty easy, but doing the same to this solid steel ball is a lot harder. Now gravity and weight have nothing to do with this. Gravity acts downward, not against my horizontal slapping. Of course, gravity does contribute to friction, but friction works against me when I start moving the ball, but works with me when I stop the ball. And the steel ball is harder to stop than the plastic ball. The difference is mass. The steel ball is more massive It's more resistant to having its motion changed. Mass is an intrinsic property; it does not depend on what's around or change from place to place. It can sometimes be thought of as the amount of matter something has. Your mass is the same regardless of where you are. On the moon, on earth, in the middle of intergalactic space floating around. But all of this said, mass does seem to care about what's around. Mass loves company. Things with mass and/or energy are attracted together by a force that we call gravity. The feeling of gravity is just you and the earth being attracted to one another. Now every portion of an object with mass attracts other portions towards it. The average of all this pulling is an attraction between centers of mass. Giant things like Earth exert an obvious pull, but everything does. Even a baseball. These two baseballs are attracted together by their own gravities. Except their masses are so small, the force is minuscule, and it can't overcome friction or push air out of the way. They're never gonna come together But if you put two baseballs one meter apart in the middle of empty space where no other forces could act on them They would literally fall together and collide. It would take three days to happen, but it would. Isaac Newton found that the strength of the force bringing two things together is equal to the product of their masses Divided by the distance between their centers of mass squared times big G, the gravitational constant. If you make one of two objects more massive, or move them closer together, the force will be stronger and this force of attraction is what we call weight So mass is intrinsic, whereas weight depends on what's around. Now, a weird thing happens when you weigh yourself on most scales. Weight is a force, but scales display pounds or kilograms, which are units of mass. What's going on is that a scale is activated by a force. Any force. It doesn't have to be caused by gravity. The scale then displays what amount of mass near the surface of the earth would be attracted to the earth with the force it's detecting. Now since scales tend to be used on the surface of the earth, by people, on which the only force acting is gravity, they tend to not be very far off. But they can be easily tricked, and they further lead to the confusion between mass and weight. Notice that weight is mutual. You are pulled down by earth with the same force that you pull up on earth. According to a scale, I weigh 180 pounds on earth.. And the earth weighs 180 pounds on me. But because the Earth's mass is so much greater than my own, and because the more massive something is, the more it resists being moved, our equal and opposite weight forces accelerate me a lot more than the earth. If you drop a pencil from a height of 6 feet, the pencil doesn't just fall to the earth. More precisely, they both come together. They're attracted to each other by equal forces but the same force moves the pencil a lot more than the earth. When you let go of the pencil, the earth is literally pulled up to the pencil by the pencil's own gravity, a distance equal to about 9 trillionths the width of a proton. That same force moves the pencil the remaining distance, which is still pretty much six feet. At the height of the International Space Station's orbit, you and earth are attracted about 10% less than when you're on the surface; about eight point eight times your mass, but not zero. For this reason, weightless astronauts in zero gravity are neither weightless, nor in zero gravity. Their weight force fails to bring them and earth together, because they move horizontally so quickly that they fall just as fast as Earth's surface curves away from them. And even though they're experiencing 90 percent of the gravity you and I are feeling right now, (That's why they don't just fly away) There are no forces, called g-forces, to resist their weight, since everything around them is falling too. It's resistance to your weight force, stress, deformation, that is needed for you to feel weight. What astronauts in orbit actually lack is apparent weight. Likewise, a helium balloon has weight. I mean, it's made out of matter it clearly has mass, so it's attracted to the earth. Let's try to measure its weight force. Okay, it has negative apparent weight. That's because its attraction to the earth is weaker than the buoyant forces from the air around it that push it up. Now, while it moves up, It pushes air molecules down, but they transfer that force widely. Not just directly down onto the scale. Buoyant forces are caused by the fact that whenever you are immersed in a fluid like water or air, molecules lower down are at greater pressure. They're being pressed by the weight of all the molecules above them and are closer to earth, so they're pulled to it with a stronger force. Now having greater pressure means they pack a bigger punch when they collide with things. So, horizontally, those collisions cancel out, but vertically, the stronger collisions from below win out, providing lift, a buoyant force. This even happens on your own body. Across its surface area air lifts you with the force of about one Newton, which is equal to the weight force of an apple. So if you weighed yourself in a vacuum you would weigh about this much more. But that's not all Earth's spin causes it to bulge at the equator so the closer you are to it The further you are from Earth's center of mass and the less your actual gravitational weight will be down is Always changing, I mean where is Earth's center of mass? It would always be the same as Earth's geometric middle if Earth's composition was uniform, but earth contains pockets of massive rock at different depths water mountains It's got moving changing insides and air and seasonal ice and though they're far away Gravity extends forever from everything so the moon the Sun the planets all of them pull on you negligibly, But truly. You weigh about a millionth of your weight less when the moon is directly above you This chunky shifting balance of material on earth and ever where else in the universe means that down is always changing on top of that Earth's spin Skews what you consider the direction of down away from its center of mass because the push you get from Earth's spin Seems to slightly lift you reducing your apparent weight and bending down towards the equator The net result is an apparent weight reduction at the equator of about half of a percent if a scale guesses your mass must be 200 pounds at the poles it'll guess that you're 199 at the equator. The 9.8 Multiplier used so often in physics is calculated based on how these factors affect someone at 45 degrees latitude all of these influences on the direction of down result in a total vertical deflection. That's only ever at most a few arc seconds anywhere on earth That's not enough to be felt, but changes in direction and strength can be used to study the shape of the seafloor Determine what's under you or even help you discover ancient buried rooms? Point is all of our downs aren't a bunch of radially symmetric lines Down is an uncombed mess. Now since solids don't flow they can have shapes that don't pay much mind to this but water can Flow so ignoring influences like wind and tides the surface of oceans and lakes and puddles is always perpendicular To down if water could pass through land, or if earth were submerged in water Gravity would be the same everywhere along its bumpy surface Such a surface is called a geoid and can be drawn at any altitude If you wanted to build a table that completely enclosed the earth it would have to have rolling undulation Z' nearly 100 meters at some points in order to be Level so that a ball placed anywhere on it wouldn't roll Here is Earth's G. I exaggerated a thousand times You'd weigh about a hundredth of a percent less a few grams here? Then you would say here where gravity is a bit stronger point is the strength and direction Down is variable by location and changes over time So down is a fluctuating vector easy enough except? Why should matter attract matter in the first place? Isaac Newton was able to describe attraction, but not explain it humanity got closer however when Albert Einstein introduced his general theory of relativity Einstein thought a lot about the fact that everything falls to the ground At the same rate no matter How massive something is when dropped it will accelerate towards the earth down gaining about 9.8 Meters per second for every second that it falls. That means that a hammer That's quite massive, and a not so massive feather when dropped from the same height will hit the ground at the same time Okay, what just happened... was an \"air\"ror. awkward laugh In order to fall through air a thing has to push air out of the way But if it has a large surface area and a low weight force it will have a lot of air to move But won't be able to move that air very quickly. In a vacuum, things do fall at the same rate regardless Of mass. This was famously demonstrated by Apollo 15 commander David Scott on the moon And I'll, uh, drop the two of them here and hopefully, they'll hit the ground at the same time. How 'bout that? That's weird right? I mean if a more massive object is pulled with a greater force Shouldn't it fall faster? Well Newton's explanation was simple: Larger masses are attracted with greater forces But will also require more force to be accelerated the same as a less massive thing Something a hundred times more massive might require a hundred times the force, but it will be pulled by gravity 100 times more so everything falls to earth at the same rate What a fun coincidence right? Maybe not Einstein realized that there's another way for things to appear to fall together of their masses Imagine a feather and a hammer floating in space in a room if the room is suddenly accelerated up at 9.8 M/s^2 the feather and the hammer will hit the floor at the same time furthermore whether it's the room coming up to meet them or gravity being suddenly switched on Neither object will feel any force pushing them There's no way to tell which of these happen. This is Einstein's famous equivalence principle He once admitted that his greatest thought ever was that of a man falling off of a roof While falling the man would not feel any forces on him even though. He's speeding up freefall is Indistinguishable from floating alone in space from having no forces on you from not being moved What if gravity isn't a force at all what if things fall not because they're being pushed or pulled But because they're not being pushed or pull To see how this could be we need to talk about straight lines What I have here is a retractable ID badge holder This is a great way to test for straight paths Because the string is always kept taut the card I have behind has two lines drawn on it And if while I pull the string out it always stays between those two lines I will know that I never turned While I pulled it because any turn will translate into a different angle between the lines on the card and the string Now if I put two of these on a flat table and pull them out, always ensuring that they go straight ahead They will never meet. They will be forever parallel, but now let's put them on a sphere a curved surface Again, I pull both strings forward making sure that they always are pulled out straight. No turning Wait they came together Well, they didn't turn look Maybe there's some kind of weird force that pulled my hands together and just like gravity. I didn't feel it, but it happened No What happened was not the result of a force it was just a natural result of? Curvature you might be thinking wait a second are those really straight lines. I mean they don't look that straight to me Also, what if they've just moved along latitude lines then they've never come together and those look pretty darn straight But they're not a straight line never turns and although latitude lines look straight at first glance following one requires Turning to find straight line paths on surfaces whether they're flat like this or curved I love the ribbon test. Now you can use an actual ribbon But I have found that a strip of paper works. Even better. Let's take a look at this path right here It's straight at first, but then it curves now if two people are traveling along this curve And they want to stay together the person on the inside will have to cover a shorter distance than the person on the outside Since both sides of this strip of paper cannot change their lengths They'll help us find a straight path if the strip of paper can lay flat We'll know that we have found a straight line and as you can see The strip can lay flat and follow the straight part of this path But when it comes to the curve in order to follow the path now The strip well it has too much material on the inside and that material Bunches up and leaves the plane therefore we know that this part of the path is not straight Let's use the ribbon test to find straight lines on the surface of a cone Well from the looks of it aligned directly from the base to the tip seems like it would be straight and sure enough Yeah, the ribbon lays flat on that path, but what about a ring around the cone? Nope doesn't work shorter distances around nearer the tip of the cone mean that there's too much ribbon up at the top So doesn't lay flat Let's see what else is there though besides this well if I start here and just allow the ribbon to lay flat Huh I get a little curvy looking shape like this I say curvy looking because while to someone say at the base this path might seem to go up Slow down change direction and then fall down faster and faster since a ribbon on such a path is flat It's actually for inhabitants on the cones surface Perfectly straight if we trace the ribbons path on to the cone We can see this clearly because a cone can be flattened a straight line on a curved surface is called a geodesic Here is a geodesic on a sphere the Equator is one Here's another a line of latitude is not a geodesic It's not a straight line to see why let's try to follow it with the ribbon you Know what I have to keep kind of lifting it Yeah, see distances around the sphere becomes shorter as we go up So there's too much material on the ribbon up here and it leaves the surface this path contains turns and in order to turn a Force has to act on you if no forces Did this is the path you would take notice that the ribbon begins moving due east, but then falls south Falls Einstein realized that curvature could cause things to be seemingly attracted to one another Without needing to invent the existence of forces like gravity but attraction only happens if things move along the surface if they stay still they Well, they don't come together so for something at rest. How does falling begin? I mean the thing has to move in this direction, but it's at rest right well Yes But it's only at rest in space and that's not the whole story up down Forward backward and left-right are all you need to describe where an event occur but a complete description will also need to describe When together these four dimensions form the setting in which everything in our universe happens Space-time Since we can talk about a falling pencil using just one spatial dimension up and down we can use a piece of paper to model Space-time for it. Okay, so we've got up and down, but we have to add another direction the pencil moves in time Now if no forces act on the pencil it won't move through space It will only get older and as you can see if all it does is get older It won't fall if space-time was flat when I let go of the pencil it wouldn't go anywhere, but now let's allow the earth which is massive to manipulate space-time into say a cone Now with no forces acting on it every part of the pencil follows a straight line But on a cone as we saw earlier such a path will look like this it will fall This is because distances around the cone are shorter higher up Time runs faster further from a massive object, but to go straight Not turn every part of the pencil must cover an equal distance in space-time like this Only when the pencil hits the earth does the repulsion of their mutual electrons provide a force pushing the pencil off a geodesic For the earth time is a series of slices from this evolution the pencils force-free Geodesic is why it falls not a push or pull just the pencils natural tendency to follow a straight line Until something acts on it now. We only used one dimension of space and one of time because Visualizing our universes three of space and one of time would take us beyond the limits of what could be shown on paper or screens but math Can take us there General relativity allows us to calculate how much mass and energy Curved space-time and has been used to explain things that Newton's older theory of falling as the result of Forces couldn't like anomalies in the orbit of mercury which orbits nearest the Sun and is therefore most affected by the sun's grip on space-time many other experiments have confirmed general relativity's picture of the universe fitting the conclusion that There is no Gravity there's just Space-time its curvature and a us in it. As John Wheeler famously put it Space-time grips mass telling it how to move mass grips space-time telling it how to curve? Relative to the earth we don't move very fast even jet airplanes move negligibly close to the speed of light So relative to earth we move almost Exclusively through time as such we are more affected by the way time is curved by mass Than how space is curved? This has led many to claim that for the most part you feel as though you're being pushed into the ground Not because of a force called gravity But because time is moving faster for your head than for your feet down is Relative and always changing, but it exists because of and is always in the direction of slower time Bertrand Russell called this the law of cosmic laziness Everything is naturally steered towards where time is slowest we call this falling going down So you don't have to keep anything on the down-low time will take care of that for you and and as always Thanks for watching Remember that you can support Vsauce and Alzheimer's research by subscribing to the Vsauce curiosity box the current one comes with a code to get a free copy of universe sandbox 2 Which is amazing and a whole host of other science toys and tools picked by myself Jake and Kevin I love it all so I hope to see you at brain candy live. We are coming to many many cities very soon Hopefully one near you by going to the show you can see Adam And I doing things that will you may not have seen us do before we also explore the science and common misconceptions behind all things Err.

"xy-gKUUj3EU": "you are now watching a Lucky Penny shop product feature hey it's a Lucky Penny shop but I'm here with that other candy video I mentioned in the islor's video if you didn't see the islor's Twizzlers video please look in the description area I'll have a link there for you you can go check that out or next to that is alert was these sweet tarts ropes which is fine I've never had in my video and then I saw this one the new rainbow flavor I said well I can't try the rainbow flare without knowing what the other flavors are so I have cherry punch tangy strawberry and twisted rainbow punch now they are soft and chewy ropes colors from real sources there's a nice big cherry there's a nice big strawberry and there's a whole bunch of fruit so let's well you want to take a nice closer look at each bag here you go they're very flat the bags are flat and that is the first one that is the twisted rainbow punch enlarge to show full detail so they're not that big there is the back who try the strawberry one roll peoples not one rope 60 calories if you like these your love of these okay maybe I want you to try these I love those you love these and if they love these you'll love these so what happens if you love these what do you love after that you love the mini juice oh no I don't have them any choose so I can't help you there either way let's take them all out of the package Oh cool-looking there's three of those three cherry the smell is just wonderfully overwhelming three of those it's almost like a pinkish color you can try come on don't you automatically zoom out and zoom into me no no I know I'm trained to do that let's just take them all that let's quit messing around with onesie twosie then show awesome right that's pretty look how beautiful that is let's push messing around it's okay to mess around when you're eating wonderful looking candy like that just take them all up okay they're very pretty looking just all the wonderful colors basically getting ready for the thumbnail right the way the thumbnail is gonna look let's just leave it like that that's a nice colorful thumbnail and I'll string them up okay that's better alright so let's try of that cherry now there is a color on the inside which looks like it runs all the way through it does I almost made it to the end there's the inside okay that's the same problem but click it they're very soft like a soft gummy I like it wonderful flavor wonderful cherry flavor and it's delicious fruity flavor exactly it is sweet sweeter than say just like a piece of licorice cuz you got that where the Twizzlers cuz you got that extra sugar on the inside let us try another let's put all these together boy they're almost metallic looking with that on the inside aren't they look would you eat them I'm playing with all my food no one's gonna want one okay in the middle oh the flavor is really strong I like that I guess I don't have to eat a whole undo it mmm probably one of the sweeter candies I've had in a long time all right last but not least the beautiful rainbow colors so they're not rounded but sort of flat alright two sides alright last one here we go mm mm hmm I taste a green apple I really taste a green apple let me it neat all the different colors in there I can't isolate orange or isolate Balu but either way very tasty all right I'm done it was a quick video because I found him in the store I saw the new and it's the first time I've ever had sweet tarts ropes I was saying that they do taste like sweet tarts and sweet tarts are sweet so these are just a sweet of sweet tarts does that make any sense I think so I think the inside has almost like a similar powder to like a sweet tart that's been powdered it's soft it's not chewed mm-hmm yeah maybe that's it maybe that's what they were going for well was it success I think thanks for watching hope you enjoyed the video I will have more videos coming up and if you can it would help me out

all-you-can regular guys welcome back thank you so much for your support I just popped that 10,000 market oh my god think you could not have done any of that without your support guys I really really appreciate it it just means the world to me you like me you really really like me sorry just being an ass having some fun alright so today what I'm gonna do now that I showed you how to do canna candy sugar & Canas syrup we can now make our gummies without using butter and the Gerber is an emulsifier however if you want to make them super super strong absolutely go ahead and stuff the butter back in there but this gives you far more control over how strong or weak that you would like to make them now you guys are always asking me how much milligrams etc something is and I don't generally tend to answer that very often because it is all dependent upon what you make how you make it once you're starting THC is etc so what I've done is in the description there I've included a link for the calculator that I use it's a free signup it's a little course you're more than welcome to have a look take a look at it listen to her she's really interesting and lots of information but the calculator you can use for free and that's what I use so then you can go ahead and you can make your calculations and figure out how strong etc that you want to make your candies and with this it gives you a lots of versatility so you can go all can of sugar and syrup or half-and-half which is what I'm gonna do in the recipe so I will stop babbling on now and I'm gonna get into the ingredients of course and of course what we need and then we'll put all that stuff together and make some awesome gummies there we go alright guys all right so for our new gelatin for our new gummy version here you're gonna use one box of your paper flavored jello I three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin a half a cup of water for blooming your gelatin or what I use are these kool-aid waters so they're just flavored water so I now use these in place of water they're great because they add more flavour to it or you can kind of combine some flavors which is really cool to do so I use those things are nice they're lighter and sugar and said just adding more flavor now another thing you can do for adding flavor is juice crystals now I get these at the bulk bar and you can only get them during the summer time but I get these in all different flavors and I've got two tablespoons of those again enhancing the flavor that way if you don't want to use or have these flavors artificial flavors you can go use those which work great the other thing you're going to need is a quarter cup of your can of syrup and a quarter cup of water for our jello and then for our candy side our candy version so it's going to be like the other one where we do the cook you're going to need a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar or again you can use a full can of sorry a full cup of your can of sugar same thing with your syrup I'm using a quarter cup of canned syrup and a quarter cup of light corn syrup again you can go and use as much or as little of either of those as you like I like to do the half-and-half mainly for taste and not to kill people so that's my kind of my you I don't want anybody rendered completely useless and then we are going to need 1/2 a cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and then as well if you want to add additional colors or flavors you can add those optionally as well and as I said if you want to add your butter as well it really makes them super duper you can do that you're just going to follow exactly the same thing except the previous steps from the previous version with regards to adding the butter and the Goregaon to emulsify it now something else I wanted to say and the same thing now in this version I'm not using the clear gel however you can use the clear gel exactly the same way as you do in the previous recipe of the regular and sour gummy recipe that's a good one to follow it's the most up-to-date and gives you both those versions that you can use and that's all we need for our ingredients and now we'll get into our equipment and then we will get the best part go and we'll get all this stuff put together alright so the equipment that you're going to need just like the other recipes a double boiler I just do a makeshift I get a bowl that will make sure that your water does not touch the bottom of your bowl you will need a smaller saucepan for our candy syrup two spatulas you will need your candy thermometer and you will need a larger pot that your bought is that your saucepan small saucepan will fit into ice water water with ice in it but a little tongue-tied today and obviously your candy molds now a lot of you ask me how many candy is gum you will get out of a batch now it's all depending obviously on the size molds that you use if you use about this large size I got these from Michaels you will get about sixty if you use of this size gummy which is kind of a little bit larger than those big ones you're going to get it probably about 75 to 100 and if you use the little teeny tiny ones then you're going to get about 150 to 200 of them so that's approximately what that recipe will break down to you for you and now d'leh before we get started there is something very important that I found out from my other recipe when I started this is and I don't do this in the other recipes but when we're working with the can of sugar and the can of syrups it is a must that we oil down the sides and the insides of our pot for the candy syrup reason being when it heats up and starts boiling the oil THC oil starts to separate and it sticks to the smiths of the metal of the pot you might have noticed that if you did that with a can of syrup which is why I redid the video for that specific reason so we're going to do things a little bit differently than we do for the regular candy recipe but I'll show you all those details once we get into it but the very first thing and don't really don't want to forget is we're going to lightly grease our saucepan and hold on just couldn't dribble a little bit of oil into it and then make sure to work it all the way around make sure to get it right into the corners because anywhere that this oil is not where there's no oil your THC will sit the only thing that dissolves THC oil is oil because it is oil soluble by doing this we're going to be able to scrape anything that sticks to the sides off much much easier then seeing all your products that they're going oh what happened so you said you want to lightly grease that you don't want to have any excess oil so make sure to do that up as well as your spatulas you want to lightly oil your spatulas for the same reason when we scrape it off the sides if these are not oiled it sticks to it and it doesn't come off so you want to make sure anything that is going to be touching the THC the syrup you want to make sure that you all and that's it I'm gonna get into putting our ingredients together and get this started oh one other thing I wanted to cover is with your moles I don't spray my moles beforehand but I have found sometimes that they do stick but so what I do is I care them so I will spray them or oil them down lightly let it sit for 20 minutes in the mold and then wash them out so it still leaves that oily feel but it's not gonna leave your Piquet knees all greasy and makes it far easier for them to come as well as you only have to cure them once every few once every five or six batches or so so it lasts a long time by doing it that way all right so now I promise we'll get into the ingredients in our candy all righty so the very first thing that we are going to do is we are going to microwave our quarter cup of liquid for about 50 seconds till it's boiling and we're going to bloom our unflavored gelatin all right so you're going to evenly sprinkle your gelatin over the top of your liquid whether you use water or the kool-aid water and then you are going to stir it in now a lot of punches I explained in about whether that your gummies did not are not that they're too sticky but they're not gelatin enough that can depend a lot of power on your gelatin I just bought a batch of gelatin because I buy a bulb that didn't it wasn't blooming at the strength of it or something was not working well I did two batches and I had almost double the gelatin so a lot of it is dependent upon your gelatin now one test that I do is when I put in the three tablespoons and mix it in it should start very quickly to get the texture of apple sausage and clicking up pretty quickly now this is not so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add in another half a tablespoon of gelatin yes I've just sprinkled on another half a tablespoon and I'm gonna stir that in and now I'm getting that texture of applesauce can you kind of see what I mean that's how you know you're probably are at the great strength for your gelatin starting off if your gelatin is not right from the beginning if it's mushy I'll show you when we go to put this in but that's the texture it should be once you once we've got it mixed in now we're gonna set that aside for five minutes or so to let that bloom now meanwhile we will add our box of jell-o I'm giving the blueberries well berry blue and we are going to add in our boiling water and stir that around and get it dissolving see was it and then just keep scraping because the jello will cause the sides of the bowl are cool it's good to just kind of stick to it so just keep scraping the sides down as you go and turn your heat on to low so again we only want to melt our gelatin over a hot water bath we don't want it hot at boiling at all that's what breaks our gelatin a lot of the time is you don't even think that you've got it too hot but really past hot water probably by 150 degrees it is that's about all you need so that's that's a big mistake that a lot of people make myself included so I'm just going to continue to stir that gently until the gelatin is dissolved and then we will add in our corn syrup and our other stuff and once your gelatin and that has started to melt the sugar takes longer because the sugar melts at a higher at a bit of a higher heat so it just takes a little bit longer but once your gelatin and that is melted you can add in your corn syrup and your flavor crystals if you're wanting to add so you saw your canister your quarter cup of Kanna syrup and then your flavored juice crystals if you want to add those in as additional flavoring and again just stir that until it all starts gets incorporated and now for you guys asking for those clear gummies how do I get my gummies clear this well you can now you could have perfectly clear gummies so I'm gonna kick it continue to stir this and just gently mix it together until everything is melted and combined I'd you notice I got my nails done so for all of you those wishing that I get them done they're done and to those of you commented there you go I know I looked at the videos and thought make and those are ratty looking hands so I do apologize hopefully it'll be better from now on in the future I hope you like these a little bit better do you got a look at them for quite a long time so why not make them a little bit more attractive and also just remember to continually scrape down the sides of your bowl so that the gelatin is not sticking to the sides and just to show you this is just how hot your water should be there shouldn't be any boiling just a little bit of steam coming off of that that's as how that's as hard as you want to get it otherwise any hotter than that it's gonna break your gelatin alright so now that everything's pretty much dissolved I'm going to add in our gelatin now here's another thing if your gelatin is after 5 minutes or so blooming is mushy when you touch it then your gelatin is not strong enough so whether it's old and it's weakened or there are different gelatin with different strengths if it is nice and firm to the touch and no mushy you're good to go so I just split this up into pieces slap her in and you're just gonna let that you're just gonna gently again stir that until it completely melts and again if you start to see any kind of foaming may take it off your heat immediately it's getting too hot so I'm just gonna let them set them going to continue to stir that until my gelatin is fully melted well once your gelatin is melted and everything looks good and it is nice and translucent just set it off to the side and now we're going to start our candy syrup alright for our candy syrup in goes our half a cup of white sugar our half a cup of Candace Canon sugar our Candace syrup quarter cup a can of syrup like I said before you're more than welcome to play around with your different measurements on that as long as it equals 1/2 a cup either way it doesn't matter and our quarter cup of light corn syrup our half a cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to gently stir that till ever - your syrup till your sugar and water and everything's just combined and then once you're combined here turn your heat on to medium Cline to start and then we're going to drop it down to medium once it begins to boil and you're just going to continue stirring this make sure to get all around the edges because the sugar likes to sit there and so we're going to continue to stir this until it starts to boil now all of my and all the other candy recipes I say as soon as we start boiling we're gonna stop stirring and use our brush not in this recipe and I'll show you once it starts boiling as I said the oils yeah I got a little syrup on the burner there so the oils start to separate out with the heat and until it gets all to the same kind of temperature it will they will stick to the side so we're going to have to continually work the sides of the pot but you're going to want to be very very gentle because we don't want to spit dirt into the syrup so as I said I'll show that all to you once it gets there now you'll start to notice as as it's starting to heat up if you scrape the sides of your pot see all that that's your oil and that's what we want to make sure it gets back into our syrup so I usually have to use the two you want as I said you have to grease both spatulas here and work it off get it back into the syrup and we're gonna have to do this continuously through the whole cooking process so at anytime that you see any darkness starting to form on the side make sure to scrape it down and as your syrup gets hotter you can just put your spatula in it'll just melt it off and also make sure when you are scraping the sides of your pot hold on to the handle firmly I've done it before I wasn't paying attention and whoops and the last thing you want is molten lava being poured anywhere other keeping it in the pot so when your syrup begins to bubble starts boiling you're gonna touch your candy thermometer and remember this is normally where I say we stop stirring not this time so we're not actually going to stir it what we're gonna do is just to continually scrape around the sides of the pot but don't go deep into the syrup we just want to stay around the bubble area and you just want to keep pulling this in so this is the alcohol of the excess alcohol and stuff burning off and any impurities that are in it so see how it's gathering up on the sides that's what we want to make sure get them back into our syrup whatever is supposed to cook off will cook off whatever is good will stay in so again just gently don't go into the stirs syrup just gently keep going around the sides and you'll do behind the candy thermometer towards the end and we are going to cook our syrup - if you want a soft candy you're gonna cook it to 260 if you want a firm candy you can go as high as 280 280 is soft crack I'm gonna go to just before that I'm going to take this to 275 but you see what I mean about the oils how they just continue they'll keep going to the sides of the pot as it heats up and gets up to temperature it will it will the oils will get incorporated and once your syrup is boiling in that you want to just turn your heat down to medium just medium a little above medium I said then don't forget to get behind in behind the thermometer because it will hide in behind there I love the smell of this syrup cooking it's oh it smells so awesome oh and just as a tip for safety always have a fan either an overhead fan I've got one going or the if you've got an overhead on your stove regardless when you're ever working with tinctures even though you've working them in a dehydrated yeah most of it's cooked off some of them may not be and you just want on the safety side always have a fan going and leave don't be sparking anything up in the in the general area so you've had your gelatin sitting over on the side and you have a look and you've noticed that there's all this white inky foam stuff and you're sure positive that you didn't do it high on high heat the heat didn't get too hot that'll happen so nice if the gelatin is old and it's starting to break down so if you do see that in order to compensate for that bloom another tablespoon of unflavored gelatin and we're going to add it into the candy mixture at the end that's gonna help us compensate for the gelatin that's broken in our mixture here so that will help it so anytime that your candies come out super sticky and you can't get them out of the mold the reason is is because the gelatin is not gelling properly so there's a really handy tip there for you guys now in order to get that out because I don't want that in to go my syrup I'm gonna run this through a strainer before we put it into our syrup so now I might actually my syrup while I was babbling away there is getting close to temperature I've got my ice water ready to go and as soon as it hits temperature I'm gonna drop the bottom into the pot and once the temperature starts coming down and the cooking process is stopped I'm gonna set it to the side until the temperature comes down to 240 before we add our gelatin in just watch your thermometer till until the temperature starts coming down and your bubbles start stop bubbling and then just set it to the side and said until your temperature comes down to 240 all right so now my syrup is cooled and then it's say because I don't want that white foamy stuff into my syrup I'm going to use a strainer to pour it through that way it'll catch all the chunks of jell-o gelatin and being bad and I'm going to mix that in now I also what I did was I bloomed another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid and we're going to add that in a little bit in a little bit so right now you're going to stir your jello and your candy syrup until it is all combined and if you find that your syrup is a little too sticky and it's solidified you can put your heat on to minimum you just want to heat the bottom to get the syrup off the bottom now you can make sure that you do so that you scrape the sides and if you said if you find that it's too hard coming off turn your heat on and it'll eventually start to melt so you just want to want to keep doing that until everything is completely melted in all the same temperature all right so now that everything is all melted together and nicely mixed now this is a test that I do to determine whether my syrup is did a job correctly if I pull it up and you see how it just goes in a nice smooth syrup it doesn't really seem to start gelling or anything it stays in a fine line so that's kind of telling me that this is gonna turn out way too sticky it's gonna come out what's it like you can't get it out of the mold it's more candy than the gelatin that's what I said about my gelatin breaking there that I knew that was gonna happen so I've added it I'm gonna add in the additional gelatin that I bloomed and I'm just gonna stir that until it's completely dissolved so now if you want your syrup just translucent that nice clear there you go you've got it you can go ahead and put it into your bottles your squirt bottles or use the little eye droppers for dispensing into your molds but however I never like to keep things plain so I'm gonna do half-and-half or I've got translucent and solid and also just to give you a look to see how to go about doing that all right so now when after adding the additional gelatin in now when I do my test you'll see it's thicker and it'll start to split up and almost solidify in midair so that's how you know it's likely going to set correctly I still had to not do things correctly that's occasionally but that is a very good indication that you're safe and good to go so if you wanted translucent go ahead and put it into your bottles at this point or use your eye dropper dispensers or whatever it is that you get it into your moles however I of course need to always get fancy so I'm gonna split this into two colors so I've got half of it translucent and half of it of the solid blue whoops all right so I'm just gonna eyeball this here if you want to be exact you can pour it into a measuring cup and split it exactly however I've been doing this from this pot for quite a while so I'm pretty good at it sometimes so because I mix the blue with the green because obviously the green from our can of syrup and our sugar so it's turned out a little bit greenish and I actually want this to be blue so I'm going to add in a little bit of blue color and then on 1/2 I'm going to add in white so this one I'm mixing in a few drops of blue you can use any kind of food coloring the gel base oil-based water base for this for this particular candy recipe does not matter so we're just gonna get that stirred in oh that's a pretty color you see it on the white that's nice that's a nice kind of teal color then in my other half I'm gonna pour in some of the blue the same kind of teal but this is gonna give me the solid background as the white now if you guys have white on hand make sure that you shake it really really well if it's hot it sitting for a while it does separate and you will find that if you pour it in you're gonna get a little tiny white it doesn't go well you get little white lumps or something like that it just doesn't blend really nicely so make sure to shake it really really well you can almost hear it come back together it's like you can almost hear the water at the top and then all kind of comes together and sounds a little bit thicker so I'm gonna pour a little bit of that in isn't that pretty so again you're just gonna thoroughly mix that in until it is one complete uniform color and once I've got that i'll get it into my bottles and we'll get this into the mold there's a little trick i learned the other day find it by Occident that's on most things happen so I'm if you want to have a half and half candy where you've got the clear on the bottom and the solid on the top what you can do to easily make that happen is use your hand blender on this we whip a bunch of air into it and once you put them together the air is all I'm automatically gonna bring the solid color up to the top or if you want to do that with the if you want it the other way around then air Rach you're clear but you're gonna have to wait a while for the bubbles to come out because that's gonna make it not so clear so I recommend just putting the solid on the back you can do that it's just a quick way of doing it otherwise you have to pour one layer let it set a little bit and then pour your second layer well aren't I just a cesspool of useless information today I'm just gonna pour this into my squirt bottle this should make a full almost a full bottle or a little bit more see bang almost right on now if you guys have to haven't seen these before these are the best squirt bottles ever they just make putting it into the mould so much easier especially if you want to blend colors absolutely highly recommend these I've got there's a link for them in the description there for you to make it easy if you'd like to order them and I'm just gonna do my clear and we'll get this going all right so I said I always do two colors I always like doing that so I did combination I'll either just whoosh or if you want to happen half you can do it that way you can go this way freestyle whatever you like and that's it get them all into your mold and you're gonna put them in the fridge for a minimum of two to four hours sometimes they've got to go overnight now if you let them go overnight and they're still sticking you can't get them out of the mold put them into the freezer for a few hours let them freeze up take one mold out of it I'd add out at a time and pop them out as quickly as possible if they still if there's still stop the first you'll come out if it starts to stick throw it back in the freezer work on another mold put them into a double boiler melt them down on low heat and add another tablespoon of gelatin melt it and recast them and that will fix that problem for you and that's it enough I'll come back low will pop these out so you can have a look at them and I'll show you how to sugarcoat them not that sugarcoating is that difficult but you can coat them with the can of sugar and just show you an easy way of doing it and that'll be it will say goodbye candies upset and you can do this in a bowl or I found that doing them in a large plastic bag worked a lot easier so in this I put a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar and I put a quarter part about a quarter cup of the flavored drink crystals that I used in my recipe again the drink crystals are totally optional for you just adds that little bit extra flavor and then I added about a half a teaspoon of citric acid because I wanted these to be a little bit more on this our side if you just want to have just a little bit of a tick bite but not really sour at all I add a quarter teaspoon so I'll do those two my sweet ones and then to the sour I use a 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid I don't recommend using much more than that one it's not going to the sour flavor isn't that great and it can also melt your candies because citric acid acid is water soluble so simple enough you can actually see it oh and I also have sorry a wire a wire rack with parts line o parchment paper line line on top of it for them to dry so I just pop them out these guys are popping out nicely and I get and what I do is I do one mold at a time so I leave the rest of them in the fridge because otherwise they start to warm up and they can makes it difficult sometimes for them to come out of the mall so I just think about one at a time and once I get them on the bag I go a little bit there and I just fish them out and shake off the excess sugar and we just lay them out to dry here just like all our other candies this is just a slightly smaller mold that I use same thing now see sometimes you'll do that and you'll see you think oh no they're not gonna come out they're stuck just pull the edges away and then they just they'll just come right out now if you do that and it doesn't come out that's when you would put them into the freezer so again you see that just around the edges to pull it away and they're good to go and that's about it I'm just gonna go through and sugarcoat the rest of these guys and then I'll be back to say goodbye well guys that's my little demo there on your cannon Candace Eric and sugar gummy bears I hope you enjoyed the demo as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to ask and thank you guys so much again for your support and let's get to the 50,000 whoo all right so you have an awesome rest of your day and thanks again for watching [Music]", "dlu_R9NZf4Y": "time for more DIY bedroom decor this time we'll be making something big a hanging chair before we start don't forget to Like subscribe and hit that little notification bousley know when we upload a new video and after we're done here don't forget to watch our other room decor videos we made a light box some cute like bolo feathers and a paper garland and in the next couple of weeks I'll be doing a room tour think of the things you will be needing for your hanging chair two yards of fabric it's like this really cool pattern a metal clip you can get these at the hardware store this holds about 200 pounds 200 pounds that's like two of me 16 feet of room and they wouldn't dowel this was huge we're gonna cut it down to about three feet the first thing that we're going to do is do our holes in a wooden dowel we're just going to mark it at the two inch and the four inch that's where we're going to drill our holes cameraman I'm gonna actually have you do this part let's switch spots [Music] as you can see we drilled holes on both sides of the end of the dowel Thank You cameraman alright so now what we're going to do is fold the fabric in half just like this and the folded part is on my right hand side I'm going to measure from the left seven inches just ignore my brothers Legos nor it right about there now we're going to angle our cut down all the way to the bottom of the fabric yeah that corner right there there we go [Music] now it's time to sew sew the top of the fabric in the sides that I was sitting on we're just going to fold it about like in half an inch and then sew all the way across [Music] now we're going to do the exact same thing to the other side see you guys now won't fray alright guys we got two sides done now we gotta do two more this one's a little different it's going to be one and a half inches thick it's thicker because we're going to slip the Rope through it think of your leg you're going into your pants [Music] [Applause] now let's put it together guys so on one end of your rope you're going to tie it knot and then on your other side of the rope you're going to poke it through the outer hole facing down now you're going to grab your fabric and get the fat part that we sewed go to the bottom and feed your rope through it to the top so this is what it should look like at this point now we're going to tie knot about three feet away from the first knot now that the knot is in place we're going to feed our now batter now that our knives in place we're going to feeds our rope up through the second hole so this is what it looks like so far now we're going to take our rope and feed it down through the second hole on the other side of the dowel now we're going to tie a knot three feet away from the end of the rope now we're going to feed this end of the rope down through the other side now we're going to take the end of our rope and poke it through up through the first hole just like that and then tie a little knot right here this is what it should look like I have a little pocket right here for you to sit up it's like a little hammock I found the center of our rope above the dowel I'm going to tie a knot at 10 inches [Music] now we're going to a Conor with a metal clip and now all we have to do is hang it in my room let's go [Music] let's put some pillows in it put this one here the seat on [Music] just like tada oh my gosh guys it's so cute I'm so happy this looks awesome it's fuzzy [Music] baby [Music] ever sees lives outside sighs crow [Music] is gone we do [Music] hi guys I better in this video before I fall asleep for real this

our vip network that we're going live right now so hang out to the end of this video and i will give the phone number my phone number for you to jump on in and text we can become text buddies chat buddies today we're talking about body parts splits what is the most effective body part split for now for you and that's an important part of the equation here there's a bunch of different body parts splits and let me break them down briefly for you we have the push pull leg system upper body push day one upper body pull day two and then lower body day three we repeat that we have the full body every other day upper body and lower body push pull everything's trained every other day typically monday wednesday friday we have the push pull split the push-pull split would be all pushing muscles on monday and thursday all pulling muscles on tuesday and friday and then we have what is known as the bro split the bro split's very popular in bodybuilding circles and this is essentially training chest on monday shoulders on tuesday back on wednesday arms on thursday legs on friday and touch-up body parts maybe calves and forms and abs on saturday something along those lines there's a lot of different bro splits out there now what this conversation will be and i'm going to answer your questions here so feel free to throw questions into the comments it's great to see everybody hello hello hello rebecca's in the house what's up mike zach hello hello um so ask questions i'll answer those clean that stuff up at the end of this video now what program is best for you that's the question should you hit a push pull legs a push pull full body split a bro split now most of you don't follow i don't want to say most of you but a lot of you don't follow a strategic training program you simply go to the gym and you simply work out and i know that because i have a thousand conversations per year with you guys during my one-on-one consultations and that's an honor and a pleasure to do so but during that people like well you know i try and train at this time of day and maybe i get 20 minutes maybe i get an hour maybe i go to the gym maybe i i i walk in the lake or around the lake near my job or something and hey i commend that i commend anyone who's getting that 30 minutes of consistent exercise in per day but eventually we have to level up and this conversation is for those of you who need to level up you've gone through that that novice level just touched my tip my toe in the water i'm going to start exercising moving my body and and whatnot now it is time to level up so this conversation what is the best body part split for you and let's let's look at this differently the best body part split for you is the one that you can recover from because if you can't recover from your body part split well it doesn't matter what you do anyway you're not going to be making gains right the whole point of training is tearing your muscles down so then we go home when we go home we eat we sleep we actually make our gains at home now i was watching vigorous steve's channel recently he's got great videos and everyone check out vigorous steve if you haven't yet kind of dabbles a little bit more on the ergogenic side peds and such previously but lots of great science that comes out of steve so i enjoy his stuff um and he was talking about very similarly which motivated this video all due credit motivated this conversation you know we speak mostly here about either the push-pull leg system or the full-body system and the way steve phrased this matches our own philosophy but he said it in a manner that i might not have said it to you when we're following a push-pull leg system this is brutal it is rough we're probably hitting four exercises per workout performing anywhere between two to four sets per exercise we could be hitting 16 sets of relatively high intensity on a push pull leg system steve makes a great point that you have to be in a caloric surplus to truly maximize the effects of a push pull legs especially if you run it concurrently like i do i'll run push pull legs push pull legs push pull legs until i'm shot and then i'll take a d load day or two and usually i'll throw that in before and after a leg day so push pull legs one push pull legs two push pull off legs off push pull and i'll get back into the cycle again i've found that to be very effective for my physique and my style of training and also my caloric intake my ability to rest i probably have a better nutrition plan than most people and i probably have a better rest and stress management program than most people simply because i focus on it and i'm intentional with my hours of sleep i'm intentional with the type of stress management protocols i build into my lifestyle now when we're following a push pull leg system you can recomp your body for sure that's what i love about it i love push-pull legs for guys and girls equally to build lean healthy functional muscle tissue and also to keep body fat at bay we will drop in low intensity steady state cardiovascular activity during a push pull leg system we'll put it earlier in the day of course in order to maximize our fat loss body recomposition benefits while allowing us to be closer to a three to five hundred calorie caloric surplus throughout the average day now let's jump away from that and let's say hey i don't have as much recovery ability i'm super crazy at work i'm super crazy at home my diet's getting better but it's not amazing yet and i'm still trying to figure out this whole sleep thing in that i would say you are best served by following a full body every other day probably monday wednesday friday now long time um community members of this channel and who follow what we speak about here you've heard me speak again push pull legs and the full body as my two favorite systems we might do a little straight up push pull if we're hitting a four by five but that's different that's that's a different training effect altogether in general push pull legs every day concurrently maybe six days a week or we'll hit full body every other day monday wednesday friday why is that because the full body is simply one exercise per movement let's say it's an overhead military press it's a bent over pendlay row it's a zercher good morning it's a high box unilateral bulgarian split squat and maybe a russian twist bang done the next workout maybe that is a hanging underhand weighted chin followed by a medium grip to close grip floor press followed by a unilateral deficit kettlebell deadlift something i like very much um with a a uh knee lift at the top and then a maybe it's a uh a transformer bar squat um and then some sort of maybe like a high cable um chop for the core right bang that is a system i pulled directly from our playbook right there two specific exercises but it's day one full body day two off day two off should be some sort of active recovery maybe you sit in the hot tub you take a hot bath you go to the bond you're in a sauna a cold plunge you get a massage you foam roll you put in a little bit of a a yoga pilates dvd kind of stretch thing um maybe you go for a walk you play some soccer in the backyard with the kids you you do a little gardening you clean some stuff up that would be ideal so higher intensity training full recovery active recovery low caloric expenditure recovery next day this is for people who don't have the ability to recover as well as maybe some others who are training more intensely now hopefully this makes sense so what's the best program for you well the best program for you as the old saying goes is the one you're not currently doing i love that one find what works best for you understand what your current goals are what or is your current caloric intake do you need to modify that how much stress do you carry in your life what does your sleep schedule look like are you going to bed with the sunset and awakening with the sunrise life should pretty much be that way can you sleep like a baby without a thought of of what is going on in your day no stress no anxiety no worry that's ideal not possible for everyone but that's ideal this has an impact on your ability to recover from training so knowing this allows us to better select the style of training now when we talk about bro splits bro splits are primarily for enhanced lifters or enhanced athletes bro splits are best used by individuals taking performance enhancing drugs i don't speak to that because the programs we discuss here on this channel work equally well and possibly even better for enhanced individuals like a push-pull split or a push-pull legs for an enhanced individual is going to freaking make incredible gains even in a caloric deficit i would say better than a bro split so and there's good data to support that but most of you guys and gals here you're you're not enhanced maybe you've dabbled a little bit you're you're not running a cycle right now and you're looking for more sustainable long-term natural body composition training programs nutrition systems but also to enhance your athleticism unleash unleash your full athletic potential while living a very long life this is primarily the information we discuss here so i hope that helps let me answer some questions here for you guys lots of questions here and guys feel free to click the links below we got a bunch of links down there this weekend we have our next certification and fitness conference the ddc become a dolce diet certified coach check that

the house what's up rebecca good to see you uh we have john johnson fd dolce love my push-pull legs highly effective for me and my schedule me too evan iron evans in the house brother what's up my man paul chalk what's up man good to see you sam don't know what that means cole what are your thoughts on high volume burpees with multiple push-ups that total out 500 to a thousand push-ups i think that's gangster i think that can you do that i think that's gangster that you'll never hear me say don't do that expressing our full athleticism is the goal now you might not be able to do that every day of your life you might have to train for that achieve that then transition to something a little bit different that's great too sam says you say the difference between a dream and a vision you say that there is a difference well a dream or a vision i don't know that i've had this conversation i say a dream and a goal like a dream is something you think about you don't do anything about that's a dream a goal is something you think about you create a plan of action that you actually follow through that's that's the difference joe i don't like doing barbell overhead press which dumbbell press is the best alternative standing arnold press do them all have fun find which one better suits you find which one you can perform safely five which one challenges you find which one you can add weight progressively progressive overload is important bench at arm day every day right reps and sets can you please map out a week's workout plan outlining them same reps sets each workout day typically we train through set and rep phases what i like to do is i like to calibrate or total up the total tonnage moved that day that gives me a good idea of what we're actually performing now i'm looking primarily this is a good rule of thumb to perform approximately 25 repetitions per exercise that can be four sets of six that can be three sets of eight that can be two sets of 12 that can be one set of 25. that's a good way to help program your sets and reps so if we're trading you could even do a 6x4 or an 8x3 if we're really focused on bar speed and velocity i wouldn't skew that heavy you know 90 plus percent of 1rm for most of the trainees out there most of you guys it just certainly doesn't make sense um oh mike the uncle my captain legit 51 need a program for weight loss i'm loose in the

julie thank the masks vision visors batters etc are a joke i agree that's we don't want to expose our children to that at this age and stage of life children don't need to be aware of this in our opinion it does them no good at that young stage this single digit stage of life it does them no good sam mike i'm struggling where to put my efforts i'm overwhelmed with nutrition training

being a weirdo creep maybe even report you sending the feds to your house um what else we got brian brian henley there he is my man brian henley crushing it by the way crushing life happy birthday to brian henley bbv you know like like i know you've worked in the sports industry for one of the major manufacturers but you should be like on the the cover like on the door like like stiff forming like the heisman trophy super ripped up ladies and gentlemen brian henley has been crushing his goals family man hard-working dude and has has every excuse probably to not be in amazing shape makes no excuses and walks around in amazing shape so i appreciate you man i hope you saw the two time three weeks photos 37 i didn't see those photos i didn't see those photos man so send them to me again brother i'd love to see um paul a few questions regarding our ig live last week which thanks for taking the time talking with me and no um next week's our one-on-one hell yeah shift workers your opinion on push pull on one day legs on one day twice per week um with less yeah that works for sure for sure shift workers you know i might go more i do like the full body i like the full body slightly more frequently than just the push pull less frequently that's me personally you're you're training much more athletically unless you're really looking more for the bodybuilder kind of mojo but i don't think you are paul ah brian so kind of you brian henley with the 499 super chat donation very kind of you my friend um brad francis what's up red good to see you supplements your opinion on magnesium 25 to 500 migs post workout i'm not mad at that i like a zma product the one that i actually like is made by true athlete sold through the vitamin shop there is a zma product that's taken at bedtime um that has thinning in that which kind of helps a little bit with sleep um so i would consider that um but you know do you do i'm not mad at it for sure i do like getting blood work though paul says supplements uh answered that sonia why isn't there pork on three weeks to shred it or living lean programs primarily because of the high fat content of pork it's very hard to have lean pork and as a result it kicks up sorry about that and moving this table around i actually got my stand up desk right now can you tell i can actually stand here and and hang out and talk though this is a it's going to be an issue it's going to be a problem i am sweating though right now like i started earlier today this thing was like super high because it was like chilly in here now i'm just like i'm sweating i've got my like i'm not gonna lift my arms because you're gonna see the rings for sure but to answer your question because of the high fat content of pork and also because pork is a dirtier meat not that all pork is if you can get like wild hog maybe i would put that in um but in general i just don't like the nutrient profile of pork as compared to some like wild caught salmon which is much more um prominent in the three weeks of shredded plant top exercises for hamstring well any sort of hinge motion is great so we do a lot of hinge work over here unilateral you heard me say the unilateral deficit kettlebell deadlift um we had mentioned um sorry about that i'm getting some pop-ups running through here but that works extremely well but also you want to get some sort of curl i have a gymnastics um tumbling block is that what it is that we use for gymnastics teaching toddlers how to tumble and such it's great to lay on it's kind of like starts in a square unfold so it's a 45 degree angle we'll lay on there we'll put a dumbbell um in our feet kind of cluster the dumbbell laying on our stomach holding the top of the block we'll hit leg curls that way we'll also attach bands to maybe the power rack let's say in the back of our our ankles so curl and hinge is going to work those hammies paul lastly do you have a link to the ig live from last week to reference i don't know i'm sorry paul i don't man when i do this stuff i just run through it truly i just run through it um i don't know i don't even remember which which one that was i talked so much unfortunately um cool i've been following a few of iron wolf's burpee routines and been increasing my reps each day today i got up to 660 push-ups wow by completing 110 six pump burpees my goal that's crazy cole good for you um mike sev could you give me a rough outline of a push-pull legs program i can start tomorrow i'm going for the games one mike did you hear me i actually just broke one down so overhead military press right vertical push bent over barbell penguin row horizontal pull um push pull hinge i like a zercher good morning as a hinge movement and maybe we'll do a a goblet squat as your squatting motion and then finishing with a russian twist the next workout i would alternate and we would run an a b system would be underhand weighted chin-ups for a horizontal pull now vertical or horizontal push we would look towards a sorry sorry sorry um a medium to close grip floor press which i one of my favorite power exercises right there by the way um hinge work single leg or unilateral kettlebell deficit deadlift works extremely well and then a walking lunge or a high box step up and a cable or banded um wood chop high to low mmg dude been following been watching for a while thanks for the info would you be able to outline the most nutritious nutritionally dense foods in terms of minerals and vitamins covet has affected me in every way but would pay we can certainly do that but i mean what might be easier for you we have a cookbook the living lean cookbook volume 2 was on the itunes top 10 best seller list for 37 consecutive months that's all because word of mouth and people

no not really um mg if you want to do time stamps for videos man let's do do one on this one if you don't mind i'll give you a free t-shirt to start and let's see how good you are you know let's kind of go from there i'm open to it man everybody gets paid around here um so bam slap up the time stand see what happens let's go and just throw them into your in the comments section and uh i'll reach out to you and we'll we'll get you a t-shirt we'll go from there i appreciate that thank you um you got it just appreciate you appreciate you co-stash says f the youtube algorithm it's not fair that you have so little views i know i appreciate but what are we going to do i'm not going to complain about it i'm going to keep my head down i'm going to keep creating great content and then i just ask you guys if you appreciate the content give us a thumbs up click that subscribe button if you haven't yet click the notifications share this video maybe or not if it makes sense for you engage in the comments i mean leave a comment for the algorithm the more information the more you engage with us the more youtube will probably start to promote us again um it's unfortunate that they did that but we got swept up in their filter and i i don't know anyone who puts out better information than we do you want to talk about honest evidence-based experienced actionable information that's all i mean look at this this is you know who who has a resume like this all right that throws out free content almost every single day um it's crazy by the way ufc fit is kicking my butt and i'm loving it 14 days and counting goals to run through it without missing a day while using living lean for the food hell yeah sonia that is awesome down 2.6 pounds in two days that is what's up good for you new hoodies coming soon brian this was a prototype hoodie this is actually a for weight cutting it's it's kind of the way it's lined uh made in the lululemon factory by the way super dope but we never went mass market simply because it would be really a niche product it didn't make sense do you like the periodization model which periodization model there's a lot of different periodization models um linear periodization works very well in the beginning and then you look at maybe like undulating periodization that louis simmons made popular those the two that i would lean towards um as being ideal

been joining us for the last couple of weeks you'll know we're in the book of romans and today we're in chapter seven and i don't know about you but i've been so blessed going through romans here on sunday mornings as well as in our small group and even in our youth ministry with our youth and doing it as our daily devotions as well there's just so much in the book of romans and today is no exception because romans 7 is jam-packed and so we're going to dive right into it paul in this chapter is focusing once again on the law and how it has impacted us both before conversion and after conversion after before we're saved and after we're saved and as we walk through our passage we're going to do so trying to answer three questions that paul i think answers for us the first question is what can't the law do the second is what can the law do and third what does the law lead us to then go and do and so we're going to be walking through those three questions as we go through chapter seven we are going to be reading right now though uh verses one to six and we'll end up going through the rest of the chapter as well uh afterwards during the during this morning and so romans chapter seven verse one to six if you have your bibles please follow along or you can follow along on the screen romans chapter 7 verse 1 or do you not know brothers for i am speaking to those who know the law that the law is binding on a person only as long as he lives for a married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives but if her husband dies she is released from the law of marriage accordingly she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive but if her husband dies she is free from that law and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress likewise my brothers you also have died to the law through the body of christ so that you may belong to another to him who has been raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for god for while we were living in the flesh our sinful passions aroused by the law we're at work in our members to bear fruit for death but now we are released from the law having died to that which held us captive so that we serve in the new way of the spirit and not in the old way of the written code this is god's word so we're going to jump right in first question that paul answers for us what can't the law do and this is something that he's already established up to this point in romans but he does it here through the use of this analogy of marriage and here he's saying that in the same way that the the law of marriage is only binding on a wife as so long as her husband is alive in the same way we are called to consider ourselves dead to the law dying we have died to the law through the body of christ now we belong to christ who has been raised from the dead his point here is we should not see ourselves married to the law as we once did but now married to christ and just as a refresher what he means by that is he's been speaking to people who have been trying to in their past in their history earn god's favor by keeping the law perfectly right and he's saying throughout romans that that's that's insufficient that's not going to save us because we could never fulfill god's law perfectly instead what we need now what god has made possible for us he has given us the gift of grace he himself has taken our place he has taken our punishment our shame and he has done it through jesus dying on the cross for our sins that is what saves us that is what gives us a reconciled relationship with god our heavenly father and so he's calling us here in these verses he's just reminding us that we have died to the law to that old way of thinking that we could save ourselves by being perfect in our behavior because that's futile that would never work now we consider ourselves married to christ our bridegroom it's through him that we have salvation alone and he's done this throughout romans already up to this point and um again the point is no matter how hard we try to fill god's law perfectly we will never be able to and so consider ourselves dead to that way of thinking and now alive to christ and not only is it true that the law can't save us it gets worse actually sin actually used the law to increase and produce death in us so verse 5 he says for while we were living in the flesh or before god saved us our sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our members to bear fruit for death paul's saying here the law actually made our sin worse it couldn't save us and even when we tried to fulfill it perfectly all it did was give sin a chance to increase within us it was provoked sin was provoked by the law to produce spiritual death and paul will go on later and we're going to read it to explain exactly how that happens but here he's simply reiterating the point he's trying to remind us that the law cannot save us and that we are released or we should be released from that old way of thinking we're set free from the law having dive or six to that which held us captive so that we serve in the new way of the spirit and not in the old way of written code and really the point here is only when we die to the law are we actually able to fulfill the heart of the law right paul's reminding us that like he's set up to this point we must no longer live in dependence upon fulfilling the law perfectly upon our own ability to do that instead we put now our faith in christ who promises to empower us through the holy spirit to live this new life for him it's a freeing news it's a freeing gospel but then paul anticipates an argument that might be coming up because of this and he says it in verse seven right he he he can already anticipate other people who used to live by the law or who maybe are the jewish leaders um or who grew up with the jewish traditions they might be saying what then shall we say the law of sin in other words paul if what you're saying is true then the law is bad isn't it it can't save us in fact all it did was stir up sin within us and paul responds with an emphatic by no means right no of course not and it goes on to explain why that's untrue and why the law is actually incredibly helpful and necessary and good and holy and righteous and also serves a critical purpose both before and after our salvation and he answers the question what can the law do right he's just answered what can't the law do and i know we went through that quickly because he's already established that throughout this point up to this point in romans but now he's he he answers the question of what can the law do and he provides us with two answers and the first is that the law can make us aware of sin's presence prior to conversion verse 7 what then shall we say the law of sin by no means yet if it had not been for the law i would not have known sin for i would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said you shall not covet the first thing the law was meant to do was make us aware of sin's presence because the law is a direct reflection of god's character right his holiness his righteousness without it we wouldn't even know what it would mean to sin against him we wouldn't know who he is and what he would be displeased with so the law and his commandments like the tenth commandment here he uses as an example you shall not covet it made us aware of sin's presence by simply revealing what god's holiness required of us or in other words you don't really know you're breaking a rule unless there's a rule to be broken right and in the same way the law and god giving us the law made us aware that the ways that we wanted to live were actually transgressing his standard his character and this is what the law does it makes us aware of sin because it helps us define what sin is but then paul expands with something interesting and he says in verse 8 to 9 but sin seizing an opportunity through the commandment produced in me all kinds of covetousness for apart from the law sin lies dead i was once alive apart from the law but when the commandment came sin came alive and i died and what paul is saying here is that without the law we wouldn't know what it means to sin and in that sense sin lies dead before the law and the word dead here means dormant it doesn't mean that it's completely not present it's there it's just not awakened yet and when the law came it provided an opportunity for sin to produce within us the very desire to break that very law and as a result paul says verse 10 the very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me for sin seizing an opportunity through the commandment deceived me and through it killed me or in other words the law makes us aware of sin because it reveals our desires to break it right it reveals sin or the presence of sin because it defines it for us and now we know what it is but it also makes us aware of sin because it shows us that deep down we want to break that law we want to transgress it and to understand this concept i think in our own lives all we need to think about is children or adults for that matter being told not to do something right when someone tells you you're not allowed to do something right what does it immediately make you want to do that exact thing that you were just told not to do right case in point i don't have a sweet tooth at all and so sometimes my wife even will come home and i won't even know that she's bought candy from the grocery store or whatnot until i see it and i i won't really touch it because that's not really what i've cravings for but if she tells me even jokingly that i'm not allowed to eat them then it suddenly becomes a little bit more appealing and i'm saying why can't i eat them i want to eat them now even though i have no desire to eat them if i know pleasure in eating them the fact that she's told me i can't do it incites something within me it provokes something within me and i kind of want to do it now i want to just reach out and take that candy and eat it um just to know that i can do it that i can transgress that law or with my daughter ellie sometimes i'll refrain from reiterating certain rules around the house to her because i know that it will just make her want to break those rules immediately right i'll be watching her and maybe i have to step away for a second i'll tell her ellie don't climb the couch or whatever it might be and if i come back 30 seconds later she'll be free falling from the couch to her death and to her doom unless i come in and save her right and so i know and in her life in my life i think maybe in our lives that general principle that once we're told not to do something it it it does something it reveals to us that we actually want to secretly break that rule rules actually reveal our inner desires to break them and that's not true of every rule but when it comes to god's law when god's law has been given to us it reveals our true depravity our wretchedness it reveals that actually deep down what we really want is to disobey god what we want really deep down is to transgress him and his law because we want our own independence we want to be god we don't want god lording over us we don't want to have to keep his commandments or his law and so paul's making the point here when the law came not only did it make us aware of sin it made us aware of our own personal sin and the sin deep down that we don't want to listen to god we want to be lords and masters of our own lives and paul's point again in response to the argument he's anticipating is that the law itself is not bad even though it produces that kind of reaction from us right verse 12 and 13 the law he calls is he calls it is holy the commandment is holy and righteous and good the law is not the problem it was sin producing death in me through what is good in order that sin might be shown to be sin and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure problems not the law but the law reveals the problem and the problem is us more specifically the problem is sin that dwells within us or as paul says a few chapters back in romans 3 verse 20 for by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight since through the law comes knowledge of sin right the law can't justify us before god can't save us but it does reveal sin and the power of sin in our lives and in doing so it points us to the only way that we can be saved which is through faith in christ so what can the law do first it can point us to sin's presence before conversion before we're saved it reveals to us man i'm i'm deep down a pretty bad person and i have this natural tendency because of sin to want to rebel against god but secondly the law also makes us aware of sins persistence even after conversion even after we're saved now it's important to point out quickly that the verses that we're about to go into verses 14 to 23 are incredibly debated they're probably the most debated of all of romans maybe or even all of paul's epistles and the core issue of the debate is whether these verses we're about to read refer to paul's experience before or after conversion right today i'm going to be assuming the position the position of the ladder and there's good reason for that we don't have enough time to go through all the reasons why some people believe it's one or the other but at the heart of it these verses to me and to all those who fall in the second camp don't seem like the genuine cry of an unregenerate person before they're saved right a non-christian doesn't cry out wretched man that i am a person who is unsaved doesn't really delight with his inner being or his inner self in god's um in god or in delighting in him or in his laws and wants to keep them genuinely from the heart that's all language that paul and we see throughout even scripture is used to describe the newborn believer and so that's partly and predominantly the reason why we're going to assume that i encourage you to take more time outside of today to read up on that if you're curious about it it helps us to understand romans chapter seven but here we're going to assume that in the upcoming verses paul is speaking of a christian's experience with sin and with the law now have also noted that there's a repeating pattern that can be found in verses 14 to 23 um and three cycles of this same pattern john macarthur has actually really helpfully labeled it um as three things so they're the condition the proof and the source and so we see that come in three cycles the condition the proof and the source and paul is sort of reiterating the same point through this cycle this pattern three times and and we'll just take a look at one of the cycles of this pattern in order to get an idea of what paul's actually saying here so paul begins in verse 14 but once again establishing that the issue is not with the law but with himself and here we're going to learn what the condition is verse 14 says for we know that the law is spiritual but i am of the flesh sold under sin when paul says that allah is spiritual he's simply referring to the fact that the law comes from god and it's a reflection of god's spirit or god's character his righteous character but what does paul mean when he talks about i am of the flesh it's important to note that he's not saying he is in the flesh which he uses throughout romans 7 or romans um as a book as an epistle to describe the fallen person the person who is not saved so even just a couple verses before he says in verse 5 for while we were living in the flesh right he used that term in the flesh our sinful passions aroused by the law we're at work in our members to bear fruit for death whenever he uses the words in the flesh he's referring to someone before they were saved that's us living in sin but we hear in verse 14 when he uses the words of the flesh he's simply referring to the fact that even after god has saved us we still have residue or sin still lingers because of the fact that we have a fleshly nature that we're still in a fallen condition that we live in a fallen world and after we're saved it doesn't mean that we stop sinning right i think we can all relate to that as christians that we're not yet fully perfected we haven't been glorified using language from romans 8 that we that will be our experience in heaven it's not our experience today we're no longer in the flesh but the flesh is still in us right as born again believers we are still of the flesh as some translations and commentators say we are fleshy right that's that's that's part of our innate nature as humans who have been exposed to sin and so we're no longer slaves to sin but our fleshly nature still impacts us and so the condition that we're experiencing even after we're saved is an internal conflict right there's an eternal conflict going on because we know what we should be like we know the new life that god has given to us and yet on this side we also see our fleshy nature still at war with the new self there's an internal warfare going on righteousness versus fleshiness sin versus law and this condition of internal conflict will remain within us until the day that we die and are given new bodies in heaven so that's the condition and paul goes through that a couple of times and then next he also talks about the proof of that condition and simply the proof of this condition is that we still have inconsistent actions in our lives right verse 15 i do not understand my own actions for i do not do what i want but i do the very thing i hate so the proof is simply in the fact that we still sin even after being saved when we know we shouldn't and not only do we know we shouldn't sin paul says that we don't even want to sin anymore deep down our new self our inner being the new man or woman in christ doesn't delight in sin anymore or at least doesn't as we used to and yet we still choose sin in moments of weakness and temptation in our lives when god saved us he gave us a new life with a new heart and new spirit which led to new desires and yet we still do the things that we hate the things that we used to do things that we no longer should we know what we should do but we end up doing the opposite right and first john 1 verse 8 confirms this for us it says if we say we have no sin if we say we're perfect if we say we do everything that we know god wants us to do we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us so what's the proof the proof is that you and i still continue to sin despite the fact that we have been born again right the condition is that we have this internal conflict the proof of that is in our inconsistent lives or inconsistent action what's the source of this condition why is this still happening why is this internal conflict present well the source is that it's because of the fact we still have indwelling sin right sin persists and clings to us even after conversion verse 17. so now it is no longer i who do it but sin that dwells within me notice that paul makes the distinction in this verse it is no longer i it's no longer paul's true self his new being his new identity which is a slave to righteousness is no longer that new person paul that god has made new in him that sins against god rather it's an indwelling persistent sin that still has some level of influence in his fleshly nature we are no longer captive to sin we're new creations in christ a slave we're slaves no more of sin but of righteousness but sin continues to try and capture us right we are no longer captured to sin but sin continues to try and capture us on a daily regular basis our identity has changed but indwelling sin remains so what's the condition this internal conflict what's the proof our inconsistent action and what's the source indwelling sin and then paul takes this cycle and repeats it about three times through these verses and so if you read it you'll see that pattern just repeat itself and he's saying the same thing essentially in different ways these three times which is interesting because some commentators have noted that he doesn't do this very often right he doesn't repeat himself like this or use this type of literary device very often through his epistles it's actually pretty rare and so the question for us here is why is he doing this here why is he repeating himself and the answer very simply is because he's lamenting this he is he's grieving this reality this is this personal experience of his of his he's grieving over his personal experience of sin still having some sort of foothold in his life he's agonizing over the fact that this fight is ongoing he'd much rather not have it these verses are an emotional outcry of anguish which reaches the climax later in verse 24 where he says where he says wretched man that i am he's saying in myself i see this internal conflict i see my inconsistencies in the way i live i know i have indwelling sin and i hate it it bothers me so much right and i think we can relate to that in our own lives right when we're frustrated when we're angry when something is really bothering us we we talk about it a lot and we might even talk we might even talk to our close friends or family or spouses about it um and repeat ourselves over and over to the point where we've said it so many times and when we hear the response you've already said that like stop venting to me and and we'll go okay that's it's probably because i actually care a lot about it and we want to talk about it a lot and it really bothers us what grieves paul here that we see is that after conversion sin continues to persist in our lives and he's lamenting this and and he's grieving this and he's pointing out the fact that actually the law reveals this to us after conversion right we we use this illustration of the mirror back in romans chapter three um amir's job is to point us to our dirtiness but the mirror itself can't cleanse us from the dirt that we see in the mirror and and we use that illustration to make the point that in the same way the law points us to our dirtiness right we already established this even this morning the law points us to sin's presence and persistence but it can't clean us of that we need something else and that's jesus and what he has done for us on the cross but to further that illustration or to can to continue it after we see in the mirror that we've been dirtied we don't throw the mirror away right we keep the mirror there and we make sure that we come back to it from time to time to make sure that we are still clean and if we're dirty then we ask that outside source to come and help us get clean again to sanctify us to cleanse us and that's kind of what the law is doing right not only does the law reveal sin to us before we're saved so that we can go about the right way of being saved which is through jesus but even after we're saved we still have the mirror we still have the law revealing to us that sin is still persistently trying to cling to our lives so the law continues to make us aware of sins presence and persistence even after we've been saved so the law can't save us um but it does make us aware of since presence before conversion and sends persistence after conversion so then third question that he answers what does the law then lead us to do the first thing it does is it leads us to detect sin in our lives right god's law god's word grows our sensitivity to sin's presence and persistence verse 7 says yet if it had not been for the law i would not have known sin the fact that we're engaged in warfare against sin residing in our fleshly natures means that we need to be diligent in being acutely of aware of sin in our life we need to know where it is where it's trying to hide where it's manifesting itself because if we're unaware of the battle then we're already losing one of the greatest dangers that the enemy plays on our souls today in our context is in masquerading as light right that's what second corinthians 11 says or making it difficult to detect sin hiding sin a hidden or overlooked sin is destructive which is why david prays in psalm 19 who can discern his errors declare me innocent from hidden faults and and later he'll continue to pray god reveal those things to me because we're naturally prone to downplay or excuse sin in our lives right that's that's not that big of a deal and the more we say that to ourselves we might not even think of it as sin at all you and i probably have ways in which we are sinning against god that we don't even know about this morning we might have even committed them this morning or even during this time of listening to this sermon god's word however keeps us from being unaware of sin god's law god's word it reveals parts of our hearts that are sinful by revealing to us what god's standard is by revealing to us who god is it helps us discern our errors it shines light on hidden faults against god it is living active sharper than a double-edged sword it reveals our intentions our hearts it helps us detect sin and so if we're not resonating with paul's lamenting in anguish this morning in chapter seven perhaps it's because we don't even perceive sin as we should and the first thing that the law points us and leads us to do today as christians is to be aware of sin's presence in our lives but not only are we called to be aware of sins present and to detect it we're called to detest sin right to to hate it and paul gets to the crescendo of his lamenting once again verse 24 where he says wretched man that i am who will deliver me from this body of death and if we just pause for a second we might ask why is paul so grieved here right it makes perfect sense though in the context of his argument up to this point because he's just spent several chapters building up the argument that we have a new life in christ we are new creations we are no longer slaves to sin we have righteousness and god is our new master we live in the freedom of the spirit we're not constrained by the law anymore we've died to that way of thinking we're no longer slaves to sin where new men and women reconciled to god and yet he calls himself a wretched man here why because in light of that new life that we just talked about he hates the fact that indwelling sin can hinder the experience of that new life the joy and and freedom he experiences through this new life in christ has heightened his disdain and hatred for the old life of sin right when you and i we can see this as a principle in our own lives when you and i go through a significant transformation in our lives for the better what it often does is it makes us begin to hate the things that threaten to rope us back into old patterns of living right it's why recovering alcoholics who are finally experiencing the true freedom of a new life of recovery from alcoholism begin to hate alcohol and stay away from it as much as possible it's why the person who loses 200 pounds begins to hate the foods that once made them gain that weight to begin with right or it's why if you've listened to pastor quan preach he's shared in the past when he was younger in junior high how he one summer gained a ton of weight because he ate a bag one full bag of ruffles all dressed chips every single day in summer to the point where he couldn't fit in his pants right and so it's why pastor kwon should today hate ruffles all dress chips because they made him a fat fat fatty that one summer in junior high and now look at him right better in our new life we should detest things that used to bring us joy but now we know get in the way of experiencing true and full joy in the new life that we have because they threaten to destroy the amazing experience of this new life and just to be clear sin doesn't cause us to lose our salvation right paul's not lamenting here wretched man that i am every time i sin against god i lose my salvation and i have to earn salvation again or ask god to save me once again no that's not what he's saying when we relapse into sin it doesn't affect our salvation before god but he does recognize that sin hinders his ability to fully enjoy the new life in christ kevin de young has said it this way and i think this is super helpful union with christ is the irrevocable work of the spirit once united nothing can separate us from christ nothing can make us a little more or a little less united unity with christ is unalterable communion with christ on the other hand can be affected by sin and unresponsiveness to god's grace it's like marriage you can't be more or less married which is our union but you can have a stronger or weaker marriage which is our communion and so paul just like what kevin durant is illustrating here paul is saying or he's grieving the fact that sin can impact his communion with christ it can't impact his union with christ but it can impact his communion with christ and so if we're not grieving sin perhaps it's because we aren't experiencing that union with christ in its fullness as we should or as god has given us opportunity to we can't hate sin when we don't love god's holiness right they're diametrically opposed from one another loving the world and loving god and and our increase in one will cause a decrease in the other and so true faith increases our distaste for sin we begin to hate sin as we know the fullness of freedom that comes in life with christ cheap grace leads us to excuse it right cheap grace is the opposite it leads us to excuse sin in our lives and because paul knows the goodness of the new life he cries out against the wretchedness within himself that threatens his experience of this new life but thankfully there's hope and there's good news all right paul gives us an answer to this rhetorical question in verse 24 where he says who will deliver me from this body of death the answer thanks be to god through jesus christ our lord jesus is the one who promises to deliver us from our old fleshly natures now interestingly this phrase thanks be to god it's actually translated from the greek word for grace right terrace and it's only translated this way thanks be to god in two places in romans every other place in romans is translated grace or the grace of god it's here in 725 and also in chapter 6 verse 17 which says but thanks be to god that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed now here in 6 17 paul is giving thanks for this amazing promise that god promises to change us from the inside out to make us obedient from the inside out to god's will and and the fact that he uses the same language just the chapter later in chapter 7 verse 25 i think means that he's reminding us in chapter 7 here of the power of that promise back in chapter 6 when faced with our indwelling sin in other words he's saying you and i are new creations we have a new life in christ who will deliver us from this wretched body of of death well it's jesus christ and how will he do it just like how we talked about in chapter six he will make us obedient from the inside out he'll transform us he'll sanctify us he'll make us more like him jesus offers to change our hearts and give us a new spirit so that we would have new desires a greater distaste for sin and a greater desire to live out god's will and it doesn't mean that this inner conflict between our old desires and our new desires will go away in this lifetime it may not even mean that that inner conflict will get easier to manage over time right and and we know that because right after he gives this an incredible promise or reminds us of this incredible promise thanks be to god through jesus christ our lord he's the one that saves us he actually ends off the whole chapter with so then i myself serve the law of god with my mind but with my flesh i serve the law of sin but he doesn't end off with that crescendo of god has saved us and and the end therefore there's no condemnation in chapter eight but he actually ends off with so then i myself sir the law of serve the law of god within the mind but with my flesh i serve the law of sin meaning that even paul recognizes in the context in the circumstance of god saving us we're still gonna go through that struggle between with my flesh serving the law of sin and serving the law of god with my mind we're going to battle that that inner conflict is going to remain but even though it remains the greater promise is that through that process we can cling to god and that god promises that even through that inner conflict he will change us from one degree of glory to another he will give us greater grace upon grace and as we depend on him as we abide in him and allow his word to abide in us he will sanctify us he will allow us to detect sin better he will allow us to hate sin more so that we can see greater degrees of holiness in our lives so that we can experience this new abundant life in christ more and more each day we will grow in our ability to detect and detest sin as we depend on god to do so so if you're feeling discouraged today at all if you're lamenting like paul was lamenting the the residual sin that still plagues your fleshly nature find hope in the fact that there is a redeemer there is a victor who has already won the war that's jesus and his promise too is that one day you will not have to go through this inner turmoil that you're facing today this inner conflict one day in heaven there will be no sin no death no decay no tears of sadness we will be able to fully enjoy a life of holiness devoid of sin and the impact of sin on our hearts we can just worship him freely for eternity but until then we still have good news and the good news is that as we cling to jesus as we cling to his word and allow it to reveal sin in our lives and the presence and persistence of sin and as we ask his holy spirit to work in us he will change us he will sanctify us he will transform us there is hope and we already have a new life in christ right the fact that you and i even struggle if we struggle with man i know i don't do the things that i should i know i don't live for god as much as i should i know i'm not as holy as i have to be i still struggle with these sins abcd in my life that i've struggled with for so long the fact that we have that struggle shows that we do have that inner man who knows deep down that that's what we should really want that holiness is what we should really want right that's an indication that god is working that the holy spirit is working within us convicting us of sin so that we can repent of it go to god and ask him to cleanse us daily and and ask him to empower us by the holy spirit to make us more holy than the day before cling to him and his word in order to be changed the war within is actually evidence that god has redeemed you but let that tension lead you to pursue christ even more and ask jesus daily to make us aware of sin to grow our hatred for sin and to deliver us from sin all right martin luther has once said um and i think it's helpful to end off with this all our good is outside of us and that good is christ by ourselves we would not be able to wage this war against our indwelling sin by ourselves we could not save ourselves by ourselves we can't even sanctify ourselves we require a goodness that comes from outside and that's christ he empowers us he gives us his spirit to change us from the inside out what a good gospel that is we can't do it but we can depend on him and we can surrender ourselves to him and submit our lives to him so that he can have his way with us and change us and to help us wage war better god's law can't save us but it does point us to sins presence and persistence and in doing so leads us to depend on christ and to see his goodness and his grace with greater ability and appreciation so that we can respond in a life of worship let's pray father we praise you for this good news we praise you that even in the midst of paul's anguish over his sin there is an answer to the question who will deliver us that's jesus you have already delivered us from this body of death you've already delivered us and one day you will fully deliver us in heaven but until that day you are already doing so day by day sanctifying us making us more like you continue to do that lord we repent of our sin we grieve over the fact that we are still sometimes we are still won over by it and we ask that you in those moments not let those feelings of guilt remain but you would remind us to cling to you and to flee sin and to pursue christ and the holiness that you've called us to that you've made available to us what a gift father let us live that way today in jesus name amen what gift of grace is jesus there is no more heaven now to give he is my joy my righteousness and freedom my steadfast love my deeper boundless piece to this side my hope is only jesus for my life is is the night is dark but i am not forsaken for by my side the savior he will stay i lay this and rejoice my shepherd will defend me in jesus for he has sent that he will bring me home and day by day i know he will renew me until i stand with joy before the throne to this cycle my hope is only jesus shall we be is is through christ in me yet but through christ we pray and hope that you've been blessed in joining our time of worship this morning stay stick around we want to connect with you

"XKrxDMxYH2A": "and we're going to get into what is all the you know what is this that he does what is sub 2 how do you how do you do some of these strategies to build lots of passive income lots of rental income the way that pace is doing it and we're gonna get down to the nitty-gritty it looks like he's jumping on now i think he has the ability to turn his mic on there he goes man you missed all the fun we had so much good stuff going on we were playing some star wars lip syncing videos and oh yeah you know what maybe we'll rap at the end of this and do some fun stuff like that thanks for thanks for covering for me bro i appreciate it oh no worries well don't don't thank me thanks star wars they were they were covering for you and uh doing quite the good job and i think everybody you know that's commenting in would say that uh they they really love star wars and they learn something uh that's lurking what was it uh the one statement that they said uh oh yeah what's uh what's hiding in the bushes of love we'll just leave it at that so pace welcome to the wealth webinar series i'm happy to have you here so what are we uh what are we gonna get into today bro you know one thing the reason i'm late is because i i'm so glad that i paused for a moment this morning you know as real estate investors sometimes we can get cocky and somebody sends me a deal this morning and i'm like buy it we'll buy it right i know the guy buy it bought it at 100. it's worth 370. he's like give me a number and i'm like 200 dude i'll let you make a hundred grand on selling this deal to me it's a straight up fix and flip and my wife who's my realtor she goes i don't know there's something weird about this deal you need to go out and see the house i go i've been doing deals for 10 years i don't need to go out and see the house dude i am so glad i went out i met the i called the city inspector this morning and i said hey i've heard there's problems on this house he's like dude that house is a tear down and i'm like okay you're an inspector you're going to be a little bit intense so i go out to the house dude oh my gosh the photos that this wholesaler took are so amazingly like structured to make you think it's a good house you get out to the house you just pull up to this to the um in the driveway and you go this thing needs to be torn down like there's not even a question i don't even need it out of my truck so anyway i ended up getting caught up with the city inspector because it still might be a deal right if i buy it for 100 i put 130 grand into it you know brand new manufactured home on on the land i'm into it 230 250 the house is worth 370. man i still might be able to make you know a hundred grand on the deal so anyway that's why i was late i apologize thank you everybody for waiting and thank you chris for for covering my butt absolutely no we were having some fun i think some people thought that i was a little crazier than i actually really am for playing the bad lip reading videos but you know what that's that's what it's all about and i love that uh you know you and jameel have been uh doing a ton of those funny videos those are awesome i know we've been doing that for a little bit and i love seeing them because you know there's nothing more powerful than a little bit of laughter and that's what i'm always after yeah i mean at the end of the day you've got a lot of these people same thing in your industry bro like these guys that are trying to teach financial education if you're trying to make an impact you have to influence people right and you can't influence people unless you have their attention and ultimately what you t what you teach is so absolutely impactful it is life-changing stuff that should be taught at early stages in your 20s when you start first start making money but nobody pays attention to it until it's you know they're already losing money it's like every story that you talk to are i hear once people hear about infinite banking and you know what everything you teach it's like they've already lost hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars because they didn't have the right information so unfortunately you have to figure out ways to get people's attention otherwise you're not going to be able to make an impact and i love what you're doing i watch your stuff last time i talked to you i was like dude the freaking sweater commercial was so good i'm like how did first off where did he get all the sweaters second off how did he get those on did he have to have somebody help him that was tricky that was definitely a challenge but yeah you know we're just trying to get people's attention because um i get people all the time um you know let's talk about strategies for a second um there's so many different strategies to build wealth right you can you can be a day trader if you really if that's a cool thing for you not not something i get excited about but you could be a day trader you could do the bur strategy you could do fix and flip you could do sub two seller finance whatever and i get people that look at the bur strategy which is so commonly talked about right it's kind of the same thing in your industry there's guys that talk about certain elements of your industry you're like ah that's kind of counterproductive to what people really should be doing but it's as far as their education or experience has got them and so it's the one thing that they have to talk about right you know what's funny about the burst strategy while we're on that did you know that i owned the trademark on burr are you kidding me swear to god man i thought for sure brandon had gotten that and i went on i had my trademark attorney go in and they said no it's available i said get it so we're we're on our way to getting that dude that's g-y b-y-o-b getting the trademark on that and uh yeah i mean hey you know some people collect domain names i collect trademarks i love that the burr strategy is so great but it's talked about and it's talked about in industries that it's like okay you want to get started in real estate do the burst strategy i'm like that's not really a beginner strategy unless you have a great you know good credit score you've got cash you know which could come from private lenders but you've also a lot of times you've got to have a w-2 income to get a lot of these lenders to refinance you out and i'm like okay let's say if i'm a wholesaler right what's the typical wholesaler how are they getting paid they're getting paid basically 10.99 right they're getting paid assignment fees from their title company no lender is going to give you money in that situation and then a lot of times the education that is taught is you can get all of your money back on the burst strategy which you can but it's like one out of ten times right so i look at the burst strategy amazing strategy obviously it's why thousands and thousands of people do it but the main thing that i see people run into is after they do their fourth or their fifth birth strategy deal they run into a lack of capital right because they spend a lot of money deploying into these burst strategy deals so either a it's because um they they don't know how to use private money right raise private capital or be you know being their own bank or just got my book man i wrote the darn book on that freaking love it once is that did that just come out oh no i've had this for a while this book was written a couple years ago i don't think i've ever written that well i'm going to mail it to you so you'll be able to read it please please please because it's it's such a vital part of of doing this business right i think it's one of those things that people are deathly afraid of so i going through my journey what ultimately happened with me is that i have been a wholesaler for a long time we still wholesale we do a lot of fix and flip but primarily i was a contractor for 10 years and what do you do when you're a contractor well you go out you swing your hammer you paint a house and you do the work and you get paid guess what i got to do tomorrow i got to go swing the hammer i got to paint another house in order for me to get paid great so it's kind of the equivalent of every time that i want to go down every time i want an orange i gotta go down to the grocery store buy the orange and now i have the orange i get to consume the orange it's gone the difference in what you are doing the difference in what i'm doing compared to maybe being a wholesaler is that i'm no longer just going down and buying an orange consuming the orange and now i have to go get another orange what i'm doing is i'm taking the seeds from the orange and i'm planting an orange seed so i can continually have oranges for free in my backyard the rest of my life right so when i had this i had this catastrophic thing happen to me 28 months ago i had a guy that owed me a million dollars in my construction company my daughter gets born and this guy files bankruptcy on me and 48 other people to the tune about 16 million bucks i was about a million dollars of that and i get this letter literally like three or four days after my daughter is born right and i go dude oh my gosh this is ridiculous i i am never going to put myself in another situation where i'm reliant on working for other people one and two that i don't have money coming to me no matter what the economy is doing no matter what's happening i need to go create real life mailbox money right now i had been doing sub 2 and seller finance for years before this but when i when that guy filed bankruptcy on me i had 100 employees roughly and i had a payroll that's a quarter million dollars every other week okay so you've got a payroll of half a million dollars a month i had to go find money real quick so what did i do i sold rental properties that i bought sub two i sold seller you know rental properties i bought seller finance and i had to liquidate this in order to to continually pay my guys and keep them on staff until we wound down the company getting filed bankruptcy on was the best thing that happened to me i didn't file bankruptcy luckily i was able to weather the storm but when that happened i go never again will i work for anybody else i put all these eggs in this basket with this knucklehead guy that took advantage of me and i don't think he intended to ever you know basically run a ponzi scheme i think it happened out of you know poor business decisions and he didn't know what to do and it spiraled out of control i don't think he marked me as a guy that he was going to steal money from i just think he was a poor business owner and i continued to be a poor business owner and encouraged him by giving him more and more of my money to hopefully get my money back right i was digging the hole deeper but when that happened i said never again will i work for anybody else this is crazy like you have to be crazy to not believe in yourself you know and and not go out and build your own business and at that point i go how fast can i get to a hundred houses how fast can i get to 100 houses with seller finance and subject to and the reason being is guess what i didn't have anymore i didn't have cash and so what i did is every conversation i would have with sellers has now been about how can i buy your house with no down payment how can i buy your house with a zero percent or a one percent or a seller two percent seller carry last time i was on your show i showed real life examples of deals that i'm in the middle of i've got a deal um i should pull up and do a little screen share for you we just bought nine houses on monday this week all seller finance nine houses seller finance two percent interest carry zero dollars down well yeah you're gonna i mean you can't just say that and then not show everybody so pull that sidecar all right let's see this thing so we bought i think we ended up buying 10 houses the same day let's pull this up and you you motivated me so i'm actually working with apple now to get that whole sidecar set up i think that was fantastic i can't wait to start being able to use that i got this thing behind me but you know i need the i need the pencil oh dude the pencil is dope but the challenge is my pencil is not connected into me right now unfortunately actually yeah i can set it up hold on let's do it and you know while you're doing that let me uh talk a little bit about what you were you know in your story that's an important lesson uh you know a lot of people and it's just because this is what we're taught but a lot of people go out there and they constantly work harder they work longer they they find any way they can to make more money by putting in more energy and more effort hiring more people to put in more time energy and effort and that's what they do because that's what we've been taught to do we've been taught to go out and work for money and put effort in for money but what you finally started figuring out what you're going to start to show is what i figured out and that was we only have so much time in the day it doesn't matter who you are we have the exact same amount of time every single day and when we are always looking at i have this many hours in the day i can get up earlier i can work later but it doesn't matter what you value that hour at you're always going to have a ceiling doesn't matter how much you think you're worth an hour that creates a ceiling and i don't know but i don't really like ceilings i like just having an infinite possibility and one of the things that's unique is what you're doing what i'm doing is teaching people how not to have a ceiling teaching people how to have their money work for them or like you said take that orange and instead of just focusing on eating and take the seeds plant the seeds so those seeds grow into more oranges and more and more and then eventually just like any fruit or any tree they drop their seedlings and more grow around it so that's what you need to do with your money that's what you need to do with your business is you need to stop thinking that everything you're going to do and build comes down to how many hours you can put into it yeah that's a it's a really good point um and i was basically when i was running my construction company i was just trading time right which is fine like you've got to do that you've got to get some seed capital you got to get that stuff going but oh my gosh man the fact that i had one person owe me a million dollars is ludicrous to me that that i thought that that was a good idea it was poor education right it was um yeah just dumb so anyway here's here's the deal on monday we signed the deal at 10 20 a.m last nine offers from pace morby and cody barton this person we bought the deal from her name is katie fisher okay there's nine houses in that who's katie fisher katie fisher is a wholesaler okay so check this out katie fisher is one of the wholesalers that we work with okay it's one of the greatest things in the world if i chose to do this i i which i i wouldn't right now but if i decided i wanted to cut off all my marketing whatsoever everything right no cold calling no texting no door knocking driving for dollars none of that i have none of that and all i did was i just go to wholesalers and i go hey let me have access to your bad deals right because what an average wholesaler looks at a bad deal is just a seller that wants too much money i look at that as like one of the greatest opportunities number one there's almost no competition right so what does katie make on this deal nine houses katie makes five grand wow that's a lot of work well it is but i we've bought i think we'll end up buying 50 houses from that one seller so she has a seller named june i think we'll end up buying 51 homes so that that package is just a chunk of nine and it's the nine houses that her tenants just moved out on right so june the seller's like look basically i want close to retail so i think we're giving her like 20 grand under retail but katie's getting five thousand dollars um as her assignment i'm sorry uh chris it's five thousand dollars per house so she's getting okay i was going to say i thought i was like that's a lot of work for five grand right so 40 so sellers getting nothing down on these on this bundle of houses we're giving katie five thousand dollar assignment fee per house so katie will make 45 grand on selling me nine houses basically above retail that's a big deal for her why is it above retail it's above retail because what i think of retail is when i talk to a seller i go look seller if you sold your house today for two hundred thousand dollars how much money would you get in your pocket the seller says i don't know probably about 185 i go great then 185 is actually full purchase price if i'm a cash buyer 185 is full retail and so when i say i pay full retail typically it's i'm paying the price that the seller would get in their pocket after they sold it on the market right so i give the seller exactly retail after all that kind of stuff but i don't give the seller anything upfront i just work out deals so the document which i'll pull up document docusign now it's been like two or three days oh there it is boom um three percent three percent interest on the deal so this is we've done two percent on a lot of this ladies houses but we're doing three percent on these ones let's see where they are let me see if i can just switch this up and are these homes in there is it arizona where you're doing these these all nine of these are in arizona so you can see um so check this out this is an interesting topic so people will ask me well what about your is there a balloon so these are four four of them on one page and five are on the other ones so all ye all five-year balloon loans with the option to extend if in good standings taxes and insurance impounded through west star servicing three percent interest on all which is great now if i'm an investor now chris you obviously you understand um the the burst strategy tremendously well if i'm going out and i want to go buy nine properties on on the bur strategy what would you say right now would be my average interest rate going out and getting loans that i can get for a burst strategy loan so if you're doing bank loans it's going to be about five percent on a commercial loan right now maybe you can get down to 475 if you shop it but private money i mean a lot of people don't realize it but private money is expensive right now 10 to 12 is where you're going to be at right so if i go down let's say that i'm i want to build mailbox money right i want to go and build a portfolio and what's crazy is a lot of these houses i know equity it comes and it goes but it's been interesting this last year me and my partner made six million dollars just in appreciation growth six million bucks now it's going to go away at some point right because we're going to have some market tumble in two years three years four years whenever that's going to happen right who knows when it's gonna happen but it is interesting to just watch your ability to gain real wealth just by sitting and watching your properties appreciate so if that's your game right your game is i want real long-term wealth i want to put money into my whole life insurance policies i want to do this i want to do that i want to have financial security but i got to start i got to start with buying properties how do i do that going out and getting a bird loan and having to have a pretty decent amount of equity what would you say is the average loan that i'm getting if i do a bur like 65 ltv or 80 percent ltd you can still get 80 on a deal like that one maybe 75 is about what you'd probably expect to get because you're cool so let's say let's look at this first deal real quick so this first deal that i have if i go out and i'm not bashing the burr strategy the burst strategy absolutely works but what i'm bringing up is that there are other ways through subject to and seller finance so check this out so two eight three four east becklin unit two right condo in phoenix purchase price is 145. okay i'd say arv is 155 on this particular property so if i'm buying that and arv's 155 what would you say a burst strategy loan would be on that what how much money would i have to bring to the table to get that deal done well you'd have to that's what would it 155 you said yeah 155 is what it would appraise for thirty eight thousand seven fifty cool so i bring thirty eight thousand seven fifty to the deal okay so let's go over to notability see if i have any i have an open file so if i'm doing the bur strategy which is great i love the burst strategy i've got to come up with 38 000 that doesn't include cleaning up the property that doesn't include seller any cash the seller that's just my down payment for my loan and that doesn't include closing costs right no there's no closing costs so add five grand so let's say that i let's say that on on this particular loan i got to bring 43 000 in cash to go out and do that loan right with seller finance or subject to right going to the seller and saying hey i'll pay close to full retail on this deal because obviously you're giving me a three percent loan burr is going to say i'm turning this into like a burst bashing strategy which it's not supposed to be 38 000 plus 5000 closing i'm at 43 000. great and then my average interest rate let's say it's five percent anywhere between four point nine five percent is pretty pretty solid right now okay so if you go seller finance or even sub two and i'll pull up a couple sub two examples which are really really good some deals that we um are doing right now seller finance or subject to i'm i'm bringing in five thousand dollars for closing and miscellaneous five thousand dollars for my assignment fee and my interest rate is three percent so for me i look at this deal and i go man i'm ten thousand dollars into this deal before i can go out and rent it out it's it's rent ready right now so it's not that i don't like the burst strategy it's just that you a lot of times you're just gonna have to raise more capital to do the birth strategy or you're going to run out of the ability to go accumulate as many properties like if i was going to do nine of these deals at the same time if i did nine of these i got to bring 360 000 to the table on a burst strategy to do nine of them plus i've got to get approved for those loans what's great about the seller finance and subject to is that i have zero approval she didn't even ask me for proof of funds she didn't ask me for for credentials where do you work hey will you send me your check pay stubs i could have not filed taxes for 12 years and that she still would have seller financed to me now you know somebody on here is sitting there saying yeah but with the burr i could use private money come out come out of pocket with zero i could borrow 100 because i have you know i read chris's book the private money guide and i learned how to raise private money so i got all the money from a private investor call it 10 so now your carry cost is gonna be the ten percent and then you basically do those same renovations that you would and then you take it to the bank and i'm going to refinance it but see here's where a lot of people are wrong right now the market's so hot you know so what you're doing you're you're giving people the equivalent of what they would get selling the property on the mls which is a pain in the ass we all know that okay you're giving them that in order for the bur strategy to work you'd have to buy that property significantly undervalued then use private money to renovate it and to do it so you just got carry cost take it to the bank hope the appraisal comes in high so now you're gambling time couple years now market's gonna slide your gambling time and hope that you get that bank financing out now i've done a ton of burrs back in the day years ago before the market was crazy where i've been able to do that zero money out of pocket and actually on the refi put money in my pocket today that's very difficult to do yeah because you got to buy the deal basically 50 cents on the dollar in order for maybe more than 40 cents on the dollar right so it's not that it doesn't work it's just that you have to find the markets that it works in whereas seller finance and subject to works in every market right and it is a beginner strategy because i could have the worst credit of all time i could be 18 years old work out a deal like you've seen have you seen the deal that i did where i even had the seller seller finance their um down payment to me no okay so let's say i saw that one yeah let's go through that one real quick it's really um interesting the reason it's interesting is because um it's very pertinent to this time our time frame right now is because i just barely made my final payment to them so you guys can see on let's pull the note on this deal this one's great i love showing the story so when did i close escrow on this deal on this deal guys everybody in the comments when did i close escrow it hasn't even been a year right has not even been a year it's 11 months and 11 and a half months all right so i bought the property for a hundred thousand dollars what's funny about this property is if i go pull it up and i'll give you guys the address i'm i'm full disclosure um address hold on let's look at this address oops my bad address is 1906 south 78th place let's pull it up okay 1906 1906 south and again this you know this is a funny conversation because at the end of the day equity comes and equity goes i can't count on this equity but it's just interesting to see i bought this not even a year ago now look what it's worth in one year it appreciated 55 000 okay here's the story on this deal okay the story on this deal is the seller dale and susan they have this house right dale and susan i'll go back to the note and i'll explain this to you guys a little bit better but they were getting offers because at the time retail was 100 000 bucks so what do you think wholesalers are offering them forty fifty sixty thousand dollars max and the and the buyer who said that they would give sixty probably would cancel or try and renegotiate right before close of escrow right so i go to dale and susan i go hey i'd be open to paying you the hundred thousand dollars and i recorded this conversation so if anybody in the audience wants to hear me actually live in a seller appointment getting the seller to agree to a zero percent with a 10 000 down payment now a lot of people go well that's impossible pc you said no money out of pocket zero percent interest and no credit i see the zero percent interest which i'll show you guys in a second but what about that ten thousand dollars where the hell am i supposed to get that if i'm 18 years old i'm 19 years old where the hell am i supposed to get that 10 grand okay well let's let's bust this out let's go back to the deal okay go back to the this is the note you guys can pull this note up on county records i close this is this is recorded with the county march 31st i closed my down payment by the way what's my interest rate guys look in the con everybody in the comment what's my interest rate three zero percent interest my down payment pay attention to this guys everybody pay attention i paid them 10 000 down payment but when did i pay them the 10 000 down payment in the future in the future not only did i have them sell or finance the home to me they seller finance the down payment okay so check this out i take over a tenant they have a tenant in the property why do they sell everybody that's new is like why would they sell why would they do this because they're retired they're they're literally driving around the country in an rv every month because they're not tech technologically advanced they're having to wait on a check from their tenant and they're like we just don't want to deal with tenants anymore so the tenants renting this place for 650 bucks my payment check this out what's my payment 375 dollars a month okay 375 a month is my monthly payment basically i inherit a tenant so i have no repairs i have none of that stuff i cash flow after let's say 375 is my payment to them another hundred dollars a month for insurance and and miscellaneous and then let's say another hundred and fifty dollars for just repairs vacancy etc right about 10 after all of that it gets paid for what do i make on a monthly basis i make about a thousand dollars in net so what happens is i make that for six months i net six thousand dollars and out of that six thousand dollars i make a five thousand dollar down payment to them six months later i do it i do it again and that payment comes due actually in two days that's so funny okay so in two days that five thousand dollar payment is due i cash flowed twelve thousand dollars in the last 12 months and i paid them 10 000 so when somebody tells me it's impossible for somebody to go out and make this kind of money with zero credit zero credentials no job history no money out of their pocket i go dude let me show you recorded documents against the county recorder's office you guys can see my notes and my deeds of trust with these sellers that are seller financing or doing even sub two sub twos are the best and i'll tell you why sub twos are amazing because i can take over existing financing let me pull you this one this one's amazing let's say what uh venmo uh xavier i think his name i have a guy that sends me event oh here it is see this right here xavier allman pays me every single month 147 and dollars and five cents okay i'm going to tell i'm going to come back to this okay i've got a property in vegas let's see let's pull it up i can't remember the address whispering grove i think there it is 971 whispering grove i bought it 971 with spring grove let's pull that up this one's a really good one too because it let's say that it's not a seller finance let's talk sub 2. there it is boom so this property check it out i bought it last year oops i bought it last year on what is that july 9th 971 whispering grove i bought it for 288 how much is it worth today 307 okay cool it's appreciated i'm okay with that but more important to this is that i bought this house subject to how did i do that let's go through and i'll tell you guys a little story about it so xavier buys this house in vegas he pays 285 000 for it and he gets a va loan chris what happens when they put it where they buy a va loan they can put how much money down they can do zero and so that's exactly what he did yeah he did zero for somebody saying that you know that they can buy with a va loan uh we'll get to that question after free anonymous but yeah you could do that zero percent down so xavier buys this house last july i'm sorry last january so about 13 14 months ago buys it for full retail 285 with a va loan and he puts zero percent down so if he buys it for 285 he puts zero percent down how much does he still owe guys 285 right maybe even a little bit more i think it was a little bit more that's why it was 288 because closing costs and miscellaneous things that basically got bundled into the into the loan right so he put zero percent down here's what happens what happens to xavier why would xavier want to sell this house well he gets a job opportunity he's a 20 i think he's 22 now but let's just say he's 22. he's a 20 year old 22 year old guy he's not a real estate investor he's just trying to build his career and what happens is he gets a job opportunity in denver remember this house is in vegas so 22 year old kid buys a house gets an amazing job opportunity in denver he thinks oh i can rent this thing out i can be a real estate investor in 30 days he's like there ain't no way i'm renting this out screw this so what does he do he calls the realtor who sold it to him and he has the realtor put it on the market at 299. did it sell no but he got offers and he got offers at like 295 but let's say that he gets an offer at 295 he owes 285 right is he walking away with any money in his pocket chris no zero right he actually would probably write a check for about ten to fifteen thousand dollars just to sell that yeah i was yeah right because this is retail so he puts it on the mls sells it for 295 gets a full price offer let's say 295 still after paying off his loan he would have to write a check out of his pocket 10 to 15 grand now the agent should have told him that the agent should have said look man i can't list this property for you unless you have 10 to 15 000 to get rid of it he's like no but that didn't happen they put on the market it failed it failed so what happened is after the failed listing a wholesaler calls xavier and the whole seller says i can help you out xavier says well i owe 285. what do you think the wholesalers offer everybody that is in wholesale should know the the answer this probably about 210 to 220 would have been your offer do you think if he wasn't willing to put ten thousand dollars out of pocket to sell this thing do you think he was going to be willing to write a check for 65 000 the difference between those two the answer is hell no and so what happened is the wholesaler who went who spoke to him this whole seller's name is dylan and dylan i know dylan dylan good you know dylan good i do so dylan good comes through my sub 2 course i go dylan get me on the phone with that guy right now and i talk to xavier and i get have xavier let me take over his house at 288 which was his mortgage balance and guess who paid the closing costs xavier the problem is xavier didn't have the money to pay the closing costs so i paid for the closing costs and xavier is paying me back every single month 147.50 for the next three years that's crazy so you got yourself a good guy there that he's actually paying you back a lot of people probably would have just said ah screw you i'm not gonna pay you yeah and that's an interesting thing so i did it mostly to prove a point right so i i do a lot of my stuff um with my students where i'll show them things because i go look guys i'm not going to just talk the talk i'm going to walk the walk i'm going to show you how creative you can really get and i'm going to do everything in my power to try and get these deals to be zero dollar deals and so somebody in my mentorship goes well yeah but you still have to pay for the closing costs i go you're right i do have to pay for the closing cost so how do i structure a deal and now i've done this five or six times since then and what maria says what if xavier stops paying i don't care exactly that's what i was waiting for i don't care if he stops you would have paid those closing costs regardless you're doing this to prove a point to your students that hey this is possible yes i did it i did it to show it's possible so now what i want to show you guys is i want to show you guys um my report from my bookkeeper i get a report every single week and the report goes through let's see my net income and all that or my net worth which is great but let's pull up the airbnb on my report and i'll do a screen share with you guys so you guys can see this and while he's pulling that up folks i want you to think about something this is really important if any of you are business owners or looking to be business owners can i give you a piece of advice i don't care whether it's a bookkeeper your mother or someone else you need to be looking at your profit and loss statement your balance sheet your cash flow statement every single month if you're not looking at that it is the exact same thing as you getting in your car today putting your mask that normally covers your face put it over your eyes and then just start driving it's the same freaking thing if you're not getting your reports and looking at them every month you shouldn't be in business and i don't mean to say that in the wrong way but honestly i don't understand how people can do and run businesses without running them from this what he's going to show you here from your balance sheet profit and loss and cash flow statement and heck if you want to really be an overachiever do a personal financial statement as well every month yeah so i i'm lucky i'm you know chris is the same we've got bookkeepers and people who do this now um so a good bookkeeper guys really should only cost you about 200 to 300 a month like just to track your expenses you can have a va do it which is great um but check this out on my screen share you guys will see um this is the property 971 whispering grove same property um i own it in an llc called moving forward ventures you guys can see my airbnb i turned into an airbnb so my monthly income is about 37 3600 bucks what's my net income guys 1300 1600 1500 1400 that's after all expenses that's after everything okay so do i so maria going back to your question do i really care whether xavier pays his 147.50 to me every month the answer is no i don't give i don't care at all i did it just to show my students that anything is possible in creative finance right i've got this new thing where i go guys stop overthinking the paperwork as well like paperwork is very important but your title company mostly does all the heavy lifting on the paperwork you can sign a contract with a blank piece of paper and a freaking catch-up packet to do all your your writing i can sign my signature with a mustard bottle right it's not that serious okay anything you can think of in financing it can be put on paper and somebody can structure it for you so if you go you go to a seller you go yeah i'll take over your payments but i i can't pay for your closing costs i can't come out of pocket for this deal i feel bad for xavier because vegas closing costs i think we're like four thousand dollars right so here's what's cool i took this property over subject to already furnished remember he moved out of the property and he went up to denver he left all his stuff in the property so i had like couches tvs all this stuff i took over all of that stuff and all i had to do was clean the property put some new bed sheets on it week first week airbnb i've never had a month where it hasn't been completely booked out yeah now let me show something too because you showed yours i'm gonna show mine so love it here's something that i i just like showing this stuff you know i i've spent a lot of time like pace has just kind of coming up with systems because as you scale and you build you need systems so why not get the systems out of the way right in the beginning this is something that we've created that and this is a google doc as you can see right here so we can share this we can work remotely this is my bookkeeper melissa and then my notes which i i never update this thing but all this does is this just gives me a really quick one pager that i can pull up anytime that shows it's almost like my vital signs right how are my rentals doing where am i at how much money am i making how much am i worth my appraised value on my rentals 3.4 million mortgage amounts 2.8 so the spread on that is what i'm actually worth with this rental portfolio you know rent amount and i've been just so everybody knows i've been selling off a ton of my rentals because the market's high that's what i do i buy low and i sell high very different strategy but that's what i do i had 91 of these stupid things at one time and thank god i'm down to whatever it is 20 some of them and then my vital signs i make 7 900 every month but you know what else is helpful is and this isn't trying to get you know you guys excited about what we're making or anything because honestly i'm not excited about 7 900 a month because i'm spinning this thing off but every month you should also be tracking your rentals every month you should have the properties and then you should be tracking is it partial late over is you know how much money people leave on the table from my payments like listen like you're late you're paying me 35 bucks i charge and i don't care if you're late a day you're paying chris that's cheap bro i'm charging 175 dollars for a late payment i you know i live in new york and there's all sorts of rules actually we have no rules anymore here in new york we have no control of our own properties you see the state of new york controls our properties so i'm only allowed to charge x-men i'm glad you can charge that but i think they'd probably end up finding a way to find me or put me in jail if i charge that kind of a late fee but anyway you know so like when you guys are doing it just build your models like this you know and it's not hard it takes some time to build it but after that like think of this you know this is pacer or one of you and you're adding properties how hard is it to me and add a column here and just plug numbers in you know the appraised amount the mortgage amount or the sub 2 amount or the seller finance amount and then you just put in your expenses and boom the system does all the work you always know what you're making or what you're losing i have properties on here losing money this one you guys will be able to look 162 thompson in buffalo new york it's on the market this week i finally got the scumbag out of the bottom so i'm getting rid of this and i have other ones that are losing all the ones i'm losing money on guess what they're on the market or going on the market so all i just want to show that just to kind of give you guys a snapshot to show you what you should be when you're starting in this business in real estate don't wait until you're so big and you're like oh my god i got to figure this out just get it done in the beginning like balance sheet profit and loss get a bookkeeper or va to do that stuff it will save you thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of dollars because making one small mistake every single week or every single month will cost you a ton of money over a long time and this and what you just saw will help save that sorry i didn't mean to take the arrangement but it's the same thing i think that if anybody that wants um a copy of my spreadsheet i'm sure chris gives his out as well i'll give you guys my spreadsheet i didn't build it luckily my bookkeeper tony builds it out as we buy more properties but again when i fir when before i had a bookkeeper and i was just managing 10 12 rental properties it is as simple as just jumping in on a sunday morning before the kids wake up if you guys um dm me on instagram i don't have i'm not gonna like do a swipe up thing or like put you in my funnel or anything like that just dm me on instagram and i will give you guys access to my spreadsheet though my whole build out like how it all bleeds into page one is my net worth and then everything else that i add is um all my assets and each individual house is its own spreadsheet so um let me know i primarily just for anybody on exit strategies i have a couple guys in there talking about um i would like to learn sub 2 and then selling it on a wrap there's so many different exit strategies so many different exit strategies and i'd love i'd love to go through that real quick if you guys don't mind i think that's important because if you don't have an exit like you don't have a plan 100 so if you guys want let's go through um top exit strategies on if i buy subject to or seller finance what are some of the greatest exit strategies oh my gosh hi come here this is what happens when mom when mommy gets a phone call is this little girl sneaks in say hi chris this is adorable hi how are you pretty soon pretty soon thank you pretty soon you have to meet my little one viviana when she can actually hop on and talk yeah my wife does all of her listings so she gets on these calls with um some of our sellers or not our sellers but all of our buyers and so it gets a little intense she loses track of that little firecracker so exit strategy number one let's go through a couple that everybody knows about right i could do a straight up rental okay straight up rental i could do a lease option those are some everybody kind of knows lease options i could do i could sell it on seller finance or a lot of people would call that a wrap i could sell it on land contract or agreement for sale depends on what part of the country you're in and can you guys see my screen oh crap you guys can't see my screen hold on i'm sorry so sorry about that i'm just answering everybody's questions here a lot of questions came in on that last one okay so rental lease options seller finance selling on a wrap land contract um a lot of people don't know what a land contractor agreement for sale is basically all that is i'm selling it on seller finance but i am keeping the deed in my name even though i'm not the owner it's kind of like buying a car when you go down to a car dealership and you get a d you get a loan do they give you the title to the car no you have to pay the car off first and then they mail you the title that's basically a land contract agreement for sale and if you guys want i could come back here with chris in months and we could talk all about exit strategies here's a couple other ones novation agreement nobody talks about novation agreements but we do a lot of them and i'll i'll jump into that right now an ovation agreement is where i fix and flip a property never having to have purchased the house ever okay so listen to that one more time it's for some reason the name novation agreement confuses people to death it's it sounds technical it really isn't so when i go and i buy i do a fix and flip i'm using hard money or private money or both and i buy it with cash obviously hard money and private money loans but they're they're paying that seller off the sellers off on their merry way but have you guys ever ran into deals where you're like five thousand to ten thousand dollars off of where the where you need to be and the seller's just not willing to budge a novation agreement makes it so you never have to purchase the property up front so you you uh contract with the seller to do the fix and flip they move out of the house you do the fix and flip you sell it and then the seller gets paid in the last year our group has made 3.5 million dollars in net profits off novation agreements alone massive massive exit strategy okay it's something i could come in here and talk specifically for two hours about novation agreements a sub tail i we just completely did one um we just completed one like 30 days ago it's on my instagram you guys can go and see the walkthrough um we a sub tail is exactly what it sounds like i buy it subject to and i take it retail which means i'm fixing and flipping it why would i buy a subject-to and then take it retail well because when i go buy a house with hard money and private money i'm paying 12 14 16 18 interest depending on my lender and it's interest only whereas if i buy a house subject to and then i go fix and flip it i'm paying a mortgage payment of you know three percent my payment's one-third and it's actually paying down the principal while i'm fixing and flipping the property and worst case scenario let's say the market tumbles in the middle of my fix and flip guess what i can do i can turn around and just rent the property out because i have an existing mortgage on the property which is amazing so if if at all possible i choose to do my fix and flips with these two strategies not with cash i love that subtile that's amazing okay subtell is amazing okay that's how we prefer to go about fixing and flipping is not going in i don't need a loan up front to buy these houses the loans are already existing so why not leverage them it doesn't make sense to me guys why would i pay off somebody's mortgage with a hard money loan it doesn't mean money loans have points i mean the average points are one to three points i mean right and plus closing cost attorney cost appraisal cost here it's existing you're just taking it over right so on those strategies those are great here's another strategy i could do an airbnb for me i choose to do airbnb out of the state so if i own properties out of the state airbnb is my main exit strategy i own properties in atlanta dallas houston florida and vegas anything outside of state i do airbnb why is because i don't want to manage properties outside of the state and i have a company that manages my airbnbs remotely and they charge me 10 of my gross income so if i have a property like the one in whispering grove in vegas right you guys saw that i'm bringing in 3 600 a month my management company charges 360 a month and i never have to deal with it the utilities are in their name if there's a repair request it goes to them it's their airbnb account which is like a super high rated amazing super host and i never have to worry about building an airbnb business i'm just the property owner and i collect the i collect the net right um another exit strategy would be let's turn it on to here i could um see rental lease options seller oh this one's good group homes oh my gosh group homes are really good also corporate rentals a lot of people don't understand this like that's huge traveling nurses right traveling nurses what happens is if they can't get housing what they do is they just go to airbnb but the reality is if you go to a hospital and you say hey i own property within four miles of here they have a rental company that will manage that property right same thing with student rentals these are kind of specialty things you know obviously they're all kind of rentals but if you don't want to have a traditional rental because it then requires evictions it requires all sorts of pain and heartache with with tenants student rentals corporate rentals group homes are they don't have any tenant rights right no tenant rights so if you guys want we could come in here and talk i could talk all about exit strategies and and go through and give you guys addresses on every individual exit strategy that i've utilized but primarily here's where you can get started really easily what this oh here's another exit strategy i forgot here's the most important exit strategy of all time can anybody guess what the most important exit strategy is of all time with buying a sub two or seller finance deal starts with a w ends with a wholesale it you can wholesale these deals okay so if if you're not wholesaling a lot of the deals that i get i get wholesalers that come to me and go i don't know what to do with this deal the seller wants too much money i go dude send the deal to me send the deal to me send the deal to me i'll buy it i'll buy it i'll buy i'll pay you five thousand ten thousand dollar fee and i did a deal with cody sperber a lot of people know cody sperver he's the investor um clever investor clever investor i did a deal with him three years ago where he made twenty eight thousand dollars assigning a subject to me now did he flash the check in his lambo of course he did yeah you have to right so it's mandatory for that i guess wholesaling subject to and seller finance that is the key thing here guys is that you don't even have to buy these properties if you're not ready to okay so i always tell people when they're brand new whether they're in my course or they're not i tell them look first place you want to go right out of the gate start wholesaling some sub twos get some cash accumulation because you're now going to be able to do a lot more deals by going after sub 2 and seller finance opportunities then sell your sell a couple of them on seller finance because now i get i start getting cash flow the problem with the reason i don't love seller finance is because i don't get depreciation and for me depreciation is massive i'm sure it is for you too chris to wipe out some of those gains you have so i love depreciation and i cannot get that on this exit strategy but there's pluses and minus to that exit strategy then i tell people start doing some lease options and when you're ready and you've got a little bit more capital and a little bit more wherewithal then you can go and start doing some just straight up rentals the advantage for a rental over lease options seller finance is that you didn't sell the property to anybody you get to keep that long term that's legacy legacy money right and you get to do what you want like chris right now is selling off his rentals because the market is astronomically high if he's in a lease option or he sold it on a seller finance guess what chris can't do he can't make a decision about these properties because he's already tied this up with a future buyer yeah and let me explain that here let me just show that i i did back when i was doing lots of real estate i did a lot of those uh for example if you guys are looking at the spreadsheet again let me move these out of the way i'll just show you uh one of the issues the market is really high you see this property here 48.55 we did a lease option with this guy the house appraised at 365. this sucker right now i bet you if we look it up it's probably worth four and a quarter maybe 450 i'm getting 26.75 he never misses rent and he has now his lease option was for a year with a year extension okay he is now going on i don't know what was the year i don't remember what the year was probably five years he's been his option is dead right his options been dead now i am still honoring it because he's with our mortgage broker and if he does it i'm a nice guy if he does it but here's the beauty like you got to remember with lease options although i'm kind of locked in with him that lease option and most just so everybody knows most lease options will expire and i charged i can't remember what he gave me we got five percent down so just under 20 grand or whatever it was he gave us down he pretty much loses at it when it expires now when i honor this i'm not honoring his down payment like that's mine like you you gave that up but i'm honoring the price that i fixed in his contract the only beauty of this is is every month he's paying down this mortgage so you can see the spread there now this is i think 230 000 now the same thing is very true and this one kind of pisses me off to even talk about right here 40 60 alma house was 210 appraised when we did it we did this one six years ago i've been renting it to the same guy for 22.50 on a lease option he put 11 000 down gone and this house is now worth in the 300 000 range because of its location i have no hope in hell of this guy closing on this deal i don't think he ever is i think he's a lifelong renter so i got to decide do i want to give up the equity and just keep taking the monthly check and letting him pay the mortgage down so you can see like there's some negatives to lease options you can get yourself in a little bit of a pickle where when you want to get out you can't and that's my problem with those but is that such a bad problem i mean i don't know no no it's just you know that's not as favorable if i needed money if i needed liquidity right now i'm screwed yeah i mean that's a good point right so there's pluses and minus to all of these exit strategies and you have to pick and choose them as you elevate and go through the game of real estate and that's the cool thing is that it it's just this fun game you get to play it's just such a fun game and you're playing this fun game like okay well let me kind of it's kind of like playing jump rope it's like timing and jumping over things and it's just it's such a fun it's the game of being an adult right building wealth and lease options are great at one point i'd say 85 percent of my exit strategies were lease options um and there's nothing wrong with lease options because let's say that i buy a deal sub 2 chris and i need 20 grand to pay for closing costs cleaning up the property a couple months of payments before i get a lease option tenant in there and i raise that 20 grand from a private lender what's great with like a three or five year lease option is that i build in my equity when i sell the property or i give them the option price and when they execute the option hypothetically if they execute it then my lender the 20 grand gets paid off and then i get the remaining equity that i could 1031 into two or three deals that i no longer need a private lender for right now i don't need a private lender because i made money on that lease option so i like lease options from a standpoint of its building um you know it catapults forward however chris is right i would say it's at least 80 maybe 90 of lease options never actually execute the option that's correct but the cool thing about this is folks is you know we're talking about all these different strategies with real estate i mean right now the market's at a top it's so high i know some major wholesalers in some of the masterminds i'm in and some of them are struggling to get deals they're not doing the volume they used to because they're not as good as as jamil is because jamil went the opposite way which when we have mono talk about that but they're struggling to get the deal volume that they used to which means if they got they don't got the deals they ain't got the money deals equal money and if you don't have the deals your income drives up and that's a scary thing where with what pace is doing his strategy sub 2 works so well in this market think about it like he's able to go to a seller and say i'll give you a full price no two ways about it and then he structures the deal how many people like right now would love that there's there's not a lot of people are not showing their cards right now there's people in trouble like making two ways about it there is there is a lot of people in a lot of trouble right now i mean it seems like everything's good out there because they're just handing out you know stimulus checks like it's candy and they can't be evicted they can't be foreclosed on but again those that that dam's gonna break and that floodgate's gonna open and those people are in trouble so you may not know the whole story so going out there doing what he's doing with sub 2 is huge it's perfect i think for this strategy or for this market plus all those exit strategies there's really in real estate there's no right or wrong way to do it there's only your way but if you're going to get into real estate one thing you notice is is what pay said he doesn't just do one vertical he's doing a lot of different ones because hey eventually one might not work and then he goes to another he's and he's been doing that he's pivoting right so don't get into one thing and be like this is the only thing i'm gonna do i got into flipping i was a huge flipper we used to do 20 some flips a month it was chaos it was absolutely horrible but that's just what we did i got myself in a cash flow pinch that's why i started wholesaling and then wholesaling paid my employees then i was like wow we're going to start keeping some of these rentals and have the rental income offset my my carry cost so then i started building up a rental and i'm like wow that's pretty cool i didn't have to work as hard for that rental income and then i had all these and now i'm just selling them all off because now today i i feel like the ultimate in real estate in my realm is being the bank i don't want i to be honest with you if i had zero properties to show all of you i would be a happy freaking man today because you know what i would do i'd take all that money it's so funny you're saying and i let all that money out man and i make more money than i do dealing with tenants not paying me tenants complaining that there's cockroaches or whatever else i mean we were watching your video it smells like pee you know if it smells like pee or smells like cockroaches there's money in the walls we did that right before you came on i love that you're selling saying this because yesterday so um if you guys go to my instagram story i actually put on i talked to a seller yesterday for seven minutes and i put on my instagram today and it's a seller he's 70 years old he has 232 homes paid off free and clear wow okay so what does he want to do right now do you think he's hurting for money no but he's 70. so he wants to get out of the game and so my line to him was this i said look man all i'm trying to do is upgrade you from a landlord to a lender and he's like wow i've never thought about it that way and so that's a line i've been using for a couple of years i'm gonna upgrade you from a landlord to a lender because if you look at the totem pole guys let me let me be honest with you the totem pole of life in real estate who's at the bottom of the totem pole wholesalers yeah okay wholesalers at the bottom of the totem pole but that's where you start that's why it's the foundation you know you're looking for distressed properties right who's at the top of the totem pole now property owners creative finance guys all that kind of stuff like we're probably as close to the top as you can humanly get however who's at the very top the lender so what chris is doing is chris is saying look i just want to be the lender because i don't have to deal with any of that stuff and i get guaranteed returns and if i don't get those returns guess what i get i get the property and i might even make more money so i want to upgrade my sellers from landlords to lenders it is one of my go-to lines i've got something really funny that i'm gonna say because i love that so much and i'm i'm one of those like listen like i don't invent things right i'm not an inventor i find something that's really good and i hook on to it and i try to mimic it what you just said that is very powerful and i think you need to go an extra step with that so i'm going to give you my idea if you find more people like that you almost need to reward them from upgrading and you know like we always reward people with banking we you know we always talk about how banks are the number one purchasers of whole life insurance and they do it by having vp so every time when we talk to somebody about being you know a banker byob we give them a little name badge like you know you ever walk into a bank how many people do you see that have name badges that say vp all of them because the bank needs an executive to have a whole life on them so we created little name tags that v say byob vp of cash flow and it can say anything you need to do something like this for those sellers and like give them a reward give them a hat or a shirt or like a polo or something that would be appropriate because most of them are going to be older so find something that would i mean like a trucker hat would be sweet and just have it say i've upgraded and then i love that freaking awesome yeah so what what you're doing is you know now they're truly truly f now here's the thing there's a couple different ways to do that and i don't want to deviate from this because i know we got a ton of q a yes but here's here's the reason why this guy's selling these 232 properties for me i look at those and i could donate those properties to to my charity and the cash flow from my charity now is basically tax-free because i would you know a lot of those would be low-income housing or affordable housing and i could qualify as a charity which would be cool and i would set my family up for 200 years out the cash flow on these properties would continue to just compound and compound and compound but most people don't set up their lives properly right even this this guy with 232 properties didn't set up his life properly so for him like he doesn't have whole life he doesn't have any policies that are allowing him to lend and do certain amazing things it's just the houses and he is nothing but a landlord okay so for him it is a major major upgrade for me i don't plan on selling my properties i plan on playing playing out 200 years in the future and having a thousand homes or 2 000 doors but me not managing them having a massive company managing them for me etc or with the way chris is going simplify it simplify it make it so simple that all you do is you have so much cash that you just lend and you're at the top of the totem pole so there's a thousand different ways to go about doing it none of them are incorrect um it just depends on your personality and what you're trying to do what you what are you trying to accomplish it's the same reason why when you buy a box of crayons they don't sell you one color right you can use any color you want and still draw a picture guys okay so he you know chris might like blue i might like red doesn't mean either one of us are wrong okay we've got a whole bunch of q a dude i'm going through just kind of reading them a lot of them are going to be rapid fire because a lot of the same questions are coming through which is pretty common but yeah we'll definitely get to those for sure we got plenty of time left love it okay cool so um i would look at that guys and pay attention to that because when you understand the end of the rainbow you understand the pot of gold and chris you just described the pot of gold you under you you just described why are we taking this journey well we want to get to the pot of gold what is the ultimate pot of gold well i want to have enough cash and i want to have my policies i want to have my things set up properly that i'm just the lender and i get to do whatever the f i want all day long i can do podcasts i can go hang out with my kids i can go travel the country if that's what what is cool for me what what's your what's your pot of gold chris like what's your end end of the line goal that's a good question and i didn't even know what that was until a few years back when my mentor taught me one of the most important things a mentor has ever taught me he kept asking me why why do i work so hard why am i coming in on weekends and all this and i kept giving him answer he said  he kept saying no and i'm like i'm getting frustrated and i'm like dude what what do you want from me like that's why i think i'm doing this he says that's not why you're doing this he said everybody is working toward the same thing and that is to live their perfect day so pace what am i working toward i want to be able to live my perfect day now here's the unique thing about the perfect day nobody can work toward their perfect day if you don't know exactly what your perfect day looks like and your perfect day is from the moment in the morning when you open your eyes and you take your first breath right to the moment you close your eyes and you fall asleep what happens in that day if it was your perfect day well it took me weeks to write my perfect day and it wasn't just a couple pieces of paper it's like a novel every moment of that perfect day is outlined now you can add and subtract parts of that but there's unique things like when i first wake up my perfect day i would feel the wind okay from the ocean i would smell the ocean and hear the ocean now right now i live in buffalo new york if any of you don't know we don't have an ocean we have nice great lakes but we don't have an ocean so what i had to do to trick my mind is i got you know one of those amazon echoes and what we play at night is the sound of waves crashing every day i turn the fan on so i have a breeze going even in the winter i do this because i want to mimic that feeling because someday i'm going to get there because my mind is already living that perfect day and i just need to fill in the rest so what is all of your perfect day like what does it look like what do you work for you need to know that and my perfect day involves a lot of surfing snowboarding with vivi and all sorts of things which involves time and i don't have time today someday i will and by being my bank you know by being the bank that is time because you you you're like you said you're at the top of the totem pole you control it and you're just collecting the checks because of the fruits of your labor but the funniest thing about being the bank is a lot of people think oh well oh great chris when i have millions of dollars i'll be the bank no do you think i'm the bank with all my own money do banks use their own money to lend to you no no money see that's that's the big thing i didn't know back in the day when when i was at that three-day event and i was in that low point that mentor that that guy greg at the front said to me says the ultimate is being the bank and i said okay i just got to flip a couple hundred houses i'll have a few million bucks and then i can lend money and be the bank see i had it all wrong i thought i had to have all my own money but then i started saying wait greg you're not using your own money he's like no do banks use their own money no he was showing people the way so they could be the bank and he found a way to make a living by not only being the bank with his money but also helping other people be the bank so that's i'm curious i love that because it's the same thing i was talking to trevor mock from carrot.com do you know trevor i know carrot.com i don't know trevor okay so he's he's the owner great guy you'd love him um he tells that same thing he he must have a similar mentor or i bet she does probably so his thing is like pace here's my perfect day and he has basically it's like 20 pages right my curiosity with you is you're a high achiever right you're somebody has a vision you understand what you're going to do does your perfect day still involves some semblance of work some sort of purpose above just spending time with family friends etc what tell me a little bit about that i'm because i'm building on my perfect day i'm curious how other red personalities highly driven people do you just hang up the towel and go i'm done working or do you find other projects to work on there will never be a day where i stop working the day i stop working is the day i'm dead because i i like working but see i don't work in the same capacity as the person that shows up to work to punch a clock doesn't want to be there i show up to work because i am helping people and that that's what drives me and when you give to help other people solve their problems it's not work at all you feel like you're building something greater than you and that's what i do so work to me although i do make good money doing it work to me is solving other people's problems every day i come in on our huddles twice a week the very first thing i ask my entire team why do we do what we do and before i even get it out they're like to solve other people's problems and help them get control of their money everybody knows that everybody knows that's why we show up every single day and the second that that changes is the second i'm not going to want to work in that field anymore so will there ever be a day i stopped working absolutely not but how i work is maybe very different than the way other people work because they work because they think they have to nobody has to work people should work because they want to because they love it and because they feel like they're doing something bigger than themselves and if you're not doing that today figure that out and if you're like i can't quit my job i'm not saying quit your job find something in your job that allows you to feel like you're giving something solving someone's problem oh chris i'm a collector great you're helping people get out of a bad situation chris i work at a grocery store you're feeding young families and you can help people someone comes through your line and you know they they can't afford their bill and you see the little kids and she's like oh they're taking groceries out how nice would that be if you were in a position to reach in your pocket and say i got this one and you do that or what if you're the second person in line and you do that how many of you have actually bought the coffee for the person behind you that you don't know these are the different training things every one of you need to start doing now to get your mind right because until that's right nothing's ever going to change doesn't matter how much you work if you're working for you and for the me mentality you will always fail the system the universe will make sure you fail until you change that one thing and just start by doing little things like that driving it's interesting because something from a retirement standpoint right so like most people that have you know you grow up you talk about retirement people are always planning planning planning for retirement for the day that they go i'm never going to work again now my in-law my in-laws are like this right so he built big custom homes my fa my father-in-law built big massive custom homes 20 000 square foot homes on one of the most prestigious golf courses in arizona and he had he found a lot of passion in it but when the market tumbled a lot of people got hurt he was one of those guys he goes i'm done i'm going to retire i don't want to get back in the game and oh my gosh just watching his mind state deteriorate deteriorate over that time and i go to him and i'm like he goes and plays golf in the morning which is great and then the rest of the day he just watches tv and i'm like amazing you went your whole life just to do that right so for me retirement everybody pay attention to this retirement is not quitting work retirement is hanging up the hat on things that you no longer drive your passions right so if that is quitting a job great and you can't find compassion in your job then do have a side hustle find passion there get to a point where there's enough money there that you can retire from a nine to five but you don't need to retire from working oh my gosh like all i do all day long is find more things i can work on because i'm so passionate same thing with you chris like that's what you're that's all you're doing is finding new amazing ways to help people all day long which is freaking amazing my whole life's been like that like a lot of people don't know like flip out academy which is one of my companies we used to teach and train people how to flip houses do burs and i don't take new students we stopped in 18 why because i just didn't get enjoyment out of it anymore i didn't like it anymore something happened and all of a sudden i just didn't feel like i was fulfilling what i was there to do so i found something different that really drove me that really led me to where i'm at today and you know what there might come a day someday in the future 30 20 years or whatever it is where my passion changes i'll tell you one thing that i truly think it's going to be because i'm already starting down that path i now have a nine month old right a little girl like you do things are changing up here man it's it's like when i think of snowboarding i think i can't wait to get her on a snowboard i bought her like a little bar and we pushed her around the house today like she's nine months old she can't even stand yet but like i'm thinking different and one of the things i think about is what you mentioned earlier nobody's teaching what i do at that grade school level nobody teaches kids how money works or the things that money can do they teach kids that money is evil it's a source of evil and that that's kind of what they are so i'm doing a whole program we're writing a children's book right now but the children's book is going to start with a course that i'm fully producing with a full production crew it's going to cost me a lot of money and it's going to be called money's cool and that's going to lead into a series of books and those books are going to be called money's cool and it's going to be called like the first one will be called scouting for cash and scout is my cat so scout will be the character in it i want to teach kids bro i already principal this is amazing and and i'm gonna give it all here's the funniest thing like and this is what's gonna make everybody crazy that that course that i'm creating for the elementor it's gonna be 40 minutes long so that a classroom could play it and teach their kids and they could have fun that course i'm going to give it to every school for free i don't want one penny from it because if it's charged i feel like i'm doing it for the wrong reason and i need to make it free and that's what i'm going to do and you know it's funny we were talking about it yesterday shawna made a joke to me she's like you can do it for free all you want but you know darren well somehow money's going to flow back to you from this and i said that's not why i'm doing it so if it does great i'll find something to put that money in that does a greater good than what i can do but yeah that's what i'm doing and i won't stop until that's done and i'm going to start in a middle school because i feel like that's just the best place for what we're doing and we're just going to keep going with it bro i love that i freaking love that idea and i love that you're constantly chasing yeah i wouldn't say you're chasing your next next passion it's just that your passions come to you through helping people and you constantly run into the same issues that people are challenged with or stuck on and so you come up with a solution to that issue that's essentially why you're doing what you're doing right now right so many people have a challenge with this exact situation that you you're passionate about solving that problem until you can at least normalize this conversation around how money actually works my gosh i think a lot of people in the industry are just trying to sell a product absolutely and that's exactly what i train my staff to not do anybody that's ever done a call on all the people on here with me or my team if they've been sold anything i will give them a hundred dollars because we don't sell we intentionally try not to sell actually the people that work with us technically have to ask for us to help them set up their privatized banking and that's how that's by design that's not an accident it's because we shouldn't have to sell a product if we're showing you the path to financial freedom you should want that and if you don't want that then you're not a good fit for us it's that simple we don't need everybody i need the five percenters i don't need the 95 nor do i want them and i get a lot of them you know the engineer types that come to us and they they got all these like things these talking they're trying to talk themselves out and i i tell my team i'm like i can't talk to them i won't talk to them i don't think i can help them they can't help themselves so sometimes i think in business it's important that we figure out not who our client is and who it is that we're serving but we need to figure out who we're not serving who is not our client and we need to understand that more than we need to understand who our real client is because if you don't understand who your client is not they will take you down yeah the same thing with sellers right motivated sellers anybody that's on here that's doing real estate investing when you're talking to a motivated seller you know and you you run down that path but i see a lot of new aspiring real estate investors spend way too much time on people that are just wasting their time kicking tires etc so i this is another line i tell sellers i tell sellers hey i'm okay with a a yes i'm ecstatic when i hear a no but nothing frustrates me like a maybe i love that i i either want to yes or i want to know i i'm not going to call and follow up in fact people go i'll ask and i'll say hey when can i follow up and i'll follow up one time but usually i do an upfront contract verbally with the seller and i go look i'm a sales guy so i'm going to follow up with you right sometimes that's what happens but what i would appreciate is if you don't want to talk to me just tell me no don't ghost me don't do anything so i get a lot of people like oh the seller's ghosting me i'm like it's because you didn't set the ground rules for the conversation you need to tell them that you're okay with a no and you hate a maybe so just tell me no and i'll move on but i see these investors that are just aspiring to get their first deal and they find this one seller that was just nice to them on the phone and they spend three months chasing this one seller and they get this this condition called one itis they have one lead and they're addicted to this one lead and i'm like bro it's a it's a if it's a maybe put it in a six-month follow-up focus on the yeses and the no's in fact go and find more no's because you're bound to find the yes right i like that about what you're talking about with engineers because i run into engineers all the time and they're the ones with all the greatest questions but they're the ones that are making the least amount of money and the ones that talk themselves out of just about everything 100 i listen i've spent 20 years in the financial industry and i've come across many many engineers and sometimes college professors have that same thing and it's it's not that there's anything wrong with it's just what they've been trained is that everything has to fit in the square hole perfectly and in life that's just not quite how it works and in money that definitely isn't how it works so typically they're better off just doing things themselves and you know what that normally leads them to do pile all their money in the stock market because that's what everybody else is doing and it's the only thing they can rationalize and then in a couple years from today 2022 2023 they lose it all and wonder what happened and blame everything else because it can't be my can't be something that i did i fit the square peg in the square hole i did it right yeah i get i get whole i get uh engineers you know that call me or they're on wholesale hotline or they're on one of our shows and that they the question is always well what if this happens well what if that happens well what if this and i go what if you just took action what if you purposely went out to make mistakes and you just learned through your mistakes and you took action what if what if what if right look at sam like sam thank you so much for posting that honestly that that says a lot about your just who you are uh you know aerospace engineer here i'm a rocket scientist and i've talked myself out of everything in real estate thus far now that isn't like there's nothing wrong with that but you have to understand like what we're saying here it's it's it's not a problem so much it's just how they're trained and thank god because if he's a rocket scientist and he's planning you know helping design that rocket that's going to go to mars man i hope every little square peg fits in a square you know hole like i hope that he does that right but you got to remember it's just different than the way real estate works it's different than the way money works there is no round peg and square hole if there was like what how would sub twos have ever come to be that is literally a round hole a round peg going into a square hole but it works and it will yeah it works and and that's the crazy thing about this is that you talk to real estate agents brokers etc and you go oh yeah well what what if your client just sold to me on seller finance or like what's seller finance i'm like wait you've been in the industry 20 years and you don't know you know sub 2 and seller finance has been done for you know sub 2's probably been done for 150 years seller finance has been done for millennia like it's been done for a long long time right i mean hell it's it's being done right now with cars like you go to leasetrader.com if you guys go to leasetrader.com you can take over somebody's lease without actually having to apply for the lease you can take stuff over all the time we do it frequently right take over payments do this blah blah blah it doesn't fit in this little hole of people so i get agents that call me and go man i'm struggling as a real estate agent i'm like well have you thought about adding sub 2 seller finance and other things i've got an agent this is interesting i challenge you guys anybody that's a real estate agent that doesn't understand how common seller finance subject to is go to your state's mls if you go to your state's mls and you do a search and you type in a keyword search for seller finance or seller will carry or subject to hundreds of properties are on the mls right now being sold on seller finance hundreds it's just that it's not in everybody's wheelhouse and so it seems foreign to people for me it's become commonplace right i was forced in a position two two plus years ago that i was like i have to build an entire portfolio with very little cash and i had to use creative finance had to use creative finance ooh eve page such a great question so eve page says couldn't the subject to trigger a do on sale clause yes subject to subject to so i this is one of my favorite topics of all time subject to absolutely does trigger the do on sale clause i have had the do on sale clause triggered on me multiple times have i ever lost a home no i haven't because there's five ways to overcome that okay so when does the due on sale clause get triggered it gets triggered when there's a transfer of ownership on record right so if we go back to the exit strategies let's talk about this for a second if you're really worried about the do on sale clause then i suggest you don't buy a property on subject-to i buy most of my properties on subject-to and seller finance because i'm not worried about it and i'll tell you why in a second but one if i am really worried about it i can purchase a property on a lease option i can also purchase a property on agreement for sale now what does that mean that means i'm taking over their mortgage but i don't have the deed transferred into my name the only thing that triggers the due on sale clause is when the deed transfers from the person who has the mortgage in their name to the new purch the new buyer and the bank goes oh my gosh there's a new buyer on the property but our debt did not get paid off i'm gonna trigger the due on sale clause right we have had i've probably had the doing so clause called five times and one of my students has had it done once it does happen and you do need to know what to do in that situation so let's say that i buy a property subject-to and why by the way while i'm answering this why wouldn't i buy a prop why wouldn't i buy all of my properties on lease options well because i'm not the owner i want to be the owner i want the depreciation i want all the appreciation i want all the benefits of being the owner of the property so for me i don't get excited about buying properties on lease options it's my one of my last ways i will ever buy a property with a lease option in three years or five years guess what i have to go do i have to go and get a bank loan to wipe out the person who sold it to me on a lease option i am not interested in ever getting another bank loan in my life this is my house right here it's probably a 600 000 house nothing absolutely crazy but i bought this property a year and a half ago zero dollars out of pocket paid closing costs took over somebody's subject too low not many people live in a six hundred thousand dollar loan or a house let alone a house they never had to even get a loan or financing for right so for me lease options are not exciting but yes you can do them agreement for sale is i actually am the owner but i don't hold the deed until the house is paid off it's like buying a car right i am the car owner however until i pay the debt off i don't hold the deed so if you really want to go that route you never have to worry about ever having a due on sale clause ever triggered if you purchase on an agreement for sale now why don't i buy an agreement for sale because if i buy on an agreement for sale that means again i don't have the deed therefore if i don't have the deed i can't go to the irs and get depreciation okay so do on sale clause very simple i've had it called on us i think four times maybe five times and every single time um we've done one of two things either a we call the bank and say hey you know what this person was in foreclosure we're now making the payment and they're like oh got it just want to make sure that that's what's going on no problem thank you so much for calling the other time that it's happened where the bank says no we don't care you're making the payments we want the house back we ended up asking the bank how else would you structure this and we went back and they we switched the paperwork work up to be an agreement for sale instead of a subject to so subject to is the tip of the iceberg right there's multiple ways to purchase the property but if do on sale clause is something you're worried about which we are not you can always buy in a lease option or agreement for sale or if it's a seller finance situation there is no due on sale clause because the seller is financing you themselves they are acting as the bank so that was a perfect way to answer that so eve i hope that helped you let's do this let's go to the top of the q and a's let's get some of these out of the way because there are some good questions and a lot of them are the repeats it says if you're living in an apartment and wanted to find a sub to seller finance to live in how would you approach that from scratch okay so there's a couple different ways to do this um you would either a go to my community so i have a great community creative finance with pace morbid it's a facebook group and i would post in there and say hey guys i'm looking for a sub two or seller finance opportunity please you know i want something in these areas and i would let the 20 000 people in my facebook group help you find that opportunity because sam if you're an aerospace engineer i would imagine that you don't have a full-time job hunting down and looking for opportunities with distressed property owners right so go to other people who have those opportunities and pay them an assignment fee five grand seven grand whatever okay that's from scratch if that's what you want you want a house for yourself easy i i own a property in atlanta right now came from a wholesaler i paid a ten thousand dollar assignment fee in atlanta for a 1.5 million dollar home gorgeous it's in ansley park anybody doesn't know ansley park look it up it's where the mayor lives it's where outcast lives it's where like everybody that's cool in atlanta lives in ansley park i get this property from a wholesaler because he's like i don't know what to do with it i know you buy creative deals this lady wants too much money for the house so i bought it from from the wholesaler and paid him a ten thousand dollar fee it's now an airbnb that brings in 20 grand a month so i would go to people who are already spending marketing dollars to find distressed property owners and say i'm a buyer of sub 2 or seller finance unfortunately not all wholesalers know how to do this so what you want to do is go to a community of people that do know how to do this and my cre my free creative finance facebook group would be a great way to start hey guys my name's sam i'm looking for an opportunity i'm in an apartment right now i want to buy my first house i don't want to have to go get a loan who can put me in the right direction for a sub two or seller finance opportunity awesome all right claire was just saying earlier remember when you're saying the point is always go see the house is that a good point dude yeah on a wholesale deal no on wholesale i could virtually wholesale all day long and not even worry about looking at the house because i'm assigning it right i let the buyer go see the house or whatever right but if it's a property that i'm going to go and fix and flip and the photos are it's like the house is trashed then yes the answer is drive by the property or pay somebody from taskrabbit.com to drive by the property and like inspect it whatever um especially if it's a long-term buying hold if you're going to buy and hold and put in your portfolio go see the property right go see the property absolutely and then candace was saying since there's so many options what would you tell somebody starting out in real estate to get started with that's a that's the million dollar question a lot i know the answer every time the answer is the same exact answer okay answer number one actually i'll give you the three steps okay you want to know the three steps to getting started in real estate i answer this question so frequently i'll pull it up on my screen it is so frequent that i was like it's literally the number one question i get my dms is like how do i start in real estate now i always want to start in real estate with people that don't have a budget assuming they don't have a budget okay this is how you get started in real estate okay i have no budget even people with money i tell them start with no budget here's what you do join a community okay what would be a community that would be chris nogle's community that would be a creative finance facebook group that would be a facebook group of other like-minded people join it right there's free ones everywhere go join one don't go join 15 go join one or two okay the second thing is squad up and bring value okay i'm going to give you some very i'm not a believer in ambiguous um catchphrases okay i'm going to give you very specific advice on this squad up and bring value so what can i do i look at people all the time right chris does video content i do video content i have houses that i'm fixing and flip flipping chris has stuff he's doing all the time reach out to other investors like us that have you know instagrams or facebook and go hey can i go out into the field with you and hold your camera while you're doing a youtube video right become friends with people and bring value that's just one of a hundred ideas that you could do with people okay the next thing is how do i actually start getting deals i would drive four dollars because it costs no money and why would i drive for dollars number one it's proven that like 70 of people that got their first real estate deal did it by driving for dollars okay it's not just about getting the deal it's also understanding your entire area and knowing what's happening in these areas what pockets what's this and you become a master of your community these are the first steps of getting started in real estate if you have not joined a community and you have not brought value to people in that community and you have not started driving for dollars then i don't suggest you do anything else so many people go on youtube they do all these other things great do those things but are you out driving for dollars while you're listening to a podcast are you out um you know building a local group or squad of people that you guys are exchanging value i'm not saying exchanging deals i'm saying exchanging value now if i was brand new and i was if i was in buffalo new york i would reach out to chris and i'd be like yo bro i know you have a camera guy i know i know when you're doing these commercials you're doing this stuff but can i just be a guy that moves the lights around packs the equipment can i just be around you guys and vibe with you and just get a feel for what you guys are doing the answer is going to be yeah reach out to my camera guy if you know next time we're doing a video shoot oh my gosh like people just don't know the how simple the value that i would look at like yeah my camera guy is always lugging stuff up setting up lights doing this doing that or i'm going to houses that i'm fixing and flipping and i'm holding my own camera like this hey guys i'm at this property one two three main street blah blah blah blah it would be way better if somebody in my local community was like hey can i just meet you at one of your next fix and flips and you tell me what you did here how you found the deal i'll hold the camera while you do your youtube video basic value that's that's an important thing uh dimitri who's started as one of our interns came to aria stood at the sat at the front of the thing and then came up and said are you hiring and i said i'm always hiring but i don't pay and and i figured that would just get rid of him and no he stayed he says okay so what do you need help with i said everything filing you know organizing spreadsheets and he says when do you want me to start so we gave him a day that was a well over a year ago he hasn't left but do you want to know what's happened now dimitri and me have done joint wholesale deals where he's made thousands of dollars and now dimitri is running the entire land flipping division of our real estate operation wow solely i fund all the marketing and he does all the work takes the calls does it i mean all he did is showed up and didn't ask for something he said brought back i do to be part of this right there we go and you don't have to know anything that's the other thing people just overthink it right they got that engineer mindset of like well what what will people think about me here's what we'll think about you holy moly why can't they make more of you that's what we'll exactly 100 absolutely anonymous said i am i like this question i am relocating to oklahoma or from oklahoma to denver and i'm considering renting versus buying problems with buying is i'm still in debt and have a home to run in oklahoma and a spouse i'm divorcing okay i've almost left that part out i could buy with a va loan which we know could be zero money out of pocket would it be better to rent until the divorce is complete i would say yes um i would second today yes i would say get the divorce complete also denver is an amazing town i would go rent in denver for like a six-month time frame if you can get a six-month lease and what i would do is i would spend my saturdays and sundays driving around denver getting to know the neighborhoods that i like and then say now when i'm ready to buy i want to live in these parts right like denver is so cool you've got parker colorado which is south denver that is like an area that nobody even knows about well a lot of people do now or you've got north northern endeavor just completely like completely polar opposite of each other you can't just say i'm living in denver so i if you're moving to a new place even if you weren't getting a divorce it's probably a good idea just to rent for a short term get to know the city and then and then get a spot to live it absolutely this one says i have a seller who has a section eight tenant gets two thousand dollars house in california worth six hundred and fifty thousand and the seller is asking for that same amount so it's worth 650 they're asking 6.50 seller has 530 000 loan on the property and is willing to do a hundred thousand owner finance any bright ideas for creative financing uh like evicted tenant and make it an airbnb good luck evicting the tenant right now yeah i was just gonna say california is an impossible situation for a lot of people right now so here's my advice for anybody wanting to hold properties don't hold properties in california unless it's new york or new york or new york just don't we guys we have amazing states you can do this stuff virtually stop trying stop trying to buy stuff in california i get people that are very defensive about it they feel like they um i have pride in california okay great great then get into politics and change the situation in california it's a mess you won't be able to evict them and by the way the price point you just talked about 530 000 existing loan that lady more than likely is losing money on that two thousand dollar section eight rent rental because she absolutely is there's no way no way so how would it be a good deal for you to take that over cash here's the rule first rule of creative finance cash flow everything you don't buy properties with negative cash flow just so you can have future appreciation you always have to have cash flow to back up on and so if you're gonna buy that deal okay it's california maybe i can do it airbnb what if you can't what if you can't get that tenant out for a year and now you're hemorrhaging money for a year that little amount of money you lose over the course of a year could amplify into hundreds of thousands of dollars of lost opportunity that you could have spent your time somewhere else and god forbid the market changes i mean california is just in a little bit of a bubble you know and then all of a sudden that 650 000 house is now worth 500 now what are you going to do here's here's the way i look at this this is an analogy i use let's say um chris and i go out to go fishing and we're brothers and our mom says okay well we only have this much bait so i'm going to split this bait in half it's going to be equal amount of bait and it's let's say it's power bait you know power bait the malleable stuff you put on the hook it's colorful smells like whatever so we go out and we're fishing in the same river i'm gonna be very aware of how much bait i have and i'm gonna try and utilize that bait to catch as many fish as i possibly can to bring home and i'm kind of competing against my brother chris it would be really stupid of me to take a big chunk of my bait and go catch one little stupid dinky fish with that big piece of bait so what i'm looking at is that hundred thousand dollars down that the seller wants to bring a very teeny little fish or a problematic diseased fish to put to bring back home that's a poor use of my bait so for me i look at deals and i go how can i buy this deal with zero down or how do i buy something where the fish even if i have to put a lot of money down like that deal in atlanta i bought i put a hundred grand down on that house but that property brings in twenty thousand dollars a month so i appropriately used my bait on a deal that will bring me massive fish for a long period of time so use your bait as sparingly as possible to catch the largest fish as you possibly can that is not a good use of your bait well said and then cynthia was asking would a house next to a nursing home be a good candidate for an airbnb i guess there's that's kind of a loaded question cynthia there's a lot of other things we'd need to know but what i would say i would say no that's not a standard candidate for um because here's the reality nobody knows i used to be in behavioral health and assisted living i owned four behavioral health and assisted living facilities i could stand at any one of those properties and throw a rock in any direction and i'm not exaggerating on a really good day if my arm was feeling good i could throw a rock hard enough that i could hit another assisted living retirement community behavioral health community they are everywhere you just don't know okay let me give you an example of how i know this when you go buy a new property in phoenix arizona and you go i'm gonna turn this into a group home you can't just turn any old home into a group home you have to go to zoning and say hey zoning i'm going to turn this into a group home now they're not going to change the zoning for the the property what they're going to do is make sure that you are geographically spaced out from other group homes assisted living retirement communities because they don't want to overwhelm one pocket of the community with too many retirement homes there are full-on cities in the phoenix geographical area or the the metro like mesa with 600 000 people that if you try to get get into the assisted living game the only way that you are going to get into that game is to buy somebody else's existing assisted living because it is completely blacked out you cannot put another property in that whole entire 600 000 person population it's oversaturated why do i say this i say this because you know that there's one retirement community right there because there's a sign in front of it but the reality is there's a retirement community every thousand yards in the entire country i promise you you just don't know it okay so i never look at retirement communities as a great way to bring an airbnb for me most important thing three bed two bath um near a freeway [Music] and because most of the time when people go to an airbnb like they're coming into town they're not staying at the airbnb except for at nighttime they're traveling around they're going to the mountains they're going hiking so recreational activities are way more important than visiting grandma smith and grandpa you know tom yeah that's a good one todd was saying i started off with rentals i'm in the process of selling my last rental should i concentrate on wholesaling for now before buying another rental um that's a personal decision because it i i don't know your financial world but here's my feeling on rentals rentals are work it's not really passive income unless you can hire somebody to manage it for you so if you're at like 10 rentals or less usually most people self-manage and it's a lot of work it's a lot of headaches and stupid phone calls and all sorts of stuff so for me and the cash flow really on 10 properties is not so dramatic that it's like this is a life-changing amount of money yeah actually i shouldn't say that it is a life-changing amount of money for like 99 of people what i'm saying is you don't want with 10 houses cash flowing you could definitely quit your job okay you can definitely quit your job however now you have a new job managing rental so for me wholesale is a great way to start it's headache free you can enjoy your weekends um so yes wholesale is the way to go for probably 99 of people to get into the game awesome if i buy sub 2 and sell to new buyer with seller financing how does it work out when the buyer wants to sell later okay so that's very simple so what happens is this you owe the the new buy or the buyer right the o now the owner because you sold it on seller finance guess what you just did you turned yourself into the lender right you created your a position for yourself where there's a subject to loan for let's say a hundred grand here i'll pull it up on the screen so we can visualize this real quick because this is this is a great great great question so let's say that i buy a house and it's a subject is a sub two house and i take over an existing loan of a hundred thousand dollars i turn around and i add fifty thousand dollars to that and i sell it to somebody else for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars with ten thousand dollars down great i get ten thousand dollars in my pocket this person guess how much they owe me they owe me personally forty thousand dollars right because their ten grand goes against that 50 that i created for myself right are we following everybody so that 40 grand plus the original 100 is what they currently owe right and they're gonna make payments and you'll make some cash flow on this which is great as they pay this forty thousand dollars down great but let's say this buyer name is tim decides hey i'm getting married i've got this girl named susan i'm gonna move in with susan and i no longer need this house that i bought from pace so tim goes and he puts it on the market he says this is for sale and he sells it for 199 two three years later well what happens is the new buyer peter submits an offer for 199 and guess what they do they go open up escrow at a title company that title company then does this magical thing called a lender payoff request now you're going to remember that this guy owed me at one point 140 grand but now he probably owes about 137 because he's paid down some principal along the way and i send a lender payoff request and it says 99 000 goes to the original sub two and thirty eight thousand dollars goes to pace's note that i created and this guy peter he goes out gets a loan for the 199 and that 199 goes to the title company and pays off these two notes before the new buyer closes escrow well said man and a fellow artist love it all right are you uh let's see this one are you given first right of refusal i'm not really so i love that so let me i know exactly he's talking about which is a perfect segue into this situation so you see tim here tim then sells the property for 199 to peter i can put in my agreement right when i sell this property to tim i can have an agreement that states hey i'm selling this to you on seller finance but i want first writer refusal to buy the property back from you when you decide to sell it instead of you selling it to peter i want you to sell it to me why would i do that well remember there's a there's a sub 2 loan here that might be like 3.25 interest don't you think i want to keep that loan in my name so yes you can go back to tim and you can say hey let me buy the property from you and you have first rider refusal yes that is in my agreements with my rap buyers awesome and then lynette had a question she was just saying she got a call out of the blue or a text out of the blue about uh selling her house she was wondering if that's a wholesaler more than likely i would say yes one thousand percent there you go so a thousand percent uh all the neighbors here are getting solicited to buy their house i must live in a good area there is not enough inventory on the market for all buyers right now okay that's just a statement what is the seller oh what is the seller financing link please is there somewhere they can go for that um they can go to my website um sub 2.com there we go give that to you and then maria this is so funny that she asked for this check this out the script

subscribe thanks for watching this yeah", "NoECnTiQAVc": "[Music] [Laughter] good morning good morning someone was talking two or three or four weeks ago and they were talking about what the catholic friars wear and that they wear a rope around their they've got this rope going around their rope and the rope has knots on it and i i was present they were talking to some kids and they said they mean something they looked at me and i went i don't know what they mean and then later on i found out what they meant and so those those three knots that are there and i guess i should preface this by saying because i'm going to do a little comparison i've been watching this catholic friar on youtube uh the venerable tom mung has has totally destroyed me and that i'm addicted to youtube now yeah there's just there's no way around it i've learned more useless information than i can possibly describe from watching this and um so you know one of the things that uh you you're getting a cramp let me come down off of my perch here back up just a little bit because i couldn't quite decide which way i wanted to go with my talk this morning and one of the things that people find very interesting is that basically the catholic religious orders copied the buddhist religious orders because we were there about 500 years before them there's so many parallels going on there that it's almost like geez they had to encounter these people and of course we know historically that buddhist monks were in egypt roughly about the time that jesus was there as as best we can figure um so there there could have been some encounters and we have the silk route and israel was on the silk route and greece was on the silk route and so there was a cultural exchange going on there so for those that don't know that we're not raised catholic that there is a difference between friars and monks and monks typically live in a community and for the most part don't go outside of the community for the most part and friars live outside of the community they can live in small groups and they interact with the community you might you could go down the city and run into one of them working at a soup kitchen feeding people or handing out boxes of food during the pandemic or perhaps teaching school things like this so they're more in the world in that sense then are the monks who typically live in cloisters or monasteries and uh their their life revolves around prayer and and liturgy throughout the day so with that now we're back to these knots and i was watching brother so-and-so on youtube and he talked about the clothing that he wore and it was really kind of funny i told uh venerable mung about it because it was one of his little episodes he's having a lot of fun being on youtube and one of his little episodes on there was talking about the 10 problems with wearing a rope and the robe we wear is very similar to the robe that they wear matter of fact it's the same color and it has the same problems like you're walking up the stairs and you step on your robe and you end up falling on your face and that was the first one he mentioned it's and the brothers behind you are all laughing at you because you're clumsy and you're down on all fours and one of the first things i had to learn when i was young was that when we went from the american temple to the vietnamese temple which was two blocks away one down one over we had to go upstairs and then we had it was on the second floor so we went up to the courtyard we went upstairs and then we had the opportunity to trip and fall on our face going up on either side or steep stairs going up to the second floor and if you have a two-story building the boot is always on the highest floor or three it's always there because technically you can't walk over the top of the buddha that's the custom and so many times i would step on my robe and kind of do like that and feel pretty bad and of course he showed it to his particular technique of how to take the robe and kind of pull it over so he didn't do that my technique is just to grab it a little bit kind of like a lady pulls up her dress but he pulled it all the way up he said you can't do that and found out he had shorts on underneath his rope but i just would pull it up just a little bit so that i wouldn't trip on it anymore and i do the same thing i kind of grab the back and pull it around when i'm coming downstairs you know and so i thought it was interesting so then he talked about the rope and he said there's three knots on it and they stand for chastity poverty he's gonna help me it's chastity poverty and obedience obedience okay so those are kind of fundamental for the catholic monks and for the catholic friars and friars or mendicants i i like mendicants that's what mimikins are what buddhist monks were in the beginning and and there's a lot of there's so many parallels in here and i and some people would probably take the fence when i say well the catholic months copied but there's really nothing to take offense to because when all said in denver but basically doing the same thing so um because there were mendicants which is and my favorite men connecticut i didn't learn to read for a while when i was in grade school and it was it was quite a way in ways into grade school before i actually could literally read and one of my favorite books out of the grade school library was the story of robin hood and this was a traditional story written actually it was an adult book you know there were a couple references in there the ladies of the night and things like that and i didn't know what they were talking about back then but there's friar tuck and fryer truck was a wonderful person because he was a mendicant and for years i wondered why is this catholic what i thought was a priest or a monk why is he living in the forest with robin hood why isn't he in a church why is he a cathedral or a monastery what's he doing in the forest well friars live in the forest some of them do some of them in california they live in missions it's an interesting thing because another little side note that i learned from a franciscan who was a friend was that years ago i learned this that rome had said they get permission to go into a hermitage in the forest or the friars do yeah yeah well i'm not talking about the hermitage ones i'm talking about he was just sleeping with robin hood he wasn't he wasn't a hermitage he wasn't drinking his wine and having a good time and everything but when the friars came to california which is all the franciscans that set up all the missions in california and then later on time went by and we came into the modern age and there's been a certain prejudice against catholics in america because of course we are a god-fearing protestant country and notice there's no wiggle room in that we are a god-fearing protestant country and i had my dad chasing me around the table one day when i told him that george washington and ben franklin and the jeffersons they weren't protestants they were theists he didn't like that so he got up and he was going to smack me so i had to run away from him but that's kind of the thing that you hear from people that that's who we are yet catholicism was here from the very beginning also it just was a pretty small i'm talking about when the country was formed not when all the immigrants came over here from europe and settled up and started their religious communities you know the quakers and the anabaptists and and all of those people i'm talking about later on 200 years later when we're actually a country and we say oh you get to practice any religion you want and one of the reasons why catholic schools came into being and everybody's familiar with the fact that catholics run schools is because they wanted to be able to also teach religion as part of the school experience for the kids and set a good example for them and um so they had to start their own school because by the constitution we cannot mix the two so but you can have your own school and up in the high desert we have a we have a christian school here in our little town of lucerne valley i don't know how it's doing but it exists and apple valley and asparagus they have christian schools where people have to pay money for their kids to go to school so they're out doing this stuff well here's let's get back to friar tuck catholic medicals in those days in those days they did not live in hermitage as they traveled from town to town and they begged for their meal because they had one of those nuts stood for poverty which means they could not have any money technically they could not have any money so every day they had to go maybe to an end where they would be cooking because they didn't have denny's and you know that kind of stuff back then at mcdonald's and the way they paid for the meal was to get a sermon they would go in and ask if anyone would please give them something to eat and very often it was very simple and then they would give a sermon so they were preachers and they were spreading the word the gospel okay buddhist monks were enjoined not to go further than 10 miles in any given day that was a rule because of course they had the rule of poverty and when one becomes a novice one of the 10 rules of a novus is not to handle gold or silver and it's a real straightforward thing you can't have any money now i'll talk about how we got around this later on but in the beginning nobody had any money and we have steve who's living at the temple here and steve is a lay person although he doesn't like to admit it to anybody because he doesn't wear his buddhist robe which is the robe of merit when you have this robe every time you put it on and you recite the gatta now i open the buddha's robe a field far beyond form and emptiness that the target is teaching for all being you create good merit as opposed to bad merit when you steal a candy bar in the store because you don't have any money because you have a vow of poverty so the buddhist monks would get up in the morning they had a very simple routine if there was any maybe fruit left over or juice perhaps in the morning they could have that kind of the to bank up the fires of hunger they would make sure they're bold and everything was clean they would wash their face and hands and they would go into the village wherever that might be and sometimes the village was a 30-40 minute walk and they would go to three houses and at three houses they would stand outside the back door and if the people inside and they would chant and the people inside might give them some food and they could go to three houses and get food and then they were supposed to go back now this is old food it's leftover food from the day before in a place that has no refrigerators that has a some tropical to tropical climate where things go off really quick but they would collect their food they would go back and they had to start eating it usually they ate at about 11 but the tradition is they had to start eating it before 12 o'clock and everybody knew when 12 o'clock was because the sun was directly overhead and once they started eating they couldn't stop if they stopped eating they couldn't start again okay they they had to continuously eat their meal and then they might do a little meditation very often the buddha would give a talk if they were with the buddha or a senior monk like mahakasha a little dharma talk like i'm doing now 15 20 30 minutes which is very brief for people of indian persuasion you understand because if you ever go to a lecture by an indian philosopher religious man or scholar it goes on for days they just they love to talk much worse than me they just go on for days and days and days so the buddha would give a very succinct and brief dharma talk the monks may or may not they they might they can stay in a place for three days so if they're staying in the place they might do a little meditation now they might perhaps take a nap okay there is no evening meal in the in the evening when it starts to get a little dark they're expected to be doing meditation the buddha would go around make sure he had a little whistle and if they were falling asleep then they'd go and they'd wake back up and that whistle by the time he got to korea was a big stick that the monks got hit with but every three days they were supposed to move and they would hit the road after lunch and they could walk no more than 10 miles now villages in india at that time and i'm told in the rural areas they're still very similar they're 8 to 10 miles apart that's the amount of time you could walk in an afternoon or the time you could walk in the morning 8 or ten miles you walk it two and a half miles an hour so you can see how that would take the afternoon in the morning and then they would come in and they would find the big banyan tree or they they'd find the center of the town they'd find some place they slept under trees a lot and friars slept under trees a lot and they would find us tree for shelter from the rain and they would go ahead and they the belongings they had were carried in a bag and the monks still carry a bag today they could have three robes three garments and they could carry a little medicine they could carry their razor to shave their head twice a year or twice a night twice a year twice a month you know they might carry a couple of willow sticks for brushing their teeth that's what they did they scrunched up the end of it and could brush their teeth with it no money no food you know they they were it was pretty simple and they'd come into town and the town people would see them and they would come up because now there's no entertainment in the town at all believe it or not 2600 years ago there were no tvs no radios there weren't even much in the way of books and if you could read you were probably a brahmana and you were reading the holy books like the uh the vedas and they were all in sanskrit and this is not what people spoke and so it was you know it was kind of like a you know middle ages in europe and everything was in latin and just a few people actually understood what was being said and the rest went uh-huh because they couldn't read anyway you know so the the head of the village would might come out and greet them and say where are you coming from who who is your teacher because gurus and their students are very common in india to this day they have a number of philosophical schools and they have a number of religious schools in india the hindu faith is not monolithic it's not one thing it's like christianity there's nothing monolithic about christianity i gave up trying to believe that i actually knew what christians were protestants sometimes catholics i know i can go get the baltimore catechism open it up and tell you everything they believe because it's written down in that book and and almost all of them believe that but if you talk to a religious and the catholics they say well we don't we go along with it but that's not exactly what we think but protestants you know there's two or three hundred different versions of what they believe there has to be because there's all two or three hundred different churches and so there has to be slight differences in there so these hindu holy men and philosophers would travel through the villages and the head men would come out and say would you give a lecture we have a very great brahmana now brahmanas were the priests if you don't know and you could always tell them because they were white because they were pure in the caste system they would be hopefully that would be their last rebirth and then when they died they would join the great god and they would never have to come back and live another existence they would reunite with god brahma so they were very holy and he would say could you could you talk with her we'll ask him to come out we'll provide a little fruit oh i can't eat at night oh well he'll eat a little fruit can you have a little juice yes i can have a little juice at night and so they put some put some pineapple juice or some whatever kind of juice they had and very often was a debate the brahman would say the bhagavad-gita says this what do you say and the monk would say well our master the enlightened siddhartha gotama says this and they kind of go back and forth it wasn't an argument it was actually a debate if you watched the recent political debates for the presidency those were not debates now those were name callings and arguments i watched some of it just really out of curiosity and there really was no debate because you don't interrupt a person during the debate you don't call them names you don't talk about how bad they are you simply say this is what i believe what do you believe and you see i believe this oh well if you believe that then how does that affect this and they would have these very friendly back and forths and that's how buddhism spread because the monks were told don't stay under a tree more than three days now if the weather was really bad they could stay in the layman's house in other words if you come into a village and the layman could say oh look at this the weather's horrible and you know some of these monks were living up next to the himalayas and it snowed up there you never hear about this but it's the himalayas and they might say well come on in here and sit by the fire you know i'll give you i'll give you some graham crackers and the s'mores and they would go no no we can't eat at night but i can have cocoa so they would be like this well the franciscans were doing the same thing or the friars were doing the same things and here's here's friar tuck my hero he's the one i gravitated little john i kind of admired him he had a big stick and he beat up people with it and robin hood he could he could split an arrow with a thousand yards but fryer tuck fryer took strapped to his back had a cake and the cake was sacramental wine because you know when you the eucharist is performed or the last supper when that you know there's a little wine in the early days everybody got a little wine they a little lily a little bread and fryer truck got a little bit more than a little wine because he walked into the camper robin hood and he said hi guys i've got some wine for sale and he also had chicken bones because back in those times in the time of robin hood if he was a historical character nobody's really sure it was so long ago but all the places mentioned exist that he would sell sell you the finger of one of the apostles yes and he would whip out his chicken bone and he would sell that to you so he had a little bit of cast so he could replace the white okay well that's that's going to the extreme but he was chase he didn't have a girlfriend robin had a girlfriend made marion but not friar tuck and he was obedient he was obedient to his rule we think of obedience like a child is obedient to the parent but that isn't necessarily what obedience means you you take a rule and to be in a religious order you have to have a rule and for those of you listening online that belong to an american zen order if you don't have a rule you don't have an order you have something i'm not sure what maybe a club maybe you have a club and you all put your club uniform on but you know when i did martial arts we had a uniform but we didn't have a rule unless you say don't hit the guy when he's not looking i guess that would be but that's not much of a rule and so friar tuck was supposed to follow the rule of the things and you really only ate one meal a day because how many meals can you make a day see the similarities all right so what's going on with the monks well in the beginning the monks were only eating one day a day how could they get away with that well one day over eight that's the first problem they have all kinds of digestive problems between the fact that people didn't know about hygiene at that time and they didn't wash their hands you know the pandemic would have been good for them they would have learned how to be clean but they weren't clean and so once we get sick from that and monks would get sick from the food just spoiling and you know the buddha had to say well you know if it's the bowl's all full of maggots now you don't have to eat it because you'd be taking a life you'd be killing a baby fly so these guys are wandering around and when we talk about i i talked about mexicans or friars and monks but they're not amongst them are they not by a western definition and of course we always have to define by the way we believe not the way they believed at the time they were called monks which was biku which meant baker but that has come to mean buddhist monk but they traveled and they literally baked for their food but they had a rule to follow and by the time the first council was called and they started codifying things we ended up with a lot of rules we ended up depending on the order you belong to 227 to 250 and there's more than one set of rules they all basically say the same thing and they all are dealing with chastity poverty and obedience just like the catholic orders do but we started getting around that because buddhism went from india where you could sleep under a tree to china where you could freeze to death under a tree and die and one night you're done because these guys they didn't have big coats they're walking around barefoot and they get to northern china and they freeze to death and somebody said uh maybe we need to do something different and one of the first things they did is they started adopting what clothes the chinese wore and the chinese when they lived in cold climates they were very heavy robes i have a light robe on today but i have one that's pretty thick i even have one that i got from taiwan i don't know 30 35 years ago that's wool that i used to sit in the zendrill with because we had some pretty cold winters here back then every other year we'd have snow on the ground that would stay and stuff so i i got this wool robe because a friend of mine had one and i when she went to taiwan i said could you pick me up one of those wool robes because it really looks warm and in korea the monks wear these quilted ropes like ski jackets to keep them warm because the point of being a monk is not to freeze to death and the point of being a monk is not necessarily to be miserable you know you could you can put enough clothes on to stay warm and but i got to china and here they are and they're all of a sudden they're staying in one place now the monks in india stayed in one place during the summer between the birthday celebration of the buddha and the memorial service remembering your mother and those that passed on during the year which is called mulan and it's ulambana in sanskrit and so we have the buddha's birthday to that it's roughly 90 days and it begins in april and ends in april may june july it ends in july because it's in the middle of the month when we have the moon shining bright and everybody knows now it's time to celebrate so they were staying together they weren't staying in the monastery they had pavilions where they could get out of the rain during that season because it rained a lot then that's part of the reason why they picked that season is because it rained every day and it rained heavy and so and they could build little shelters for themselves out of reeds so they weren't wet all the time and wouldn't get sick so now they get to china well they've got a background of living together in community for a while see now it's kind of a combination deal well they travel and usually they travel in twos and threes and maybe fives they didn't travel like a hundred months went down the road and came into a village because the buddha told you can't do that if a hundred months go into a village and you go begging you're gonna take all the food that people have and the fee people want to be good and they want to support holy men because that's that's the way of india we support holy men so you're going to strip out their their water they're not going to have anything to eat and it's your fault you get to china first thing the chinese saying is wait a minute you're a wise and holy man what are you doing out on the street banging different culture i remember years ago americans were were obsessed with the idea that they didn't want oriental culture or asian culture of any kind they wanted buddhism but they didn't want culture this is still going on there's a group in hawaii no priests no monks no nuns no clergy they're all lay people and they they honestly feel that they don't need to have any kind of clerics in their operation will just have educated lay people who don't have to follow a rule don't have to follow poverty don't have to follow chastity and don't have to follow obedience basically they can do anything they want to do because this is america interesting idea well and then i'm staying at a temple and i'm hearing americans complain that i'm not vietnamese i'm not japanese i'm not chinese why do i have to do this you know nobody ever made anybody eat with chopsticks usually a spoon was put out there you know matter of fact half of the buddhist world doesn't eat with chopsticks you go to southeast asia with the exception of vietnam everybody eats either with their hands like they do in india or they eat with a spoon so that that's not buddhist okay but americans just had a really difficult time with this because they didn't want to have to change anything they didn't have to look at how they lived their lives they said well there's nothing wrong with having a mercedes-benz there's nothing wrong with having an 850 000 house and there's nothing wrong with looking down on people that don't have what i have because i earned it therefore i get i get to be a snob and i get to look down on other people that aren't as good as me because that's the american way and it's kind of the western way it's not just american it's the western way so they didn't they they got confused they didn't realize that equality besides being an american ideal that people don't want to follow is always been a buddhist ideal when you take someone and you shave their head you put everybody in the same robe okay i've been doing this for going on 50 years this month over here has been doing this for fully ordained for going on two years now three four four yeah this is four and a half okay do you see any difference in what we're wearing no there is no difference in other words there's no way for me to say i'm a really important person and i know you would the first thing you would say yeah but you're a little bit older maybe that makes you an important person in some countries in asia it's common for older people to become monks and nuns they have a different status and the difference in the status is nobody expects them to go out and pioneer a temple to go build temples or start universities you know here's this person he just his heart is bleeding for steve so i go out to the zendo this is winter now officially and he's got a heater on and i'm going ah we don't normally use a heater in here just went in one ear and out the other because he is just a little ball of compassion and he worries about steve i don't want steve and i hope he doesn't want you to be cold either he didn't want anybody to be cold so he turns the heater on and i have to adjust what i'm doing because normally i would have so many layers on going out to this endo and i'm sitting there sweating now we're being using skillful memes which is the topic for another talk because we do heat our dharma hall up because nobody would come if we didn't so we have to be skillful and make it comfortable enough that they want to come so now they're living in these buildings and they're getting to put on lots and lots of clothes and now they have to start somebody's got to have money well back in the buddhist time if people came to the song or when it was gathered and they wanted to donate money and people did that you know they said well i'm going to donate some money because the monks might need new ropes or they donate when i first joined the vietnamese order at the end of the summer we would get yardage and the idea was we would go to somebody who would make us a robot the only problem was there was nobody in this country knew how to make a road but we i had lots of ultra cloths gray and yellow because i would get this yardage but i don't sew and i i thought at that stage of the game probably it wasn't worthwhile for me to try to figure out learn how to solve so i can sew a rope which are these robes are particularly difficult to soak just because of the way they intertwine they're not a tube so they had to do something so in that time the monks uh would appoint a devoted layperson who would accept the money and would keep the money and they could buy things that were needed it might it you never hear of food but it could have been clothing it could have been cloth for clothing it could have been medicine for sick monks as time goes by in therapy countries today the saunder will have more than one lay person who does this kind of business for them that will handle the money will go to the grocery store and buy the groceries i remember my mother telling me when i was young that that the nuns always had a layperson which was probably an oblate right that would handle the money and do the shopping for them so the nuns didn't have to handle money same idea okay not being pulled to decide by this notion of having money or having wealth so there they are and they start to get they start to store food people bring food in the form of rice which we still have we have lots of rice anybody wants to come we'll give you a bowl of rice we might have miter might not have sesame seeds shake on it and that'll be your meal or noodles we have noodles too so this this whole thing went along but the monk still had the rules and then i think of a nun story and i have all these movies that i saw you know and but i i call anybody who's who's practicing the dharma as a cleric a monk and i had a friend she was a feminist and she called them numbs and she had all these little buttons i used to wear one on my robe that said knuck but it said something else like we support monks or something like that you know so these similarities go along and what do we do now well we have if i look at the monks that i know the really good monks and a couple of them i truly believe are enlightened they drive cars somebody has to own that car believe it or not if you go to triple a and you say i've got a car we have a car donated here last year it's 20 years old and it's only got like 70 000 miles on it and it's a little clunky because it's a four-wheel drive honda car but the person that brought the car said i want to donate this is your backup i thought why not you know a little backup car here and i have my truck and if i drive that car then i don't wear out my truck which i bought whenever i bought it a year or two years ago because my other one died a terrible death and uh so somebody asked on it if you go to triple a and said that this is going to belong to it's going to belong to the temple and they go well what well you have to have an entirely different insurance well i've already got insurance for my truck under my name so the car is under my name see how that works because we don't want to get it out of the temple thing because then we have to pay a whole lot more money just to have another entity involved in there so we're just being skillful with that stuff we have a bank account because we have to pay property tax and we have to make repairs around here and every once in a while we build something new and we can't sit around and wait for somebody to come down our road particularly during the pandemic and say oh do you you need a few hundred dollars to do something let me donate that to you so no we have a bank account like everybody else does and so the nuns at sheila temple which is a beautiful chinese temple the largest they i think they still are the largest chinese style temple in the west they just opened up a school they bought the supermarket down below that whole area and opened a school so they opened a like a secondary school like a high school or something secondary school i think for yeah that's high school yeah oh yeah they're they're a big operation they have university of the west big operation yeah they get a lot of money and the nuns in there have money because we had a president and the vice president came by here they were getting ready to run for office i never can remember who it was and he gave a speech out there and the abbots told everybody to donate to him and so they all wrote chexy because they didn't have the money they wrote a check and they think that gets them out of it well it doesn't get anybody out of anything it's still money yeah yeah you know if we decided that we're gonna these water bottles are gonna be our form of currency then i'm handling money when i handle a water bottle but it's an adaptation that's that's simply what it is it's not uncommon now particularly like in japan monks have to buy their own robes and with the exception of one monastery that i know of they have to pay to be able to live in a monastery in other words you have to pay for their food it's not a big deal but they better have somebody supporting them a family that says okay my son my son the priest i had a disciple years ago who passed away and he says i'm what what every good catholic mother wants a priest it was a joke with him yes so these these things of owning a car so now you have possessions you've got you've got to have money so you can pay your insurance you've gotta have money so you can you know credit cards money we know that i was informed by a friend last year that i was i was a dinosaur because i carried money in a wallet because he went to buy a sandwich at a place and he pulled it for a five dollar sandwich he pulled out a credit card and they go you're buying a sandwich with a credit card it wasn't a debit card it was a credit card he says yeah everybody does we don't use money anymore i heard in the news that there were some stores that said they weren't going to take money anymore and the government had to tell no you can't do that yeah yeah you don't get to do that you don't get to decide what the currency in this country is so all of these all of these things and there are areas like in japan where a lot of the monks get married here after they've been among for a while you know trained and all that and some in korea and in tibet half of the people that you think are monks or llamas and they're not monks and they can get married and that's cultural that part is cultural that part is not buddhism it's culture so when my teacher came here and we started making buddhists it's kind of like making cookies you know when we started making buddhists instead of saying do not participate in improper sexual conduct which is more like what the buddha actually said because it wasn't just having a girlfriend or a boyfriend there was a whole variety of stuff he simply said do not take the vowel not to commit adultery like if you ever decided you wanted to take the five precepts one is don't commit adultery and i understand your husband's bigger than you so you probably wouldn't anyway but those things are cultural yes they are for the most part the things americans like about japanese buddhism that they like are cultural it's not the buddhism that they like it's the cultural stuff who doesn't like a rock garden who doesn't like a beautiful bonsai and where did you like to go to japan and be part of a tea ceremony that's all cultural it grew out of buddhism but it's still cold so i think we need to start wearing a rope around our waist with three knots on it yes well we're big on trees years ago we used to have high school students come to our temple in long beach and they'd always ask well i see threes a lot buddha dharma and sangha yeah yeah how can we make one more symbol we're so loaded with symbols right now so let's just come up with one more symbol here to make this happen so that's a little trip up is there a difference between a friar's life and a buddhist monk's life very little there's very little difference is there a difference between a buddhist monk's life and a catholic monk who lives in a monastery very little if you compare buddhist monks who live in a monastery with catholic monks who live in the monastery or friars and we travel you and i travel all the time so we're really not cloistered and i'm telling you all you got to do is travel with him one time going down the hill and coming back up where can we get french fries i want to coke we're going to get french fries so that's not an activity of employee street person you need more than one meal a day because we work we do things around here and you've got to have the energy to do it so you eat more thank you [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] so [Music] [Music] is unconsciousness [Music] form no perception conception or consciousness [Music] consciousness [Music] extinction is [Music] he finally dwells [Music] therefore [Music] is he gave [Music] is is [Music] [Applause] [Music] cultivation [Applause] i vow to cultivate humility recognizing the illusionary state where truth is conditional dependent on subjective knowledge i will look at all my opinions and bias realizing that ideas and opinions are conditioned by the sixth senses and the expression of subjective truth and i practice somatic so that i might become a newborn to the light of vow to conditioning poverty recognizing that all things are impermanent i will let go of my sense of ownership over possessions and people realizing that sickness old age and death come to all and that i cannot control my own body i will forgo trying to control others i will practice donna so that i may have no that need opportunity to study the past and enlightenment comes rarely and then for a fleeting moment i will subdue discontent realizing that my master and sangha or as my family i will study within another and potentially i have a practice period so that i may learn the effortlessness of the way how to cultivate harmony recognizing that mindfulness is the foundation of amongst life i will treat each moment as if over my last realizing that my speech actions and thoughts can cause unhappiness and discontent i will guard the doors to the body mouth and mind at the expense of my own comfort for the sake of harmony i will practice casanti so that i may have patience with my own and that shortcomings sage of the shocking clan taught selflessly for 45 years after his enlightenment and that all the ancestors down to my true master

We couldn't do that without some preparation first get two plates and glue a paper pocket to the bottom of each one Place a coin in each of the plates the only thing is that it takes a bit of training to get it. Just right? Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo This easy trick is great for beginner magicians The knot gets untied inside a towel roll What is this is this the power of will nope it's the power of the magic hole? Cut out a small circle in the roll through that hole you should be able to hold the string with your finger Keep it a secret Under which of the cones is the paper ball what about now? Where does it keep disappearing? For this trick you'll need two cardboard Semicircles make comes out of them with the help of some glue the secret is to slightly press on the walls of the cone Gently squeeze the cone and the paper ball will be sucked inside a simple But fun trick here's another simple trick pop balloons with a single touch all you need is an orange peel Rub it in into your finger and go on to impress your friends The orange peel contains a substance that can dissolve rubber in seconds. That's why the balloons immediately pop The bulb lights up right in your hands without any wires or anything How is that possible to be the lord of light? You must first be the lord of the ring We will need an opaque lightbulb carefully take off the base using a knife and some pliers We'll also need a metal base from an old incandescent light bulb we will attach it to the opaque light bulb some additional supplies To 3 volt batteries and LED and a couple of wires. We'll use a hot glue gun instead of a soldering iron Connect everything as shown in the picture Tape the two batteries together glue the long end of the LED to the positive plus side Connect the other end of the LED to the side of the base with a wire Connect the negative - side of the battery to the bottom of the base with another wire Put the base on the light bulb Press the ring against the wall and the bottom of the base This way we close the circuit and the LED shines right in our hands a great way to impress your friends Do you remember that childish trick with the vanishing fingers Well, you just didn't have a magic ring back. Then now it just got real put on the ring ah Where's my finger give it back? Oh? Thank god. It's back Want to try out this trick get a piece of black EBA foam and cut off a slice? Put the ring next to it Hold the prop between the thumb and the index finger done Remember that the illusionist must wear black clothes in order for the trick to work For the next trick we will need the help of physics fill up a bottle with water and place a tennis ball on top Turn the bottle upside down. Don't worry you won't wet your feet because of the pressure difference the ball stays firmly in place even if we give it a little turn a Magic glass that changes the suit of the card, but how does it work? We'll need two playing cards of the same order but different suit Join them together by applying some double-sided tape to their top parts when placing down the glass hold the edge of the outer card with Your fingers the eight of Hearts folds back and the viewer sees the eights of clubs A bit of practice and you can go show off your magic skills to the public Some playing cards and some money That's what we're going to need for our next trick wrap a dollar bill around a card folding its edges on both sides Turn the card face down and unfold the edges of the bill the card ends up inside the bill It looks like it's about to tear apart But the bill stays intact how cut the card in half tape one half to the back of the main card This secret pocket is what allows the car to freely move inside the bill amazing and For our next trick we will need two glasses and a dollar Bank No, turn the glasses upside down fold the dollar bill lengthwise in half Put it on top of the glasses Then tell your friend to push one of the glasses without moving the banknote of course. He's going to fail Let's demonstrate our financial wits by sneaking a coin on top of the end of the bill Wallah the bill stays in place some sleight of hand and just a teeny bit of swindle. What a fun little trick The props for our next trick are pretty straightforward a banknote a sheet of paper and a pencil Place the bank note inside the sheet of paper Then take the pencil and pierce the bill at this point we would ask the sensitive members of the audience to look away But wait no need for that the pencil went through the bill and left it intact The sheet of paper wasn't that lucky though you do understand that this trick needs some preparation in advance with a sharp blade Carefully make a cut in the bill so that the pencil can go through it. That's it. No one will even notice it a cup of coffee and a glass of smoke Please what yes, we want to teach you a new trick and show you how to make liquid smoke Wrap some matches along with a pencil and some foil you should get a kind of a tube Take out the pencil and pinch one end of the tube Place the prop inside a glass and light on fire the side with the match heads The smoke pours out like liquid to the bottom of the glass and stays there You could keep watching it forever. It's very beautiful You can also make some cool smoke rings with this smoke cut a plastic bottle in half cut off the wide part of a balloon and Put it on the half of the bottle with the neck you should end up with a cool instrument for making smoke rings whoever makes the most smoke rings wins Don't let go of the balloon. It'll deflate wait what here's the secret? We'll need a small ball place it inside the balloon and start inflating it turn the balloon neck down so that our plug securely closes the hole And that's the whole trick no one will figure it out unless you tell them yourself in the next bit We'll show you how to make a pendulum candle pierce the candle in the middle with a red-hot needle on the bottom of the candle Clean the wick from any wax Position the candle between two glasses and light both ends at the same time The wax melts and drips from one end making it lighter, and then does the same for the other end a perpetual motion machine Prays the magic but always remember about fire safety What do we have here an ordinary matchbox? What's inside? unsurprisingly matches wait a minute where did this coin come from place the coin between the box and the moving part the coin will fall inside as soon as the Box is closed Open it again. Isn't it wonderful? Don't take away the matches just yet We've got a few more tricks up our sleeve take a match and light it up blow Explicitly on the box and the match goes out do it one more time and again the match goes out by itself The trick is to snap your fingers just at the right moment on the match head to make the flame go out make a lot of noise while blowing to distract the audience if The previous trick didn't work. We've got a trick that works every time Take five matches out of the box and crack each of them in the middle Position them in a star formation and put a drop of water in the center The star slowly opens up The secret is that the water droplets lift up the ends of the matches, and they will slowly drift apart We are going to need a plastic bottle for our next trick show the audience that the bottle is empty Hit the bottle with your palms and suddenly a bottle cap appears inside. Where did it come from? Take off the sticker and make an opening like a small door in the side of the bottle get the cap and attach it inside The bottle with some double-sided tape put the sticker back on now if the cap will just fall down If you give it a good hit Leave a comment and tell us which trick you found the most fun was it the liquid smoke magic lightbulb or maybe the cartridge Don't forget to hit the like

tuesday and i am here with i know some members some people that have watched this channel don't know this name jester styles tom mullinger one of the busiest and most professional hard-working magicians in the whole of the uk somebody i've been trying to get on the channel since i started the channel and he's just been so damn busy tom thank you so much for being here oh craig it is an honor and a privilege i'm still not quite sure you've got the right person it is very early in the morning the energy drinks are on but when you need me i'll be there that's a promise i made you since day one so i'm doing it early we've had to do it early because let's be honest you're so damn busy over christmas everybody else in the uk is either sitting at home in front of a computer doing virtual shows or they're sitting at home doing nothing or they're delivering pizzas and instead you're going out gigging every single day that's why we have to do it now because it's the only time i can get you well i'm here i'm here um yeah i'm very lucky i've worked hard i'm very lucky so thank you for having me that's why i wanted to get you on the channel because this channel is a lot and i know you've watched a lot of the videos we put out but it's all about helping magicians become better and helping magicians get more work and your career has been amazing and i want to talk about it but you are i think it's fair to say at the top of your game uh you know you you go out and you perform all the time the brand you've created not just locally but nationally is you know i go to gigs and people will turn around to me and they'll say oh we've seen have you seen jester styles and you see in jester styles you know you you're doing so many things right and i think that everybody in every country that watches this channel needs to hear from you i mean that's a that's a massive honor to hear and it makes me feel great i am just doing what i do a lot of the stuff that i do is stuff that you've told me to do and i know that you tell a lot of people to do stuff and most people don't listen and that's one thing i've loved about seeing this channel great because now people are seeing the version of craig petty that i knew the one that i met um i met you when you were still very much the the character on the wizard product review uh which many people still to this day do not realize is it was a character um but i met a very different craig i met a craig who honestly cared about the people that he had working with him the people that he met and people are starting to see that now and i'm delighted for it i hopefully don't have to stand there like a bodyguard next time we go to blackpool hopefully people will be nicer to you now but fingers crossed right yeah i i remember we should probably not talk about this when we started now i remember people that would um make threats to you personally on your on your facebook page they'd involve they'd make threats about your family and they'd be like if i see you in blackpool and i just replied to them i'll be in blackpool i'll be sat right next to craig come and have a word because i don't think people realize how how big i actually am and so hopefully we've moved on from that craig and you're now going to have yeah i haven't had any death threats for a while tom so i'm hoping do you remember and we shouldn't talk about this either but do you remember when you um announced that you were gonna give away uh a digital copy of one of your products yes and people were messaging you um if they wanted one and it went it went crazy and i was i think we would drive it i would have been driving you to a gig and people were messing with saying they wanted a copy and you were like oh it's going to take me five days to get through all these and you said to me please do not let me forget because we know how busy you get and how forgetful you are and then you realized that you were watching you were reading a message from someone saying um oh i'd love a copy of your video of your product and when you scrolled up the message before was them accusing you of being the satan of magic and calling you very bad language it's actually attacking your your your wife and you're like why are you doing this and then that's when you started to realize that you didn't actually have to help everybody but i mean i've seen it and i'm glad now that you are here in a new light with a new a new passion uh i think rylan's helped you i think having ryland done he's definitely calmed me down a little bit i will say that the language is better around him so yeah generally generally not always but generally definitely so now i'm over the shock of the amazing intro that you gave me um i am here to speak to you i wasn't convinced i was the right person but then you you said that because my career had started so different and i was like you know what if i can give out advice that helps one more person do what i did then this is a great place to be and i want to talk about that because you see the thing is you you hear so many people that say i got into magic when i was six years old i got my paul daniels magic set and and the bug hit me and i've been a professional ever since but there's so many people that come into magic later on in life and it's almost overwhelming it's kind of like well i didn't start doing it when i was in nappies therefore i i can't become a professional magician and and your journey to being a professional was very different to everyone else is that is that fair to say yeah pretty much everyone i speak to is very different too let's talk about that when did you get into magic i was 28 years old when i learned my first magic trick and a lot of magicians say i didn't get into magic till i was like i had a magic set when i was younger i did some magic and then i discovered girls and skateboarding and then came back to it i didn't know a single magic trick until i was 28 years old i was uh so when i was 28 was a really exciting time for magic on tv foolers had just started the magician show was on dynamo was um was just getting bigger and bigger so it was an amazing time to fall into magic because it was everywhere um and it was watching michael vincent on foolers that got me into magic he did a card routine and once it finished i reround it and watched it again because i loved the presentation and the journey that he took the audience on the story i just realized that i hadn't breathed for the entire time i was watching the show i hadn't blinked for that entire trick and i was like i'm gonna have to get a book of card tricks for for christmas so i can show my friends down the pub that's all that i thought i'd do um you know this but most people may not i don't hide it i am extremely dyslexic and dyspraxic i find reading extremely difficult for me to decide i was going to get a book on anything was monumental luckily shortly after i got a book i realized that dvds were also available uh but yeah i was 28 um when i left my first magic trick and then it just went upwards from there and when did you decide to take that when did you start doing your first professional gig because obviously a lot of people will buy a magic book and that's all they'll do and and they'll never take that leap but you know it felt like very early on you decided that this was a career that you wanted to do so i did my first magic gig when i was 29 i um after learning how to do magic a year after buying a book on card tricks you were doing a professional gig that's crazy so the first one happened by accident the first well no the first one happened because i've been doing tricks to friends and stuff and i've been doing them at the ice hockey where i used to go as a fan and one of the people there said oh were you coming to my 70th birthday party or something and i was like well yeah uh don't they said how much i said don't pay me i'll do it for free and like we can't do that i said tell you what i'll do it for free but i if you enjoy it i'll accept a tip and they gave me a 70 pound tip that was the first fee i ever i ever earned and it went from there and then eventually um it became a regular thing at the ice hockey was my first residency we'll get we'll get to residences in a minute actually let's go back to how when i realized i wanted to be a professional so i discovered magic at 28 i stopped doing everything else uh i start i was a gamer i stopped playing on a stint on the xbox on i stopped going out to meet friends i was just practicing magic i was getting into the magic world i emailed every magician that i could find on google that was localish to see if they did magic lessons because i was struggling to learn from a book um so i i reached out to people and most people ignored me some people came back i won't give any names but some people came back saying like offering lessons phenomenal amounts of money craig you wouldn't believe how much people thought they could they could charge for a lesson especially when i look now at who they who they actually are and what they possibly could have taught the first positive reply came from jamie raven before before britain's got talent jamie raven emailed back before he was a household name and said if you can get to london i would love to spend a day with you and and talk about being a magician and i was like i've never been to london before and i think most people at that point would go i don't want to go to london to go and spend the day with someone but i went um paul martin and jamie raven were business partners at the time i spent a day with them it was amazing they were absolutely putting on a show though they were like they were talking about being a professional magician they were like counting out big caches of big stacks of money as like they were showing off in a good way now i realized that the time after the time they were they were actually running an agency and that money was going out to the performers they didn't have that much income but they did show me that um you can be a magician just by being a nice person they showed me that you don't have to know every single slide i went in as this really eager kid almost at 28 and i was i've been learning the past and paul was like are you enjoying learning the past i was like no it's hurting my fingers i can't get it because i don't don't learn it you'll never need it i've never learned the past then after doing that i got a phone call on my 30th birthday from a friend of both of us keith pearson who we tragically lost this year and keith phoned me and he said i don't want to give you lessons i don't want to sell you lessons i want to tell you about a magic club and he told me about lemington and warwick magic society where he then met me there the week later he gave me a deck of cards he gave me a double backer he taught me a routine um introduced me to everybody and i was like okay this is this is cool there's a community but the funny thing is that night was uh another club visiting lemington magic society so i got to sit there and watch other magicians perform their set i was so excited craig i was i'm going to see real magicians i'm going to see real magicians the first one comes on and i'm like okay i still want to be a magician but i don't do that sort of magic the second one comes on and i'm like oh okay i'm still want to be a magician but and this went on and i remember being extremely disheartened when i left they weren't bad mad magicians but they were all doing the same material as the one before them and it was all very um traditional cabaret stand-up magic it was a lot of change bags and stuff i was like okay well i know i still want to do a magician be a magician and i'll just keep going back to the club so the next lecture and i won't give you the name the next lecture was on misdirection and i was like brilliant this is going to be the real secrets of being a magician and i was the lecture was terrible the lecture i could tell i could tell by the way the room felt the the the energy in the room that it was not a good lecture so i was like okay i'll give this one more go because i do really want to be a magician but maybe maybe um the magicians you see on tv are not like maybe they're the rare the rare crop at the top of the top of the pile the third lecture that i saw was gary jones so you've no you don't know gary jones you've never heard of gary jones you've never seen a magician perform like gary jones and i just sat there mouth open eyes wide i was absolutely mesmerized by not only the magic but the way that he was on stage the way that he was so humble yet so skillful and so funny but he was kind of old and i was like okay you're still out there rocking this so when he said oh i've got some dvds i'll buy them all um eye candy had just been released with iphone 10 on it so i became a student of gary jones i liked his style i liked everything about him and then the next lecture was harry robson uncle harry and harry robson will openly stand up and say in a lecture room that he is a terrible magician but he's an amazing entertainer yeah i like this and he's he's the one that started talking about the business side of it and he was like uh if you really want to be a successful professional magician all you need to do is just be good with people you need to be in the moment the tricks come second and that was the first time i'd ever heard that um and i was like so i just need to be good with people i've i've spent 10 years training i've got mbqs in customer service i i can do this and that's when i really started to think i'm going to be a professional magician and in the first 28 years of my life are the ones when i was little so the first 18 i had nothing i wanted to do i was uh i'd failed to be a professional snowboarder i'd failed to be a professional skateboarder i'd failed to be a licensed uh spray painting graffiti artist i just was just plodding along and for the first time in my life i was like i am going to be a professional magician even when i was still too nervous to perform magic to my friends i knew that at one point if i could get past this initial nerves i was going to be a professional magician it was it was just in my mind there wasn't another another thought in there and then then i nearly quit twice so it got to the stage where i was struggling to learn anything i'd learnt the basics and then i was falling into a trap that i think may push people away from magic i was watching dvds on people that had all these amazing slights and stuff and i was like my this practice was not helping but i will never use that as an excuse because i found a way around it but at the time i was like well i can't do that i can't do that i thought maybe maybe i'm just not going to be very good at this it's so then our magicians struggle with it's that impostor syndrome oh 100 i still get that sitting here um but then i watched a dvd by mark bendel called the unknown and the first trick on that was so simple but so powerful i remember clapping the dvd when i was watching it i was like this is amazing and as that dvd went on i was like this is simple moves but i can make it so much bigger and that got me back into learning magic but more creating magic so um i would look at the stuff that i already knew the stuff rather than focusing on stuff i couldn't do i was like well i can do this and i can do that can i mix them in to make a routine so everything that i made was quite original i'd if if people said to me oh do you know mcdonald's aces no i don't i don't i don't know any of the the named tricks i've never learned them i've never had a magic set so if you want to fool me get a kids and get a marvin's magic set that one where the rope's in the thing and it slides up i haven't got a clue how it works um so i had almost unique original material because i got inspired by mark bendel so his name needs to be in this interview the unknown is an amazing dvd um so do check that out and then i almost quit again when i started to get the negativity from magic clubs the magic club that had been so kind to me and everybody that wanted me to do well when i started to do better than them or to be seen as a business threat or someone that's this this young man that's coming and is now surprising as perhaps they thought that uh the atmosphere changed and i realized that magic clubs can actually be quite damaging because you go and watch a lecture where someone talks in depth about routines that they've been working for 10 years and then you think well i can't do that and you try and practice it for a bit when you get home you think oh it's too it's above my skill level if you start to think everything's above your skill level you start to lose faith in who you are and i was found that i'd go to a lecture i'd leave really deflated and then i'd go to a booking the next day and feel like a rock star again and i'm like oh maybe i should just not go to the magic club for a bit and start trying to learn other people's stuff and work my own so i nearly quit then as well but here we are here you are so right this is this is really really really really interesting so when did you go full time that must have been around about the same time that you met me the 6th of december was when i went 6th of december 2013 was when i went through the gadget show before that right i was i was working on the gadget show so i was working in a very um hostile environment a very you you have contracts short-term contracts in the tv industry and everybody wants to get the next role the next step up so you get told you hear things like uh well if you want to work in tv you will stay here till eight o'clock tonight even though you've been there since eight o'clock in the morning and uh i'd get people say to me like can you make the talent a cup of tea i was a runner and a researcher so i'd gone in as a runner um as a something to do that was a little bit different because i was fed up with working recruitment and sales and i was apparently really good at being a runner so they promoted me to being a researcher in one of those promotions where you don't actually get any more money but you work a lot more hours and you suddenly become accountable for a lot more things but it will look good on your cv i think i've been mugged off here so the more they said to me if you want to work in tv or you should have done this at this point craig i was already a professional magician in my head it was the only thing that i honestly cared about so my work i just didn't care and that's a horrible thing to say but i just i had no interest in being there my heart wasn't there i just said i'm not signing that contract when it comes back up and i'm going to be a professional magician and they laughed um they laughed and my partner at the time cried but we but here we are again so the 6th of december because i'd met you before and this is the bit that i don't know how this happened so please enlighten me because out of nowhere i reckon probably october october or november uh i wake up one morning and it says mark lavelle has commented on your facebook wall or something so i'm like well no mark what's mark said and mark had simply tagged in the name of your old business partner that's all you've done and i was like hello how can i help and then i don't remember what happened between there and me meeting you very nervously in a hotel for a chat um so at some point i don't know how i got on your radar i don't know how it then came to me meeting you but we then met and i had a chat and then i started working for you so how did i get to that chat where did i come on your radar um i'm not too sure the only thing i can think of is that we were really pushing to take more people on in slightly unusual at that point and obviously i knew mark very well because i worked at world magic shop well i didn't work at world magic shop but i spent a lot of time at world magic shop on the wizard product view and he was obviously working out at the same time and we spent a lot of time chatting so i can only imagine that i said to mark hey you know i'm looking for people to join uh slightly unusual i want people that are good that i can help and i imagine he would have mentioned you if he tagged me or russell and he probably would have mentioned you and he probably would have said let me make a connection for you i imagine that's how it was because news me to a few different people john meredith back in the day he introduced me i remember i worked with john i did one of my first gig for you that's interesting though oh good old paul i've worked with him as well uh it's interesting because i i would have never shown mark any magic so mark would never have known me for any magic that he'd seen but i do remember on more than one occasion mark would come down to lemmington magic society and mark did work for world magnet shop he was very well known and i noticed and the reason i'm saying this is to give some some sort of advice in this chat that we've just randomly started that's gone on for far too long already i'm sure mark would kind of float around and people would be like that's mark lavelle that's not the valve and world magic shop and no one would go and like say hello so i went over the first time i met mark i went i was eating sweets at the time i went over offered him some sweets and he was oh thanks very much and we had a chat and it's that that people remember yeah it's the oh you went over and you spoke to them and you were nice and i didn't i didn't care who he was i think maybe because i was already quite old i think i didn't have that uh wide-eyedness that a lot of younger magicians have when i've already grown up and got a mortgage at this point like i didn't have any ideas of grandeur without anybody like we're all people i've i've didn't want to have any hero worship or anything like that so i was like well i'm just going to go and say hello to him then i went and said hello we chatted watched the lecture and then that's probably the only reason that i'd have been on the radar so the advice that i'm trying to get out there is you never know who you're going to meet so always be the best version of yourself in any any situation that you're in but also go and say hello like just just break the ice because life's better when you speak to people um you know one of that's amazing advice you know i think that um we're scared especially when we go to conventions you see like somebody that you've kind of maybe idolized a little bit and um you don't want to go you want to go up to them but you can't i remember the first time i went to blackpool my hero was pat page and i was literally just standing loitering near his booth for about three hours trying to pluck up the courage to go and see him and he eventually just noticed me over there shaking like a leaf and he just shut his stall down for half an hour in the middle of blackpool when it was a one-day convention just shut his stall down covered it up saying i'm gonna be back in half an hour he said hi i'm pat he took me to the cafe he bought me a coffee and he just talked to me half an hour and showed me magic tricks wow okay that is that is the extreme example i was gonna say there's a big difference between going up and saying hi craig love your show have a great blackpool to hi craig can i show you this or my favorite one that i have to walk away when people start doing it would be hey craig i saw that project that you've been working on for the last 10 years and you released can i suggest this change like who the where were you like no no you don't you don't do that but um i guess that's just social skills isn't it so it's but yeah you best stick with you never know who you're gonna meet and always be nice to everyone yeah um because everybody can help you in one way or another it's a good idea to be nice to everybody and yes to try and help everyone because you never know when you need their help the only thing i put on that is always try and help people always be nice to everyone but always be yourself and never never break on what you hold true never break on things that you believe just be yourself and you will things will work out because people are nice good good things happen to good people anyway back on track so i meet you for a coffee and you in russell in um a hotel that was close to you and was nowhere near me i think i'd finished at the gadget show then i'd driven an hour to meet you to drive two hours back uh we got chatting and you were like well go on then show us the trick and i showed you special k by um mark bendel from the unknown dvd and because it's the unknown dvd which is aptly titled he went oh that did is that yours did you create that i was i really wished i did i didn't it's mark bendel from this tv dvd um we got chatting about where i wanted to do with magic he gave me some homework and did we were you performing no you weren't performing there you then said that you had a residency and could i join you on a i think it was a sunday night or something at this residency it was you and russ and you said come on down do some magic with us we'll buy your dinner and we'll have a chat so we did that and i was so nervous but i didn't had a great night and then i got to sit down with you and rest and speak to you um as friends but at that point as people and you explain how the gigs worked and how working for you worked and there's no point in in not mentioning the fact that at that time your reputation wasn't the best uh because the what people may not know there's a big reputation about you not paying people on time but what people don't know is at that point you were working every single day often a close-up and an illusionist show and then it was just you doing the money so if you didn't have a day off then the money didn't get um didn't get paid to people so i had loads of people in my ear saying oh you don't want to work for craig petty and then i was like do you have you've been asked to work for craig petty and they were like no but i wouldn't work even if i was and i was like okay i can see that there's more to this than people not just don't work for craig petty there's jealousy there's people that haven't been asked and then you started to change the business well i think that i think your wife changed the business and suddenly the money was getting um it was so smooth do a gig go and get paid like two days later like it was it was never an issue so i ignored all that i had lots of people saying that you were that you um that you didn't pay well enough and it was just a lot of a lot of jealousy and i think that the fact that i was able to understand maybe because i was i don't say old and old and wise i wasn't i was younger and i was so excited and i just wanted to prove to people that i could do this i wanted to prove to myself that i could do this that when i started jumping in with you i was very aware that i was the last one in so i was the new kid and there was a layer cake so the gigs that you had that were the longest drives i had to do but i understood that so when you said it's a bit of a drive mate it's 2.5 hours to work three hours to drive 2.5 hours home for x amount of money and yeah we know it's not the best fee but it's it's a regular thing it's a big client i was like i'll do it i'll do it i'll i'll i'll drive those drives i'll drive in the rain and the fog to go and find a small venue to go and go and kill it and i did i worked so hard that you would never have to question me if that made sense like i wanted to show everybody in your business that i mean you mentioned some great names there um you've also got people like nemeth phoenix that we're working for you who still is nemo phoenix is one of the best magicians slight wise that i've ever met because not only can he do the skills he can entertain with it as i want to make sure that he knows that i'm good i wanted to make everyone that you introduced me to i was like i want them to when they feed back to craig and say how's the new kid i wanted them to say that guy turned up early he didn't miss a table didn't miss a beat and he and that was it that's what i wanted i was trying to prove to people that i was here for a reason i wasn't someone that thought it would be a good bit of fun i was here to make a business out of it so that happened very early on after we chatted that's december and the new year of 2013 i was professional mostly working for you because i was building my business yeah you were and you were fantastic and i think it was in the february then that you went to blackpool for the first time wasn't it well here's the story then um if you remember it was you said you need to come to blackpool come to blackpool with us and uh i can introduce you to loads of people and it was my mom's 60th so i said i'm not going to be asking i'm not going to make this one i will be at the next one definitely uh and then my i don't know if you remember my mum ended up in hospital for that weekend and you'd phone me just to see you'd heard and you're trying to see how it was and said i'm all right she's um she's stable she's fine she's just in hospital they're keeping her in obviously the party's off um but i'm all right thanks for thanks for checking in have a good blackpool um if you see anything cool like grab me any cool tricks that you see and uh i hung up the phone i thought that was nice it was really nice because i knew that you were busy i thought it's nice that you just checked in and i think this is when i realized that i'm not working for a tv company anymore that doesn't care and that was really nice that they took the time to check in and then the phone went again and it was you and i was like oh has he found what what says he found a cool trick and um you said i'm just checking does that mean that you're not working and i was like oh he's gonna have a gig for me i was like no no i'm not working i'm not doing anything i cancelled the weekend to spend with my mom i can't see her you said right how quickly can you get to blackpool i was like uh i haven't got any money great i've already got the money to said i've got booked your room i've got you a ticket all you need to do is get here it's the least we can do to say thanks for all the work you've done so off i went and i have never driven i've given to blackpool fast but i have never driven to blackpool as fast as i did that night and i just was just there was it i think it might be the saturday night i don't think it was the friday but i was i was there uh as quick as i could get there and you were just there with a with a drink ready for uh with a ticket like i'm really sorry about your mom let's take your mind off it and that was my first blackpool courtesy of you i i i actually do remember that but i didn't remember that at the time yeah yeah yeah i remember i remember yeah and then um then we just got drunk that night and then the next day you introduced me to people and i was like so this is this is a real this is the real uh aspect of being a magician when this this social bubble and at blackpool i met friends friends for life so the other thing that people mean that sounds like a really nice thing to do the other thing that you did for me is if you remember my 30th birth i don't remember my 30th birthday but you may remember my 30th birthday when i'd been pro for about three weeks and i had a big 30th birthday party at the casino in coventry at the rico arena and you came down and did yours you did a cabaret show yeah i don't remember much of it but i know that it went down very very well so yeah it's not true what people say about you mate [Laughter] not true what people say about you well how did how did you go from where you were then to now because now i mean you you you are as i said at the very beginning of this whole thing very very successful you're one of the only and i'm just saying this you're one of the only magicians that's still working in december right now you're working every single day most magicians are sitting around doing nothing you're out doing gigs every single day it's amazing well this is possibly the important but we could probably skip everything that we've just talked about that was probably just you and i catching up in a in a public forum um the important bit to me was i didn't go self-employed i didn't risk everything i had a mortgage at the time to work for someone else so i loved working for you i got i always tell people in the year that i worked non-stop for you i got three four years worth of experience in that one year by doing the one the gigs that other people said oh who doesn't pay well enough or oh it's too long i earned my stripes for working for you i did military bases um and there's two types of military bases you're either working the high end which is lovely everyone's very respectful it's it's almost like a high-end corporate or you're working with boys and uh it's it's a lot of fun but you have to be quick-witted you have to be able to take a take a punch almost and keep rolling and i did both for you i did um small venues i did house parties i did big corporate christmas parties the first one i ever worked for you that were that blew my mind i'd never been to a big big christmas party and it was a ramada hotel christmas party and i turned up with a sharpie and a deck of cards and whatever's in my bag and i walk in and there's unlike 100 tables and i'm like what do i what do i almost turn around and walked out i thought what do i do to see what i can do but i did that for you i've got all the experience that i could take i never turned down a gig i never winged i just kept on going and kept on going um but i didn't that wasn't the dream the dream was always to make jester styles into a business for me into a brand uh and then it got to the point where i was starting to get busier on my own from stuff that i've been doing so i'd do a booking and get another book into a house party get a wedding and it got to the point where i was turning down more work from you than i could take um which used to make you laugh because you just phone me up and go is there any days that you're available next month and i'll be like you can have this one you can have this one um but obviously we i always prioritize my gigs and what was amazing was you always prioritized my business and i remember being on the motorway with you uh driving to a booking with you we had two bookings in one day and they were miles away and we were driving and anyone that doesn't know craig doesn't drive and craig likes to sleep in a car and if craig's not asleep in a car he does this brilliant thing because not only does craig not drive he doesn't understand what driving actually involves now i drive i drive high performance cars and i drive them in a way that high performance cars like to be driven which is fine then it's safe as long as you're aware what you're doing in your surroundings when you've got craig petty with his ipad or his iphone or his iwatch or his eye whatever in his hand and he's watching a magic trailer if you've ever seen a craig petty rant on screen imagine that in your ear while you're trying to drive down a motorway in the early hours of the morning he's grabbing you go look at this is this acceptable would you release this is that even convincing um that is an experience that i hope that most of you never need to survive but while he wasn't doing that you would you would craig you would be giving me advice on how to grow my business knowing full well that that would mean that i'd be leaving yours and as a friend and also maybe a mentor is the right word that's amazing to to take in i luckily i was mature enough to understand that's what you were doing as well you weren't just being nice and telling me what i wanted to hear you were giving me solid advice knowing that i would end up having to not work for you anymore and i listened and i was it wasn't just you i was very lucky with the people that i got speaking to um owen strickland d christopher elliott bibby lee thompson have absolutely shaped my career and i was very lucky to have them to talk to the whole time and it got to the point where my business was big enough where i was able to message you and say thank you for absolutely everything that you've done i will always be at the end of the phone but i need to come off your books because you book up early and then i'll yeah it just it just it just stopped working um so due to your mentorship and the hard work that i was putting in because i'd learned to do it the right way the first time from working for you i was just i was just set ready to go um the business the the business i created i didn't want to be a magician which sounds daft because i did want to be a magician but i wanted the the branding i wanted the the character i wanted it to be a product i wanted it to be more than just a guy that does tricks i didn't want people to book a magician i wanted people to feel like they could book an appearance from jester styles so they weren't hiring a magician they were booking an appearance from jester styles d christopher said to me very early on if you act like a rock star they will treat you like a rock star and i took that to heart and i don't mean that i turned up and acted like a knob and was like neck and drinks at the bar i me i mean the opposite i turned up early i was extremely polite i didn't drink it and that's a you know that's a big bet for me i didn't drink it a gig um i always exceeded expectations and i just treated from the minute that i got into the car on the way to the gig they were going to get the best of me uh no matter what was going on with my mom with my with my dog's health i mean i've worked as we all have i've worked through some horrible dark days but no one ever knew that so i shaped myself working for you i earned my stripes and then i put them to use you really did you really really did and on that subject what advice would you give people about creating a brand because you have done um especially locally i think you focus locally in the warwickshire area you know i go to weddings i get booked to go to weddings and i'll turn up with a van full of illusions and i'll walk in and it's a bit frustrating i'll walk in and people will go oh you heard of jessica stiles have you heard of jester styles and i'll go to another wedding the next week have you heard of jester styles and it's like my god i can't go anywhere in warwick without actually having people go have you heard jester styles and then i'll go to a corporate gig and i'll be doing magic oh you're really good but have you seen jessica stiles yes i know i'm better than him  off are we swearing are we okay well here's some advice for you no that's my internal monologue mate is you give yourself a good name yeah yeah one that people remember um but here's the here's the thing i was skint when i first got into magic i was working in tv which is not the best paid i already had i don't know i'd never talk about figures apart from to my account and that's something that i learned from you craig never talk about money because somebody always earns more uh but i had a mortgage that was nearly a grand of my house is beautiful but i was broke so when i started trying to get into weddings and stuff wedding fares is the way to go but only if you can afford it wedding players 100 200 pounds now i started doing weddings about the same time as owen strickland started doing uh weddings and done an interview on this channel and he spent about an hour talking about wedding fairs so here's the thing right owen he's not going to mind me saying this owen strickland fantastic phenomenal wedding phenomenal performer uh actually he's a slightly better human being than he is performer and that's the probably the nicest thing i can say about him i i love the guy but he had a full-time job with a good salary he was working extremely high in the police while also being a wedding magician so he had money so when a wedding fair came up he was like yeah i'll do that one i'll do that one i'll do that one i was skin so i had to maybe pick one wedding fair a month and go to that and i wouldn't be like i've done four wedding fairs this month i'm not brilliant i've done one i hope it's good um so i had to grass roots it i had to get out there and put my face in people's faces i had to find other ways to do it and that was anywhere where there's people you can show up and i was originally a very street magician branded performer um heavily inspired by our guest dynamo and david blaine and the fact that i used to be a skateboarder i used to hang out on the on the streets as bad as that sounds but i was very much an urban an urban kid um i used to like i like street art i like street magic i like street performances i like spray paint and that that came across in my branding and my and who i was my persona it was me turning up to 11. so i had to get out so i found ways to to get into back doors to venues um if there was a street food event i would be like uh emailing them saying oh do you need a professional do you need a magician to come down and if they said yes and they'd pay me 150 quid i'd go down if they said no i'd go down just wouldn't have been paid i've offered them the services um my argument there is if you pay me they could have me for however long they the booking was if you go down on your own you can do what you want but you end up doing um you put yourself in these situations so the dough and brew is the best pizza place like literally it's won awards for the best pizza in the uk it's in the it's in warwick they had a little street van so pizza's lovely but it takes a while to cook so they're someone replaced their order and i was already smart enough to know that if you mess with people's ordering systems or you delay them you're a hindrance and you're a botherer but if someone's ordered their pizza and they're waiting for it to be delivered and you're like hey do you want to see a card trick everyone's it's a win-win so the guy on the on the vans like mate are you on a free pizza you've been really helping us today so yeah you get free pizza i'll always work for free pizza facts but then they have the conversation like oh do you know we've actually got a restaurant and i'm like i didn't know that is it are you busy how how can i ask what's your wait time because pizzas take a long to cook especially in an oven they're like oh yeah it's 20 minutes i'm like well i could do magic at a table for five minutes to break that weight up and then you start selling what you can actually do like there's a delay you can get in there or you can help people find their seats and suddenly i had little little bookings here and there in restaurants in warwickshire in coventry's not so good like it's just not very affluent so there's not many nice restaurants lemington's nice warwickshire is nice rugby is nice so that's where i targeted i just made that i made sure that wherever people were i was and then i always made sure that i left people that i was as good as i could be i was be so good they can't they they don't forget you or whatever it is um like that was my mission so every time i went to a an event i treated it like a wedding fair uh oh and you can have the wedding fairs and he's done very well but i'm gonna be right behind you and if i have to grass root it and fight and find a way i will that's one thing maybe it's the thing i said i wasn't going to talk about but maybe it is being dyslexic and just practicing you have to find a different way around stuff so i was like well i want to get here i'll just go the long way but i'll i'll do it and i'll never never stop fighting and if it's raining i'll go out if it's cold i'll go out and that's why i did i was so i had such a chip on my shoulder craig to prove people wrong so i was just i was there well you know there is no substitute for hard work and the thing is a lot of magicians and you've heard me speak about this at events they will sit at home waiting for the phone to ring and then when the phone doesn't ring they will blame everything else other than themselves oh the phone's not ringing because of this the phone's not ringing because of that and you know you see it all of the time and up until a few years ago it wasn't too much of an issue because marketing was very very easy you put an advert in the yellow pages and you just sit back and wait for the phone to call but these days that ain't the case anymore you have to be you have to have a marketing strategy whether that be the route i go down which is digital and seo and content based strategy or you do what owen does which is uh wedding fairs or you do what you do which is network and just make sure that everybody knows who you are there's no right or wrong way of doing it but you need to make sure that you've got some sort of strategy other than sitting around in your bedroom waiting for the factory oh absolutely and when i'd say that i was i was broke like i had to borrow money from a friend to do a gary jones and chris congrev course on being a wedding magician which was the best money i ever borrowed but the reason i say that as well is when i went there i can't remember there was probably 15 maybe 20 other magicians in the room owen spoke about this i think he was one of them yeah owen was definitely there and the reason i was there was only owen and i that bothered before and jack there's three of us that performed at the end because everyone else was was too nervous now i was or didn't want to now i was too nervous but i performed and it was terrible i did card to orange the card wasn't the same card in the orange like everything that went wrong could go wrong and i learned so much from that one that one course so there's the other thing as well like the reason i say that is just to say if you're gonna take an opportunity make the most of it if you're looking at becoming a or just doing more with your magic if it can help with any advice it's make the most of every opportunity so i got resonances very early on uh i was a massive i am a massive ice hockey fan uh coventry blaze was my local club i realized that i was going there every week and i'm buying a ticket i said to the directors um you've got these vip boxes there's period breaks could i go up and do some magic i can brand it to the blaze i can get blaze stickers for playing cards and they were like uh that'd be amazing how much would you charge and i was like oh i was going to do it for free but they've mentioned it and then luckily a friend who uh interjected herself at this point she said uh actually well she was a marketing manager there and that's how i met her from different the difference but i had a job and we sponsored the blaze she said actually we're looking for someone to be a corporate host okay that sounds good right so you're going to meet the vip fans the vip guests could you take them to the box talk to them about how ice hockey works because if you've never if you don't know how ice hockey works it takes a while to get your head around and then maybe pop up and do some magic that was like brilliant that's amazing i'll do that and they offered me 40 quid and this was um seven years six years ago and i'll tell you now i still do it for 40 quid like but you love ice hockey you'd be there anyway so here's the thing right you'd be there anyway you're meeting vip guests now okay vip in british ice hockey is not the same as the vip clients that i meet when i do football and rugby but they're local business owners that have got a passion for something so that's good so you're meeting people that are local business owners you're there every single week apart from now when i've got other gigs i not there as often but at the time i was there every single week so i'm performing every single week i'm performing to people that i see regularly so i've constantly got to make up new stuff it was win-win it was just like a dream come true i was i was almost i was on the team pictures i was in the brochure i was on the website so okay my brand looks good they don't need to know at the time that i was brand new so i'm still still going i'm working every weekend to a new audience but if about a warm audience they're expecting me to be there there's a big difference between turning up and interrupting someone's evening to show them some magic to turning up to where people are expecting you to be and they're already looking forward to it that's a big thing it's a big difference to learn and you can play for the strengths of both but it's just that like most magicians would laugh at that 40 quid like well they would say on facebook that they laugh on that but you make the um you make the best of any situation do you remember colin skinner had managed to secure a venue that was offering the stage space to magicians and he said i can get i can get magicians on stage it's a cabaret night to a student audience uh it's 50 quid and he put it on gigshare and magicians were just diving in saying that's a ridiculous fee no one should ever work for 50 quid i was like so it's the stage i get to learn about lighting i get to learn how to use a mic it's a student drunk audience so they're probably going to be really warm anyway and i get paid 50 pounds for learning the experience you couldn't get me on there quicker you came in to do it with me just i don't know why you just needed something to do but just people ask me that i just love performing you know what i'm like i just like to me if i see an opportunity to do a gig you know you know how many gigs we do as a company i i i don't i just go and do it i don't care it's that i learned so i did that um i was so nervous that was one of the first cabaret shows that i've done which is strange now looking at what i do now but that was one of the first ones that i don't know i was so nervous uh i hadn't been nervous for years because i was like i remember that night you were amazing because i'd never seen you work cabaret before and i was like sitting there at the back of the room watch because you went on first and i was on the second half and i was sitting there thinking i've got to follow this my eyes opening for craig petty i mean come on but i was so nervous i didn't i didn't really know what i was doing it was the first staged cabaret that i'd done i've done stand-up shows parlor and i knew i could smash that but you overthink stuff and you don't think in your head well stage is just like parlor but a bit bigger uh so i was so nervous lee thompson said i'm going to come down and see it i'm going to video it um and lee will they will give you the feedback that you need to hear not the stuff you want to hear and i thought i was nervous that he was in the room uh kev g had come down but the minute that the curtain went up and i was on i was on and it was a good show i did a good show and by good i mean that no tricks went wrong the audience enjoyed it and i made the people that join me on stage look good that is the bare minimum that we should be looking for as performers it was a good show you did a great show after but we smashed it together which was nice but more to the point that's a priceless opportunity who else gets to go and practice on a stage in a in a nice safe environment no one but magicians were slagging it off because it was 50 quid now you need to if you want to do this and you want to do it well you need to take these opportunities and i i learned on a 50 pound gig that was the first one that i did i then went to edinburgh so work out that cost to work for elliot bibby to headline which was very nice of him to headline his um magic show that he does in edinburgh magic festival amazing amazing gig because i was really involved in that then in the timing and the pacing he showed me why you have music where you have it i just absorbed it i've just absorbed it i probably made 75 pound there but then i had so much love for being on stage that i was able to write to my own show and when you write your own show and you've got your own theater that you can do it in it becomes your baby you can really get your character in and i never would have had the experience to do that to have the success that that's had without taking the 50 quid and the 75 pound five-hour train journey thing so again i don't know what advice i can really get across here but it has to be just take every opportunity and treat every gig like it's uh a thousand thousand pound two-hour gig in london like treat every gig like it is that level because that's how it will come across a lot of magicians try to skip the steps and what i mean by that is there's facebook groups on facebook in the uk i'm saying this because 70 of the viewers for this are american so in the uk there's facebook groups where you can share gigs with each other and a lot of the time there's a gig that'll come up and it's like two hours close-up magic and a 20-minute cabaret show it's a thousand pounds only apply for this if you've done gigs at this level and you'll see magicians applying for that gig like oh yeah i can do this i can do this and then the next day a gig will come up going it's a hundred pounds for two hours close-up magic and the same person will apply for it and it's kind of like make your mind you can't stick the steps if you are going out at a certain level that's fine but you need to get good at that level and then move up to the next level then the next level and then the next level you can't skip the steps do you know what i mean i know exactly what you mean and i will never be magic famous i don't want to be magic famous i've seen what being magic famous does to people but i will always aim to be respected so i want my if my name comes up in conversation it's never going to be because of a fantastic lecture that i've done or my newest greatest release if my name comes up in conversation i always want it to be a positive because i want it to be that someone's worked with me or has taken advice from me um and that's what i wanted to achieve and i wanted to do that every single step and i have tried hard to do that and i've been very fortunate that that idles to rivals things the people that i started getting to magic watching their dvds and thinking i'd love to be like them next thing i know i'm on a gig with them and you're like how did i how did i get here and then people do remind you like lee thompson's good at reminding you you're very good at reminding me but you've learned it like the imposter syndrome is huge and when i walked into a gig and i it was my gig actually and i had to find more people to do it with me and i had steve della and lee thompson uh steve della is phenomenally what if he's not the only one the most awards you can ever win like most winningest magician i don't know and then lee thompson has done everything everything from street magic to film magic and i had imposter syndrome then and but i realized that i i'd earned not only had i earned my right to be that gig i don't their respect that they would come and work for me uh we did one not so long ago so i don't i don't work with you anymore craig we're both too busy however i said to you if you ever need me i will be there for you and i will always try and uh always try and back you if i if i can uh so i get a phone call from craig which is this is novel because normally it's a message and he's like i've got and you you sounded nervous and you never sound nervous i was like oh you need something you know i've got a gig it's a really good gig uh it's a big it's a big gig you'll love it um it's working with me oh and working with steve della you like him and cyped all you like him i was like craig what is it he said uh it's a voodoo gig that's brilliant yes i'll be there that's that's if people don't people will people won't know that i do a lot of uh voodoo and darker shows but i'm not going to pretend that anyone knows that uh i said hang on a minute what video stuff do you and steve della do and you're like well yeah we're hoping that you could probably do the voodoo and we'll we'll just do the rest i was like okay okay so i was like let me just see who it is let me grab my little my little box and i'll go and do what the booker wants and you guys go and do the rest so it's it's nice to be on the tip of people's tongues when they need something specialist so let me ask you a question you said that you never want to be magic famous and i know that's true however was that always the case because it a few years ago you were doing review shows and releasing products to the magic community and you don't go down that route unless you want to kind of be more involved and and be magic famous because you saw what doing a review show led to me being like yeah i did do you know what that review show i got that was my own mouth that got me into that um so the review show had started and i was watching it and i was like you're boring like with all the love in the world the mark that was doing them i was like i'm bored me being me decided well i'm gonna go and tell him because again the same with mark lavelle you go and meet people so i knew mark trevor sony from the magic club anyway and i went and spoke to him said i've been watching your review show mark and i don't mean to be rude but you're boring like you you don't seem to care about the products and i mean we know why when you're doing a review show you're trying to remember everything you need to say you're trying to remember the camera and he was very new to it at the time but i decided to call him on it and i said something stupid like you need someone like me to come and like do the color commentary to use a wrestling term and i didn't think anything of it but apparently mark's wife had overheard that and she was like actually you know what you're right you do need someone like him so i got the offer to go in and if someone offers you to do something cool um then yeah you're to do it i didn't being magic famous was never was never a goal but doing a review show was cool so yeah uh then i did release i'd released uh there's one one product that's mine that's got my name on it and i've actually been involved in quite a few projects i'm actually involved in quite a few projects now i just want to do that thing where the magicians do where they pretend they can't talk about stuff but i did uh so again the old dear old point of this is people don't know me so i am known in some circles for doing very dark macabre uh tarot reading palm reading cold reading voodoo dolls uh dangerous effects so i did release something to the market it was a close-up trick they involved lego men but it was it was good right craig it's a great trick it's an awesome trick it's a really good trick it was a trick that came out of a necessity so i was doing weddings and stuff and there's kids there and for god's sake if you're doing weddings get the kids involved you will be a star if you can do cards across if you do cards across but you have the kid running around the table you've gone from being a magician to a legend because the kid's excited the parents think that you're amazing because you've made their kid into a rock star and i need more stuff like this but i don't want to break character i don't want to have fluffy bunnies or i don't want to have light up thumbs i need something that still suits me that's still cool and i was thinking this over and then one day at a wedding a kid went can you do anything with my lego and i was like yes so i did i think we had the lego figure found the sign card or the card wasn't the sign card until the lego figure touched it and then it became the sound card but that went in my mind i was like lego's good because often people have lego sets for kids at weddings in the little bags everybody's played with lego adults have a lovely link with lego like everyone if nearly everyone played with lego as a child it takes you back lego's still relevant so i was like right i'm gonna do a trick with lego and then when you spoke with d christopher on this show he talked about the making a trick so i created the the prototypes for the figment i got like six made i sent you one i sent gary jones one chris congresswoman kev g1 and i said to see what you think and it was chris congress that phoned me instead of i've worked this routine it's brilliant the reactions killed i think you've got a great trip there so i thought brilliant i'll just get 100 of these made and sell them some magicians stephen leathwaite uh i told him about it and he said stop he said if you think you've got a good trick now you'll have a good trick in a year's time what you want to do when you create is you want to create stuff that looks good and keeps you full of pride when it's on your shelf five years down the line so don't do anything now play with it work with it keep it you keep it till you own every inch of it and then release it and that was the best advice i'd ever got because the whole point that the whole reason that figment's so magical is it happens twice if that makes sense the the the reveal happens twice the card changes which it goes from okay that's impossible but quite clever to know that is impossible and that came about after playing with it for a long long time um so the best advice i ever got which was echo with some stephen lee freight which was echoed by d christopher and he talked about when they make product to release so yeah i put that out i didn't want to be magic famous when i put that out um but i was proud to have something out because i was proud of it if that makes sense yeah i knew i knew that the product was good and i knew that it was a worker which is why which is something that you learn when demoing a product and working in a magic shop you realize that 90 of magicians if not more are hobbyists and i would say 60 percent have never performed outside of their friends and family so you've got a trick like figment that is not in any way a magician faller and it was never designed to even be slightly falling you can see the moves that you do that you need on the trailer because i knew or we knew that that if that sold it like to a worker it's so simple so you're demoing it and 90 of the people you demo it to go oh yeah i can see how that's done and you're like okay but some of the magicians that did weddings that did kids party their eyes would light up and they go this is brilliant thank you very much and i still get messages now from people that are still working it and sending me videos or or thoughts so yeah that went out still proud of that i'm hoping that my next release will be uh slightly more in tune with my style now but i'm not really planning on anything i don't want to keep releasing stuff um because if you've said if you've seen craig the people that pride themselves on constant releases eventually the standards drop eventually because so what happens and i can tell you this from experience what happens is because you know i've released a lot of products and i think some of the yeah some of them are even your own one or two um the best stuff is the stuff that i released at the beginning flipped out the stuff with the flipper coin key master chop all of that stuff you put pressure on yourself to continually find that next thing and the quality goes down and down and down i've took a six year break from magic and i've carried on creating and if i decided to ever release something else i'm in a situation where i've got so much amazing material but that's because i took such a step back from the magic community if that kind of makes sense absolutely i've um i've got stuff in stuff in mind i've got stuff that i'm very proud of uh i had a i have a routine so in lockdown i wrote a new show um which is difficult to write a show when you can't practice it on anybody and i also challenged myself to write a show that was a non-magic show basically which is another challenge to do in lockdown but one of the routines i came up with i was extremely proud of and then i got one one show between the first lockdown and the second one i had two dates and i've got two shows so i did my original show and then my new one and it's well it's sold out but it's easy to sell out when you've only got a very small audience i have to sit two meters apart but one of the routines i put into that show works so much better than i thought i was so proud of it uh i've been chatting to d christopher he was i can tell you it's now because it's been on the show uh he was saying about bringing about the 1914 i was so excited i was like let me tell you about this routine he's like brilliant tell me about the routine i tell him about the routine and he just confirmed everything that i all the rules i've broken it wasn't ready for a release it was good in my show but it's it's only good in my show because it's written for my show you couldn't take it to the the masses uh he was like you know what if he did this this and this it'd be a product we could release and then he went why do you want to release this this is obviously something that you've created and you're really why do you want to take and i was like why do i want to release it that is a trap that magician that you fall into as a magician you're like this is good well maybe i'll sell it no like keep some stuff back be i don't know just it's it's a horrible track thing that seems to be the the path that magicians take and i think there's a lot to be said for keeping stuff back uh the only option the only thing that would really like to do would be an alakazam uh academy one day that is that is a small goal to have one day well peter and the team over at alakazam are absolutely amazing can we can we talk about alakazam because i have not bought magic for a long time this is this is the channel that brought rylan's love of alakazam to the airways like youtube channel it's well i have to admit that uh that i am an alakazam fan as well so i have not bought magic for a long time i didn't need any magic working in a magic shop you become very uh non-fussed by new releases because basically there's nothing new and you can not much not much takes you by surprise and i've got my own set and i've now got to point where i can work my own make my own routines which i love doing and then lock down here and everything had to change and we have to get socially distanced and we have to get socially distanced quick so i was like oh let me just have a quick look now peter nardi is just one of these people that he's just got the charisma of the gangster and i think because i grew up in coventry which is which is not particularly nice i'm drawn to that sort of thing so when pete speaks i listen so alakazam is one of the only emails that i get in that i actually read and i got drawn in when i was looking for socially distant material to perform on zoom or behind behind in a box which is where i am now um and things like symbol and swindle and i was like okay alakazam's got some good some good stuff and then they start doing their live product launches where you can hang out and it's a bit like being at a magic club but it doesn't smell as bad and you've got your own drinks rather than paying for multi-pack coke cans for a pound each that you're not allowed to resell okay they've got a vibe here uh and then they brought out the collector which i put into you know my halloween set craig it's not it's not a product there's no products in there it's stuff that i've created the collector went straight in okay but i always knew that alakazam were good but i'd never spent much time really looking so all their new releases are coming out and they're amazing then you start thinking well they can't just have got good so i started looking at their back catalogue and i just think their pricing their customer service i am i am an alakazam fan and that is why i've set myself the goal of one day doing an alakazam academy well i think the thing is that peter cares he it's his business it's his reputation on the line and he cares and one thing and i know from speaking to peter one thing that he's very proud of doing is when somebody comes to the to him with a trick to sell it's normally the end product that alakazam put out isn't the product that initially came to them peter will sit down and work shop it and then see if they can adapt it and see if they can change it and see if they can improve it which they did with the collector uh as good as nicolas mavressus is and he is very good uh peter improved that yeah apparently they had it for like a year to work on it which is what we just said with with the figment is it's just nice to see um i mean there must be some magic companies that don't do that and put stuff out straight away and see what happens get the money and not think about it so but um let's not get you started on a rant because i said i would only do this if there was any chance i could get some information across that may help someone else otherwise we could have done this in the pub and uh or in your man in your man cave um but i don't know i don't feel like i've been able to help anybody for a while no yeah well the advice that you've put forth so far is amazing it really is and i think just your story and how you've gone from where you were to where you are now is inspirational tom it really is well we could not sell it mate we could do we could skip all this and put it in a two minute video so if you're watching this and you are new to magic and you're worried that you've left it too late or you're not uh physically gifted enough if you've got any sort of lack of coordination if you struggle to read if you struggle to concentrate  it it doesn't matter you can do it just find your own way to do it and don't take bad advice never take advice from people that aren't out there doing it ignore facebook magicians um look for social proof if someone's telling you how to go and market your business check out how they're doing if you want to see someone that's been successful check out owen strickland or elliot bibby they're they are absolute workers they're the intercontinental champions we often um laugh between the three of us like we're the ones that no one knows who we are we are working like people that think magicians only work weekends or only work saturdays when lockdown hit and we lost all our bookings i'm not a bragger i'm really not but i honestly genuinely work four or five days a week and often multi gigs on those days like i lost everything in lockdown but you just you stay focused you don't the same drive they got me here is going to get me through this so be so good that they can't ignore you act like a rock star they'll treat you like a rock star treat every gig like it is uh one thousand pound an hour gig and be yourself that's it that's all you need to do uh don't take don't take corners and don't get an ego there you go mate we could have done that this morning [Laughter] so here's one last question for you uh before we wrap all this up what's next what what you got planned next because you know you you you you how old are you now tom 37 in january the 12th point in january oh you've been doing this for almost a decade jesus seven years seven years come on [Laughter] what are you what's your plans next what what have you got i know you say you've wrote another show but long term what are you wanting to achieve honestly i've already been more successful than i ever thought i ever would be so every day uh just felt like a bit of a blessing so really um i'm loving loving having a stage to do cabaret shows on so i did wrote one last year i wrote one this year but i feel like we didn't get much out of this year so i think what i'll do is continue to work in confessions which is my show that i wrote this year i'll give that a year's run in stratford-upon-avon probably once a month you can come and see if you can get there and then i think i want to do a tour i want to actually take my show it's very easy to do a show in a city or or a part of the world that you're known i know that i could probably fill out and sell my tickets to my show from doing a wedding and then being like oh guys lovely to meet you today by the way next thursday night i'm in stratford-haven it's just my story my show it's 15 a ticket do you want to come i could do that but to to go on tour and sell tickets where people don't know you that's a challenge and maybe i can take elliot bibby and i talk about it a lot maybe um maybe you but you're you're a hard man to go on tour with because you don't drive and you sleep a lot and you snore a lot in the car but that'd definitely be something that i would like to do um i i'm gonna try and get some letters after my name that's that's the goal for next year oh wow yeah i'm gonna try and get some letters after my name uh you're probably the wrong person to speak to about that they don't like you but i'm gonna uh hey we're we're on speaking terms now i was speaking to them just the other day i am i'm going to go for it i am going to go for it i think it's one thing that i really should have i think uh just to prove just just to be on that level like this i can i can work as hard as i want but you know that's the one thing i can do for myself um i'd really like to say that i can get behind uh the christopher because i'm so excited for his new his new law relaunch um but he's got so many amazing performers and stuff that's coming out i've got nothing really to offer that he can't get elsewhere so i'm going to be a fan for a bit of that i think i'm going to sign up to their mailing list get their things but really as as sad as it sounds i'm going to start rebuilding because we've lost um a lot with the lockdown what does it make possible as brad burton would say you know what does this make possible and what it makes possible is you know there is less competition it's sad there's a lot of magicians that have dropped out of magic that aren't going to come back for one reason or another maybe they've got themselves a job and they don't want to lose the stability of a full-time wage maybe they've just decided that you know they like having a weekend and they don't like running around the country all weekend every weekend but there is going to be lot less magicians and trust me when everything's back to normal and it will be at some point in 2021 uh when everything's back to normal people are going to want live entertainment more than ever before oh hell yeah so building won't be hard for somebody with fire passion drive determination enthusiasm motivation and a willingness to succeed which is everything that you embody well again i appreciate that it's beautiful to hear but again okay maybe it won't be hard but it still needs to be done and i think like you said don't skip a step so i want to go back and just fill up the bank a little bit you know like i didn't work for a year so like with the savings have gone and stuff so just just get back to what i was doing uh i'll tell you one thing that everyone's gonna have a shot because it shocked me getting your reps in like i am exhausted i did what did i do the other day four hours and i was exhausted like remember we used to do like two weddings in a day you do like um wedding breakfast mix and mingle wedding breakfast drive somewhere and do uh wedding evening gig and then drive home nothing i tell you mate that's gonna it's gonna it's gonna shock people well you know that you rang me the other day and i was like i'm in an illusion show with cats uh i haven't done many illusion shows over the last year [Laughter] and i was i was with cat and it was one of those ones where we had to be in london by nine o'clock so we left the house at 4 30. and we had three illusion shows to do man i was almost coughing up blood at the end of those three shows i was dead i was like oh my god i thought i genuinely thought at one point i was having a heart attack hey i was like oh my luckily i had cat so you know there's that but yeah cattle look after you look after you but yeah that's it man i'm just gonna go back to doing what i was doing try and get my life back uh stay positive write more shows learn more stuff uh from a learning point of view um i really enjoyed writing a show that was no magic so i'm gonna go much deeper into my cold reading and perception skills and hypnosis awesome that's so yeah just going to try and be more crazy than i am now before we wrap this all up and we are going to wrap it up now but one thing that you have said over and over again in this whole interview is the importance of having a mentor the importance of finding people that can support you you've talked about d christopher you've talked about elliott you've talked about all these guys i know there's going to be people that are going to be watching this interview that have resonated with what you've said they are in the same situation as you were a few years ago maybe they're struggling or whatever it may be especially with kobid um would they be okay to approach you and if so how would they do that oh honestly i love it when that happens it still shocks me now people contact me about a few things already uh lego men being one um i do a lot of risky magic a lot of uh i don't like using the geek phrase but a lot of razor blade stuff needle stuff smash and stab stuff people always uh like at least honestly once a week and then once a minute at halloween um contact me about that so if you've any questions about that get in contact i've got some really good little just just ways to sell it or drop me a message on instagram is the best way to do it because what's your instagram handle down there what's your website you mean you don't know it's at jester underscore styles i mean come on i don't know but i want to hear it yeah you can get where yes the reason i like instagram is i don't because i keep everything off facebook um i don't put even any my work stuff on my facebook account that's mine my facebook business page is business but instagram is is the best place to contact me and here's another thing about the brand just to go back about making a brand and being a brand um if you've got a branded instagram this is just my opinion and i'm going to speak about it with passion but if you've got a branded instagram keep it branded so i know people that have got their instagram where they're talking about gigs that they've done but then they're also tagging in producers of tricks that they've bought like oh i can't wait to well you just told your audience where right you can't go and get a standing ovation for turning water into ryan on a saturday and on sunday be like oh look at this great trick that i bought from uh alakazam like you need to have a cut-off point and also uh don't put like back in the gym or um here's my dinner like create hype so use your instagram as a way of getting your character across and if you if you go to the gym a lot then one of the reasons you may get booked is because people like the fact that you you fill a suit well so put a bit in but don't don't put it too personal just keep it about your brand um i did it when i first started i did it too much i was just trying to put across the character that i wanted to be and now i use it just as social proof so i have wedding photos i have um any gigs that i've done it's great to network with photographers but you'll never see me like put a photo of my uh my new trick that i've bought or my car or going out like just just keep in mind that the story you're trying to tell with all your social media i think is what i'm trying to say in a in a weird way that's true and just that you know how passionate i am about marketing it's a mistake i made recently because when i set this youtube channel up originally it was set up and the slightly unusual and i realized very quickly this needs to complete rebrand because this is just not appropriate for the youtube channel that my clients are seeing which is why everything changed over to magic tv and it's why we changed everything and rebranded everything for that very reason yeah start with magic shops or um card companies would be like like and share this status in your story on instagram and try and win 200 pounds worth of magic i'm not no i don't i'd rather not have 200 pounds worth of magic and keep some sort of mystery of of how i do what i do so it's just it's just something i'm passionate about most people will just laugh it off but i like to think that at least for a split second uh the character that people are seeing me become has some sort of magical powers or mystery mystery powers even if they just think it for a split second then don't go oh infinity war an 85 pound from alakazam so yeah i completely agree with you and tom it has been absolutely exceptional i know how busy you are i want to say thank you so much for finding the time to come on the channel uh genuinely i know that you get impostor syndrome but genuinely you're an amazing guy and i think that a lot of people that are going to be watching this interview are going to be inspired by hearing you speak thank you so much i i don't think that uh they will and i think that when you edit this out and take the junk out it'll be about 13 minutes long of me telling people not to put photos of themselves of their gym workouts on instagram but um this is this is it this is as human as as we get this is you and i chatting i have been extremely lucky in my journey and i worked extremely hard to be that lucky so i just you don't have to be um magic famous you don't have to be well known to make a very good life for yourself doing something that you enjoy i disagree with the whole luck thing i think you make your own luck i think if you were sitting in your living room all day waiting for the phone to ring then all of this stuff that happened to you because you were lucky wouldn't have happened all the stuff that happened through luck happened because you're out there busting your ass about uh busting your ass telling everyone about just deciles number 13 and building a brand that's why that happened it wouldn't be but only because of the work that you put in unfortunately craig petty because my brand is built around luck and i have a show called origins which is all about luck i have to disagree with you there and say that look is the title but i do i do know the point that you're making yeah like you make your own look and the harder you harder you work the luckier you get but um i think just by i think the advice there's the two minutes maybe of solid advice that i did give have made the best of every opportunity and that's it that's that's that's the secret isn't it just just go out there and be yourself and have fun so who knows who thought that i'd be here chatting to you about this i still like used to drive home i used to like they've all starts but i would drive home thinking this is my life and this took a long like five years i pro i would say until i was convinced myself that i was doing this um i drive home from a wedding and being oh that went well oh well maybe or maybe i will we had to do this as a job and i'm not hang on i haven't i haven't made any money from anything but magic for for five years so it's uh it's still a dream it's uh yeah you're great you really are you're awesome well this is mostly this all started off with your most of this is your your creation i just right uh you described me once as being a mixture between um how did you word it if lee smith met d christopher you'd get jester styles uh but another thing that that's just reminded me when we met if if lee smith and g christopher banged the resulting love child would be just the styles that was the wow that was how you would it yeah that's that's a craig petty sentence right there uh the other thing that i will say is something that i've just reminded myself of is when we were filming um a video a show reel or something for slightly unusual that i was going to be on you pointed out you laughed and said like that i'd arrive like this and we'd have a laugh and i'd just be lounging around on the seat waiting to go and then i'd go and get changed and get my suit on and then i'd walk out and you'd be like tom walks in jester styles walks out and there's a physical difference between me and jessica stiles and i don't mean i'm like some over-the-top pantomime character although that may work for most people it doesn't work for me but there is a physical difference in the way that i act and i stand and i look and i interact and who jester styles is and my partner came with me to do a wedding fair once it was a big uh two-day alternative wedding fair where you make your stand up it was it was wicked but find your niece and you you'll find something like that and she'd never really seen me perform in i'd shown her magic but she'd never really seen me as jester styles before and she said it's a physical difference and i think that comes when you are really comfortable with who you are and who you're betraying then it becomes second nature and i think that's when you nail it i think that's when you can be like i've found like no one else can do jessica styles as well as i can do jessica styles you can be a better magician you can be funnier you can be better looking you can be quicker with coins you can be more smoother with cards but you can't do what i can do the same way that i cannot do what craig petty does when he goes on stage as an illusionist the illusionist craig pay the arrogant um quick witted aggressive craig that you become on stage no one else can do because you do that without becoming threatening like you play the heel and the audience wants your magic to go wrong and not that i've seen your show a lot of times but the audience want your magic to go wrong and you're you're personal on stage with you that they want them to do well but you do it without people actually hating you and i don't know i wouldn't be able to do that i've even got to be a dick i'll be nice um d christopher when he does if you've seen his penguin lecture when he comes out and he's sipping his whiskey and making like little little cut off jokes no one else can do that so once you find your own thing that suits you find your character then you never have to worry about not being as good as the next person because you're different to the next person i will work next to anybody you put me in especially close-up uh idols to rivals but i've worked with some of the people that i used to well i still do admire but i've worked next to them the table next to them and i've not even thought for a second that i can't compete with what they're doing because i know that what i do is the best i can offer and once you get that that takes a lot of the impostor syndrome away because you know actually you know your stuff it's yours you've made it your own you can tell your own story and people love it so just i don't know where i was going with that but around finding your character well i this is this is going to add another 40 minutes you're gonna have to edit that hell out of this um i started off thinking that i was gonna be a lot different than i was so i when i got into magic like i said i was 28 and i was already trying to be something that i wasn't i was already trying to have a real job and a real career so when i got into magic and found actually i can play with this i can get my persona across i started off really dark and really serious and i guess i wanted to be the next i don't know de christopher that sort of stuff because that was a natural interest to me and tarot has always been a natural interest to me but then as i started to perform that way i realized actually i'm a nice guy i like having a laugh and it kind of balanced out a little bit more and then i was like okay i really enjoy the street magic side of it and the dark magic side of it but then i also enjoy borrowing people's ring and make them disappear so i sat down and i was like okay so we've got jester styles and this may sound really daft and 90 of the people are watching this and some people will physically laugh at their screen now and if you laugh at your screen now that's great but this message is not for you and it'll do you no good but i sat down and worked out who is jester styles where did his power come from how does he do what he does and some of you will be laughing and thinking that's the most geeky thing i've ever heard and some professional magicians if they're watching this would be like what what a just buy a trick that's that's um works well in the real world and and perform it like rubik's cube magic's popular why don't you do no i need to i worked out what suited me and where i had it i stopped calling myself a magician i started calling myself a magical entertainer and mystery artist i love the phrase mystery artist unfortunately it's used by a lot of people now dee's got it tattooed on his hands so i don't really try and use it that much because he's kind of he's got a tattoo so he's like he's gone that next level but i was like that's i've worked out what i could do is just decide what jester styles could do you will never see me with a rubik's cube because the minute i walk out on the rubik's cube it you you're not going to believe it like even if i physically learned to solve one and did it for you you'd be like that's probably a trick because i either dress like this or i'm in just a stars mode and neither of those neither of those patterns suit um suit of rubik's cube material or any extremely like number squares you'll never see me do a number square i know that a number of squares done well is incredible it's not it's not a jester style style trick um so i just sat down craig and worked out exactly the story i wanted to tell and how i was going to tell it and i like to think that it goes well it now gets to the point where people message me even my partner messages me and says i've seen this it would really suit you and if someone knows what suits you then that means actually what they know is the story you're trying to tell and i think that's huge so it's very interesting that i did an interview on this channel as well with tom crosby who is the polar opposite of jester styles that the performing nerd and jester styles are probably opposite ends of the spectrum but the advice that he gave is almost identical to your advice except for saying i would never do this trick this trick district you'd see me with the rubik's cube but the concept of he's very selective about his material because he knows his character and because he knows his character he knows what his character he wouldn't see um tom crosby doing you know voodoo stuff and stuff like that but it's it's exactly the same advice but just in a completely different way which shows that the advice works no matter well there may be one very good reason for that and that is because uh i am i am lucky enough to call tom crosby a friend and i don't just mean that we speak on facebook if i phone him now he will he will answer the phone knocking things over now um i am lucky enough to call tom cosby a friend to the point that like he's if i phone him he'll answer like we speak often his show that he did at blackpool uh his his geekism chair not geek isn't that that's jonty his show that he did at blackpool that he did at edinburgh fringe just inspired me so much that when i wrote my latest show confessions it was based around the advice that he gave me from writing his show which is probably the advice that i have just given back to you then but yeah so the the thing is that i realized was when i was writing um confessions i was like oh i really like this trick maybe i could squeeze that in and then the advice that tom was always like don't squeeze in a trick just because it's good like you learn i don't know let's say symbol from alakazam beautiful trick and i was like i could do something like that and and he was like don't squeeze something in just because it's good so tell your original story and i was like you're right you are you are correct so tom crosby that is definitely tom crosby's advice reimagined in my mind and given back to you so yes thank you for credit checking me there uh but that goes back to it find you try find people that you can work with and you can bounce ideas off because i've learned a lot from tom crosby who i'm so glad he did this show uh i haven't seen it so i guess it hasn't gone live yet it's not gone live yet when when there's a lot of love you do a lot of material a lot of videos so i don't watch them all but uh some things i do look out for d christmas i watched instantly toms i watched instantly owens i'll watch instantly uh so you've got some good people coming up i still don't know there's me people are going to be disappointed i feel like we should give away something to make it up to people there the amount of people that i'm interviewing for this channel i've bumped david regal david regal i've bumped now four weeks in a row like and he's my favorite magician it's just crazy i think i think i think we should give something away craig to make people watch this i think you should find one of your many dvds on a shelf and we'll give it away with somebody make let's give something back so i feel like we should probably stop talking because every time you give me we just talk randomly and i don't think we've actually really achieved anything here but then it's an amazing interview i'm not so sure but uh please do let me know on instagram if you've watched the entire interview and i'll uh i'll look forward to seeing you soon craig absolutely and i've actually yeah i've actually got to get ready to go to work i mean i know that i know you've broken i know you have i'll wrap this up guys thank you so much for joining us if you're watching this on

afternoon this is um southport armchair history and i'm liz fuller from the southport historical society and i want to be sure and thank the library and the friends of the library for helping us spread the word about these programs so today's topic is southport's frontline workers and the spanish flu and i'm especially happy to be doing this presentation during women's history month and to share the stories of some of the less well-known heroes of world war one i do want to say up front that in this presentation i'm going to be referring to the pandemic of 1918 as the spanish flu and that's because that's what they commonly called it at the time so since then medical researchers and historians have determined that the flu did not come from spain and that it was inaccurately and unfairly named that and it's actually quite possible that it came from kansas so if you want to know more about the whole story of that previous pandemic and you haven't seen my other presentation on southport and the flu pandemic of 1918 be sure and watch that and it's available on our facebook page so i also want to thank the friends of the fort caswell rifle range for their help in putting together this presentation they have done extensive research on world war one and on the local nurses of world war one and without their um their research i would not have been able to put this presentation together and um i saw norma eckerd the president of the friends of the fort caswell rifle range is on this paw so i'll introduce her to you um and can we put all the um bob can you put the mics on mute just individually so we don't know what's happening here i'm not sure how you can do that bob can you meet the mics denim okay all right i'm back okay um yeah if everybody could try and keep their mics on mute that would really help if you want to ask a question that's great take it off but otherwise it causes background noise okay so now we're gonna start all right in april 1917 woodrow wilson appeared before congress to ask them to declare war on germany in order to keep the world safe for democracy the war had already been raging in europe for three years but german subs had begun attacking u.s merchant ships and the us could no longer retain any semblance of neutrality what most people don't realize is how terribly unprepared for war a country was in 1917 the u.s army consisted of 100 000 active duty men with another 112 000 in the national guard there were only 400 nurses in the military and another 8 000 in the red cross reserve so to see how that stacked up against other countries here's a chart showing their the relative countries military strength the us military would have been between belgium and montenegro which is one of the reasons that germany didn't perceive us as a threat they thought they could win the war before we could manage to pull together troops and get them sent to europe for action so we would have been right about whoops right about there okay but two months after war was declared the u.s held a selective service registration all men between the ages of 21 and 30 were required to register drafting began soon after two more registrations were held in 1918 to add to the draft pool while the army could and did expand the soldiers through the draft it couldn't draft nurses it had to rely on volunteers only women who volunteered went into the military and once in the military only women who volunteered went overseas now nursing was very new to the military there had been unofficial nurses who participated in the civil war and contract nurses in the spanish-american war but the army nurse corps was a new division it had just been created in 1901 so 16 years earlier um it was created after the army saw how important nursing was to the spanish-american war effort and navy nurses were even newer having been established in 1908 so just nine years before the war since nursing was a new faction of the army they had no direct method of recruitment so instead all recruitment was through the red cross so nurses who registered with the red cross indicated whether they would be willing to enlist in the military if needed and then when the military asked for more nurses the red cross reached out to their list and asked for volunteers so being a red cross nurse didn't necessarily mean that you were part of the military but if you were a military nurse you were also in the red cross so the red cross worked hard to recruit members especially nurses some of it was through word of mouth but a lot of it was through recruitment posters and as you can see they were not subtle if i fail he dies work for the red cross and even less subtle if you fail he dies their campaign was very successful by the end of the war more than 20 000 nurses were serving in the military overseas up from the beginning of 400. so red cross recruiting was not just limited to nurses during world war one over 20 million people became members of the red cross and 8 million u.s women served as volunteers so to be clear that wasn't 8 million nurses it was about 8 million volunteers and about 24 000 military nurses so you could be a member of the red cross where you gave money you could be a volunteer and you could be a nurse so um the other members were they were volunteers they were donors they gave donations of approximately 400 million dollars in money and materials to support the war effort in addition volunteers rolled bandages and put together care packages they donated books and stationery and supplies for the soldiers in stateside camps they sent food to the soldiers at home and overseas they sent clothes to refugees in europe and they knitted socks and hats for the soldiers and i don't have the exact numbers in front of me but i have to say southport um overshot their money target like they had a target of how much southport was expected to give and they gave more and i think it averaged out to 30 dollars per every individual in southport which was a lot um there was very much a feeling of patriotism and a desire to help from almost all women in the united states in southport there were two red crosses one in the white community and one in the black the black red cross helped out on selective service day and they registered black men for the draft in the white community the southport women's club helped register the white men by march of 1918 the white southport red cross had 300 members which is astounding considering the size of town so here are some of the local southport women who trained as volunteer red cross nurses now they were not heading overseas but they could help um out locally with first aid and and back filling for the nurses who would left the country so about one third of u.s nurses did go overseas leaving a gap back home so one of the military nurses that went overseas was from southport she was a woman named susan adkins williams susan known locally as miss susie was born in southport in 1879 and her family lived in this house on nash street now susan's family had deep ties to southport her father was a veteran of the confederate army a river pilot and he had served as a southport alderman and he was an influential businessman in southport so this photo is a meeting of um confederate war veterans from brunswick county so it's possible her father was one of the men in this group but um but we don't know for sure susan's mother's family also had deep connections in southport she was an adkins the sister of captain j.j adkins and captain e h adkins who were both cape fear river pilots so this house belonged to her brother captain j.j adkins and his wife and you can see where her aunt and uncle's house is positioned on bay street and davis street near the garrison so her other uncle captain e.h adkins and his wife lottie lived across the street um from susie and her family so this is lord and nash street their house might be familiar to you as it's now a bed and breakfast known as the robert ruark inn so robert roark was the grandson of susie's uncle captain atkins so the man who lived in that big house it was his grandson he was also a celebrated novelist so rurik memorialized his grandfather who lived in that house in his autobiographical novel called the old man and the boy so as her uncle's grandson rorke was miss susie's cousin so her cousin was known for his adventurous lifestyle which he documented in his books and magazine articles and that adventurous streak must have run through the atkins side of the family because when the opportunity arose miss susie didn't pass up a chance at adventure as a young woman susie moved all the way from southport to brooklyn new york where she attended the long island nursing college at the age of 29 she graduated with high honors and this is her graduation notice that was put in the paper along with an article saying that she had graduated with high honors and then this is the hospital where she attended school and later worked it was eight stories high and is considered the first skyscraper hospital in the world after graduation she rented a room in a boarding house and worked as a private nurse in brooklyn shortly um whoops oh i'm missing a page so let me just tell you her um her mother got sick and developed stomach cancer and so susie came back to southport and she nursed her mother until she passed away and i don't know what happened to her um her picture so anyway um she did that she took care of her mother and then she passed away and then shortly after her um i'm sorry shortly after her mother died a call went out for nurses overseas um france and england were begging for nurses but with the war going on they couldn't afford to take just anyone they needed nurses who could hit the ground running and actually be of help without a lot of training so they requested graduate nurses like susie and so at the age of 38 susie's adventurous nature called to her again she left southport and she returned to brooklyn where she promptly volunteered with the red cross indicating that if her country needed her she would come so just about that time a brooklyn-based nurse named francis van ingen was frantically looking for well-trained unattached nurses who could drop everything and leave immediately for france she was putting together the staff for the first navy hospital in france where she would be head nurse van ingen had been chosen to head this camp because of her education and experience she was a graduate of the brooklyn school of nursing only six months after the war broke out in europe she had joined a red cross unit stationed in northern france she was part of a 10 nurse unit sent over from the united states to join existing british medical staff and there she nursed british french and belgian soldiers in a hospital converted from a boy's school she stayed on at the hospital for a year working from february 1915 until her return to new york aboard this ship the ss espana in february 1916. so now it had been a year and a half and she was heading back to france and this time with the american navy nurse corps so part of the navy and she was going to be chief nurse of navy base hospital number one in breast france so although we don't have a photo of van englund we do have a photo of the trench coat and hat she wore during her time as a nurse with the navy nurse corps in world war one both of which are on display in the smithsonian so it may seem kind of random to look at her trench coat but this was a very important item for nurse van ingen according to the donation paperwork this trench coat was used as a coat by day and a covering by night so they must have used that if they were you know out in the cold they didn't have enough blankets or they needed to be protected from rain trench coats were so useful to nurses during the war that many described them as their closest friend van ingen maintained a diary during her time in the navy her entries are an invaluable source of information about the life of navy nurses she wrote about her assignment to staff the first navy hospital in france and this is where she recruited susie she says at noon on september 11th while i was stationed at the united states navy hospital in brooklyn the commanding officer told me to have 40 nurses ready to sail for france in two days it's still hazy in my mind just what did happen during those two days kind people helped me phone others loaned their automobiles or ran errands themselves the red cross stretched forth its mighty arm and the full equipment including the uniforms appeared so what nurse van ingen is saying here is that in addition to helping supply the nerve while supplying the nurses it was the red cross who supplied the uniforms the army did not have the capacity to produce all those uniforms so in many instances it was the red cross that provided them and it wasn't until 1922 three years after the war ended that the red cross was reimbursed for their expenses so originally the nurse uniforms were supposed to be white but in france it was almost impossible to keep white uniforms clean so instead they switched to gray uniforms with white aprons cuffs collars and caps which were a little easier to keep clean plus they could have multiple um you know caps and multiple cuffs that they could interchange and keep their uniform looking nicer longer their outside coat and uniform were supposed to be olive drab green a wool fabric just like the soldiers wore but all of that fabric was going to make uniforms for the soldiers and there was a shortage so nurse uniforms were changed to a dark navy blue which has now come to be associated with nurses so then ingan's diary entry continues on september 14 1917 the unit left grand central station it was early enough in the war for our uniforms to be new to the public so they must have turned a lot of heads as they were walking along a regular officer the navy dr ellis von wendiken who you see there with dr vickery took charge of the unit our destination was the navy yard at philadelphia so that's showing that there it's not very glamorous looking and we walked from the train to the uss henderson it was the first time officers and crew had ever had women traveling with them and the nurses found things as interesting as the crew found us there we go the following sunday evening the sixth division of marines came aboard about 1500 men under major hues comparatively few of this division lived to come back two-thirds of the officers were killed after the armistice colonel hughes passed through our hospital on crutches on his way back to the united states a mere shadow of his former vigorous self so here's our entry from the morning that when they when the ship pulled out she says monday morning we slipped from our moorings out between the men of war in our convoy was the cruiser san diego with its great observation balloon which was up most of the time two destroyers a tanker and two transports the finland and the antilles so what she's talking about is that the ships were traveling in a convoy to make them safer from submarines when they when they a ship was traveling by itself it was a more of a target from submarines than when they were in a whole group and they would move across the ocean in a zigzag pattern which also made it harder for the submarines to target them but it also made their progress slower so imagine how that must have been for nurse susie and the other nurses one day they were working as nurses in private hospitals and then the next they're informed that they had been selected to join the military and head overseas they had almost no time to make a decision about what to do let alone say goodbye to their family and their friends they had to scramble to find a way to secure their belongings to keep them safe until they returned to give notice to their jobs and their landlords to cancel their bills their magazine subscriptions to gather their important papers together to find new homes for their pets um just to leave everything and everyone they have ever known and then within two days they were on a ship on the ocean heading off to war surrounded by strangers some of the girls had never been away from home before miss suzy had at least had the opportunity to travel a little in her life having moved from southport to brooklyn and she had spent some time living on her own in a boarding house but in many ways she was still just a girl from southport heading off alone to a great big war in europe so nurse susie and the other women arrived in a foreign country that had been devastated by war for several years they didn't know the language or the customs or the area and even though they were experienced nurses they had no experience in the military or the military way of getting things done so in this picture these are the actual nurses from that hospital um i counted up and i think there's about 27 nurses here there were 40 in the original group so we have a little better than 50 50 chance that one of these nurses is miss suzy nor susie but i we don't know which one then ingan's diary entries give many details of their grueling experience at the base hospital it had inefficient heat inefficient water there was a cesspool there were numerous mice and rats and maggots and flies and just unsanitary operating conditions the main building of the hospital which you can see here was four stories so that required multiple flights of carrying stretchers and food and water and coal and excrement she also writes of serving in field hospitals at the front lines and of experiencing gas attacks so despite her challenging circumstances nurse susie wrote home to southport and she told them to be sure and let her know of any brunswick county boys who were sent to france so that she could look after them with particular interest and care if need be if susie and the other nurses needed any confirmation that they were putting themselves at great personal risk they only needed to hear of the plight of their ship convoy as it made its return trip to the united states despite taking all the same precautions they had taken on the way out their convoy was attacked by a german u-boat the antilles one of the ships that traveled with them was torpedoed and 67 lives were lost that loss of life was the first case in the war involving a large number of american casualties this attack could just as easily have happened on the convoy's trip to france and their susie could have been one of the lives that was lost so two months later in november 1917 the southport women's club packed a christmas box to send to nurse susie in france and i was really pleased to see that southport was remembering this poor motherless girl who had relocated to brooklyn before heading overseas and although i'm sure that it helped that her her aunt was the treasurer of the civic club so the fact that they were sending this box was written up in the newspaper and i was really excited for her and i imagined how pleased she'd be with all sorts of wonderful treats from home so i was a little bit disappointed when i looked in the minutes of the women's club and discovered that they had decided to send handkerchiefs i'm sure handkerchiefs were very useful especially in the time before kleenex had been invented and i'm sure that they were very much appreciated by nurse susie i was the one who was a little bit let down and i don't know what i expected to be in the box but not just a handkerchief so i'm hoping that maybe with the handkerchiefs they included maybe some cheerful little notes and cards and letters and some candy or something so chief nurse van ingen continued to document their experience in the war she wrote about the heartbreak of some of the u.s troops arriving in france already too ill to join the fight so in december 1917 she wrote our most serious cases were the measles and meningitis especially the measles cases coming from the transports the transporting of them from the ships to the hospital proved fatal to many so what she's talking about is these were men arriving from the u.s who already were sick with measles or meningitis it's likely they hadn't shown any symptoms before they got on the ship it took you know a week and a half or so to get across the water or somebody might have been i have had it when they came on board and then they passed it to um to some of the other men on board because it was very crowded conditions and people were coming from all over they didn't have a natural immunity to the germs um that were being brought on board so um so then she just saw all of these people being sick she said they were carried from the ship to the lighter from the lighter to the dock from the dock to the ambulance and from the ambulance to the hospital it sometimes took from six to eight hours to accomplish this she said at this time those lighters were just uncovered boats mere barges so that these sick boys were exposed for hours to the cold and the rain so it's interesting that nurse fan ingram was writing about the loss of life due to measles in december of 1917 because at the same time back at southport colonel chase who was the commander of fort caswell was fighting his own battle with the measles outbreak so it appears that there was a concern over a measles outbreak in wilmington so the colonel declared a quarantine for caswell soldiers they were not allowed to travel to wilmington and this caused quite an uproar among the families of wilmington who wouldn't be able to see their sons at christmas because this was about a week before christmas so as you can imagine colonel chase was trying hard to keep the boys safe knowing that if they shipped out and then came down with measles it's likely they wouldn't survive but it's just another example of the challenges in public health administration of trying to safeguard citizens from dangers while also trying to allow for their personal freedoms so in this case the soldiers were used to following orders but their parents especially their mothers were not so fort caswell had been one of the first locations in north carolina to receive troops because it was already an existing camp the first men to be sent there were the national guard and they were followed very quickly by new recruits these are the barracks for the enlisted men now the fort was built to accommodate about 450 men the average amount stationed at the camp during world war one was between 1200 and 1500 so several times the amount was built to hold the overflow were put into trends until more barracks could be built in the summer they dealt with heat and snakes and mosquitoes and sand spurs and the winter wasn't any better the winter of 1918 was one of the coldest that was then on record in north carolina so the tents were heated with these they're called them sibley stoves and they were left over from the civil war this is the headquarters and then the the hospital is building in the back and these are the newly formed troops who until recently had just been regular working joes these particular troops that you see are lucky because they have uniforms the very first troops to come through were asked to bring some tan pants and some boots if possible and if they couldn't afford those they were asked to at least bring a change of pants and some underwear and socks because it would be at least two weeks before their uniforms got there now i recently learned of some letters written by a soldier named russell ernst who was stationed at fort caswell for the first half of 1918 and these letters are in the north carolina state archives he wrote these letters to his dear friend helen petty and in one letter he describes some of the challenges of serving on oak island he said he wrote i guess that'll have to spend my summer here among the sand spurs fleas and gnats if i do i shall have to learn some new cuss words from someone for my present vocabulary is entirely inadequate to express my sentiments when i'm standing at attention during guard mount or parade with about 27 million gnats in my eyes and ears and a similar amount of sand fleas working into my shoes and leggings so there's some insight into what life was like for the sake for the soldiers because the us had committed to build up its troop presence so quickly there was an urgency about the soldiers stay at fort caswell that year they were desperately needed on the battlefields of europe therefore the training had to be hurried and intense because of the rust experiences the men weren't always fully prepared for what lay ahead of them in europe of course the government was continually doing whatever it could to improve the training of the troops in january of 1918 the united states war department proposed the construction of a rifle range adjacent to fort caswell to be used for small arms training of soldiers destined for overseas duty so this is not a picture from the fort caswell rifle range but it's one that's very similar and the targets you can see in the background are on a mechanism that's operated by a soldier who's down in a protective pit trying not to get shot he would cause the targets to move up and down to make them more challenging to hit and then arm start the soldiers who were several hundred yards away uh north of the structure would then attempt to shoot the targets so in another letter to helen russell ernst described his own experiences after spending a couple of days training recruits on a rifle range at fort caswell he wrote just a present my head feels like it might be as large as a barrel and my ears ring like firebells have been on the rifle range for two days trying to teach a bunch of rookies how to shoot and my con the continual banging of their guns in my ear has temporarily deafened me until i can scarcely hear a person speak in an ordinary tone of voice we'll finish up tomorrow and surely we'll be glad of it so i hadn't thought about it but when you look at this picture of these men at the rifle range they're they were just wearing their regular hats they're not wearing any kind of safety equipment over their ears like you wear it at gun ranges now so i that would cause a lot of pain and hearing loss he also shares um he shared with helen his own scores and target practice on the rifle range and with some of the artillery and apparently his scores were pretty good because he was he was proud of them now ernst was born in ohio but he grew up in south carolina and then he'd been living in asheville north carolina for a few years and that's where he enlisted from so he didn't really consider himself from being from north carolina and he's so he said about his um scores he said not so bad i think when you consider that i am shooting against a bunch of mountaineer moonshiners and hunters who are noted in history and fiction for their shooting you see my company is recruited from henderson polk and transylvania counties in north carolina and those counties are noted for their wild and woolly inhabitants okay so during world war one there was no real way to get between fort caswell and southport by land and there were no bridges so the government ran a steamer called the getty which transported the troops to southport whenever they were off duty which was usually uh sundays and one evening a week so imagine what it was like for this small fishing village to become a military town overnight there were as many troops at caswell as there were men women and children combined in southport the soldiers were young they were away from home for the first time and they were preparing to go overseas to fight a foreign war many would not come home when they had liberty they wanted to um they wanted ways to amuse distract and comfort themselves southport was a dry town in a dry county although there were some pockets of moonshining but imagine how worried the leaders of the town and the mothers of the town must have been about what kind of element this was going to attract gambling alcohol and loose women and i found it interesting enough that it wasn't just the mothers in southport who were concerned it was the mothers of the boys being sent off to war who were worried as well they were concerned not just about their son's physical safety but about their moral and spiritual safety as well so the citizens of southport set up an army navy club on nash street the masons turned the first floor of their lodge over to the club the red cross collected and donated furniture decorations games a victrola and records you can see a piano in the corner and there's plenty of stationery for writing the folks back home there was a canteen run by the red cross that sold sandwiches and cakes at low prices and local women and young ladies signed up to volunteer as hostesses there was a stage for presentations and performances the town built a bowling alley and a gym in the back they built a band stand next door for musical entertainment and in the few months that the boys spent at fort caswell the people of southport did all that they could to make them feel welcome and appreciated including inviting them into their homes for home-cooked meals and providing support and advice and kind of acting as stand-in parents and before they shipped out the soldiers made it a point to get their pictures taken on the steps of the army navy club it had become a tradition that was thought to bring them luck for the first nine months there were no nurses at the fort the military doctors and the hospital corpsman provided any medical care that they required with 1200 men at the base it's likely there were fair share of injuries and accidents and illnesses there might have been a few broken bones sprained ankles or severe sunburns then in just a few weeks starting in february 1918 there were three recruits that died one of meningitis one of tuberculosis and an 18 year old boy who died of pneumonia it was thought that the young men were already sick before they arrived at the camp perhaps they were in an early stage of their illness and it had gone unnoticed the procedure at fort caswell was that new recruits were initially isolated from the rest of the population and this measure probably saved lives as no one else caught their diseases but the deaths of these three young men left the caswell soldiers shaken and this anxiety was evidenced in russell ernst letters to helen so here's an excerpt of a letter he wrote the day after the third man died he said we've had several deaths on the post recently among the recruits they brought everything from hydrophobia to toothache with them i wish they'd been kept away from here for our health record was fine until they came so it may sound like ernst lacked compassion for his fellow soldiers plights but i think it was his way of letting helen know that he was scared that he could too could die in battle or a disease and since it was much more common for soldiers to die of disease than war wounds it was a a real concern but at least by being in a training camp for a few months ernst and other soldiers had time to get familiar with the idea of being in the military and with the military way of life before they were sent overseas as you recall nurse susie and the other nurses were just thrust into the warfront with almost no preparation or lead time they had the culture shock of being at war of being in france of being in the military all happening all at once and once they got to their hospital camp in france they discovered that real life didn't always look the same as it did on the recruitment posters so after a while the military realized that the transition for the nurses could go more smoothly if they could at least train the nurses to the military way of doing things before sending them overseas and then things would feel more familiar once they arrived so in march 1918 the military began sending the first nurses to containment camps like caswell for military training before sending them along overseas um so it was at this time that the first nurses arrived at fort caswell and i i like this picture that you're seeing because in my mind that's you know as the nurses came across in the boat they were brought across to the camp this is how i envisioned what they first saw of their new home and what it looked like so the first nurse to arrive was nellie davis who would be the chief nurse at caswell now if you remember i mentioned that when the u.s declared war in germany we had very few soldiers and even fewer nurses there were about 400 nurses in the military and nellie was one of those elite few she was originally from denver and she attended nursing school at st joseph's hospital there and she graduated in 1907 when she was 23 years old she joined the army in 1916 about six months before the war started perhaps she saw what was coming and she wanted to be a part of it she was assigned to letterman hospital in san francisco which was one of only four sites in the country that nurses were assigned to you can see the picture of it there letterman was a very large hospital with many departments and facilities and nellie would have gotten a lot of training and experience during her time there after the war started she was sent to camp jackson in south carolina to serve as chief nurse now this was a brand new camp built to train recruits before sending them overseas and there were between thirty thousand and forty five thousand soldiers at the camp so then in march 1918 she was sent to fort caswell to become the chief nurse there she was tasked with setting up a nursing program to care for the troops and to train new nurses about the army way of nursing she arrived on march 16th and she had only four days to get ready with the base and set things up get familiar with the basic get everything ready before her staff arrived chief nurse nelly had six nurses on her team all brand new recruits who had heard the call of the military and wanted to serve now these women were new to the army but they were not new to nursing they all had degrees in nursing from large hospitals and in addition the nurses had other things in common they were all young they were all single they were all white american women and this was no coincidence the requirements for nurses at the time were that they'd be female u.s citizens between the ages of 21 and 45. now the requirements didn't necessarily specifically list race however that restriction was embedded in the requirement that they must have graduated from a nursing facility with more than 50 beds african-american nurses tended to go to smaller segregated schools in the south and in the north where there were larger schools their enrollment was limited by quotas so by requiring that the nurses training be from larger schools the military was in effect limiting the participation of african americans and the official reason for doing this was that they did not have the ability to provide separate but equal lodging for black nurses and they continued this policy even as the military grew more and more desperate for nurses so by 1918 the red cross had dropped its race restrictions on membership black women could and did join the red cross as nurses so the red cross had a whole pool of trained nurses who had signed up to volunteer and who were eager to serve their country the first black woman to become a red cross nurse was from north carolina and despite having extensive experience and strong educational credentials she was initially denied because of her race nevertheless she persisted and in 1918 she was accepted as the first african-american in the red cross nursing service and after admittance to the red cross nurse elliot signed up for and then was refused by the army nurse corps her white colleagues were all automatically awarded red cross pins that allowed them to transfer to the corps and help with the war effort eliot's pen arrived late and displayed one a designating her as the first african-american nurse and thus unable to join elliott refused to be defeated and she contributed to the war effort through nursing soldiers and their families at a containment camp in tennessee and when the spanish flu pandemic hit tennessee in the fall of 1918 elliott was instrumental in nursing her community she even learned to drive taught herself to drive so that she could go from house to house and take care of people she herself eventually contracted the disease and it left her with permanent heart damage so instead of calling upon the pool of trained and experienced african-american nurses the military decided they would try and recruit student nurses who could work as nurse's aides and they decided to start their own military nurse training program to grow their own nurses which of course would take time and money when it would have been faster to accept nurses from the ready-made pool finally in the last few months of the war they tried an experiment with black nurses calling up two groups of nine whom they sent to camp camps in illinois and ohio to care for black troops these nurses arrived in camp sherman ohio so these particular ones you see in this picture are the nurses that were sent to camp sherman ohio on november 13th two days after the armistice so they sent them to treat victims of the spanish flu and all accounts all the reports that went up um said that the nurses did an excellent job and were well liked by the staff and patients but of course by then the war was over so back to southport and march of 1918 when the first six nurses arrived so chief nurse nelly was the exception she was from denver but the rest of the women were from the eastern part of the united states and two were from north carolina so i always wonder about the dynamics of a group like this being thrust together from so many different backgrounds and locations and how would they get along so we can see that for the women were practically the same age but one nurse anna loveland was considerably older than everyone else she was 47 years old she was even older than the chief nurse who was 33. now nurse loveland had been a nurse for a long time she had also served in the spanish-american war as a nurse before the nurse the military had its own nursing program so she'd never been actually in the military before but she had a lot of experience and knowledge that the other nurses could learn from so i really hope that they recognized that and they were respectful of her and the other nurse that i worry about is bertha jost so bertha was an american citizen she came to fort caswell from new jersey but her family um had moved to the united states when she was two years old and she was born in germany and there was a lot of anti-german feelings going on at that time due to the war people stopped speaking german in their homes people changed their names to sound less german sauerkraut was called liberty cabbage frankfurters became hot dogs and hamburger became salisbury steak german people were treated with suspicion because they might be spies so again i hope that nurse jost was treated kindly by the other nurses another thing that i spent some time worrying about were these um six young women being alone on this fort with twelve hundred to fifteen hundred men who knew they were soon be heading off to war but after investigating further i realized the situation was a little different than i had originally imagined it so first of all i learned that several of the officers wives and families actually lived at the fort so you can see right there those are officers quarters that line the parade ground um so um there were other women living on the island with them and in addition there was what was known as a hostess house on the base which was a building where women from southport and wilmington and anyplace else could spend some time when they were visiting so the women couldn't very well spend all their time walking around the parade ground they couldn't go to the men's barracks or to their tents so they built a little facility for um for visiting the other thing i learned is that many of these men were assigned as entire units so there was a company from charlotte um from fayetteville from raleigh and other cities in north carolina so since they were so close their wives girlfriends and parents would come to visit them um generally traveling by train to wilmington and then taking the steamship down from there on a sunday so and then some wives and sweethearts even relocated temporarily to southport or to wilmington so they could be near their husbands and boyfriends so the nurses all worked and trained together at caswell then after about four months one of the nurses debbie bell was sent overseas to france that's her going to france and then it appears she had performed bravely while she was there because she earned the serbian cross the day after debbie left another nurse arrived to take her place and over the next two months six more nurses arrived at fort gaswell bumping the number of nurses up to 12 plus the head nurse so it's likely that some of the more experienced nurses would have started to leave like debbie did going to overseas assignments but in the fall of 1918 an enemy attacked the barricades of fort caswell and despite their mortar guns and their submarine mines and all of their weaponry the soldiers at fort caswell were helpless in its path one by one they succumbed to this unrelenting enemy and one by one the nurses of fort caswell stepped in to rescue them the enemy of course was what was known as the spanish flu it had arrived in wilmington on a troop transport bringing soldiers back from france the first case in wilmington was reported on september 19th almost immediately colonel chase declared a quarantine of the base all rnr was cancelled the steamship named wilmington was not permitted to make mail stops despite these precautions over the next few weeks 500 soldiers got sick so the entire camp had only been designed to accommodate about 400 soldiers and the men had been busy building extra barracks and a ymca and a hostess house along with learning how to drill and march and use the weaponry they hadn't thought to expand the hospital so the overflow went onto porches and tents but since one of the few treatments that was known for spanish flu was fresh air they probably sought to take advantage of southport's well-known salubrious breezes so i just want to mention this photo and the next few pictures of the span uh based on spanish flu were not taken at fort caswell like the other pictures that i showed you these were taken at other base hospitals and emergency hospitals from that time period so the treatment for the spanish flu was much more nurse centered than doctor-centered there was just very little the medical profession could do to treat the men um generally they treated the symptoms and provided support and they just allowed enough time for the patient's own body to find a cure before long the nurses learned how to predict the course of the disease so there were those who died from the actual virus and they went very suddenly they might have a cough in the morning begin to turn blue by the afternoon and be dead by nightfall which is why they called it the blue death then there were those who lingered their bodies fought back against the disease but it left them with weakened lungs and they developed pneumonia on top of the virus and since antibiotics hadn't been uh invented yet they were too weak to defend themselves and then the third scenario was the patient that appeared to have recovered and tried to resume normal activities and then they would find themselves back in bed much sicker or stricken with a heart attack from damage due to the disease so fort caswell had a successful record with the treatment of the flu and it's likely that they followed a similar routine as another camp called camp brooks um and who also had success with the flu so this is the routine they followed at camp brooks i'm assuming it's the same during the day the patients were nursed mainly outside in the fresh air and sunshine and at night the tent flaps were left open with patients supplied with extra blankets and hot water bottles to stay warm sunshine is known to kill bacteria and viruses and the fresh air factor was the subject of serious research until antibiotics were discovered patients used their own dishes and utensils which were cleaned with boiling water after each use staff had to clean their hands with disinfectant after each patient contact and there was no sharing of cups or towels or other items allowed and the nurses all wore gowns gloves head coverings and masks when they were in contact with patients they used various um methods to isolate and control interaction in the hospitals so this included ensuring good ventilation separation of beds reducing the number of beds in the wards arranging the beds so that patients heads and foots were opposite so they'd have a further way to cough if they were going to cough on each other and hanging sheets between the beds other measures included disinfection of bedding and rooms staff disinfecting their hands within a septic hand solution and the introduction of gauze masks so this picture right here i think is interesting this is uh obviously they've got the patients on a porch this porch separated by sheets this porch is at walter reed hospital in washington dc so that was the state of the art before the outbreak of the pandemic medicine had made great strides in the preceding few decades and it was actually getting reputation for being able to cure disease people were starting to look to the to the medical practices as being able to help them but um faced with the spanish flu however doctors were at a loss and they had to admit there was nothing they could do and so what soon became evident was that nurses were the ones who could make a difference on the front lines of the disease while there was no effective medical intervention nursing skills could provide comfort and basic care they monitored vital signs they ensured proper ventilation they did disinfecting and bathing and changing linen they supported personal hygiene and feeding they provided emotional support and education and more until the patient either recovered or passed away so here's an example of men gargling with salt water to keep the flu at bay um civilians did this too civilians also tried methods such as slicing onions and leaving them in the sick room to draw away germs and then sometimes they would wear onions or garlic around their neck or put sulfur in their shoes with the idea that it would keep germs at bay which when you think about it it probably kept people at bay and so by extension kept germs a thing the nurses used everything in their power to fight the illness there was no effective treatment or vaccine for spanish influenza doctors experimented with different treatments that they had previously used for respiratory diseases and that included things like quinine camphor whiskey creosote with its known antiseptic properties and even strychnine general medicines for symptomatic treatment were used such as calamel castor oil and aspirin in 1918 there were no guidelines on the management of aspirin toxicity there were not very many directions on the aspirin bottles about doses and there were no recommendations for the amount of aspirin prescribed one physician prescribed a handful of aspirin every hour another gave out thirteen hundred milligrams every hour the american medical association recommended a thousand milligrams every three hours or until symptoms were relieved so the bottom line is daily doses prescribed were between 8 000 milligrams and 31 000 milligrams which is two times to eight times higher than what's recommended today so in addition to the flu they were probably also dealing with symptoms related to poisoning themselves with aspirin another very popular treatment was vic's vaporwrap and vicks had actually been invented in greensboro north carolina in 1905 by a local pharmacist because back then pharmacists could just invent medicines um the product would remain in the family's company for 80 years and then they would sell it to procter and gamble so the common treatment was they applied hot wet cloths to the person's chest and throat and back between their shoulder blades to open up the pores and then they would lightly dry them and then they would apply vapor rub very thickly to those areas and the goal was to rub it in until the skin turned red then they would cover the whole area with hot flannel cloths and then the body's heat would release the ingredients so to their credit vicks never came right out and said that their vapor rub could cure the spanish flu but they also did encourage its use under doctor's orders so even if it didn't work it felt like it was making a difference and the supply just couldn't keep up with the demand in one day over hundred thousand orders were placed packaged and all filled by hand so you can see this newspaper article says drug is still act to conserve stocks of vapor rub needed in flu districts influenza epidemic is decreasing in most sections and the demand is slackening but we are still 18 000 gross behind on orders and it will take some time to catch up and then down below where you can't really see it it says 3 million jars shipped in october alone so with the sales rising the year before the flu um total sales of vapor rope was nine hundred thousand dollars the year of the flu it tripled to 2.9 million dollars and it's it quickly became sort of an icon and um as more orders came in the company had to expand um they had to add night shifts and so they actually helped the economy because a lot of teachers had been displaced people couldn't work because of the flu so they found jobs at the factory after their schools were closed and soldiers returning for world war one also were able to find employment at the vaporwave factory so to many persons at that time remembering the horrors of the pandemic they said vic's vaporweb saved america so whether it was by planning or accident fort coswell ended up well staffed for the flu pandemic they had six doctors and 12 nurses the wilmington morning star pointed out that at times the fort had more medical staff than all of wilmington despite a much smaller population and it was probably inevitable that that some of the medical staff got ill at least one of the soldiers who died at caswell was a hospital corpsman and one of the nurses came down with the flu as well she was a local girl from charlotte north carolina and the newspapers tracked her progress fortunately she made a full recovery and by mid-november she was healthy enough to leave for an assignment overseas in france despite the best efforts of the nurses between seven and ten of the five hundred men died at fort county as well from the flu one man sergeant robert guy farmer was buried here at the smithfield bearing ground sergeant farmer who was 32 when he passed away was married to a local girl katie piper who was only 24 when her husband died she was the mother of three children ages three and two and then a baby named after his father the wilmington newspaper noted that some southport women came over to the fort to help with nursing so i'm hopeful that word got back to robert farmer's wife that he was sick and that she was able to come over and spend some time taking care of him before he passed away sadly just five months after his father passed away their baby also named robert farmer passed away in the third wave of influenza that swept through the u.s during the winter of 1919. so the flu would pretty much run its course at fort caswell by the end of october but the so-called spanish flu was still not quite finished with caswell yet based on their success with managing the flu and the unique ability of colonel chase to speak spanish another group of men were soon sent to the fort to recover in 1918 the us government began bringing puerto rican men from the sugarcane fields of puerto rico to fayetteville north carolina to help construct camp bragg or as it's now known fort brac they were offered free transportation housing affordable meals and pay of 35 cents an hour but the men were unprepared for the north carolina weather they didn't have appropriate clothes they were given cramped uninsulated housing and of course there were unfamiliar germs so when the flu pandemic arrived many contracted the disease a cemetery was established at fort bragg to inter these men and it later became known as the main post cemetery and due to the limited information the army had about the men it's not clear whether their families in puerto rico were ever notified of their deaths or about what had happened to them about this time a transport ship the city of savannah arrived in wilmington with 2 000 more puerto rican men on their way to work at fort bragg now coincidentally peace talks had begun in europe and the government realized the war was going to be coming to an end so they decided to just turn the ship around and send the workers back to puerto rico but before they could do that influenza broke out on the ship health officials transported 200 of the sickest men to the hospital at fort caswell and sent the remaining men back home so the patient's situation was made worse because they didn't speak english and those around them didn't speak spanish fort caswell had been a segregated whites only military base there were no nurses to care for these men but amazingly the red cross cross found a nurse to care for them her name was lena wright jason she was born in delaware but she had grown up in puerto rico after her presbyterian missionary family had moved there when she was a child lena was a graduate of the presbyterian nursing hospital in san juan and she had offered her services to the military when she first arrived but she had been turned down so she had been attending an african-american woman's college in conflict court north carolina when the flu broke out so she's one of those women in that picture but again we don't know which one because it wasn't labeled individually she left her studies to respond to a desperate plea for african-american nurses to help with the pandemic in wilmington and when news of the puerto rican victims became known she volunteered to help nurse jason was fluent in spanish and english and understood the culture of puerto rico she could offer nursing care translation assistance and emotional connection to the sick and frightened men with nurse jason's care some of the men recovered well enough to return to their homes in puerto rico and i just want to read this article here it says the red cross was hostess at luncheon at the wilmington light infantry armor yesterday to colonel a.w chase of fort caswell and others in the military service who were in the city colonel chase on his return to the fort was accompanied by miss lena jason a registered red cross nurse who will aid in treating the puerto ricans in the hospital there miss jason spent 15 years in puerto rico puerto rica speaks spanish fluently and will be of great assistance in treating the islanders who are still in the hospital and then one other article says in answer to a telegram sent by the women of the military relief committee she left and came to wilmington and is now this is a section of a larger article is now at fort caswell and is doing splendid work both as an interpreter and nurse lena jason is doing this as a service to her government at the risk of losing the time at school thereby losing the credits necessary to finish her course she has made a noble sacrifice but is satisfied in the knowledge that she is performing an invaluable service to the government and to the unfortunate puerto ricans some who are paying with their lives and fear fearful penalty of leaving home also in the service of the government unprepared for the change in the climate and who contracted pneumonia from exposure so i'm really impressed with these articles and i really wanted to highlight them first is talking about a woman doing a great sacrifice and service to your country which you don't see very often it doesn't this is extremely unusual for the times it doesn't once mention her race normally you would see an article that would you know mention that she was um not white and also the puerto ricans it doesn't mention their i mean it mentions it from puerto rico but it doesn't highlight the fact and it says that they are also doing a service to their country so um i was pretty amazed by the articles and i was pleased to see them getting some credit for their sacrifice so sadly 28 of the men passed away from the virus and their bodies were sent to wilmington where they were interred in the national cemetery and you can see their markers today they can be identified by the words employee usa on the inscription none of the others say employee so gradually southport adjusted to the new normal of the pandemic and this is a picture from the fall of 1918 which gives an idea of what life was like during the pandemic so we see two little girls playing in front of the army navy club now it's possible that they're out playing because their school is closed we know that due to the flu school was shut down for several weeks we also see a guard out front perhaps limiting the number of people who could enter since it was known to be a crowd disease and then we can also see a woman sitting in one of the windows looking out perhaps perhaps to get some air and perhaps because there wasn't much happening on the inside due to the flu and not too many people there if you look um closely it's hard to see what this is but this is a close-up of the picture and you can see that the guard is wearing a mask to ward off the flu and the woman in the window is wearing a mask as well so it's likely that because the people of southport acted quickly and took the flu seriously they were spared a lot of the death that was seen in the rest of the state and it's ironic that while so many families were worried about their sons going off to war so many more people died back home from the epidemic so 828 north carolinians died from combat injuries in world war one nearly 14 000 died from the spanish flu most of them in a single six to eight week period in the fall of 1918. and so the flu passed and the war ended almost simultaneously a few months later nurse susie williams returned to the u.s aboard the ss leviathan she could relax a little more on this trip knowing that there were no subs in the water there was no war waiting for her when she arrived in port and upon her return to the states nurse williams chose to remain in new york and she worked as a private nurse and uh like several of the nurses who served at fort house while she never married over 200 active duty nurses succumbed to the spanish flu during the pandemic fortunately all of the caswell nurses survived now five of the nurses finished out their assignments at fort caswell and then they left military service five others went on overseas assignments for the military and stayed for another one to three years two made a career in the army and worked there till they retired and the last two nurses had a really interesting story anna and faye met in nurses training and then they served their army duty together they served at fort caswell and then at camp lee virginia and then they left the army and apparently they were not too happy with their experience it kind of left a bad taste in their mouth but about a year later faye fay white said that a friend and i'm assuming it was anna convinced her that service in the navy would be different so she decided to give it a try and the two women re-enlisted they enlisted in the navy this time and they served most of their careers together and they were assigned to places like haiti and the philippines so ann um retired from the service when she was 46 and went into private nursing um but faye continued her navy career during world war ii she served in the south pacific she worked her way up through the ranks eventually becoming a commander in 1945 she became the first navy nurse to receive the bronze star newspapers across the nation used her image and her age and her service to promote the purchase of liberty loans she retired from the military in 1947 at the age of 53 which at last left her free to get married which she did marrying for the first time at the age of 60. she and her husband had 22 years together before his death faye and anna remained lifelong friends and faye and her husband attended anna's funeral in 1972 which was just four years before faye's husband also passed away they herself lived to be 99 years old she always looked back on her 30 years in the service as a worthwhile sacrifice for her country and all of the nurses at fort caswell sacrificed a great deal for their service working at half the pay of the soldiers whose lives that they were saving none of them ever had children of their own only eight ever married they had to choose between their careers and their marriage as married women were not allowed to serve so you may be wondering what happened to our doughboy russell ernst who wrote letters to his sweetheart about the conditions at fort caswell ernst served at fort cazwell from mid-1917 through may 1918 and from there he was sent to new york and then on to france he came home following the war in february 1919. he and helen had originally started writing to each other simply as friends but over the course of the war their feelings deepened and they married in december of 1919 about 10 months after russell returned from overseas they were married for nearly 60 years until russell's death at the age of 86. the couple had one daughter and it was her descendants who donated his letters to the north carolina archives and just so you know that ernst didn't spend all of his time complaining here's what he had to say about the volunteers of the red cross he wrote we boys appreciate deep in our hearts more than we shall ever be able to tell the great work that the red cross ladies have done for us it may seem a small thing to hand othello a sandwich and a cup of coffee with a smile and a few words of cheer but by doing so the red cross has won the love and highest esteem of all american soldiers so the southport nurses along with millions of other american women made a real difference in the winning of world war one and these women were well aware of the irony that while they were helping to win the war that was supposed to make the world safe for democracy they themselves were not allowed to participate in this country's democratic process by the end of the war president woodrow wilson had finally come to see the inherent unfairness of the situation as well he said that his change in views was in large part due to the contribution of the nearly nine million american women who supported the war effort either by joining the red cross backfilling for the men who were serving overseas or serving themselves as ambulance drivers telephone operators and nurses and that all of that service changed his mind about including women in the vote so in september 1918 he again addressed congress and in part his words were we have made partners of the women in this war shall we admit them only to a partnership of suffering and sacrifice and toil and not to a partnership of privilege so the 19th amendment which granted voting rights to women was ratified in august of 1920. the following fourth of july southport held a pageant to celebrate so you can see these women are southport women and they're standing in front of franklin gallery and in the annual 4th of july parade that year veterans from the civil war the spanish-american war and world war 1 all marched down moore street while their neighbors looked on and cheered and the southport nurses marched right along beside them so i'd like to um thank the family of private arthur red ferguson for the pictures from caswell the family of sergeant russell ernst and helen penny ernst for the letters the friends of the fort caswell rifle range and the state port pilot for the all the pictures and information that i showed and if you want to learn more about brunswick county in the great war i suggest you look into this book that has recently been written and published by norma and amy eckerd and i think norma is on the call hopefully and um if she's here norma are you here if you are oh there she is um take your um take your mic off mute you're on mute norma norma is the president of the friends of can you know how to do it she's the president i'll let her figure that out she's the president of the friends of the fort caswell rifle range is a non-profit that she started with her husband and her daughter and they've done uh extensive work on recovering and the rifle range that's on fort caswell raising awareness and they have a website and if you figured it out norma and they've written and published a book there we go here we go good job you did a good job is there anything you'd like to say about the the organization or where people can get the book if they want um yes we still have a problem you know that's a pandemic so it causes problems we don't have bookstores close by so we have our number our phone number and that that flyer that you showed for people to get in touch with us we're still selling books about two a week we've sold about i had to reorder the hardbacks because they were sold out and we sold 50 of those

Valentine's Day special edition or whatever this is is that it's in the spirit of the lovey W holiday and as you can see you can bite it twist it chew it pull it nerds are a classic treat and what better way to treat a classic treat then wrapping it around with some good old-fashioned gummi goodness and then you can tie up your lover with that gummi goodness uh-huh well then that's the reason for the season let's go ahead and crack this bad boy nap oh yeah let's observe here oh yes yes yes well upon closer inspection this bad boy is indeed a rope what I love most about the Nerds rope is it's awesome versatility I mean you could use it as a bracelet on a very stylish one you could use it as a jump rope for your pet hamster and of course you could use it as some sort of eating apparatus but what kind of weirdo would do that all right let's go ahead and say goodbye Oh Jones I look like the prettiest boy at the ball the great thing about the Nerds rope is how incredibly sugary it is when you take basic nerves which are basically just you know pure sugar anyway and combine them with the gumminess that is a rope you get a delightful teeth eroding treat now wrap your lover up and show them some fun", "VmNSto519TE": "hey guys welcome back to my youtube channel today I'm gonna be showing you guys how to make at home nerd ropes basically so one of the first things that we have to do is we have to get our supplies guys sorta head to the store okay I made it to the storm at Walmart and I'm gonna go inside and get some gummi bears or worms whatever I can find and nerds and that is all you will be needing at the stores so let's go see ok I'm back in there and it's pouring outside cuz I assume my brother wants some and my family wanna try some so I got three nerds cuz you know they always cheat you and then I got a huge bag of parbo harrybo I don't say it gummy bears to melt oh my god for shattering that's what I'm gonna be doing it's so loud so he goes oh when I get home because I'm soaked right now and I'm just gonna drive home I'll see you when we got there hey guys I'm back from the store and by the way it was pouring like pouring when I was driving on the roads were flooding so if you don't know what organ is there you go um but yeah so I've got all this fight got three nerds big bag of this and I've got these to sort the colors of gummy bears and this should just put the Nerds it first things first let's open up these nerds and see how much is in it and import into this we have this much nerds I almost call them M&Ms we got the Nerds in there now I'm gonna sort the different colors out we've got five of them right here and there's five colors I looked on the back yeah there's pineapple lemon raspberry orange strawberry and you guys gonna say this is gross but just [Applause] well that's mg okay oh I guess I'll just sort of how I go this one will be green I'm gonna put you guys on a little time lapse while I'm doing this [Music] you [Music] now I have them all sorted out voila we've got clear pineapple yellow lemon green strawberry I don't know this I believe is cherry and this is orange ugly so and then we got our nerds now now we have to go melt them in the kitchen so let's go I'm in the kitchen now and I'm going to melt the red first because it's the biggest but before I do that I need to fill these empty ones fill the bottom with nerds so once the red is ready and just drop it on in there and then cover it with nerds so the red is gonna be our first experiment and then we'll learn off of that so let's put her in the microwave through like 45 it is see if I'm asked to put it in for longer yeah but it's almost melted like okay so it almost melted focus Queen yeah see look uh yeah so we'll probably do like maybe one minute would be perfect so we'll wait about kailyn's cooking our stupid food and I'm gonna fill these up I'm going back in for lunch city 30 but now I know the other ones going for like a minute but these artists spell it much so we'll see girl she was bubbling okay so it's definitely ready okay now we put now you put the layer over the top well I think I'm stupid dude look at that there's the layer of that on top on top gummy bears and there's the bottom and it didn't run through so I'm gonna put this in the freezer now Green Green is up next we're gonna do one minute death it's kind of the same it's a little less than red but one minute should be good I'll watch the other one was bad it's too long Oh again one minute is too long I repeat one minute is too into the freezer the green goes why laughs there she is okay I'm actually gonna be on my phone while my camera's charging so we've got orange yellow and clear laughs we've got these here I don't know what to do with like the rest of them melted so I'm just gonna leave it over here and do not I repeat do not put the gummy bears in for a minute it is too long and it will bubble over and then you're gonna have to clean the thing what we're gonna do yellow this time and we're only putting this in for 30 seconds and I'm watching it the whole time the other time I said it was but I forgot and now I'm actually gonna watch it because I'm scared so let's do a third you know what's your 25 I'm scared perfect timing they are all melted okay the freezer the lemon goes see there you go okay oranges up my favorite color we're doing 30 seconds okay all right Gina going in the freezer last one we'll put it in for 30 seconds damn clear pineapple going in the freezer and I'm gonna leave them in there for like 20 minutes so it's 148 I will come back at 1:00 no I will come back at 2:08 guys 208 they're in there and I don't know what to do with these so I guess I'm just gonna clean them okay you have all the containers soaking in hot water with soap and I tried to scoop out as much so good in the trash and I don't have very many nerds left all right everybody we it's been an hour later so when you guys do this make sure you wait an hour because it actually takes a long time for it to rego back let's take it all out and go off of the last one you did just so you can make sure that you have all so I got him out this is how mine's doing so far it's peeling up like that it looks like really cool look at mine yes I repaired it yeah I'm reporting an anime that looked beautiful totally killin candle at this just shut out look at mine mm-hmm mine's better she's excuse me mind spoke jeez she's focusing on hers that was cheating and look the Nerds are going everywhere now we have a bad kitchen problem yeah all right well um um I'll see you guys when I get in the room with these and I was gonna try and cut them but no okay guides so we are back in my room and these we've only done two so far we're gonna let the others sit till their room temperature so they'll go back down to being a gummy instead of like frozen cuz they're in the freezer so these ones do you ever like peel out as you saw and yeah so I guess I'll just eat it like a burger bun but here they are holy crap that was a cold one just very good it was really good very sugary like but look the inside it turned to a gummy now it's back at room temperature and it did taste like a nerd rope just there's a lot more rope as you would say the gummy part also very good if you look at the inside red on the inside if you like sour gummy stuff what does mean I like sour gummy stuff as a candy if I chose and these are really good for that but if you don't feel like chocolates and stuff this is not your thing so it's not Kalyan Singh it's probably not gonna be my mom's thing either but I didn't video though in the last part because I was cutting out the rest of them so we've already done these two those are a lot bigger and I cut these down to small pieces so right here we have a pineapple crap right here we have orange and right here we have a woman and I'm excited to try the lemon the orange it is very good very good lemon here we go lemon is my favorite so far it is very good don't let me down pineapple does that lemon that was really good lemons like my second padbole my favorite that is so good this was actually really fun to film and I think it'd be fun to try it too but just don't eat like the whole thing or you might have a heart attack so don't do that because it is a lot of sugar literally gummy bears and nerds are literally just sugar but that's literally what it is so like girl make sure you eat something else with that and drink water so yeah this was super fun stay tuned for more videos because I've got a lot of fun videos coming up and I just got a new computer for Christmas and it can hold Adobe Premiere Pro so I'm gonna be doing some better editing than just using iMovie so yeah stay tuned for that so thank you guys so much for watching this video if you guys liked it like it and if you didn't like it anyways thank you guys so much for watching like and subscribe peace out", "lexa2aklLGg": "hey what's going on so this is my review on the nerd rope nerds rope somebody sent me a couple bucks and wanted me to review it and I'm going to review it because that's what they pay for they paid for this so what up being said let's get into the review of their nerds rope ok so you can see this like some kind of alright it's kind of like a licorice surrounded by some kind of candied crap if you will this looks like some kind of DNA like you know at size class this is what your mob real looks like ok I got a mustache [Music] alright this actually looks pretty good I I [ __ ] with this for sure yeah alright let's before I let me get a drink of my coffee really quick Wow I actually found somewhere in McDonald's in Los Angeles that the large coffee was and was under $2 it's amazing oh and my sausage McMuffin was Oh get this Los Angeles and it was at Mike Hoff my large coffee and a sausage McMuffin was barely three dollars it's great so let's get started with the review I could do without all the nerds I used to eat nerds in the candy well okay they're like the little candy crap um it's pretty good yeah really sweet I'm not like too big on these sweets do I have any nerds in my teeth I do or was that last night's food I should have rushed my teeth like that drunk anyways I give it a 7 it's pretty good candy arm I would you know if I were uh if I were a kid behind a van and I would try to lure kids into it I would definitely stock up on these for sure so very good hopefully no appeals are watching so anyways thank you for uh thank you for the money to buy that stuff for the review whatever your name is I forgot anyways uh a couple points like to make really quickly as you guys know I do reviews and then I kind of go about my daily business of life I wanted to Ross to go get a new car mouth because I broke mine because I sat on it and when I get it when I went into he says hi good morning welcome to Ross and that just ignored him and he said it again hi good morning welcome to Ross like to be hurt like look dude people all across the country we're tired of this fake corporate schmuck greeting every day every time we go into hey welcome to Dollar Tree hey welcome to this hey welcome to that weren't we don't really care to be acknowledged because it's not a genuine hello good morning it's a forced greeting from you guys that your higher-ups tell you to say and also a lot of places do that because when people come in there to steal they're less likely to steal if they know that they're acknowledged when they come in like they know that they're being watched or whatever so it's a fake ass greeting nobody cares so I ignore everybody that says oh hello welcome I don't even respond to them anymore they're so they're so fake a phony [ __ ] them anyways so I'm at this McDonald's right and the one thing about La well there's a million things that I don't like about it but one of the things about La I don't like is that the bathroom situation I hear sucks especially you know when you're in your van you don't have a home and you know you always kind of like have that one bathroom spot where it's like clean and you just stick to that one spot but like when you're when you're out about in LA it's not very convenient to just stop anywhere and go use the bathroom it really really sucks like right now I'm going to a cemetery down the way right here just to go use the bathroom I'm gonna go do a video there anyways but I'm not even gonna go use the bathroom till I get to that cemetery why cuz I know that cemetery has a bathroom and nobody ever goes there as a matter of fact the bathroom is located in the same place where what a great day Hollywood actors interred in the mausoleum so I'm gonna go visit him and go take a dump so I'm in the McDonald's and there's a guy on the can I don't know how long he's been enough so I'm like whatever so I just go order my coffee and then these slobs just start coming in there just start sliding into McDonald's and then there's like a line of like five nerds and a McDonald's and one of the Nerds this homeless bummy black guy you know the kinda like when you just walk down the street and you see him you kind of want to maybe go across the street just go away from him he starts yelling everyone like oh I've been waiting here and the other guy was like I've been waiting for 15 minutes uh here's a little bit of advice if you've been at McDonald's for 15 minutes waiting to use the bathroom how about you just go walk your happy ass over to smart and final or we got Ross over here we got Dollar Tree as bathrooms we got this 'piease apparatus clothing store which is going out of business with structs oh I love them as a matter of fact I probably to come back here and get some clothes why should I use your bathroom Jersey Mike's uh huh else you got you got a couple bathrooms over there Pizza Hut they probably got a bathroom go use the bathroom somewhere else after 15 minutes um why would you want to use the bathroom right after somebody that's been on the camp for 15 minutes and you don't even know how long they were there before you were waiting for two minutes I'm the same anyways guys this is black Megan with another review I'm kind of behind on my reviews if you want to me to review something that that you want me to review just hit that PayPal it's in the link below guys I am behind on the review so you know you ain't gonna give me like money on it like all do it review tomorrow I'm trying to spread it out I

up is you can serve for the first half of the event and then the second half you get to just play and have fun or you can flip flop it where you could have fun during the first hour and then the second hour you would serve so that way we're each getting to fellowship but also gain a chance to serve we need people who are interested in just overseeing a station where they get a oversee a game

transforming life with christ and that's that's about relationships so this palm sunday picnic is an opportunity for an invite to bring someone to church that maybe hasn't been to church for a long time so we encourage you to be a part of that and then now we're just two weeks away from easter celebration sunday and so today as we are moving toward worship in the next few seconds here i just

we continue in worship this morning we want to encourage you to continue worship through giving and so there are several ways that you can do so this morning if you are here in person there's a box out in the foyer and you can drop your tithes and offerings there you can also go online to hfc.church give and give online or you can mail your tithe and offering into the church or drop it by our front office this morning so let's continue in workshop this morning we're at the movies and we need to silence our phone who knows where that button is i don't have silence everyone does right up here it happens to all of us we buy a new home and we turn into our parents what i do is help new homeowners overcome this was an adjustable spanner good choice steve okay don't forget you're not assisting him you hired him if you have nowhere to sit you have too many who else reads books about submarines my dad yeah oh those are progressive can't protect you from becoming your parents but we can protect your home in auto when you bundle with us look at that do we really need a sign to live laugh and love yes the answer is no i can help new homeowners not become their parents [Music] nope noah no joaquin no it just takes practice give it a shot do you hear that yeah it's a constant battle we're gonna open a pdf who's next progressive can't save you from becoming your parents but we can't save you money when you bundle home and auto with us no fussing no cousin and nobody all right everyone we made it my job is to help new homeowners who have turned into their parents i'm having a big lunch and then just a snack for dinner we're using a speakerphone in this store is that a good idea one of the ways i do that is to get them out of the home you're looking for a grout brush guard did you ask me any help no no no we all see it we all see it he is blue here okay blue progressive can't protect you from becoming your parents but we can protect your home in auto when you bundle with us these i think are the funniest commercials on tv right now uh are any of those things things that you can relate to do you feel like that maybe you're possibly becoming a little bit more like your parents have you said something recently something happened when i turned 40 that i started to really appreciate the pun better known as the dad joke and one night i got into these signs at this colorado store this very punny signs and so for the next 30 minutes i started to scrolling through these signs breaking at the apple store police looking for eyewitnesses how about this one life is short if you can't laugh at yourself call me i will now you got me how about this one if a cow doesn't produce milk is it a milk dud or an utter failure my kids give me a hard time about this and i for 30 minutes laughed at these and my my wife was just rolling her her eyes uh if you're not careful you will find yourself becoming like your parents and maybe you find yourself saying things like your parents uh have you said things that you thought i will never say something like that like don't make me come back there i'm sure on road trips this week some some parents have said that i'll turn this car around money doesn't grow on trees yep you had those parents as well are we trying to air condition the whole neighborhood here please and thank you don't forget please and thank you because i [Music] said so i have absolutely said that now a phrase that i i find myself really gravitating toward in my parent days right now are uh god gave you two ears and one mouth for a reason god gave you two ears and one mouth for a reason what's that reason you should listen twice as much as you speak exactly so how good of a listener are you how good of a listener are you maybe we should ask the person that you came with today or you're sitting next to maybe we would get a better answer there i found this flow chart online and uh basically we won't go through the whole thing it was how good of a listen are you and and then it kind of takes you through this flowchart if you're in the middle of something and somebody wants to discuss an issue with you do you and then it goes through the the flow chart and at the end of it you find out that either you're a great listener yay maybe that's you today you're an occasional listener you're okay with this or maybe you're listening skills need some work your listening skills need some work now it's easy to think about someone else that might fit into one of those categories but today how good of a listener are you now kate murphy wrote a book and it's not a christian book but it's an interesting book you're not listening was the title of it and she is a person that specializes in this and the arts of listening and how we're losing in it and she said this while you might take listening for granted how well you listen to whom you listen to and under what circumstances determines your life's course for good or for ill ill we are each of us the sum of what we attend to we're the sum of what we attend our our life to the soothing voice of a mother the whisper of a lover the guidance of a mentor the admonishment of super a supervisor the rallying of a leader the taunts of arrival are what form and shape us so in this last season this last year it's now been a year one of the things that i find myself with groups of people saying things like this so what is the thing that we want to take from 2020 and beyond now in this season what is it that god's teaching and i think one of the things that god has taught me the most in this last year is this it is essential it is essential it is spiritual this concept of listening and i need to in the in the middle of all the voices are in the world all the noise and all the loud things that we hear on a weekly basis all this week you've been told different things and it's gotten louder and louder and louder some true some lies and in the middle of all of that and the fear and the worry and the voices that are all in around us which voice am i going to listen to how good of a listener am i am i able to listen to the voice of god in the midst of all of that and he lead my life listening is a spiritual skill it's a spiritual habit and i want to get better at it i want to get better at it and i hope that you do too so we're going to take a look at some scripture this morning because i begin to take a look at something and the reality is is that listening and hearing is all throughout scripture all throughout old testament new testament it's just there now maybe the first verse that comes to your mind is is james 1 19 where it says this my dear brothers and sisters maybe mom and dad got that phrase from this take note of this everyone should be quick to listen slow to speak and slow to become angry that's a great verse to memorize by the way it's a great to lead your life but this thread is everywhere it's in the teaching of jesus and the parable of the sower you can find that in mark chapter four jesus liked to teach some parables and he would teach large groups of people and disciples it would teach them and he starts off this very famous parable this way listen listen exclamation point by the way a farmer went out to sow a seed as he was scattering the seed some fell along the path now if you've heard this story before it's an illustration about how the gospel is being shared and the seed is thrown to a rocky path into a rocky soil into a hard path into an authority area and into good soil and the point of it is that there are different ears that will hear and receive the gospel and the good news and if you're the good soul you hear the word you it and you accept it and there's growth that's there and he ends the parable this way he who has ears let him hear let him hear the the the story that's known as uh the the mount of transfiguration the transfiguration moment happens in mark chapter nine after six days jesus took peter james and john with him this is mark 9 2 and in him and they led him up to a high mountain where they were all alone there was there he was jesus was transfigured so what does transfigured means i mean it answers in the next verse his clothes became dazzling white whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them suddenly jesus is glowing that's that what that words mean then peter sees this scene and he sees elijah and moses show up but by the way who have been dead now for hundreds of years this is this a transcendent moment on top of this mountain and peter said to jesus rabbi it is good for us he just has to speak up if you know peter rabbi it's good for us to be here let us put up three shelters one for you one for moses and one from elijah for elijah and and i love this parentheses that's here he did not know what to say they were so frightened it's this moment where this amazing thing is happening before him jesus is just glowing he's seeing these biblical figures and peter cannot handle just the silence he just has to he has to speak i don't know if you're like that but when there's this that moment he's like i just i just have to get something out and so he doesn't even know what he's saying well let's just build these shelters along the way then a cloud appeared this is verse 9 and cover them and a voice from the cloud says this this is my son whom i love listen to him listen to him so uh do you remember that movie city slickers back in the day and in the 90s about the same time i went on a missions trip to ohio to a christian dude ranch we did mission work but while we were there i learned to ride a horse i learned to rope a little and at the end of this adventure we did a a sheep roundup uh which was comical at best sheep are just squirrely animals that are like advertised pretty nasty and dirty there as well but it was interesting that learning all these cool new uh new things and then being out in nature is just beautiful and then getting to see these experiences with sheep as i was thinking about this week uh my mind thinking about the sheep and there was a video that popped up that i'd seen before that i wanted to show you check out this video one more time [Music] [Laughter] [Music] isn't that amazing did the sheep actually recognize that when they spend time with a shepherd they actually recognize the shepherd's voice and i was reading this week it's even if someone tries to impersonate that that voice that a person that comes in the sheep know the difference between the two so if you are familiar with scripture you might know that john 10 27 these are the words of jesus my sheep they listen to my voice they hear my voice i know them and they follow me you see listening and hearing our essential spiritual habits and needs that we would grow in in this this feature our potential to become like christ is only as great as our ability to listen and to follow his voice so how good of a listener are you how good of a listener are you now we have to admit there are some things that are make listening very difficult especially in our culture today a couple of things maybe you could think of some things why are why is listening hard today why is it difficult well it's a noisy world uh it seems like i wonder if we could just like get a a sound reading on the whole planet like how through the years how the noise has grown and things are just louder and louder and louder not just the it just seems like voices are louder and tvs are loud and everything is louder in our world and it's hard to find places of of silence and quiet that's there we all have our distractions of choice so when those moments come where you have a little opening in your day what is the thing that you grab is it your phone is it that show is it we can't operate without a tv being in the background i know that during this week specifically if i want to listen well i cannot go to buffalo wild wings or someone like that why there are tons of tvs everywhere and by the way there's tvs in every restaurant now aren't there i mean they're everywhere and i know that there are basketball games that are on and my head is on a swivel uh and so for me to be a good listener i have to be careful about where i go did you know that our attention span continually is going down check out this quick uh stat here two year 2000 the average attention span was about 12 seconds this is on average uh now it's eight seconds a goldfish has an attention span of nine seconds so we are now lowering our attention span than a goldfish teachers you know what i'm talking about uh you parents you know what i'm talking about grandparents you know that this is an issue in fact the author of the book that i mentioned earlier katie she said this we should be teaching listening skills in school we should be teaching kids how to listen it is an essential skill that we would learn and the truth is is maybe one of the reasons we're bad listeners is when we hear certain words do you ever find yourself jumping to conclusions or trying to rush the story or to finish someone's sentence we jump and we hear maybe even a loaded word and we go oh oh i i know what they're thinking oh i know what they believe they said this and suddenly our minds go to places and so it becomes difficult to listen we're i think by nature now not very good listeners back in 2016 uh there was a protest that happened in dallas uh it was over police violence and a horrific thing happened a gunman came and shot five police officers and they were they were killed there if you remember that it's been now i think five years and and i was extremely impressed with the chief of police his name is david brown he's the former chief now and when moments like this happen when someone has to go to a microphone because i have a microphone every week i immediately i have a camaraderie with a person i feel like that i'm almost praying for them i'm hoping that it goes well i'm cheering for them i appreciate good leadership and very difficult moments and i don't know if you remember some of the things that happened but but but but chief brown he was just a calming voice in that extremely stressful situation he said i was exhausted this is a post interview i was exhausted but felt like really god was with me and what he encouraged during that time because he encouraged that protesters and the police would come together in a room and talk and listen to one another and in fact this became such a powerful moment that you know it inspired others to join that police force and that good came out of a horrific situation he said this as he was asked well how did you why did you encourage this or why did you think about this and and brown who is an african-american said this when i was in the sixth grade i was invited by a white classmates to over to their house for for dinner and as i'm approaching the house brown said he felt like sidney poitier in the movie guess who's coming to dinner worried he might get uninvited when his friend's parents found out that he was black when they welcomed him served him pot pie and was interested in what he had to say it changed his life and then he said this why aren't we smarter than sixth graders why can't we figure this out he said it takes not a big group not yelling and screaming but let's sit down and listen to each other and invite someone home for dinner and it shouldn't be a surprise that chief brown is a christ follower he said i'm a servant i want to serve god and i want to to give grace to other people i'm a christian i believe that service is a part of my direction and loving people despite themselves why can't we be like sixth graders listening to one another you know what as i've been listening in this last year the more i listen to people the more i really hear people there are a lot of people that are hurting there are a lot of people that are just broken inside and when i listen and when i hear and when i see and when i i really validate someone i show empathy and compassion and we start to look a little bit more like jesus don't we because jesus was a fantastic listener so we've been in this series called soul shift and we've been talking about these different spiritual shifts that we need to take to grow in our faith and the first week we talked about from me to you and how i need to focus if i'm going to grow i need to focus more on you than just on my natural me from servant to child i'm not just about serving god to get something out of it but instead i'm a child of god and that's a there's a difference there from seeing to unseen to things that are temporal to things that are internal and then pastor kenneth led us well last week and talking about there's a shift from being a consumer to being a steward so this week in the last couple of minutes i want to share with you about how we shift from being someone who asks to someone who listens now asking we're pretty good at that we have alexa we can ask all kinds of information and and she will tell us uh on our phones we can ask uh all about who the capital of such and such the birthday of such and such we get information all the time we're pretty good at asking isn't it great that we have maps that tell us where to go now when we ask we don't have to print any maps out anyone ever have to print out a map or go to an actual folding map you know when we ask it's it's different than really listening and the heart of it really is this i'll just get to it when we listen in our relationship with god it shifts to the it shifts to the center and it becomes the primary reason relationship becomes the primary reason we're talking to him when we ask we're we're seeking information when you ask things but when you're listening it's all about relational intimacy relational intimacy so fun fact tom hanks is uh you know was born in concord california and he's married to rita and uh was born july 9 1956 which we'll have to do the mouth on how old he is he is about 5 11 and he has a dog named lieutenant dan uh these are things that were the last parts made up and i don't know how high tall he is but if i were to tell you these facts about uh tom hanks which is by the way awesome actor right you know what that sounds like you can know tons of information about someone but you you know that you don't really know him i've never met tom hanks i've never spent time with him i don't know tom hanks tony evans said this information is just not enough you can have information about god have you ever known someone that knew a lot about god but it didn't seem like they really knew him they really knew him information is not enough information can give you knowledge about god but it's the holy spirit that gives you the experience with him so think with me who are the people that really knew god there was a guy named moses and and moses he says it says this in exodus says the lord used to speak to moses face to face just as a man speaks to his friend there was david and he would write these words as the deer pants for streams of water soul my so my soul pants for you it longs for you my god my soul thirsts for god for the living god and paul would write these words i want to know christ i want to know him and this word for no is is not just head knowledge it's something far far deeper and more intimate to know and and the hebrew is this word yada and in the in the greek it's gnosco and it's this intimate knowledge that you can have this relationship that you can have and this is the desire of god that he would you would know him so how do we do that how do we know god like that how do we have this kind of relationship where we would listen and hear i believe god speaks he speaks through his holy spirit that he gives us jesus said this one day before he went to the cross boys he was talking to his disciple guys i'm going to leave but it's better this way that i would leave because i'm going to send you a counselor an advocate someone that is going to not only be with you but it's going to be in you and this holy spirit it does things it it provides things he becomes a helper for us he is with us this is the scripture of john 14 through 16. he is an advocate he teaches and he reminds us of things that jesus says he guides us into all truth the spirit also convicts and he corrects and in first corinthians two it says this no eye has seen no ear has heard and the mind is imagined what god has prepared for those who love him but it was to us that god revealed these things about his spirit for the spirit searches out everything and shows us god's deep secrets no one can know a person's thoughts except the person's own spirit and so and no one can know god's thoughts except god's own spirit and we have received god's spirit this holy spirit not that the world spirit so that we can know there's that word again the wonderful things god has freely given us so the holy spirit speaks to us he guides us he counsels us he convicts us he he guides our feet he teaches us and reminds us of who god is it reminds us of who god is so a few months back i moved houses and when he moved you have to do a lot of things you have to transfer bills and addresses and all those things to when you switch over and those things are no fun because you have to be on the phone a lot and i had a modem issue and i got a new modem at my house for wi-fi and so i had to call xfinity i don't know if you've ever had to call xfinity it's it's just a treat for your soul uh and i had to be on the phone and this wasn't my first time calling xfinity it was like the third or fourth one of those times i was in a coffee shop and i was trying to talk through what to do and after about 30 minutes that the phone just cut out have you had that experience before just suddenly like you're talking to yourself now and all of the things that had been talked about all throughout the last 30 minutes ain't gone uh that are there so finally i get home and i gave it one more shot i've got to get wi-fi set up at the house we've got to have a connection that's there we gotta be able to have tv and all those things and so i i reached out to xfinity again and the operator that answered the phone that night was the best operator i've ever had they had the most soothing voice that i've ever heard on online and even though this was someone that was in the the marketing the telemarketing you know business of just had this ability to soothe and throughout the process because there's a process when you're setting up wi-fi it would be a long process of waiting for something to reboot every 30 seconds he would say this matt i'm still with you mats i'm still with you maths i'm still with you it almost became comical because it was like 15 minutes of this math i'm still with you matt's i'm still with you matt i'm still with you you know what the spirit does maps i'm still with you i'm still with you throughout this last year in the difficult ups and downs matt i'm still with you the spirit speaks as we as we spend time with him he he reminds us of god's presence he convicts as i spend time with god when it's just me and him when it gets quiet sometimes the lord has told me you know what you need to do you need to go have a talk with someone you need to go to apologize i know you didn't think about it at the time or when you said those words but man those were really hurtful you need to go back and chat with that person and make things right he's guided my feet when i look back this week i just spent time talking to god and just thinking about the last 20 plus years of my life god has given me discernment through his spirit some of the greatest the biggest life decisions that i've made has come in this relationship with god where he has pressed into my spirit and my soul and he has helped me make some very difficult decisions all along the way this is what it looks like to know god and to be guided by his spirit and this is his desire for us and it's it's essential trust this is proverbs 3 5 and 6. i've come to love this this amplified version of this familiar passage trust and rely confidently on the lord with all your heart and do not rely on your own insider understanding in all your ways know and acknowledge and recognize him and he will make your path straight and smooth so uh back in the 90s there was a commercial about a golfer named tiger woods do you remember uh tiger came out in about the 90s that was about the time i started to play golf and this commercial was fascinating to me i was just shocked by it because what was interesting about the commercial do you remember some of the nike commercials from the 90s with tiger what he would do is he took a golf ball and he started doing this and i thought this was the coolest thing ever and he started doing tricks and all kinds of things where he would just tap the golf ball on the golf club and so you know what i did i said i'm going to learn that skill and for the next months and weeks i was in a room or i was on a golf course and i just started to do this and i would count number one two three four and it was one or two at a time then it became 100 then it became 200 and this is a learned skill and so there are things that i know that you don't know how to do very well but then you can learn those skills right can you think about one of those things that you didn't know how to do but now you do so that's what listening is listening is not something that well i'm either good at it or i'm not good at it it's something that you can become better at so if you were to watch a ted talk about how to listen to others there's a really good one by a guy named julian treasurer he says this here are some ways you can get to be a better listener with others that's first of all you need silence every day like this is not a christian talk this is just a better listener talk and he says for three minutes every day you need to practice silence you gotta find silence because it'll reorient your ears i think that's good advice in the mixture of all life you need to focus on one thing so you when you have a lot of voices and a lot of things are out there you need to learn and train your ears to listen to one voice i think that's great have you ever needed that skill when you're trying to really listen to someone to savor sounds to hearing to savor sounds listening positions are important there's a difference between being open and listening to someone and being closed and and how you position yourself as important and then it gives this acronym which is great for learning to listen better with others r is for receive receive from someone next is appreciate what they're saying okay i hear what you're saying you're affirming someone you're appreciating someone you're not trying to cut them off s is for summarize so what i'm hear what i hear you're you're saying have you ever heard great listeners say that before what i hear you saying is this and then they they are hearing what you're saying and repeating that back and then the last one is this is to ask to ask questions to ask questions instead of just jumping to the conclusion but ask and really receive and connect to someone so on my phone i have this little thing in the front i don't know if you have an iphone if you've ever been here there before if you're becoming like your parents you didn't know you had this section in your phone uh but there are these little things that somehow get turned off sometimes and you wonder well why am i not receiving my text or my calls or why can't i get online well sometimes these buttons get turned off and to receive things you have to make sure the antenna is on you have to make sure that you're in a receiving posture on your phone so there was this kid one time and and his name was samuel and samuel one day was in church and he started to hear his voice samuel samuel but he didn't know god's voice at the time it was god speaking and he goes to this guy eli the prophet the priest and and samuel is taught by eli this is god's voice so next time you hear it say these words speak your servant is listening so what does samuel do he goes back he hears us with that voice samuel and he responds speak your servant is listening so how do we how do we get better at listening to god maybe it's as simple as every day we make sure we're in the right posture we start off by saying god speak your servant is listening there was a pastor and his name was lloyd john ogle but he passed away a couple years ago and he was in first presbyterian in hollywood california he became the chaplain for the u.s senate for years he recently passed away a friend recommended just some some things from him and he said this what was interesting about ogilvy is he wrote books about prayer and other things he said it hit me one day that 90 95 of my prayer time was me talking to god and it was about five percent listening and i decided i decided that i wanted to shift that around and i wanted to make my prayer time 90 95 of me listening to god and about 5 or 10 of me talking and he said when i did that i started to notice a change in me i started to notice my prayers started to be answered i noticed that god started to speak more through his word and through his spirits i started to notice instead of me just asking god to answer this or that i started to notice that i was being more a part of what god was doing in the world and he transformed my life so how good of a listener are you this morning as we respond i i made a little sheet for you you'll find it around your chairs maybe underneath your chair or the one in front of you and it's it's a worship response this is just for you it's it's nothing you're gonna have to turn in today uh but you

every week and here we are again with another story this time we are starting a new chapter in this book of american folklore called the westerners now i will caveat that this section probably most likely i know for a fact will um have some negative depictions of native americans i just want to say this book does not represent how i feel about those things and i am still going to read the stories um and try to put into light why conceptions of native americans being bad is wrong okay because it is and i feel like i've gotten to the point with this book where i really feel like i am just beating a dead horse that's a phrase that humans say um over and over and over again but every time i run into stories where it becomes a problem and we have to talk about it and if i don't talk about it every video one random person who watches just one of these is going to come in and think oh wow it's okay to treat other human beings like garbage no so i have to say it every time anyway let's get started on this chapter of american folklore called the westerners the conquest of the land west of the mississippi was a short and violent enterprise the trails were blazed early by indestructible trappers like glass but it still took gold strikes and rumors of gold to bring immigrants streaming across the great plains and rugged rockies the ordeals of the wagon train humorously commemorated in such ballads as sweet from betsy from pike were quickly followed by the ordeals of taming and civilizing the big country the rough justice of the frontier soon pacified the gunman gamblers and scalawags who flocked to cow towns and gold camps and in 1886 a u.s cavalry put down the last serious threat of the native americans within a few decades one of the 49ers rushed the pacific coast and the wild west became the old west out of this prodigious experience grew a prodigious number of and variety of heroes and it was the characteristic of the westerner to accept and even to inflate the romanticized versions of their exploits the legend has made one long adventure of the hard lonely life of the cowboy it has celebrated outlaw leader jesse james for his generosity and practically created sam bass in the image of a robin hood on horseback it gave hearts of gold to ladies of pleasure like julia boulet of virginia city and it measured frontier lawmen and hard-earned killers alike by the notches of their cults but beneath its most romantic yarns the west remained dauntlessly realistic and the heightened ironies of life in the west have been preserved and the solid real life ends of the calamity jane's and the willed bill hickox today no section of america is better known than the far west and this because of the stories and legends it tells of itself this is the phantom train of marshall pass here is a ghost story in which the phantom is mechanical it takes place in the high colorado rockies where the narrow gauge tracks of the denver and rio grande railroad wind through the narrow defiles and under long wooden sheds which protect the tracks from avalanches and winter snows the story is told by charles m skinner an early folklore collector soon after the rails were laid across marshall pass colorado where they go over a height of 12 000 feet above the sea an old engineer named nelson edwards was assigned to the train he had traveled the road with passengers behind him for a couple months and then met with no accident but one night as he set off for the divide he fancied that the silence was deeper the canyon darker and the air frostier than usual a defective rail and an unsafe bridge had been reported that morning and he began the long ascent with some misgivings as he left the first line of snow sheds he heard a whistle echoing somewhere among the ice and rocks and at the same time the going in his cab sounded and he applied the brakes the conductor ran up and asks what did you stop for why did you signal to stop i gave no signal pull her open laid out before we have to got to pass number 19 at the switches and there's a wild train climbing behind us edwards drew the lever sanded the track and the heavy train got underway again but the whistles began behind grew nearer sounding dangerously and in turning a curve he looked out and saw a train speeding after him at a rate that must bring it against the rear of his own train if something were not done he broke into a sweat as he pulled the throttle wide open and lunged into a snowbank the cars lurched but the snow was flung off and the train went roaring through another shed here was where the defective rail had been reported no matter a greater danger was behind them the firemen piled on coal until his clothes were wet with perspiration and fire belt from the smokestack the passengers too having been warned of their peril had dressed themselves and were anxiously waiting at the windows for talk went among them that a mad engineer was driving the train behind as edwards crossed the summit he shut off steam and surrendered his train to the force of gravity looking back he could see by the faint light of some new snow that the driving wheels and the rear engine were bigger than his own and that a tall figure stood atop the cars and gestured frantically at a sharp turn in the track he found another train about 200 yards behind and as he swept around the curve the engineer who was chasing him leaned from his window and laughed his face was like dough snow was falling and had begun to drift in the hollows but the trains flew on bridges shook as they thundered across them when screamed in the ears of the passengers and the suspected bridge was reached edward's heart was in his throat but he seemed to clear the chasm by abound now the switch was in sight but number 17 was not there and as the brakes were freed the train shot by like a flash suddenly a red light appeared ahead swinging to and fro on the track as well as as well be run into behind us to crash into an obstacle ahead he heard the whistle of the pursuing locomotive yelp behind him yet he reversed the lever and put on the brakes and for a few seconds lived in a hell of dread hearing no sound now he glanced back and saw the wild train almost leap up upon his own yet just before it touched it the track seemed to spread the engine toppled from the bank the whole train rolled into the canyon and vanished edward shuttered and listened no cry of hurt or hiss of steam came up nothing but the groan of the wind as it rolled through the black depth the lantern had two it disappeared now another danger impended there was no time to linger for number 19 might be on its way if he did not reach the second switch before it moved out the mad run was resumed and the second switch was reached in time as edwards was finishing the run to green river which he reached in the morning ahead of schedule he found written in the frost of his cabin window these words a freight train was wrecked as you saw now that you saw it you will never make another run the engine was not under control four section men were killed if you ever run in this road again you will be wrecked edwards quit the road that morning and returning to denver denver found employment on the union pacific no wreck was discovered next day in the canyon where he had seen it nor has the phantom train been in chase of any engineer who has crossed the divide since that night and that was the phantom train of marshall pass interesting also terrifying can you imagine being a passenger on that train can you imagine being responsible for all those lives and what if he had kept going what would have happened interesting very interesting next is jesse james and the widow the following the following tale with its o'henry surprise ending has been told about several noted bandits here in homer croy's version the hero is america's number one outlaw jesse james of whom it is said to be said he robbed only the rich because the poor did not have any money the democrat wagon in the story had nothing to do with its politics it was a four-wheeled two-seated open wagon the youngers were a family of outlaws who rode with jesse and frank james one of the marked characteristics of jesse james was his humor he liked to play pranks rarely did he go through a robbery without doing or saying something that had an element of humor in it a good illustration of this is something that happened in the foothills of the ozarks one day the james's youngers were taking back a road when noon came upon them it was their custom to go to a farmhouse and get the wife to prepare a meal for them and they always paid well they came to a humble cabin and one of the group went to the door to ask a question a woman answered the hulu a bit startled to see two other mounted men she didn't know if she could cook the meal or not she said as there wasn't much to eat in the cabin but finally she was prevailed upon she watched the men dismount and seat themselves in the yard to wait until the meal was ready as the men waited they were more and more impressed by the poverty of the cabin and by the hard struggle the woman had to live then they noticed that the woman was weeping and they asked her if she was frightened she said she wasn't but that seeing men in her cabin made her think of her husband it developed that her husband was dead and that she was having to face her problems alone the men were appreciative of this and glancing at each other decided to be liberal with her sensing this friendly sympathy the woman choked up she tried to hide her emotions but was so brought up that she was unsuccessful jesse said won't you tell us what's the matter the woman hesitated but at last the trouble came out the cabin and her little farm were mortgaged to a heartless skin flint who had been pressing her for money he had finally warned her that if she did not have the mortgage money ready when he arrived he would take her property he's coming today she said again beginning to weep at last dinner was ready and the men sat down jesse for the most part ate in silence now and then glancing at the poor widow in her humble surroundings finally he said how much do you owe this man eight hundred dollars jesse ate a few moments when did you say he was coming this afternoon about four jesse took a few more bites what did he look like she told him how will he be traveling in a democrat wagon driving one horse at the end of the meal jesse pushed back in his chair what road does he usually take the woman told him it so happens said jesse that i have much money with me and i'm going to loan it to you the woman looked at him in amazement was he joking he wasn't you remind me of my mother said jessie and i want to do something for you the woman began to weep afresh i'll work my fingers to the bone but i don't know when i can pay you back she cried jesse patted her shoulder don't you worry about that i'll stop by sometime then if you have it you can pay me back the woman sobbed and knew at her guest her guest splendid generosity now you want to do this in a business-like way says jesse he sounds like a hard man to deal with so you ought to protect yourself this gentleman here indicating frank james will write out a receipt then you copied an ink in your own handwriting before you pay over the money you make the man sign the receipt that's the proper way to conduct business he'd make you do the same and don't tell him anyone's been here now will you do as i say yes sir cried the weeping widow i think you're wonderful i wouldn't say that jesse answered modestly i like to help deserving people when i can he's a very kind-hearted man said frank finally the men mounted their horses and the door the widow stood her face a light and waved goodbye to them that afternoon the skin flint called on the woman signed the receipt and left after he had driven about three miles away from her cabin on his way home an unfortunate incident occurred suddenly three mounted men popped out of the timber one seized the horse's bridle and all leveled cruel looking weapons at him the man chanced to have 800 but not for long the horsemen appropriated it then they whipped up his horse and sent it spinning down the road leaving the mortgage holder alone and on foot with the problem of catching his horse as best he could then the three men rode away no one knew where they went and that was jesse james and the widow we're not done i just oh i love that that is so nice see i don't care if it's fake or not i think stories like that should be told stories of outlaws are the heart of gold because who what really defines an outlaw well someone that doesn't follow the laws of the time but who says the laws of the time are just jesse was just doing whatever he needed to do in order to live his life i think that's wonderful there's something very charming about an outlaw especially one that actually has a heart and cares about people anyway we should move on to the next story but i love that one so much okay this one's called skeleton cliff of montana the white man brought the native americans some benefits and many scourges among them diseases here's an account of the coming of such a scourge told by plenty coup a young native american to dr william a allen and adapted for this book the disease in this case is smallpox it had started with a white miner who died near the fort called union on the missouri river his clothes were taken by a blackfoot indian who caught the disease from them he spread it to his tribe once it spread to other tribes the height bud of skeleton cliff which is why it is so named the story will tell still towers over billings montana many snows ago there were some river crow indians who were so big and strong all six feet tall with hair so long it reached the ground before going out hunting or into the battle they braided it around their heads these warriors were the guardians of the river crow tribe and so they lived without squaws at the foot of the cliff from the top of which they could see enemies approach they were young and strong and knew no fear they were good hunters so there was always plenty of buffalo tongue and dried elk to be had in their camp one day they heard a strange sickness was taking the lies of the sioux and the blackfoot tribes but they felt no fear for the great spirit had been kind to his crow children yet one day one of these guardians of the tribe found he could not rise from his bed or from his buffalo hides his limbs were heavy his eyes dim and his body covered with red spots that burned like bee stings the others quickly built a sweat lodge and heated stones they poured water over the hot stone so the lodge was filled with steam then they carried the sick warrior into it so the evil spirits would be sweated away afterward they plunged him into the icy waters of the nearby river called loudly on the great spirit in spite of all their efforts the young brave was taken across a slippery log to the happy hunting ground the other braves performed the ceremonies for the dead putting near the dead man and all the things he would need in the next world his war bonnet his tomahawk and war club and his horse which they had killed but soon a second warrior was stricken and then another and neither the sweat lodge the icy river nor all the medicine men's dances and bags of charms helped with every sleep another brave died the sick ones begged the strong to leave before they were also stricken but crows do not desert their sick brothers even in the face of an enemy one cannot fight they built a mound of stones four by sixteen feet to mark the site of their stricken camp when they should all be dead by the time only sixteen warriors were left among the guardians of the crows there were silence in the camp one night they sat around their fire and smoked the medicine pipe and the head men spoke for some cause we do not understand the great spirit is angry with his children the crows when we pray to him he does not hear something more than prayer is wanted the greatest sacrifice that it is in our power to give so let us say to him that we will give up our lives if he will once more grant health and strength to our people but let us ask for a sign so that we know our words have been heard we will prepare for death and chant our death songs then if our sacrifice seems good the great spirit will make our fire leap higher than the tallest tree if not the fire will die down i have spoken so the warriors built up their fire and did as their leader said painting their faces putting on their war costumes and chanting their songs as they did so the fire leaped higher and higher until it reached far above the tallest tree the head man pointed to the flames the great spirit has heard our words that is his promise he will smile again upon our people his words filled them all with pride then the 16 young warriors blindfolded their horses mounted them and rode along the trail to the top of the cliff when they were all assembled the head men solemnly gave the sign in unison they lashed the horses and the animals and their riders plunged over the edge of the cliff hundreds of feet down native americans and their amounts were impaled on the grotesque pines at twift out twist out on the cliffside for decades the brave skeletons were still visible hanging from the trees but ever since as all know the great spirit has been kind to his children the crows and that was skeleton cliff of montana human beings have some very interesting relationships with the world around them they explain things in very interesting ways with religion with science with magic and i can't say if anyone is more right than the other but it is something to think about why human beings have found religion and spiritualism and things like that and why it means so much to them i also should discuss that in the beginning of this chapter it mentioned something about the native americans being finally won over by the cavalry when really there was nothing to be won settlers came and they pushed native americans out of their home and then they just kept pushing and conquering and taking and if you didn't look like them then you were wrong and since they had killed their brothers and sisters before them what are the native americans supposed to do just lay down and take it that's not fair that's not justice and there have been horrible atrocities committed against native americans in this country humans are complicated creatures no country is perfect no human is perfect but that's why we tell these stories we talk about those things because we need to realize our flaws and the horrible things that human beings can do and try and be better [Music] next we have sam bass texas robin hood born in indiana in 1851 sam bass moved to texas as a very young man and crowded a lot of excitement in his 27 years after a stint as deputy sheriff he became a road agent and later a train robber noted for his open-handed generosity with the money he obtained at gunpoint it was a soon matter for legend anecdotes and ballads clustered around him j frank dobie texas historian folklorist and story collector interviewed a number of old-timers who had known sam bass or new songs or stories written about him in order to compile this sampling of bass anecdotes sam bass had been in texas only six years when rangers killed him he had been an outlaw on the dodge only 10 months he had spent most the time around denton specializing in horse racing he was never much of a cowboy sam used the coin money he spent he spent a justice free he always drank good whiskey wherever he might be in the spring of 1877 he wrote down to san antonio and threw in with joel collins they bought a small herd of cattle on credit drove them up a trail and somewhere north of dodge city sold out for cash they soon sent all the money in riotous living and then got their names on the map by robbing in nebraska a union pacific express carrying california gold each of the six robbers took ten thousand dollars in freshly minted twenty dollar gold pieces they split it up and sam made it back to texas all right side up with care rode into the town of denton with all his friends to share in the months following his reputation for lighthearted generosity began to grow into legend now he had something to be generous with something that did not belong to him he and his followers made a few poor paying train hold ups in north texas he tipped the porters and break men so people said the rangers were after him the people were for him he had not been robbing people unless they happened to be aboard the train he stopped he had been robbing corporations going into town to buy supplies became incredibly risky he was on the dodge covering lots of country he had to take and when he took he put those 20 gold pieces into circulation sometimes sam was sorely pressed for grain for his horses and food for his men one morning a farmer named hoffman missed some shelled out corn for his it had been carried off in a sack with a little hole in it hoffman trailed the grains of corn until he saw he was approaching a camp known to be occupied by the bass gang he turned back home a few days later bass saw him handing him a twenty dollar gold piece explained i have to have some corn in a hurry the other night in 1927 the proprietor of an ancient looking plank hotel at van horn was an old time texan named jackson from denton county he was a while he was a great admirer of sam bass and one winter night while he and i and asa jones sat by the wood stove that warmed the hotel lobby he regaled us with stories of the daring good outlaw sam he said was sandy-haired kept a sandy mustache well trained and habitually wore a grin that showed his sandy hue teeth he was a good nature in it of itself one time jackson then just a kid and his small brother were carrying a bucket of water a piece from the well to their houses where they were overtaken by sam bass and his crowd give us a drink kids sam bass said the boys had a gourd and they proudly ladled out water bass noticed that jackson's brother was crippled with rheumatism and as he started to ride away he pitched the a few silver dollars sam bass was a fool about good horses one time rangers raided a little pasture where the fine horses belonging to the outlaw gang were kept for several days the rangers paraded those horses around keeping them in a livery stable at night the stable was across the road from where the jacksons lived i woke up one morning hearing voices jackson said i thought i recognized kid mccoys he was one of the bass men and rode the best looking horse in the outfit i ran to the window and peeped out the live re-stable doors were wide open and there sam bass kid mccoy and the other men were pulling saddles off some little sorry ponies and saddling up their own horses it did not take them long to change and then they came out of the stable yard healthy split yelling like comanches and emptying their six shooters into the air shirt tails were dodging behind every door in town my father was a very quiet religious man never even said dog gone my those boys are making a big disturbance he said if sam bass wasn't a killer it wasn't because he could not shoot while galloping by a live oak tree near belton they say he sick shootered his initials into it a vendor of mounted horns from an old-time texas sears named bertillon used to sell at fancy pairs of longhorns perpetrated to be from steers that sam bass had shot on his own night stampedes one day shelton's story of denton county used to remember a neighbor who had a butchered a fat cow said he'd give me a dollar to carry a hind quarter to a certain spot in the denton creek bottom delivered to men camped there and asked no questions the meat was wrapped in an old slicker that i tied behind my saddle that saddle was the first new saddle i ever owned the skirts were fancy stamped it had long strings of tan l thai alkyd and its creaking sounded sweeter than walt's music along in the middle of the afternoon i found the camp four men were there all wearing six shooters i said i'd come to bring some meat one asked me if pete lenoir had sent it i said he had well get down kids stay a while this man said i didn't want to stay but got down and untied the old slicker after that i delivered the beef the man said that sure is a fine saddle you're riding i agreed with him and he was prouder than ever then he said kid how about trading your saddle for mine i looked over at the old hull he pointed to i looked at the six shooters he and the other men were loaded with and the saddle guns laying around in easy reach i didn't have any say coming and i didn't say anything after the saddles were changed this man asked do you know who i am no well i'm sam bass i left with a heavy heart i wasn't scared so much as i was just down having lost my fine new saddle if it had been up to me i'd not have put the old hull on my horse i'd have left bear back but sam bass put on his old saddle on my horse and girded him up himself the leather on it was fair and it had good saddle pockets but it was coming apart i felt that i had been taken advantage of by the meanest lowdownest man in texas i rode on home when i got down i yanked that saddle off and threw it on the ground like i was trying to split a tree when i did i heard metal clank i looked in a saddle pocket to see what it was it was three twenty dollar gold pieces and the other pocket were three other pieces well i bought a rig sure enough with all that money new sav new saddle silver plated bit and spurs navajo blanket fancy boots leggings and everything in the spring of 1878 a youth named chunk porter was clerking in a dry goods store owned by miss mr cates in the original town of kaufman early one morning as he told hundreds of times in later years and his descendants had others still to tell he had just opened the store and was sweeping the plank sidewalk in front of it when three strangers rode up on good horses two got down and walked into the store the other remained mounted looking up and down the road chunk was alone in the store that day his employer being sick at home one of the strangers pleasant featured and pleasant voice said he wanted to buy a suit of clothes chunk was able to fit him with the best grade of wool in stock the purchaser handed over two twenty dollar gold pieces and said he would put the new suit on now chunk went to the safe which he had not yet opened for change after he had worked the combination opened the door and pulled out a tray of money he became aware of the man in the new suit standing behind him at his side son he said that is a good deal of money chunk explained that the town had no bank that their cash had to be sent by stage or taken in person to tyrell for banking and that the illness of his employer had preventing him attending and saying that matter the stranger advised him not to let everybody who came along see how much money the safe held and then rode away after sam bass was killed in round rock the closey warbur identified as having come from the kate's dry goods store in kaufman railroads express companies and the governor of texas all offered rewards for the capture of sam bass and these offers induced some citizens to join the sheriff's policies out to get the money they were all fiascos while the sam bass gang was dodging about the breaks of the clear fork of the brazos in stevens county the sheriff set about organizing a posse a settler named hyde who was proving up a section of land decide he joined the posse and rode to the caddo store to enlist another brave or two to go with him as he was dismounting with his artillery a man carrying a sack of provisions from the store asked him where he was going i'm going down to hunt down sam bass the settler replied then you don't need to go any further you found him the stranger said what are you going to do with him nothing i guess had answered there didn't seem to be anything else to say how many children you got sam i told him he had a big litter sam went back into the store and brought out a dozen apples a lot of candy and a package of arbuckles coffee take the candy and apples home to your children he said when you get there make yourself a big pot of coffee and never tell a soul that you've seen sam bass hyde waited 30 years to tell this story he said one night soon after a train robbery by the bass gang held in the vicinity of dallas a deputy sheriff named boyd from denton county and several citizens ambitious for reward money were in a saloon at pilot point none of the posse knew sam bass by sight that but they were full of plans for capturing him presently a stranger in the usual garb of rangeman walked in glanced over the crowd and moved to the bar and invited everybody up for a drink everybody accepted after the stranger downed his whiskey he took a seat at a long table at the rear end of the room his back was to the wall and to one side of an open window he asked for coffee and bread several the men sat down at the table also ordering coffee ordering coffee boy'd opposite him the talk naturally drifted to the recent train robbery not in the least reticent as the stranger revealed a marked familiarity with the circumstances attending it boyd was growing suspicious but the stranger remained drawingly calm when the coffee came he stirred it slowly and then asked boyd to pass a plate of bread boyd was by now flustered he seemed to feel that some action was expected of him as a peace officer he paid no attention to the request rising the stranger pulled out his sixth shooter fired a bullet to the plate scattering its contents over boyd's lap then he stepped through the window by the time the deputy and his posse got outside sam bassett disappeared the country had another joke at the expense of sam bass hunters most people who met sam and some who didn't told of their encounters with pride in one town that sam had entered into by to buy ammunition he saw a sheriff and dodged into a dressmaker shop she had a mountain of ruffles on the floor in those days party dresses were trimmed with yards and yards of ruffles the dressmaker recognizing sam bass told him to get under the ruffles and he did the sheriff came in and saw nothing that interest him when she was a grandmother the dressmaker used to end her story by saying lots of folks loved sam a few weeks before sam's betrayal and death a well-armed writer dismounted in front of dr isaac mayfield's little office in the village of deanville a way east of the bass gang's usual range young dr mayfield was fresh out of medical school and eager for practice his horse saddled with bearing saddle bags loaded with country doctors full equipment stood at the hitching post the stranger said the doctor would have to make a considerable ride to get a sick man what kind of sickness the doctor wanted to know you'll see when you get there the stranger led over what passed for a road about 10 miles west and south to the ugua creek and then along a dim trail to the yagua thicket still noted for the dense growth of yaupon and other shrubs and trees then they came to a camp that had apparently been occupied for several days eight men were visible their leader did not give his name he was told the doctor that one of the men had a wounded leg he lay in a pallet of blanket-covered moths the doctor uncovered him and saw that he had been shot through the fleshy part of the thigh and that the gangrene was settling in he called for a boil pot of boiling water it was soon brought he washed the bullet hole at entrance and exit and applied the antiseptic he then told the leader that he must probe in order to remove the pus and need needed some clean cloth the leader went into his pack and brought several plain silk handkerchiefs new and clean the doctor had no narcotics to give the wounded man anesthetics were then unknown this is going to hurt he said you will have to hold him the men were standing around back out of the way the leader said boys those new steel handkerchiefs are going to be pulled through that bullet hole hurt or know her now let a man get each leg arm and arm one to his head and hold him steady no matter how much he hollers hold him until the doctor says quit five men stretched out the wounded men while the doctor ran the silk handkerchiefs through the bullet hole the sun was low when he finished he said that he would stay through the night if there was anything more he could do but there wasn't he would return if called the leader asked how much he owed i guess ten dollars recovered the bill the doctor said the leader handed him a 20 gold piece adding doctor i would be obliged if you not mention this day's work where you've been or what you've seen the doctor replied my patience and practice are private i make it a point to keep my mouth shut on personal matters he had concluded that the leader of the gang was sam bass descriptions and the papers following the killing around rock confirmed the opinion almost immediately after news raced over the country that sam bass had been betrayed to the rangers by one of his own men named jim murphy and killed the ballad of sam bass came into existence nobody knows who composed it and years have followed millions of longhorns who soothed on their bed grounds and studied on their lawn slow trailing by the strains of the song one line in particular expressed the sympathies of the singers oh what a scorching jim will get when gabriel blows his horn no tails are more persistent than those about treasure sam bass is supposed to have hidden if he did not bury his loot what did he do with all of it the records i believe don't show that he ever went to lanoiano county just the same a big jag of sam bass gold wrapped up in canvas male sac branded us was buried there they say many years ago a ranch man hired three mexicans to cut cedar pickets on one side of pack saddle mountain he camped them and left it rained and it was two or three days before he came back camp was deserted he could not understand why the mexicans would leave without getting their wages he began looking around the rain made signs easy to read he found there were six packets exactly six had been cut and leaned against the cliff two of them as he read the sign had pushed their way through the very thin wall into a small cave just inside the cave he found an old mail sack the us brand still visible on it prince of coins showing on it too the mexicans had taken the gold and lit a shock and that was sam bass texas robin hood wow you know i've never heard of sam bass but now that i read all of these stories about him i wonder why he seems like a really wonderful person and if the stories say that he was well liked i will leave them the fact that he was stealing money from corporations and not people that couldn't make ends meet says something in and of itself there is something called chaotic good you know anyway this next one is gretchen and the white stallion a wild and beautiful horse appears again and again in folklore it appears under a number of names the white steed the ghost horse of the plains or as here the pacing white stallion it is always pictured as a noble beast this tale of such a horse is based on a story told in the 1870s by a woman who came to texas as a girl with german colonists she herself may have been the original gretchen gretchen's family removing up the guadalupe river and wagons at the end of the train they had a gentle old grey mare that followed their wagon without roper halter stopping every once in a while to grab a mouthful of particularly lush grass she was stupid and lazy and her ears flocked but she was faithful she carried two big sacks of cornmeal so arranged that they made a kind of platform the wagon was running over with such things as german settlers carried beds and bedding pots and pans mugs and plates a heavy chest of drawers a sauerkraut keg and many many children gretchen eight or nine years old was the loveliest of these one day she asked her father to let her ride the old grey mare he could see no harm in this in fact her absence might lessen the constant hubbub so he lifted gresham up from the platform of cornmeal sacks and tied her there with the rope in such a way that she would be comfortable and not fall off the old man hardly battered an eye and when gretchen was on her back continued as usual to walk and pick grass along behind the wagon that afternoon a gully of at a gully the tire of a wagon wheel fell away from the fellow shrunken by dry weather and several spokes were broken when the halt was made for repairs gretchen was asleep firmly tied on her pillion of cornmeal she did not know when the old gray mare grazed out of sight down a draw her father was busy with the wheel her mother like the old woman who lived in a shoe had so many children that she did not know what to do and so neither of them noticed it was only after the wagon was repaired and the other children were counted into it and the train started on the little gretchen was missed then the old gray mare could not be found none of the german men so new to the frontier could follow her tracks in the maze of mustang tracks they now discovered they struck up camp to search night came and no little gretchen the next day came and passed and no little gretchen then on the morning of the third day the old mare brought her in and this is the explanation the little girl gave after dozing she not knew how long she woke with a start the lazy old mare had come to life and was limbering along a gallop and naying pacing a white horse with a cream-colored mane and tail she tried to stop the old mare but she had neither bridle nor halter she tried to jump off but she was tied on and the knots of the rope were beyond her reach after the old mare had trotted and galloped until barely sundown the white horse all the time pacing ahead like a rocking chair they came to a large bunch of mares they came out full of curiosity to greet their new sister and they were very cordial in their greeting the wild mares seemed not to notice little gretchen at all they were so cordial in their nosings that the old grey mayor that soon their muzzles were touching the mail sacks probably the sacking was salty some of the meal had sifted through the mares tasted it no matter if it was their first taste of corn that they never never had they liked it they began to nip at the meal sacked so eagerly that they nipped gretchen's bare legs she screeched she expected to be chewed up right away even if the mares meant no harm but at her cry the pacing white stallion was with one of the was with one bound beside her he was as considerate he was intelligent he drove the wild mares off then he chewed into the ropes that bound gretchen next he took her gently by the collar of her dress very much as a cat takes one of her kittens and set her down upon the ground it was about dark now and the coyotes were beginning to howl little gretchen held too but there was no danger after a while she made a kind of nest in some tall fragrant grass near a spanish oak and having cried a while fell asleep when she woke the sun was high and not a horse was in sight she was hungry she went down to a water hole she saw close by and drank water for breakfast she had heard that a person lost a way out in the wild to better stay in one place until he found himself or until someone found him she had no hope of finding herself she wished her papa would come she remained near the water hole noon came and still no horse or person appeared within sight gretchen was hungrier than ever it was late spring and she gathered some of the red agrido berries also called wild currants growing near but the thorny leaves pricked her fingers so severely that she quit before she'd eaten enough to satisfy her hunger evening fallon she was still alone she gathered some sheep sorrow down in the bottom of the draw and drank more water darkness came the stars came out the coyote set up their lonely howling little gretchen laid down in her nest again and again cried herself to sleep when she awoke the next morning there standing oprah over her sound asleep ears flopped down and lower lip hanging shapeless like a bag of curd was the old grey mare gretchen was as glad as the red bird singing over her head she jumped up and ran to the mirror and tried to get on her but the old man was too tall then gretchen grasped her by the mane and tried to lead her to the log that lay near at hand if she could get the old man beside it she could use it as a stepping block but the stupid old mare would not budge after vainly pulling coaxing and jumping about for a long time gretchen began to wail she was leaning against the shoulder of the old mare sobbing when she heard swift hood hoof beats rhythmic and rocking she looked up and saw the beautiful white steed the sunshine was on his whiteness he came arching his neck and pacing with all the fire of a mustang emperor but there was something about him that prevented gretchen from being the least bit frightened on the contrary she stretched her arms toward him and gave a childish o of welcome he paced right up to where she stood gently grasping the collar for a dress and the scruff of her neck and his teeth and lifted her up upon the mare then he must have told her then he must have told the old gray mare to go home at last she went went with gretchen but no cornmeal home was the camp by the gully where the wagon had broke down gretchen's parents were so happy at having her restored that they did not mind the loss of the cornmeal after she told her adventures she showed the nipped places on her legs and after years she told the story of many many times if her children and grandchildren seem doubtful of the facts she would in a pet pull down her cotton stockings and show the small faint scars in her legs where the wild mares had nipped her the children would have to believe her and that was the story of gretchen and the white stallion there is something incredibly romantic about the old west something about the stories ring true to how human beings are i think at their core curious strong their love for adventure their love for creating stories i'm really excited for this chapter and i hope you are too thank you for joining me for another story time with sid um i hope you're all staying happy healthy and safe and i'll see you next week okay bye", "zys5iFl36OA": "hey guys what's up it's boy exotica and in the day's video figured I would do a review on medicated nerds sorry people are always around

wheat taste but yeah you can kind of like at first it tastes really good tastes just like candy and then afterwards you can start to taste the cannabis tastes good then it's not like hard like I was expecting like some edibles sometimes like the gummies are kind of hard in stout this is really fresh we made about that much of it so far I have boys but like I said I'm gonna finish this off I don't know if I should actually know what shad just opting I'm not gonna eat all this cuz I don't know how strong it is I'm gonna try to gauge it still do have some things to do let's take one more bite of

these new sweetheart elope set fights thank you to Rachel for sending me a picture on Instagram and let me know that these were out there I had no idea they were a dollar ninety-nine at Walgreens and there are five different flavors in here three and a half servings are in the container eleven pieces are 110 calories so we have strawberry blue punch cherry apple and orange key what you want I do like the rest and it feels like there is a lot of sugar in here but I'm just gonna read what syringe [Applause] there's a few of them already yeah but that's crazy did we not get all the flowers there's a red pink blue green in the large yeah we got at least two of everything okay red pink blue green and orange yeah you wanna take a picture of these before you eat them all yes there's a little bit about two boys are two greens the whole box yeah so I had to take a picture before we could start just so that we wouldn't eat them all okay why don't we do the the orange these are babies going flat mm-hmm that's baby I love it though that's very good it's got the Tarkan's to it Wow so instead there were three and a half servings in here I've had this is a product of Mexico it says close it no like the flavor I would like turn orange yes the textures really not I give a tortoise dog yes lots and lots of orange Bible and let them how about a strawberry is that the really paint would be they have a nice chewed your home hmm that's it okay story it isn't it's not Jolly Rancher ruling it isn't as sweet of a strawberry even though I mean it is incredibly sweet but there's like a like a starburst strawberry it's not like that yeah it's not that strong yeah it just it's good it just doesn't have the fiber okay how about cherry rude yeah it's a stronger flavor mm-hmm it's heartless Kuchar mm-hmm it's a leaning towards a lifesavers cherry but I still don't think it's that strong no I think I'm lifesavers cherry is stronger but I still like this device it's very good okay blue punch mm-hmm hmm look I'm oh yeah I could definitely get them it's like a fruit punch oh yeah they're calling it blue punched as it's blue but it is like a fruit punch kind of like a kool-aid for no punch um they're gonna fly it's nice and the last one is Apple the green so we mainly have cherry mm-hmm which is good mmm Apple strong I figured the Apple would be stronger that's why when to do it laughs it's a strong it tastes like a blow pop a green blood pop there's an apple that one's nice yeah Apple only ones are the strongest levers yes and then probably the punch then the cherries and the strawberries last I agree I agree even though I like the flavor of the strawberry it just doesn't have as much fiber as I would like for it to have yeah but these are good they're good it's got a good chewy texture to it so stuff is like a gummy right the only thing is you're gonna be tempted it said there's three three and a half servings in here and you're gonna want to eat all of these cuz they're that good yeah I mean you saw how quick we ate five of them they they go pretty fast I mean I guess you could suck on it for a while but me I have a tendency to just treat a minute it gets in my mouth I want to chew it up you know and and move on to the next so I would like know I maybe you should drop if you like a little bit of the sweet and the tart then I think you'll like them too so thank you again to Rachael for telling me about them and thanks for watching [Music]", "upNW4tSmM1U": "please like and subscribe\nhi~ this is JaeYeol ASMR ~ nik-l-nips stick and ice

audience hello yeah but anyways today I am going to be eating or trying to eat a 500 milligram edible that I did find at a lab that I recently went to it was the first time that I had gone there and I just had to pick these up for you guys because I've never seen them ever in my life and once I figured out that these existed I saw a video on YouTube and there was comments saying that they really didn't hear so I'm not sure if I should eat the whole thing or eat a hundred milligrams of it because the other time if you guys haven't seen my if you guys haven't seen my last video I did eat a moon edible 100 milligrams and that edible like totally hit you guys I Loki freaked out so yeah I know that 100 milligrams will do me justice when it comes to properly hitting me right but yeah I had to pick this up for you guys 500 milligrams you guys enough to make me feel like I'm dying I'm not even kidding but I don't think I am gonna eat the whole thing or the whole string but I am gonna offer some people some of the edible its if you want it you want it and if you don't then you don't know pressure let me go ahead and set this camera up for you guys I am going to open and eat this in front of you guys you guys already know the deal so yeah if you guys haven't checked out my last edible video go ahead and check that out and let's do this okay I am literally on my knees for you guys but let's do this okay so this is the edible again you guys look at this cute new packaging I've never seen this type of edible ever I just had to pick it up for you guys I have to I have to this one unfortunately is not really like childproof it does have that starting cut there so it can easily be open unlike the other edibles I've said that it's a great idea not to suggest an opening just because young adults and kids can be around as for me I do have a baby around so you know not good for that but other than that it is cute I love it yeah they're medicated nerds 500 milligrams that's just tripping me out like I don't really believe it but I don't know I mean it just say it on the packaging so it says total dosage is 500 milligrams of THC and the rope has eight servings so let's see I don't know I mean that's you so it's saying one-eighth of the rope is 50 milligrams so we can calculate that by cutting it in half and then cutting it in half again and then cutting it in half again so that's pretty much a small ass piece like literally this is 50 milligrams and then another 50 and like it's just I don't know it's pretty crazy to me it just say that it's 60 minute activation time right there so I guess it's gonna take about an hour just like the other edible that I did consume for you guys so it does have this California warning sign that everyone always looks for on packaging but yeah I mean I wouldn't honestly you guys I wouldn't really trust this because I did buy it and an underground type of lab I've never even heard of this lab I was invited I wasn't even gonna buy anything so these are kind of like products that I'm iffy about so I don't know I guess you have to do your research I didn't do much research but I did see a video online yeah that was it that was pretty much it if you guys do want to have more research on this go ahead and look up videos because I'm pretty sure these are getting more known out there but yeah enough talking I'm just super talking talking maybe because I'm so nervous I don't know but let me go get some scissors actually no it has the tear there um and then let's do this so let me do a quick thumbnail and then we'll get back to it it is so hot in here you guys I'm really trying to just do this so let's do it okay yeah ready or not here we go so it says teryn share which I do plan on doing I am going as my uncle probably if he wants to try some hey baby baby okay I'm doing a video let's do it so I'm gonna open it sorry my babies in the background you guys okay look at this you guys what the heck so I had this in the refrigerator and my mom was just like freaking out telling everyone this is not a candy that this is marijuana and Dada Dada and I mean yeah precautions you guys so I'm gonna have 1/8 of the rope okay so 1/8 of the rope that's what it looks like you guys and it does say on the packaging it is 15 milligrams so here goes nothing not a soul bomb maybe you wanna try some it's so bomb you guys this is dangerous oh my gosh you guys okay two eights of the rope so this is gonna be a total of 100 milligrams why is that so bhama if you guys hear little parts as my sister's baby they just want to be cheese massage they want to be here and watch me the film for you guys these are so so bomb he says that it has a super potent formula okay I think I should keep it like that cuz I don't want to freak out you guys but okay I'll have a little more so I can have half of it which is gonna be 250 here's another one so it should be about 250 milligrams if not maybe a little less a little more nice learn can't film here you guys it is so hot in here mom like I ate a little less or a little more of 250 milligrams you guys I'm gonna feel like I'm dying but I'm yeah let me go see if anybody else wants to have a little piece of it maybe just 50 milligrams or a little more I don't mind sharing this it's whatever I did post this on snap so if you do follow me on snap you know that I did post this and I asked you guys if you guys have ever tried these and some of you guys said that they smack which is why I'm kind of scared because I don't want them to smack me so hard but some of you guys said that they don't so I guess it's just our personal experience and yeah I hope that they don't super smack but if they do a Plus let's go see who else wants to try some of these so we are gonna go outside and I am so hot here because I closed all the windows and doors so that no noise could come in but yeah your girls ready to go outside and just breathe but I will be checking up when this [ __ ] starts to hit and let you guys know what I feel so yeah let's go outside [Music] do you want to chase up it's a 500 milligram nerd okay you guys my uncle is down so go ahead and open it and then 1/8 of the rope is gonna be 50 milligrams so right there it does okay getting eighth you know what anything I know how an ape looks and we know candy no a little more a little more this would be good in them yeah I mean if there's a 500 milligram rope come with me yeah cheers Cheers you have to let us know how you feel okay I am back and I am definitely feeling this edible more of like a body high I feel yeah like maybe more of a body higher than anything else I'm like slowly freaking out like I can just feel it creeping up right now we are watching a movie so yeah I can definitely feel it while I'm watching the movie and yeah I'm pretty good right now but you guys I can definitely feel it just like it's gonna hit me like I know it's gonna hit me super hard and I just I hope that I don't freak out but yeah this is an update this is probably almost an hour after I ate the edible so keep in mind I ate about 250 milligrams this is about an hour later which yeah like the packaging said that it would hit me 16 minutes later and it's about that and I can definitely feel it creeping up right now so yeah this isn't even this isn't even the full-blown like faded moment but I will be back for that I hope that I am not freaking out or anything but yeah my mom is making carnitas and I just cut onion and cilantro and yeah I helped her in the kitchen and I'm gonna show you guys what we're eating because it just looks so bomb you guys that goes everyday bomb like super bomb and they make the best that Anita's so shout out to them but anyways let me get back to you guys and then if anything when I start to really feel it I will also ask how my uncle is feeling because he did take about 50 milligrams so he isn't really gonna feel as much but he'll definitely be feeling something if this rope is potent like it's saying it is but yeah I'll be back I already ate a taco and it was so so bomb but this is what they look like ooh ooh they look so bomb the airplane the baby I totally forgot to record I am still a little faded I honestly thought I was gonna hit harder but it didn't the day is still going the days are going so I'll be back to let you guys know the update so I thought the Edible was going to hit a little harder after the last video that I did make but no incident I was probably peaking right there and it didn't go any further than that but um yeah I was expecting it to hit a little harder just because I did consume a 250 milligrams and it just wasn't that heart of a high or a faded moment but yeah I mean would I buy them again I probably wouldn't maybe for the flavor and the taste because it tastes so bomb but for it to like actually hit and make me feel super faded mmm I don't know I'm gonna have to think about that one but yeah it was pretty good I enjoyed it I still have a little bit left and yeah I'm pretty sure it did hit my feel not as much but yeah he's knocked out after a while I thought it was gonna hit a little harder but it didn't so that's kind of a shame because other edibles that I have tried they've hit pretty hard so yeah when I buy this again sorry I'm in the kitchen and everyone's eating and I just decided the wrong time let you guys know the update but yeah it didn't hit that hard would I buy it again maybe not maybe for the flavor and taste but for it to hit me hard no I'll probably do a moon because with a moon edible eye it got me so good with just one hundred milligrams I did check up on my uncle he is totally asleep so yeah I guess I'm gonna ask him later how he felt after the edible but yeah it was a good run I did enjoy the edible it was really fun eating it I was pretty excited and yeah I've never seen an edible like that and I'm glad that I tried it for you guys like a rating out of 10 probably like I don't know a 7 just because it peaked and then that was it like I didn't really feel like super faded or anything maybe I was more of a body high but yeah other than that it was good I hope they get like the video I'm gonna show you guys a bit of what my sister is making and then that's the end of the video or maybe I'll include a little more because we are gonna drink later so other than that thank you guys for watching do not forget to Like comment and subscribe but okay but yeah let me show you guys what my sister's doing because it looks so fun oh so good were the beers

see you guys in the next video and Cheers", "IZ5AS2mBK-w": "what's the hold on YouTube it's the Lauren aka Nubia 420 and today I will be making some storm and gummies into infused gummies with my own homemade tincture that I did here with a little Keith so if you've seen a green dragon video then you know how to make a tincture this specific one was made with Keef there is a video on that so if you're not sure how to do it check it out I will link it up here in in the cards and let's get started so we have gummies you can make any you can make this with any football company our Dollar Tree just happens to have these and we're gonna go ahead and cover them in some nerds so it's going to be the infamous nerd rope but not a rope shake because we're going to use these heart molds here so it'll be a little more adult then we're gonna have a good time so let's go ahead and get started we have our pot here with about an inch of water in it and then we have our mixing bowl and we're going to use this to double boil and then melt down work on these so that we can work with them so let's turn my stove on it turn to medium heat you don't want to heat it up medium-high heat and now we have a double boiler now I'm not the cook in this relationship so I don't make things from scratch so you will never see me making tactically scraps which is a video on our channel if you're interested I like cheap [Music] if you care about the colors of your dummy you should separate them and melt them down by color so just as these nope this isn't the easiest method it no honestly you can probably make some gummies from scratch it should be easier to work with the knees then whatever I had these I wanted to try it so here we are [Music] okay so we are this is what it looks like all melted down we're gonna go ahead and drop something tincture in and we're gonna mix that up so we calculated our texture at about three milligrams per drop and this is about 20 drops right here so we're just gonna throw that anything down this is a Everclear based texture it's not an oil-based tincture I don't know what this will work for William Hastings I'm sure there are recipes out there that use it you have to find one of those recipes this is alcohol you share it with us yes please no other if you know of a recipe that uses real oil-based future luckily in bully evaporate as this continues to heat it just a little bit more the treatises we added it which is good for porn is hormones [Music] Tomic shirts wet distribute it with it I do don't want one go meet us you know ten milligrams and then another tummy is 15 because another one is zero so I mix it up do this is you have to work fast so it's probably not a great idea to do a whole bunch at one time working in small batches it's probably better so don't we come over here I'm actually going to skip the measuring cup then just try to pull it straight into our moon from this bad boy right here so I'm always sprayed with cooking spray so try to help the release be a little bit easier I kept my double boil it is just home low just the case this heart is up to where I can't really work with it [Music] [Music] obviously if you're making these other people don't touch it fingers are you making it for yourself do whatever you want okay so we didn't get the entire tray filled we only have enough for two four six eight piece of seven and a half I want to call that one whole but now they're gonna go in the freezer for about two hours until you know they're nice and frozen never want to take them out and we'll cook them in the nerves and they will let them dry out so that's it into the freezer big deal okay so we grabbed our gummies out of the freezer I took them out after about an hour just because our freezers turned up so high and it's so tiny that it freezes super fast and um we're gonna pop them out and then what you want to do is take your nerve and spread them out on a tray or on a sheet so the phone and you see they're a little tacky but not totally you're just gonna sit them right in that sheet right there and then we're gonna go ahead and coat them for these delicious candies so it's not a rope but it's literally all the same ingredients as the rope but I feel like this is much more manageable a much more manageable tree and they just kind of so you want to let them fall out a little bit because they get tacky as they're falling but you see right now and it's not really sticking it does a little bit but you got to kind of work it and then what's your color these they're going to sit on the countertop now you can cover them with it's how and they'll sit on a countertop for I believe 24 hours 24 to 48 hours to dry out it's something that you want to do to you've got man so this part does take on a little bit of time to do making sure you get good and then we have our test one here that we've already covered as you can see but not too many it's not too bad you mean you just pop it in your mouth and eat it people seem to like them I'm not sure why but this needs on itself alright and here we have the final product our hearts covered in nerd ropes these are that when you sit out for probably a day or two just to dry out and go ahead and eat them be eights I'm already very different very sweet probably 10 years ago but I love these not too sure how I feel about them right now they definitely have a cake that tincture is kick in we will be making some gummies from scratch I won't that will be way up goodies and that will be coming very soon in the meantime it has been a pleasure hope you guys enjoy the recipe let me know if you have any questions my comment subscribe do all that good stuff so have a good one everybody stay safe hope you've enjoyed your quarantine here but you know Rona V out there coming for all of us alright have a good one peace [Music]", "KUDCkx7SPCQ": "[Applause] wait after just that I'm wet cheese touch wait actually put some

crazy candies first a new way to be nerdy Willy Wonka makes a playful nerds rope that's measured in miles hi everybody welcome to unwrapped I'm Marc summers and today we're exploring candy so unique it can only be called wild and crazy now here's the question are you the type that likes to play with your candy perhaps you would like to wear it well these are nerds ropes and they can be a necklace perhaps a bracelet or they can be stretched out like that now how do they think of these things and how do they make them let's watch call it colorful and crazy twisty or tasty nerds rope stretch the imagination net syrup has quite quite something it's a gummy Center covered in rainbow nerds it's like a big delicious strand of DNA nerds ropes are fairly new but regular nerds have been around since 1983 the most popular flavors are great and strawberry and if you like them tart they also makes our nerds and flavors like lightning lemon and amped Apple usually one box of nerds has two flavors but the Nerds rope is like a cluster of five colors and flavors grape orange lemon watermelon and strawberry it's it's quite an experience Willy Wonka invited us into his private factory in Itasca Illinois where nerds ropes roll off the conveyor in not feet but miles we're to line up all of our nerds ropes that we make in one day end to end we have over 60 miles of nerds rope believe it or not it's thought this sugary strand came about by accident the word run factories that one day there were load of nerds laying around and somebody was experimenting with some gummies that mystery inventor apparently dribbles some of the gummy mixture over a pile of nerds and then he went to lunch and then when they came back they discovered this amazing thing and then they said about how to how to create this so that lots of people could enjoy it and they were very successful before you can have a nerds rope you have to have nerds nerds are just as iconic amazing candy that has tons of character I mean I think when you see them being made it just it just blows your mind more than a hundred fifty million of these tiny crunchy candies coat the ropes each day we start off with a sugar crystal and we just keep coating head with with more sugar liquid corn syrup the sugar spins and pans like this and slowly grows into lots of uniquely shaped nerds we keep a tin trigger on and different layers and so we get the full nerd check out these naked nerds this is what they look like before they add color assignment we start to the time that we're done it's about six hours meantime the gummy Center cooks with gelatin sugar and a special ingredient citric acid for fruity flavor we're going to take this will cook that mixture and that gives us this yummy this gummy that is warm into the rope from there we run it through a shower of a gajillion nurse this is not a shower of nerds it's more like a storm countless little candies cover the long sticky red ropes then they cut them and cool them down and within a few minutes a conveyor leads the finished ropes to a container called au bord and that u board allows us to be able to wrap it so it'll maintain its shape as we send it out each rainbow-colored creation slides into a shiny foil wrapper as for what happens next well that's up to whoever opens it nerd roof is just one of those super super creative canoes I mean it's just like pure imagination I would say it's a one-of-a-kind absolutely so the next time your kids want a colorful candy edition to play dress-up how about a nerds rope ring or belt for candy bling nerds ropes make a funny fashion statement and an even better edible accessory", "_7HjM6a7bo8": "hey welcome one welcome all welcome to sack day so last week was the first installment of snack day here on my channel and every Friday I will review a snack that is either one of my favorites or a recommendation that has come from you guys and last week snack was the birthday cake Oreos which is one of my favorite snacks to have on hand at all times I love birthday cake Oreos and as I said in that video that United States or American birthday cake Oreos are my favorites so the snack that I'm featuring today is a snack that I only tried last week but I heard heard lots of things about a lot of youtubers have talked about this snack on their channel either on monthly favorites or however they have talked about it but I have never been able to get my hands on it and something that I've always wanted to try especially with my love of sweets and my love of candy and it is a nerd robes so I found these at a local candy store here in Vancouver actually in tuas and they import a lot of their candies and it's more of a specialized candy store I've never been able to find these nerd ropes anywhere else in Canada let alone even in the United States I've always wanted to try them I love nerds I love candy so anything that's fun and flavorful like these candies are definitely up my alley and I had three flavors I obviously tried one last week when I got them I couldn't keep my hands off them but the flavors that I have here today are I guess a limited edition Valentine's Day flavor I'm not sure exactly what flavor this is but I'm sure that it would just be like a sweet berry flavor and then I have very berry which again I think would be really similar to the Valentine's Day one I find that nerds have a flavor but they're not always distinguishable sometimes they kind of just blend into a sour sweet flavor so you can't really tell that they have a specific flavor but it's nice to buy the different flavors I don't even remember which one is the one I try think it was just rainbow so it was multi flavor so it was nice and basically what nerd ropes are I'll open one for you look in the Valentine's Day one as it was Valentine's Day recently immersed in February so basically what is it's falling out of the package so basically what nerd ropes is is a rope of this gummy candy that's not super chewy but something that is there to hold on to the Nerds and gives a different texture in your mouth rather than the crunchy nerds and the Nerds are all wrapped around this rope so essentially it is just a long gummy candy with nerds on it not sure why this was so appealing to me I mean I do love nerds as it falls out at the package I do love nerds and I do love anything sweet so I always wanted to try it there's a fun way to eat nerds rather than just out of the box and putting in your mouth you can take bites of it and it's nice at different texture so you have the crunchy texture and then the chewy chewy soft texture as well I really enjoyed these keeps pulling on the package I really enjoyed the one that I had tried I don't know if it's worth the price because when I bought them at that specialty candy store I guess because they are imported they were a little bit expensive there are three dollars I think a little under three dollars for one of these which I guess is expensive for candy although usually I don't mind spending a little bit more on any kind of candy that I'm willing to try I don't know if I'd keep these like in stock as I say in my house but I mean it's nice for to try it out once in awhile or if I'm just in the mood for something like that but yeah these are the nerd ropes this is a Valentine's Day one this is the very very one I would recommend it to try it if you can if you've never tried it before they're really enjoyable so if you have easy access to them or know where they sell them or just love nerds I would definitely recommend to try this it'd be fun to have if you were just I guess stored in the movies or even having a candy party or just having a candy table you know at a wedding or any kind of event kind of thing it would be fun to have the Nerds ropes and yeah so that's the nerd ropes and that snack day for today any other recommendations you guys have definitely put them in the comments below I love snacks so give me any kind of suggestions I am heading to the states this weekend so if you have any American candy suggestions definitely let me know and I love you for you

it I have to put it in the fridge for a couple minutes - five six minutes and then you take it out now you have to make sure it starts sticking to the side of the bowl up that's how you know it's ready then you have to make sure that the sides will come off so how I do that is I try driving a lot of it and I pull it up [Music] [Music] I'm doing that we have to light our nodes or plate this first for a little bit you see have compared to when we were mixing it to get in the Discworld see this is gonna be the inside of our nerve room you have to make sure it gets harder and harder stretch so you have to knead it for a little while and then what we do and we would put it on a plate and let it sit in the fridge so it would get used to its shape and then we roll it in the nerves and so keep the shape that's why I had to grab minority classes pretty nerdy nerdy nerdy because I mean we're working with nerds so as you can see it's getting harder and harder for me to stretch so now on your fingers my hands my hands when I [Music] go in but then you stick around it [Music] [Music] [Music] we want to get as much as we can on there to cover every single spot just like the actual nerve

Hopefully it'll be very interesting look it's an actual whistle *tries to whistle* It's not doing anything *mores whistle noises* Okay, it's not working But it tastes good. I know that the whistle pop tastes a lot better than this this is a little bit bland It doesn't really have a flavor it has a flavor, but it's not really like pungent and strong All right, winner goes up to the little whistle pop Next up we have the world's largest gummy worm First is the regular gummy worm so let's check this out.

I love it. Okay Let's open this up though. Yeah, you're right look at that. Look at all these sour patch kids look at that That is that is great i don't really eat, sour patch kids because they get stuck in between my teeth, so whatever you eat candy Everybody make sure you floss your teeth or else your teeth will fall out And then you'll be really mad and sad the rest of your life, not going to eat it or anything But now we know what's inside the giant sour patch kids box It's a small one, and then a small one i don't know if that even makes sense *music plays , dances* Last but not least we have the giant sweet tart versus the regular sweet tart Do you think inside here contains giant sweet tarts, or just a whole bunch of Smaller sweet tarts comment down below alright.

to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching

to them you can overtake me thank you for watching see you next time bye", "cHWSKeBuFqs": "one of my favorite things about going to the movie was picking out candy I remember as a kid I used to get licorice and bite off the ends and use it as a straw but if you're looking for some of the best licorice you've ever had make sure you check out Tim Bo's licorice I might get Murray I'm Tiffany nice to meet you nice to meet you Tiffany to meet you so Wow look at all the colors it makes me so happy is this part of your marketing plan yes the colors are inspiring thing 10-feet like become happy when did this all get started basically last year we saw this decided that we should bring it and offer it to the public on a full-time basis what was the inspiration behind Tim Bo's licorice this is the inspiration for me this is my baby I see that there's a huge variety of flavors and there's a traditional black licorice what makes your black licorice so different than the other the black licorice is done with real licorice root it's not done with anise and it's not done with a bunch of chemicals to change the real flavor it doesn't carry the nasty after bite that most of the licorice is you find nowadays in the black do and then are some of these flavors exclusive to Tim bows licorice yes some of the flavors are exclusive for instance the new strawberry banana down here which is one of our very outstanding colors and everything is of our own design the spicy black is of our own design spicy black that's something you never hear we brought the spicy black because I personally think the beer drinkers need a choice to they say candy and beer doesn't go together we've solved that problem well another exclusively half is a strawberry banana it's a very colorful licorice rope and it tastes like so yummy but what our customers really are getting excited about it's a sour rainbow because it has all the fruits in it where is this all made it's made in Spain Spain that's a long way to go to get some licorice if you want the best you go to the best source and in our opinion we have found that Spain makes the best in the world and as you can see the most beautiful so I'm ready to do some tasting okay let's go start here with the spicy black sour watermelon and sour rainbow and of course don't forget to traditional black the black licorice nice to go so you don't have to eat it all at once thank you so much Maria where can we find you guys we have a Facebook site and a website that lists our current locations and our up-and-coming locations so you can find us and I

and I'll see you guys in a future video bye", "qqK060xvpIg": "[Music] hi there guys so good it's really good to see you welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary we help you make sense of all those millions of seeming products at your dispensary all those bags with all those candies and gummies and cookies and cakes and whatever and drinks how do you know which ones to spend your hard-earned money on which ones did you avoid that's what weeds is here for that's what we're here for and today we're gonna let you know if it appears 100 milligram Rocky Widow is worth your money I don't believe it's going to be this little guy cost me ten dollars for one hundred milligram edible and I think I'm going to wish I spent my money elsewhere the rocky rope again is 100 milligrams from a tap here I've reviewed several that appears before found them to be lacking too severely lacking so I hope this one is just simply lacking and up here I found it to be bad on the really bad to be on the taste dimension for most of their products they taste they have that really astringent app weed aftertaste that it's really bitter and acidic kind of taste so I hope this would taste better because it's basically just a nerds rope I think it looks like the Nerds should hopefully mask the flavor of the gummy on the inside also I don't know I guess the gummy is the only part where the THC actually is and the Nerds on the outside don't have any or doesn't contain THC so you can see it here at standard-issue nerds rope up should they call it the rocky road so I'm going to eat the whole thing in front of you guys here I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know if this is actually worth your hard earned money um alright so without any further ado I'm gonna shut up stick this in my mouth hole here we go and there comes the weed taste and that comes stronger I was about to say oh it didn't taste so bad the Nerds are kind of like a cool cruel prank they mask the original flavor I go oh it's sweet and tasty and then you get into the jellied rope and then then comes that after flavor but it is not as bad as some of the other gummies that I've had like their standard gummy bears are way worse way worse tasting so this one for gummy is not bad I can totally get through this one all right you guys get the idea I think I lied when I said I was gonna eat the whole thing in front of you because it's gonna take longer I thought chewy but I won't finish it and I will come after you guys in two hours - what - no that this ed up your rocky rope and I'll finish this little nerves at the bottom - it's worth your money so thank you so much for watching weights guys we'll see you in two hours at pure I'm sorry just not what $10 I'm not high at all 100 milligrams of THC supposedly I have one more at appeared to review and I think that will be my last foray into and a pure in not there any worse than any other like your infused creations or voodoo sours I don't I don't think that they're necessarily and worse they might even be slightly better in terms of taste and consistency well I think voodoo tastes better but maybe in potency consistency in potency but who knows gummies just do not work for me why and and be though your mileage may vary you may gummies gummies may work for you animals manifest themselves weird ways and different people but they are not for me and I would not recommend them to anybody they don't taste good they don't get you high or they don't taste good to me they don't get me high and I just don't find anything pleasurable about them so I'll do my one last at a peer review that I've got and then I am going to say that we have reviewed enough and appear to know that ah that they are not for me and probably shouldn't be for you either okay guys that's gonna do it for this episode and this review here on wheats thank you so much for watching sorry to blast that appear so much here but again it's just done I can't help it it's you know if I'm not high I'm not high thank you so much for watching guys we'll check you out on the next review peace hello and thank you so

"[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'll be showing you how to infuse starbursts so delicious and surprisingly was one of the easiest edibles i've ever made and i feel like i'm going to make these many times in the future they turned out so well [Music] to make these starbursts here's what you're going to need some starburst candy i wish i could have had the all pink kind but we don't sell them in canada so i just got the original infuse coconut oil and optionally you can also use a concentrate or extract to make them extra strong and some lecithin to help with absorption first i have the top part of my double boiler and then i'm going to peel the wrapper off of some starbursts and place them in the bowl i use 30 pieces here but the amount you use doesn't matter too much the recipe is very forgiving then you're gonna heat up a pot to a light boil and place your double boiler container thing on top and then using the spatula you're going to use to mix everything together add a scoop of some lecithin and then mix that in they do take quite a while to melt so just keep an eye on them and for the first five minutes or so they probably won't melt that much so you can pretty much just leave them be but then after five minutes when they start to melt like this um just keep stirring them and watching them until they melt all the way down then once everything is pretty much melted like this we can add our coconut oil so i'm going to be adding one tablespoon of coconut oil but you can add for this amount of starburst up to three tablespoons of coconut oil and to make it stronger i'm also going to be adding some concentrate now we just have to mix everything together so i'm having some trouble getting the starburst and the oil to emulsify together you can see um the oil kind of just doesn't really blend into it at all so i'm going to grab a whisk and see if that'll help us emulsify a little bit better so using the whisk aggressively actually turned out very well everything mixed together and it worked better than i expected honestly now i'm just going to put my starburst mixture onto a baking pan that is covered in waxed paper and then i'm just going to place another sheet of wax paper on top and kind of roll it and shape it out to the thickness i want in the end i feel like i wish i would have made it a little bit thicker so it would have been the exact same thickness of actual starburst but next time i'll do that i guess and then i just use this sharp utensil to kind of just shape it so i could have nice corner edges and then i placed it in the fridge now while i'm waiting for it to cool in the fridge i'm going to heat up my double boiler again because um i don't want to waste any of the starburst and the coconut oil mixture that's left in the pot so i'm going to make a little drink out of it so i have a whole video on how to do this and to be honest that video is going to give you a much tastier result than this one because this is just like a little makeshift one i did and i'll post the link of how to make that drink below pretty much you're just going to add some water and heat it up so you can get all the mixture combined and then you're going to add a drink mix to it and then cool it and serve it over ice but check out the video i have on how to make an infused starburst drink because it's like literally one of the most delicious drinks i've ever had and you can put quite a bit of coconut oil in there and you can't taste it which is very surprising considering how much i put in it okay so now that our drink is made and our starburst has cooled down a bit i actually left mine in the fridge a little bit too long it was about a half an hour and i felt like it was a little bit too hard for me to cut easily so i just took it out of the fridge for five ten minutes until it was ready to be cut so i'm just going to start by cutting these little edges on the side which i'll probably just snap on while i'm cutting and then i'm going to cut all of these into squares after i cut them i realized that i feel like the size was not accurate to the size of a starburst so when i make these next time i'm going to actually place a starburst on there and measure it out now they're all done so i'm just going to throw them into their little container and that's it they are ready to eat [Music] these turned out so well i'm so so happy with them this is probably going to be my go-to instead of gummies now they just just everything is amazing thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thanks so much guys have a wonderful day [Music] you", "YuSwQkSviVg": "hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at another edible this time a nerd rope edible but a special flavor so you can see with the numbers and basketballs this is the LA Lakers version of the medicated nerds rope as you can imagine these are obviously black market I highly doubt the Lakers would want their name on this but yeah there's a little symbol there I saved the part that I tore just so I could show this um and the flavors amazing grape cherry lemonade and you see the has like a lightning yellow and purple lightning and if you'll notice these new flavors are for 20 milligrams instead of 400 I've reviewed one of these before on my channel but just in case you haven't seen that these are the nutrition effects oh that's before just said they're the amount of servings now it says the serving size is one inch 50 milligrams I don't know why the mg is bold that they kind of doesn't make sense but I've got ingredients there believe something has changed like an added ingredient anyway 1/8 of the rope is a thoughtful portion I would say that's pretty accurate and a 60 minute activation time so be very careful what you're gonna eat and then wait wait a good amount of time before you eat anymore yeah these are there's been a few different people making these but they've added they just added a few flavors like this one and there's a I believe it's like a green apple or no watermelon they added a cherry so be out be on the lookout for those if you've tried this specific Lakers flavor let me know what you think yeah I got mad videos like this on my channel edibles dab karts all that kind of thing and yeah goodbye", "uV-TC-I7fMY": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] wow that was so good what'd they do that so much for watching", "L8AjbMbel_s": "i saw joe falcon no i saw something

gonna sound like i was i'm making this up but uh i see the guy like as he's talking and as he's about to be handed his um candy he's fidgeting with his pocket and then i'm like what the [ __ ] is going on here truly just such a hard dick his dick was so [ __ ] hard for the candy for the candy what was the other explanation the the person checking him out is an old lady i don't think he was

they were specifically the kind of paint if you want your penis to look good if you want your penis to look good you would wear these sweatpants it's very funny to also to imagine the guy that was

away well it's definitely not nerds rope it's not nerds ropes no we have we've got a lot of a lot of uh anecdotal evidence to back that up yeah although maybe there hasn't been you know scientific full full clinical trials if you went in to every cell and chopped up chopped out a little bit of the chromosome that is a very sweet story i mean i'm incredibly endeared by it it was so cute yeah because the first part is you never see a dick that hard and you're like awesome initially i didn't want to laugh at it because it's like yeah let him get the [ __ ] case oh no but it's like it's pure joy yeah yeah yeah yeah totally the hard-ass dick is where it really yeah when did a disney movie territory god i was [Laughter] [Music] otherwise i would have had a crisis of conscience [Music] yeah

post you don't want to make it you do not want to miss it trust us you do not want to miss any of the content that we're dropping let's show you some content what did the guy today oh we got the new bangs new bags we got the nerd nerd rope coming with that new thing new thang tropical nerds robe what you got I got the very very nerds rope this don't say you want to put the boss new I never seen this on all I seen with the red one I seen them both I had to grab them both just one coming a nice little gold wrapper blue wrapper and then you got the og with the red wrapper now if you're not familiar with nerds ropes nerds are a little crunchy candy a little sweet kind of tangy real small real small you can pray put a thousand to your mouth so then they stick them to like a like almost like a licorice rope or real thin like shoestring licorice rope and there you go got a nerds rope like yellow jello kind of like a jelly a jelly yeah like a jelly jelly licorice so let's crack it open let's see what we got going on as we told you there are little nerds oh my god jelly string so this is a tropical and this is very berry all right so we gonna try to tropical first so break off here go a little piece for you little hoodie so we're gonna cheers it up laughing do you sit you sit where do you have to say about the tropical you could taste like that pineapple that kind of tropical fruit flavor tour you can definitely taste it good texture there's rope nerves rope is it's in a top ten candy for me definitely in the top ten candy sheesh can never go wrong with the Nerds rope let's see what that very berry talking about though that very very nerds room what I like about that fish obviously forgive me forgive me son forgive me what you got to say what the tropical nerds wrote I don't know what the big sub of me for though what's the picture was to be for know maybe peak maybe the green I'm I'm thinking it would be um like climb or something baby then the yellow is the pineapple the red jelly tastes like carry yeah then that's it it does just like a regular no drop kinda kind of does taste like a regular nerds rule but you can just kind of taste those flavors coming through the pineapple I think it's lime like said peachy get a little bit of peach in there too so let's see what that very berry talking about cheers it up what see you ah the beriberi what you think about the maryberry I think anytime something is buried to me it always has a strong blueberry taste to it I'm not a fan of real blueberries I'm not a fan of blueberry case I don't know why it I don't know if Boo Berry just has a stronger taste and overpowers everything but it pretty much tastes like blueberry to me and I'm not not a fan of that so like little honey said the tropical nerves rope gets the honey stamp of approval the Very Berry to me does not if you are a fan of the blueberry I would suggest you get the Very Berry I will definitely buy the tropical again the Very Berry I'll probably leave this one on the shelves would you would you buy the tropical again would you buy the Very Berry again as always like comment subscribe let us know are you a fan of nerds ropes if you've never there they're kind of like a forgotten candy a lot of times people have never even had a nerds rope go try one go get the red one that's the original if you see the tropical go ahead and grab that and if you see the Very Berry in your pan of blueberry 2% game [Music]", "l6nx2cc-nEg": "[Music] so uh foreign so [Music] you so uh so go oh so so so so so so two yeah two wow

video for you guys and I'm very excited about this one because I think it's going to make a lot of people's lives a lot easier and it is going to be delicious today we're going to be doing a little experiment making gummies out of two ingredients store-bought gummy bears tincture or coconut oil so I just bought some gummies from bulk barn any gummies are fine and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to melt these down and I'm gonna add to some of them tincture and to some of them coconut oil and we're gonna see how they're going to turn out I think the ones with tincture will turn out amazing the coconut oil ones I'm not so sure about so let's try it out and see how it goes PS these are like the best gummies ever they're the Albanese brand you can buy them at a lot of places and they're so good they have like the best flavors the green ones and the white ones are my favorite so I'm actually not going to use them for this recipe so I'm probably gonna eat them while I'm melting them first step is to sort your gummies you don't have to smoke them if you don't want to but I want all my colors to be separate all right let's do this so I separated my gummies into yellow and orange purple and then my favorite ones just to eat while I'm doing this and we're gonna melt them and then add in our ginger and coconut oil and see how it goes I have no idea how long it's going to take us to microwave them so I'm going to start with like 15 second intervals and just check on them and then we'll find out how long it takes to melt them without over putting them I don't know so start with these great ones here there's a total of 13 gummy bears in here and they're just regular sized right there I mean they're a little bit bigger than like kuriboh gummy bears um but they're pretty standard so I was going bears and you guys can even see that okay so I'm gonna check on them in about 15 seconds and see how warmed up and melted they are so that's 20 seconds and they're starting to melt but they still need a little bit more so I put it in there for another 10 seconds okay so this is a total of 30 seconds pretty much melted and good to go I'm gonna add my tincture into here for this amount of gummies I'm going to do 1/2 a teaspoon of tincture so it's just room temperature you don't want to have it like really cold or frozen because it will affect the heat from the gummy so we'll just put that half a teaspoon in so there it is and let's see how well this stirrer is in if it doesn't stir it hopefully you guys can see that can you oh you guys can't even see that there we go so hopefully that stirs in well and if it doesn't we are going to add some lesson and lecithin into this to help combine it but I think that there's enough things and the gummy bears to start with that we shouldn't have any issues getting this to emulsify or combine or whatever you want to call it so that looks pretty good and then we're just gonna put these into a mold the same way you would with homemade gummies and let them sit and we will move on to our next batch so this is quite a bit thicker then they're coming mixtures so it seems like it's kind of hard for the little syringe to pull it up so that's one a little bit of an issue here so let's see yeah see we can't really soak it up so our options would be to microwave it more so it gets more liquidy or to add more liquid but I do not want to add more liquid so I am going to put it in the microwave for another 10 seconds okay so that was another ten seconds for a total of 30 are sorry a total of 40 seconds and I think they should be good enough to be able to put into our molds so I have about half in the mold then it's being a little bit trickier to put in that I thought it was going to be I'm having some trouble like getting the the dropper to like suction it up and that's because it is really thick so again I'm going to put it into the microwave for another 10 seconds and warm it up some more now if you had a lot more going there zero melting I'm like I did it this won't be as much of an issue because the heat will contain itself because there's a larger amount because there's such a small amount that's getting cooled off quicker and thickening faster and also like my dropper is like has a limited stuff to suck up so that won't be if you're doing a larger amount but it's not hurting anything by putting it in the microwave for just like 10-15 second intervals you just have to make sure you work kind of fast so let's throw that back in okay so looks a little different now I guess it just melted a lot more it's a lot more liquidy and put these interim moles okay so I put the purple ones into a molds now let's try some more but with the coconut oil let's do the yellow ones one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen so we'll do thirteen of them just like we did last time and then we're gonna microwave this I'm going to start it with 40 seconds okay here's our 40 seconds melted they're nice and liquidy still might be a bit of an issue with the syringe dropper thing but if you have like one of those bottles you can dispense them with that'll be like way easier but let's add in the coconut oil so I hope you know what nut oil is what I expect to be the most difficult but I think that there's already less lecithin in the gummy bears so the oil should be able to emulsify pretty good but we'll find out so let's have it half a teaspoon of coconut oil okay we got our half teaspoon let's mix that in so so far it's actually mixing in really well that's all something I do for gummy bears with tincture instead of coconut oil because they I think they taste better but I know that most people you should just have coconut oil on hand the texture is a little bit different with the coconut oil I'm going to put that back in the microwave for another like 15 seconds alright so I did another 10 seconds I thought 15 might be too much all right now let's put these in their molds it looks like it's a lot harder using these so I'm gonna use one of my squeeze bottles which will be a lot you hear well I guess I should say hopefully it will be a lot easier you can see that like the coconut oil's making it like that doesn't like stick to the sides of the bottle that much I'm actually very surprised how well the cup oil mixed in oh my god that's so hot oh god it burns okay so don't touch hot melted candy because it is really hot and it hurts okay and this is cooled off a bit now that I've changed the bottle so hopefully it comes out okay if not I'll put it until I got a hot bowl of water or something look at all that gelatin or gummies sitting on the top there and I gotta get him down I'm just gonna leave this to sit upwards to get this to come down guys it's just it's it's too sticky this didn't really work that well either I'm gonna take the metal cap off and I'm gonna put it in the microwave just like this hopefully that works okay I did it ten seconds in the microwave it still doesn't look like it's gonna come out like this No okay this is not working either see another way that we can get this into the mold I mean like it's still gonna taste delicious I'm probably gonna have to eat a lot of this like just peel out of the bowl and stuff okay my plan was to cut a hole and squish this through but I don't think that's gonna happen well let's let's try see oh it's working okay I mean it's a little hardened now Oh No okay this is not working very well okay so the melting of the gummy bears and adding coconut oil didn't work very well I don't know why it seems like it almost got like harder like I now I'm just wondering if I like I microwaved it too many times like I don't know it just it won't come out really it's too thick to come out of anything so I'm gonna make another batch with the tincture just to test that out um again and see it's like it's definitely going to work or if it's user error and I mean it still I'd still take my get it a fruit roll-up it still tastes good if you wanted to you just melt them and then I mean this is really good little easy to get through oh look but you could just melt it and put it onto like parchment paper or silicone and peel it off after and just cut it into strips it's like the same thing it just won't be in the molds the actual gummy product mixed really well - coconut oil it tastes amazing of course you just they just happen to make sure it's pretty making the mold so still work very good I'll be snacking on this later okay let's do some more with the orange gummies and let's put some more tincture and then this time 1112 where do we do 13 or 12 I remember 30 I think and you don't have to do 13 so it's just the number I'm doing I don't know just - just what it is I'm doing and yeah you can just use whatever amount you want obviously you're really good okay let's microwave this you've got 30 seconds we're gonna do double the tincture so one teaspoon instead of half a teaspoon see this looks like it might have been too much tincture too much liquid and they might not set but you could always add more gelatin but I have a feeling these will set they'll just be a lot softer but if you want them to be able to firmer you could just add a sprinkle of gelatin a little more liquidy consistency as will definitely be easier to put into our moulds hopefully this one works a bit better I think it will we just got to act fast I mean using a dropper I probably would've been fine I don't know why decided to use this because it's such a small amount coming out already there we go oh yeah that's perfect oh and also just FYI if you buy these bottles which are really great for gummy making when you're making larger amounts not like this much died by making the tape it comes with like this I don't know if you can see that it's really really small and the gummy mixture is usually too thick to come out so I just put a different tip that's a little bit wider on there to make sure it can get through this was really difficult to use with such a small amount that I had so use a dropper if you have one this is usually my go-to option to squeeze things into molds but because there is such little amount when I squeeze it it's not really doing anything whereas if there was like this much gummy make sure when I squeeze it the pressure would push it out but because I made such a small amount obviously it's gonna be a little bit trickier I will just eat this out of the bottle later I'm just going to put the gummies that I need into the fridge probably for like 20 minutes alright guys I'm back but it hasn't been 20 minutes it's been two days so I took the gummies Oh after 20 minutes and they were not nearly hard enough I couldn't even really get them out of their molds so I put them in the freezer for a little bit like about half an hour and once they were hard enough I popped them all out of their molds and just left them on some parchment paper but they still were a little bit too squishy and too like corn syrupy so I left them out for a day and they were still a little bit too squishy Tomo for another day which is where we are now so it's been two days and they are perfect so if you guys make these just leave them out on a piece of parchment paper for a couple days depending on how humid it is wherever you live it might be a little bit different like it's not very humid where I live at all um so they dry up pretty quick but if you live somewhere very humid they might take a lot longer to dry or they might even not work for you in the first place so I'll show you what they look like so both the purple and the orange ones turned out very well you can see they're sticky obviously because they are sticking to my fingers so they are a little bit stickier than like a regular gummy but they're they don't really stick together in the bag because I've let them dry out for a few days so the purple ones had half a teaspoon of tincture in them and the orange ones had double that amount so they had one teaspoon of tincture and I thought they were gonna have a lot of issues but they're totally fine yeah they turned out very well and they taste just like the gummies did before I remoulded them last thing just to clarify um my gummies with the coconut oil didn't turn out only the ones with the tincture worked for me I don't know why the coconut oil ones didn't work if you guys know why please let me know because I'm very curious so yeah guys these turned out fantastic I'm super impressed with the results I definitely am gonna use this method many times in the future um going forward what I would do is for every 10 dummies I would do half a teaspoon of tincture so you can just multiply that by however many you want to make in total but based on what I've seen with these with half a teaspoon and the regular teaspoon they both turned out so you couldn't probably get away with using a little bit more but if you're looking for a starting point I would go with ten nine bears and half a teaspoon all right please let me know if you guys try this out I hope you enjoyed the video and let me

(I enjoyed the food!)", "z7LhQrZdpIc": "hey this is pressure Locker you have two ropes and lighter these are special ropes each rope burns in exactly 60 minutes the ropes however do not burn at a constant rate so you don't know that half the rope burns in 30 minutes or that X percent of the rope burns an x percent of the time the problem for you is how can you measure 45 minutes by burning the ropes now some of you may have heard this problem so in this video I'm going to pose a variation how can you measure 50 minutes by burning the ropes give these problems a try and when you're ready keep watching the video for the solution so it takes a little bit of ingenuity to measure 45 minutes I'm going to explain the steps first and then I'm going to show you how it works in a little animation the key is we start by lighting the ropes in three different places at the same time we'll light one end of one rope and both ends of the other rope the rope which has two flames is going to burn two times as fast as it normally would so it's going to burn up in 30 minutes at this point the other rope will have 30 minutes remaining on it so you then light the other end of that rope and that will give you a rope which is burning two times as fast as it normally would so that remaining rope will burn up in 15 minutes so if you add up to 30 minutes and the 15 minutes you get a total of 45 minutes from start to end so let's see how this works we start by lighting the ropes in three places we light one end of one rope and both ends of the other rope now we'll let the flames go the rope which had two flames on it is going to burn two times as fast so at that point thirty minutes have elapsed at exactly that moment you want to start a flame at the other end of the other rope so this rope which should burn in 30 minutes with a single flame will now burn two times as fast because it has two flames so this rope will burning in 15 minutes 30 plus 15 gets you 45 minutes from start to end so now let's tackle the next problem how can we measure 50 minutes we already know how to measure 30 minutes we light one rope at both ends this rope will burn up in 30 minutes so the question is how do we measure 20 minutes the key is that if one row burns in 30 minutes when it has two flames the same rope will burn in 20 minutes when it has three flames going so how are we going to get three flames going well we're going to use a little trick we're going to like the rope at one end and we're also going to light it somewhere in the middle the flame in the middle is actually going to split off in both directions so that's how you're going to end up getting three flames on this rope so this rope which would burn in 60 minutes with a single flame is now going to burn in one-third the time it's going to burn in 20 minutes with three flames now two of the flames may end up meeting and I'm going to show you what to do in that case you actually just like the rope in another spot but if you do this correctly you're going to measure 20 minutes and then 30 plus 20 is equal to 50 so let's see how this works so we start by lighting one rope at both of its ends we already know how to do this this is going to measure 30 minutes exactly when this rope burns out you want to light the other rope in two different places you light it at one end and then you light it somewhere in the middle so three flames are going to come from that now if what I showed you just happened where you have two of the flames meeting you're only going to end up with one flame remaining on the rope so what you then do is you repeat this by lighting this somewhere in the middle now that middle flame is going to split off into flames so you keep on lighting the rope so that you always have three flames going if you do this in the limit you're going to measure that this rope is going to burn three times as fast so it's going to burn in 20 minutes and therefore you have 30 plus 20

string and then add more nerds to it so you ask me - okay so don't worry about this up here well enough for the Nerds well that may have been so much I'm gonna say they don't know gonna pull it out a little bit you know or the Rope I'm gonna lay it in oh that's pretty but this is very they're very sticky I just wanted to like get off of my hand yeah ill okay sorry that was just like it was like very nasty to me okay and just like stick them on oh that's sticking on other side I'm gonna try to take this off of my hand and hopefully I don't have a panic attack okay okay now I'm gonna lay that down because that was so nasty to me I don't like this sticking to my hand that is so nasty everybody's in the living room watching the football game and cowboys her losing it I hate this okay sorry y'all but that's just me a winner I like sneaky stuff on my hand no rope I think yes I think yes I'm gonna put this in the refrigerator what's looking harden and I'll be deck which ah okay that's nice that's genuinely like that's just disgusting okay so I just went and got my nerve rope out of I'm just kidding but I just went when um and got my new rope out of the refrigerator and here is what it looks like this is actually really good like oh it's really good I just made it real fat so I'm just like pulling it a little bit and make a stinger the conservation the law of the conservation of mass you know I said that's all wrong but yeah my nerve roll my nerve rope makes it look good look at me yeah I thought it was fun kind of so bad but this actually came out pretty moving my hair just came out pretty you see ya oh who likes me likes me likes me like that oh honey you put this one y'all yeah any some Oh what thank you I'll ant on the other line hmm anyways I can't I'll clean it off

Yes. All right, we're gonna make\nsome coiled rope baskets using these buckets as a form.  Because we're gonna wrap\nthis rope around that bucket. And then we're going\nto pull out the bucket, and they're just\ngonna hold the form?  Yeah\nLAILA ALI: And be soft?  So, it stays the right shape.  Oh, perfect. That sounds pretty easy.\nYou got this, right? VERONICA: Yeah. LAILA ALI: Since\nyou're so handy. We're about to\nfind out for real. All right.  Start at the\nbottom of the bucket, and we're going to\ncreate a small coil. And then we're gonna start\ngluing the rope around, and around, and around, until\nwe've covered the whole base. Then we're gonna\ngo up the sides. So, Laila, I'm gonna give\nyou this little bucket form. LAILA ALI: OK, thank you.  And then, Veronica and I\nare gonna work on this one together. LAILA ALI: Sounds good.  All right, so\nfor step two we're gonna actually flip\nthis thing over and then start\ncoiling up the sides.  OK. Start coiling with the\nsame piece of rope?  Same piece of rope. We're just gonna be doing it--\n- Take it around the side, up. - Yeah, vertically now.\n- Got you. OK. ORLANDO SORIA: Until we\nreach the top of the bucket. LAILA ALI: Perfect. Easy enough. ORLANDO SORIA: This is\na special kind of rope. You have to go to a\nfabric store to get it. It's not at any hardware store. But I think, it's\nbeautiful and bright, and it's going to go with\nthe new bedroom perfectly.  Yeah.  I love it because it has\nlike a natural cotton feel, and it's gonna add some\ntexture to the room. Some softness, right?  We're almost done. How exciting! LAILA ALI: These\nare looking so cute!  So we've reached\nthe top of our bucket. So this is actually the end\nof our basket-making process. What we're going to do is--\nwe're gonna cut a little extra so that we can tuck this\npiece of rope on the inside and cut it on an angle. [MUSIC PLAYING] LAILA ALI: OK.  And then we're gonna take\nour basket off of it's form. It's just so fun. LAILA ALI: Oh, look at that! ORLANDO SORIA: Yes! VERONICA: It's like, awesome.  Those came out so nice.  How cute! ORLANDO SORIA: All right,\nso what we're going to do-- we're gonna take this\nlittle piece and, sort of, glue it on the inside\nlike this, flattening it out as much as possible.  That puts a nice\nclean into it.  Yeah. All right, so for\nour final step, we're gonna add these\nleather handles. We're gonna cut the leather\ninto 12-inch pieces. Next step is gonna be\npunching holes in them, so we can connect\nthem to the basket. And now, I'm going to add the\nleather handles to the basket. So we're gonna stick this\nChicago bolt through. We're actually going to\nscrew it from the inside. [MUSIC PLAYING]\nSo now we're done. These look so good!  They're really cute.  Feels like something I\nwould buy in a high end store, but we just made it ourselves.\n- Yeah.  What I like about them\nis they're versatile. She can put anything in here. These are gonna be a great\naddition to the new bedroom.", "Al98jQJng1o": "- Hey everyone, welcome to Awesome Time. Today we've got one, two,\nthree, four, five, six, seven strange flavors of classic candies. Let's get after it. Today we're mixing things up a little bit. I think you guys are\ngonna like it, though. Eric's gonna come in\nand I'm gonna show him these seven strange\nflavors of classic candies. He's gonna decide which is his favorite. Come on in here, Eric, and let's do this. Are you ready for your first--\n- I'm ready! - I think this could end\nup being your favorite. - Right off the bat? - Yep, this is pretty cool. It's definitely a strange\nflavor of a classic candy. You might not think\nsoda is candy, but I do. - I mean it's got enough\nsugar to be candy. - Yeah, baby. This is pure cane sugar made in the US. - That's dirt. - It's Dirt Soda.\n- It tastes like dirt. Clearing my mind, I've\nerased all my candy memory. Hmm. Organic. That's the first thing\nthat springs to my mind. - I feel like you're not in love with it. - It's not terrible.\n- Right - It's got the taste of dirt. I would probably be able\nto drink this whole bottle. But I don't know if I'd be\nlike, gimme another one. I don't, like my body doesn't reject this, which is always a positive.\n- You're going back for more. I didn't even ask you to try more and you're going back for more. - Yeah, it's not bad. Like if you had dirt in your mouth, it's got a little bit of that taste. But it's so sweet and so\nsmooth that it's drinkable. I'll put this, right now,\n'cause it's the only one-- - This is your favorite.\n- This is my favorite so far. - This is currently your favorite. - I'll sip on this until\nI find something better. - All right, in time for the\nholidays, I got for you this, candy canes, but the\nflavor is mac and cheese. These candy canes have\nbeen our most popular so far this season. - I had a taste of one\nin Real or Candy Cane, one of our hit videos. I mean right off the\nbat that smell is poof. - Oh, wow!\n- So smelly. - Oh no, I like it. - I kind of get used to it. No, that's weird, though. - This tastes a bit like\nbuttered popcorn Jelly Bellys. - The butter is strong. It's kind of like a cheesy butter. Going into this, I\nthought I would spit this all over the table, because I\ndid that with it originally. I don't like it.\n- I hate it. - It's growing on me. - Now, the question is do you like it more or less than the Dirt Soda? - I didn't expect this\nto be a tough decision. I'm gonna stick with the\nDirt Soda, only because when the smell hits my nose\nI'm a little bit like ick. But then I taste it and I'm okay with it. - Moving on to the next product. These are gonna be your new favorite. - Okay, I'm ready. - These are from Jelly Belly,\nthey're called Candy Cones. These are made in the USA. They are like a candy corn consistency. Each one is dual flavored. The cone part here tastes\nlike an ice cream cone and then the top tastes\nlike whatever flavor of ice cream's on top.\n- Ooh. - So each one's dual flavored. - Yeah, and you got five flavors. Right out of the bag it\nsmells like ice cream. - This one's orange sherbet,\nthis one's french vanilla. Ah, man. Oh, you're just taking the whole thing, you're not separating the flavors. - No, I'm not a freak. (womp, womp, womp) - How's that being a freak? So every bite of ice cream you have, you take like a little bit of cone and a little bit of ice cream? - No, the best part's when\nyou get down to where you get a bite of ice cream and cone. Throw it in the comments. What's the best part, eating\nice cream with the cone or just ice cream by itself? - Right, that's chocolate. You just get the chocolate\nthen you get the waffle piece after it.\n- No, I wanted it together. - Oh, man, that tastes just\nlike mint chocolate chip. - Mint is good. Mm, I like the strawberry. These have made me thirsty. (laughing) This makes me want to go\nback to the Dirt Soda. I did not think I would\nlike Dirt Soda this much. - Are you gonna keep the Dirt Soda over the Jelly Belly Candy Cones? - This is harder than I thought! - Really? I'm generally shocked. You think you know someone. - I did not expect this. - You're gonna keep the Dirt Soda. - I'm going with the Dirt Soda! - He's crazy. - This is blowing my mind right now. - This is blowing my mind. Eric, do you like taffy? - I do enjoy a good taffy. - This is chicken and\nwaffle-flavored taffy. - Everybody's getting in\nthe chicken and waffle game. - [Voiceover] New Kentucky\nFried Chicken and Waffles. - I know, but this is your\nsaltwater taffy, made in the US. I love taffy. - Oh, it does, it's got a\nvery maple syrup smell to it. Mm, there is chicken in there. I mean not real chicken.\n(laughing) There's not like-- - That would be weird in taffy. - Yeah, it'd be hard to ship. Got a good chew to it, fresh. Fresh. I thought this was gonna\nreally easy when you proposed this idea, I was like\noh, this will be easy. - Well, so did I. I thought it'd be really\neasy 'cause I was gonna start with soda flavored like dirt. I didn't think you would like it so much. - My palate is so refined. Right now, in this moment, the Dirt Soda's so\nunique-tasting to my mouth. It's so much different than anything else. Like I've had chicken,\nI've had waffles, syrup. I've had that candy taste before, and this is really good and it's unique. But just 'cause I've never\ntasted anything like this, I'm sticking with it. This is really good, though. - I guess I'm gonna have\nto go buy a bunch more Dirt Soda for you to\njust have in your office. - Yes, please! Try to beat the dirt, Jamie. - Oh, Eric, I feel like the Dirt Soda stands no chance against these. These are Pixy Stix, but\nvery interesting flavors. You've got cucumber\nwatermelon, mango lime, and pineapple-flavored Pixy Stix. These are actually from Mexico. - Cucumber's got that veggie taste, so this could be knocking on\nthe door of the Dirt Soda. - [Jamie] Who doesn't\nlike Pixy Stix, though? - Oh, I love 'em. - You can really taste\nthe cucumber in there, and it's good, I love cucumbers. - Ooh, that is good. - That's gotta be better\nthan that Dirt Soda. - Now, don't knock my Dirt Soda. I'm almost finished with it. - I'm going to the mango lime next. - Ooh, that's good. The mango's real good, mm. - That one is real good, too. - All right, I'm doing pineapple last. I think this will be my favorite. Mm. Sometimes like Pop Rocks\nand some of that stuff gets like whoa, you know, and it hits you. - Right, yeah. - But this is just kind\nof, it's almost just nice. I'm going, just 'cause I've\nnever had Pixy Stix like this, I'm going to the Pixy Stix. - Okay, okay. - Dirt Soda's out. I'll give a little love to my dirt. - We got a new winner. All right, the Pixy Stix.\n- Pixy Stix. - I don't know, I feel\nlike this has no chance, but knowing you, I don't\nknow, maybe it does-- - Yeah, who knows. - From the same people that brought you mac and cheese candy canes come\npickle-flavored candy canes. Tell me what you think. - All right, I'm gonna try\na little smell test first. - I like me some pickles and that is-- - I'm not getting a lot\non the smell, are you? A little bit. It's not bad. - I think this is better\nthan the mac and cheese one. - Yeah, it's subtle, it's more subtle. - Yeah. - Now in Real or Candy Cane,\nJoey got this and I had to eat a real pickle and root\nbeer and I did not enjoy it. (gagging) I do not like it more than these Pixy Stix - I'm not surprised, I'm not surprised. - These Pixy Stix are so good! - Yeah, I'm not surprised. Move onto the next one? - Yeah, nice try, pickle candy canes. - If anything could dethrone Pixy Stix, it's probably this next one. - Yeah! - Nerds.\n- Oh, I do love me some Nerds. - Ah man, these are Nerds\nin some pretty fun flavors. It's guava on one side and\nmango chili on the other. It's like a top-five candy for me. - For you, really?\n- Oh, yeah, oh man. - So you're the guy at the movie theater-- - Making all that noise. - All right, I got my guava going first. You know what also I like\nabout this box design? You put your mouth on it and\nthat really lets people know this is my box of Nerds,\ndon't eat any of it. - That's so unexpected for Nerds. - Yeah, I know. - Nerds are so traditionally\nlike that strong candy flavor and this is super sweet, but it's good. - I like it, it's pretty good. All right, I'm doing the mango chili. This is really interesting. - Yeah, excited about this one. - Quiet, I'm trying to watch the movie! Mm, that's got a little spice. Yeah, people who really\nwatch our channel, though, they'll know I haven't done\na spice video since we did the Carolina Reaper powder\nhere on this set last. - Yeah, we destroyed Eric's stomach. - Yeah. (coughs, gags) Get off my lips. I can feel it in my stomach,\nlike it's rejecting it. But this I like. It's like just enough\nheat that it's enjoyable. Ooh, this is gonna be hard! This is the last one, Jamie. Whatever wins this just wins. You've got a lot riding on this. Whichever I choose, could\nsell millions of units just by me touching it. Man, I don't know. - You get three flavors\nfrom the Pixy Stix. You only get two from here. - I know, you really\ndo, that's a good point. I'm calling it. Eric's favorite candy of this episode-- (tapping) Nerds!\n(air horn) I'll tell you why. The flavors are both really good. It's the crunch and the tactile like... I like having that like\nI'm eating something a little bit more just a little\nbit versus the Pixy Stix. - There you have it. Nerds, Eric's favorite. - My fave! Still, dark horse, right? - Still rocking that Dirt Soda. You can get all seven\nof these classic candies in strange flavors at vat19.com. I hope you guys enjoyed this format.

was like an ant bite or something all right preston significant progress huge huge and quite frankly we've never seen damage like that before dude i could ride this rock to the sun honey it's gonna break down with all the enzymes inside of it yeah i don't like the way he's stroking it yeah getting real personal sometimes in life you have to do what is necessary and there's special enzymes in this honey you can already tell i can feel it i haven't felt it yet you want to rub it you'll probably feed it too hey hey hey have you keep picking he's thinking i'm thinking listen you're not putting any emotion into it there's no emotion when you take my sister on dates is this the same level of emotion no he's nervous now make white noise steven so what scott doesn't know we are hiring a lie detector to come to the office to ask him questions my mom dad sister myself are going to ask him some very difficult questions about him and my sister's relationship so if you guys have any questions you want us to ask scott put it in the comments wait yeah oh that was a great spin no no give it everything you got this whole game is literally red oh yeah six seven keep going keep going inside this five gallon bucket of barbecue sauce is one chick-fil-a nugget and you gotta find it is it at least fresh yeah it's been sitting in there like two hours okay there's no more barbecue sauce needed steven a little bit more i'm so confident in my abilities i'm going to reach one hand in and i'm going to go in the bottom left-hand corner grasp the nug and pull out how do you find the corner of a don't worry about that no no what did i say no i'm goaded don't eat it don't eat don't eat it don't eat it don't eat it it's [Music] oh the satisfaction i can do this with my baba coop why is it always the sticky slimy stuff i gotta deal with it every time bro this is not very good okay like my hands are slipping and it's a crowbar it is not meant to go through a bedrock rock i feel like the only thing i'm doing is leaking barbecue sauce and let me tell you something the fun fact there are people out there who eat rocks i researched it so they probably are watching this thinking like oh my gosh honey barbecue bedrock all right all right preston i've given it all she's got boys [Music] this is my personal television he's trying to i guess you don't really need anything i think i get five blocks why we don't need to do it wait it's still usable yeah it's still working right yeah yeah whose great idea was it to get me a crowbar with barbecue sauce oh my gosh let's put the nail in the coffin and here she rests oh listen if you don't look at the camera good things happen all right what are saltine suckers so you got one minute to eat as many saltine crackers as you can and that's how long you'll get with the tool ready set go this is also not keto by the way that's four that's another 12. 14 crackers i'll be on the liberal side please put it out right here like [Music] i feel like i ended up making better damage with the pickaxe it's not even that deep all right four three two one i had to legitimately stop because of my ears so the goal was to try to make a line down the middle of the rock and then see if we could potentially split it into i don't know if it's gonna work but i'm giving it all she gots guys liz i can't even hear anything i don't even know what this is struggling i'm blindfolded and i got to choose one person and that's the weapon i get and there's two of them there's four of us that's okay all right marco polo hello i like you oh okay take your blindfold off did i choose wisely dude you chose yes scott how far are you i don't know i have like 14 left come on we are moving into the biggest weapon in our arsenal which is the jackhammer it's literally stuck inside i think you can get it biggest piece of bedrock one layer does it break oh god we gotta get through something so we're gonna get to the sandstone oh my god i think it's scientifically proven that i am no match for the hundred layers of bedrock so i'm challenging robert burst come back down to dallas help us get through this i will pay you ten thousand dollars if you can get through this thank you for watching have a great day see you next time peace", "YL4_zsIENhY": "[Music] hello and welcome to lofty pursuits and public displays of confection in tallahassee florida i'm greg and today jake and i are going to take a trip without taking a trip we figured we're trapped here in tallahassee not being able to travel like many of you and wouldn't it be fun to travel with candy and have the flavors of the world there are flavors that are known around the world for different things and relating to different countries we thought it might be fun to do a series of candies that are an assortment that have flags of different nations and the flavors that are known in the country so far we've heated the candy to 310 degrees we've poured it on our candy cooling table and as it cools we add food coloring the food coloring is a lot of water in it and we need to get this water out so we stir it into the very hot sugar fast and you can see it boils almost immediately getting rid of all the water in the form of steam keeping the water out of the candy and preventing the candy from being sticky we discovered this flag challenge that we put for ourselves is more complicated than we thought a lot of countries are known for the same fruit and a lot of flags we can't make they're just too complicated so we're going to pick some flags that we can make and flavors that we think you'll like but are going to be a bit unusual we're going to start with the country of thailand and the star fruit the carambola we're going to add a little citric acid here that's the white powder and fortunately i'm really familiar with how these should taste you see they grow in south florida they may not be native there and a friend of mine's father has a farm with carambola plants on it my friend john would pick them on the vine and drive them up that afternoon they were so fresh and they were much bigger than what you find in the supermarket i think they picked them early to get them to ship better but these things were amazing and we've captured this flavor in the candy itself flags are icons and it's important that you do the proportions as best as you can out of respect to the flag for any country so what we're doing here is the thai flag has five stripes two red ones that represent the land and the people that are one unit wide two white ones that are also one unit wide that represent the religions of thailand and one big blue one that's two units wide in the middle that represents the monarchy this flag was adopted in 1917 and is an apocryphal story about why it was adopted before this it was an elephant on a red background and the wind knocked it over once and was accidentally hung upside down and the king declared there'd be a new flag that could never be hung upside down and this apparently is it but also in 1917 thailand declared war in germany during world war one and they picked the flag that was the same color scheme as their allies the united states britain france and russia if you notice the candy i was pulling was sort of amber in color and i needed white and i didn't achieve this with food coloring i achieved this just using my arms and pulling this candy on the hook you see every time i fold the candy over i fold in air bubbles and the air bubbles reflect light and make the illusion of the candy being white it also creates more surface area on the final candy so when you eat it it's gonna give a little pop of flavor as it'll dissolve faster on the white stripes than on the solid colors now it's time for me to build the flag and the problem is how much of each color did i make i needed to make a precise amount it's easy to calculate the area of something when you're dealing with rectangles but we're dealing with rectangles that are cut out with a circle because this will be a circular approximation of the flag and how did i do this i did this with math it's pretty easy to calculate area of the circle once i sketched it out and if i did this right i made exactly the right amount of red white and blue so if i cut the red in half and the white in half and make one stripe of blue if i make it round all the stripes will be in the right proportion as i alluded to earlier we're going to be making a series of this in different flavors from around the world this all started because of one of our listeners on our podcast his name is sam and he wrote in he wrote in the wake of flights being grounded a candy assortment featuring national flavors might be popular and i think he's right we added the flag design idea thank you sam and sam found this out on our podcast and then we posted on the community section of youtube a request for flavor ideas normally when we do this we get 10 maybe as many as 40 comments this time we got over 800 comments and we knew we were on to something there's gonna be a series of these videos in a series of these candies we're not 100 sure of all the flavors we're gonna do but i know i'm gonna do lychee because i've been wanting to do that for a while and woodruff from germany maybe and how about um how about prickly pear from mexico although i don't think i can do the mexican flag or one of the other countries prickly pear comes from i want to avoid flavors that i've already done so as much as i love maple syrup from canada our mushroom flavor is very mapley so we're going to stick with that for the moment but what flavors can you think of that would make good candy that we may be able to investigate because this is a process of investigation of exploration you may not be able to explore the world right now but maybe we can give you a little something from around the world to explore without leaving your house and of course if you want to try this candy for yourself you can just go to our website www.pd.net we ship worldwide and that would be kind of appropriate with a world wide range of flavors you can also follow us on instagram facebook and twitter we also have a patreon page that allows you to donate to a fund which we use to make the podcasts and do the strange travel videos and the things that are not well business related directly we'd like to thank all of our wonderful patreon subscribers for their support let me recap what we've done so far we heated the candy we cooled the candy we divided it into colors we built the log that has the cross section of the thailand flag and then i started tapering it and when i tapered it i was able to cut off the end we call that end of unicorn dropping we sell it in the store and we were able to put it on our batch roller at this point jake has been tapering it down into individual rods so we take a log we make it into rods and finally we're going to cut it up into individual pieces and we do that on our canvas looking good for 12 feet underwater i didn't think that was a problem all that's left to do is look at the final design and it came out great and the flavor is wonderful too you can order this candy and we can ship it to you if you go to www.pd.net and you can try it for yourself but if you're ever in tallahassee we're right off the i-10 exit at thomasville road in tallahassee and you might be lucky enough to see us make it we don't have a regular schedule but we make candy a lot of times just not all the time and we hope you get to see it in person someday thank you for watching and we'll see you in the next i wanna video", "LMD5aAC9wAk": "hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is liz if this is the first time you're joining you're a regular subscriber welcome back thank you so much i really do appreciate your support i really do mean that i love you guys so today i'm going to show you how to do the sour version of a gummy uh gummy candy so this has got includes the gelatin and a cooked syrup candy syrup you combine them and we then apply the sugar sweet and sour sugar right afterwards so we don't have to wait for it uh to dry uh or to figure out when we need to add it we add it right afterwards and um all right so i'll just get right started we'll get into the ingredients the equipment that you're gonna need and then how to put everything together all right well thank you so much for joining and i hope you enjoy the video okay so this recipe is done in two stages well technically three because we cook in two different stages and then we combine everything so for the first gelatin for the jello half you're going to need three tablespoons or three envelopes of unflavored gelatin one box of your favorite jello flavor a quarter cup of light corn syrup a half a teaspoon of citric acid a half teaspoon of gour gum and a quarter of a cup to a third of a cup of your can of butter and for the liquid you're going to need um a quarter cup that we're going to heat up to boiling and then a half cup that we're going to be using to bloom our gelatin and you can use any liquids that you like i like to use these um kool-aid or the kool-aid jammers these ones are good because they're a water-based and they're clear so you don't have to contend with color and they're also half the sugar so again you're not going to it helps cut back on the sugar since we got a whole ton of it in it that totally up to you though you want to definitely stick to a clear type liquid those powerades if you like those type of things those vitamin waters if you like them i don't like them they do not add the greatest of taste but if you do add juices like with it have real fruit juice in it then you're going to want to use a mold inhibitor because mold will develop very quickly and if you want to add additional colors or flavors uh we can do that i'm going to be adding 2d fruity and so i'm going to kind of make it pink and purpley i don't know tutti frutti colors and if you want to have a nice solid uh background you're going to need white food coloring so that's for the gelatin part the jello side gelatin side for the cooked candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar a half a cup of light corn syrup and a half a cup of water so for the equipment that you're going to need you're going to need a double boiler so you can use any pot and metal bowl i like to try and use a thicker thicker metal so that it doesn't get too hot you're going to want something to disperse your candy i love using these bottles they work great and they've got the piping tip which makes it really nice or you can use an eyedropper now this recipe is a little bit thicker so i'm not sure how well an eyedropper is going to work with it you're also going to need an oops timber you're also going to need a smaller pot for your sugar syrup and a candy thermometer two spatulas you're also going to need a hand blender and if you're going to be splitting your syrup either by doing different colors or flavors you're going to need a measuring cup to split that out if you're just doing all one you don't need that or in in lieu of a hand blender you can use whisk in a very strong forearm so the first thing that we want to do is we are going to bloom our gelatin and we are going to heat up that other quarter cup um you may need a little bit more liquid if you do you can just add it in later on if needed so we're going to heat this up in the microwave for about a minute and 20 seconds and we're going to sprinkle three tablespoons of gelatin unflavored gelatin onto our half a cup of liquid you want to kind of evenly spread it and then you're going to mix it in so that it is thoroughly mixed and that there are no lumps so you want it to kind of look like light up you want to look like applesauce and then you're going to just set that aside for five minutes and we're gonna add our boiling liquid to our jello mix and you're gonna stir that oh and you're gonna start you're gonna put your heat on to the lowest setting we just want our water to get hot we don't want it boiling gelatin melts at just hot water so we just want a hot water bath and we're going to stir that in and we're going to add in our corn syrup that's our quarter cup of corn syrup and we're just going to stir oh sorry and we're going to add in our half teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to stir that i said until it's dissolved it takes about five five six minutes or so for all of that to melt and in order to get this stuck gelatin off the side you can use some very hot water and a brush and it'll just you can wash that off otherwise if you don't it won't it doesn't melt and then it you'll get bits and stuff in your jello then you also want to make sure when you're stirring is to rub your spatula across the bottom because the sugar and the gelatin can stick to it and you don't want that so you want to make sure you'll feel it you can feel it smooth on the bottom if there's stuff stuck you'll feel it kind of rough you just kind of want to work it off scrape it off then once your gelatin or sorry your jello is fully melted we're gonna add in the gelatin and what i do is i just kind of cut it up into smaller pieces just like this and just in she goes and you're just gonna gently stir that until it's melted and if your water is hot now if the um your pots nice and hot you can turn off the heat you don't gelatin required doesn't require much heat at all to melt and if it gets too hot the gelatin will break which means it's not going to have that it's not going to your candies aren't going to set that well and the sign that you'll know that it's too hot is if you start to see white foaming stuff white foamy stuff happening on the top of your mixture here on your syrup now that everything is melted we are going to add in the can of butter and our gour gum and the reason that we have to use gour gum is it is an emulsifier and it is going to allow your oil and your your water to come together as one as one liquid versus being oil and water you know don't mix together an emulsifier allows them to come together as one solid solidified unit in short it basically mushes the oil and the water together to live happily we're going to pour in the our can of butter and i've used a third of a cup so as you can see adding you're adding the can of butter or oil to our gelatin you can mix and mix and mix until the cows come home no matter what those two are never going to blend together now you might get the appearance if you kind of whisk really really quickly you have the appearance that it's combined right that kind of looks like that's all combined however if you go and you set that and if you want to set that up now all of the butter would raise to the top of the mold now if you've got one of these little strainers or a strainer it's great for doing the guru so we're going to use a half a teaspoon of gargum and you're going to gently sprinkle evenly sprinkle it over the top if you don't have a strainer you just want to make sure to try and get it evenly over the top there this will adhere to the oil and allow it to mix in with our with the jello and i'm going to let that sit for a minute and now we're going to get our trusty hand blender [Music] and you'll continue to mix that until it is completely all one color all one unified color you don't see any kind of streaking or any kind of any difference whatsoever that's when you know it it is fully blended and emulsified and you're gonna be how about that texture and once that's done we're just going to let that set to set aside and leave it on the hot water but turn off the heat and then we're going to do our candy syrup all right so for our candy syrup we're going so for the candy syrup you want one cup of sugar a half a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water you're gonna mix that together until it is blend till it's all mixed up and your sugar starting to dissolve and we're going to turn the heat on to medium-high and you're going to stir the syrup until it begins to boil so as soon as it starts to boil then you are going to stop stirring that's when we add the candy thermometer and we don't stir it again and then you're also going to want to grab a jar of hot water about whatever something of hot water and a brush so you can wash down the sugar crystals off of the side and that'll prevent your syrup from crystallizing once it begins to boil there we're going to add our candy thermometer i'm going to try to add the candy thermometer now if you ever wonder why i kind of have this weird looking thing the one that i have said it setting on it that thermometer doesn't always work for me it occasionally will fail um this i like the digital but the digital um doesn't have any way of holding on to it it's more meant for just kind of sticking it into checking a temperature and then i have to use the tin foil to protect the digital from the heat so that's why i kind of have this weird makeshift candy thermometer and we're going to cook this syrup to 208 280 degrees soft crack now you can go a little bit if you want your candies a little less chewy you can go a few degrees less you can go to about 275. if you want them a lot chewier then you can go to 300. i seem to find the 280 is perfect for it well for what my liking anyway so we're going to continue to cook that syrup until 280 degrees just remember to wash down any crystal any sugar crystals that may form on the sides just to let you know you're doing this at the medium high it will go fairly quickly so don't leave the kitchen normally you do the sugars at a lower temperature so you have a little bit of time this doing it at the higher temperature it will go very quickly so i'm traveling you don't leave your kitchen and then you also want to get a pot of just cold water or a bowl of cold cold water stand by uh we're gonna put the bottom of the pot in that to stop the syrup the cooking process so we're at 276 270 see how quickly it starts to go 278 279 280 leave the candy thermometer on because we want to bring this temperature down to 240. you can turn your heat off leave it in the water until the temperature starts coming down and then we're just going to set it on the side here until that temperature comes down to 240. so once your temperature comes down you can remove the candy thermometer and we're going to add in ow be careful the syrup is still very very hot you're going to get your gelatin mixture and you're going to have a look and you're going to make sure that you don't see any green or anybody butter separation now you might see a little bit of cut like see how that color there difference that suggests your jello that the air is coming out of so don't worry about that what you care is if you see any kind of green or oily looking so that's good we're going to pour this into this candy syrup and be very careful when you're stirring this now your gelatin is going to be a lot more liquidier than the liquid liquid ear i know i come up with my own words uh then the candy syrup is going to be thicker it's also going to start to solidify as you can see on the spoon that's why you're going to gently stir it and we're going to turn the heat on to bury it to the lowest temperature and you want to make sure to take your spatula and go all the way around the edges the syrup will has a tendency to stick along those edges see so i like to use the hand blender whoops to make sure that everything is fully uh mixed together and blended and emulsified [Music] and then you're just going to gently stir to make sure that it's all nicely mixed so now at this point is when we're going to add in our flavor and additional colors if you like or as i said if you want if you're not doing that you can just go ahead and put this into your bottles right now and get ready to distribute into the molds so i'm going to be adding one of my newest favorite flavors tutti frutti love this flavor i usually use about a cup and a half and again you just want to gently get that all mixed in now if you are going to be splitting uh if you want to do two different colors this is this point you're going to put it to the transferred over to your measuring cup and split it in half or if you wanted to do two different flavors then do that before split it in half add your different flavors but i'm just doing one flavor base two colors okay so i have got now whenever you look at a um a measuring cup always look at it straight on get down at the level and look at it straight on if you look at it from a down level you see you don't get an accurate reading that looks like two and a quarter cups however it's more like two and a third cups so for this one i'm going to do i'm gonna add some more red and i like to use the no taste red i hate the taste of red dye i can always taste it and everything so i like the no taste red the one thing about it however is it doesn't have quite the intensity of red that the regular does but i'd rather forsake a little bit of the intensity on the color versus the intensity on the flavor there we go that's a nice red and the other side i'm going to do purple i'm going to add in some pink i want a more pinky purple versus a dark purple and a couple drops of blue now mix that up see what we get now right now because we did i didn't add the white into it and it looks like it's a solid color it's actually it'll come out kind of still a little bit translucent so if you want to get a solid background and that it's not going to lighten up or get that kind of clear or translucent look you want that solid opaque then you need to add in the white so i'm going to add a couple drops into white on both sides so we have here when we add in the white it's going to dull down our color a little bit so that i'm just going to add in a little bit more of the red and add a little bit more to the purple purple i think i'm gonna leave i like that color but the red i wanna looks kind of orangey and see how much nicer that color is now it's a lot richer and gives you more that solid background makes it opaque versus having that translucent look to it and now i'm just going to get ready to pour it in the bottles and distribute it into the molds all right so now we're ready to distribute into the molds and you can go do half and halves now don't fill up your mold all the way to the top if you do it ends up leaving a sharp edge on your candy that dries out and it doesn't make your candies very pleasant so don't fill them all the way up to the top and it's also when you're trying to pour try and keep it to the middle and just let it distribute it out once you have your mold set up while all filled up you put it into the fridge for uh two hours sometimes it may take a little bit longer basically two hours or until they're set all right so it's been a couple of hours and our candies are ready to come out of the molds and we're gonna make up our sugar sour mix so you're going to add one cup of sugar and to that you're going to add a half a teaspoon of citric acid cut it and you want to make sure to thoroughly mix that in so you're going to get even citric acid on everything not just get like a big hunk of it on one candy that's kind of gross so you want to make sure to thoroughly mix it in now the nice thing with this recipe is as soon as we take them out of the molds we're going to put them right into the sugar this sugar mix you don't have to worry about waiting for them to dry or partially dry before we can add it and the reason for that is citric acid is water soluble so when you do the other gummy recipe when you just take them out they're still wet and gummy bears are essentially water and gelatin so as soon as there's any moisture on them the citric acid will begin will automatically begin to melt it doesn't do it on this because you have the sugar coating or the sugar candy syrup in there that helps protect the gelatin and that's why they don't melt as soon as you put it on and that's why this recipe is way better for doing sour or sugar coated candies now these guys are going to be a lot stickier than your regular gummy recipe so you just kind of pull it and they'll start to peel out and then you just work them out and then just pop them right into your sugar sour mix and as they warm up a bit uh they will start to get a little more tacky so no worries as long as you can pull them out of the molds they're good and they do stick to your fingers they do just kind of put it down into the sugar you can just kind of rub it in and it'll get them off that's nice once the your sugar or your sugar sour mix is on they no longer stick together see look at that and then you just put them on the rack to dry as per usual now what i like to do is i like to put holes in my parchment paper so that way you're getting air from both sides it helps with drying the other nice thing with this recipe is it doesn't take anywhere near as long for these to dry as the regular gummy recipes they're pretty much dry in a few hours to overnight now if they do start to get a little too warm and too hard to get out of the mold just put them back in the fridge for a little while if you actually keep a little bit of sugar on your fingers once they get a little bit sticky it'll help with them not sticking to your fingers a little aid with them coming off see if they stick they will fuse just pull them apart now if you're taking these out and they're just not coming out they're way too sticky um they're too gooey you can put them back in the fridge for a couple of hours or um and if you take them out and they're still not going to come out what you can do is uh put them in the freezer for about an hour take them out put them back in the double boiler on low re-melt them and add a half a tablespoon to one tablespoon of bloomed unflavored gelatin and that should add enough a little more gelatin there that'll fix that right up and if you find that they are too gummy oh sorry not if they're too gummy if they're too chewy they're like rubber bands again same thing just put them back on the double boiler on low remelt them and add a couple of tablespoons of um liquid to it and mix it all in until it's all melted recast them and that should take care of that problem if you've taken them out and there's um your butter is all risen to the back same thing just put them into the double boiler re-melt them add a little bit more gargum and re-emulsify make sure to use the hand blender or your whisk really really well like i showed you earlier so again if they're stuck like that uh check first to see just gently work around if they come away then you're good you can pull it out of the mold but if they're doing that they're not coming it's not coming away at all then they need to either go into the longer go into the fridge longer or to add some more gelatin to them they are a little bit more work but they are definitely worth it in texture and flavor in everything i've pretty much abandoned the other gummy bear recipe personally i just use this recipe now i'll just do either sugar coated or the sweet or the sugar and sour mix option is if um they are being really sticky um they are kind of coming out they're set but they're just really sticky um that can happen because it gets it picks up a little bit too much moisture in the refrigerator you can just let them sit in the molds for a couple of hours on the counter before taking them out that'll assist in drying that out a little bit now if you can stand your candies up it's a good idea some of them won't stand up though too small to whatever decides so if you can stand them up great if not you just want to flip them over every couple of hours until they're dry and as i said before this recipe and the drying time is it's a lot less time and that's it for them so just leave them out and enjoy some awesome sweet and sour gummy candies so that's my tutorial on sweet and sour gummy candies these are the little bad boys they haven't dried yet but you can see they're really nice they're little that little squishy now because they're still wet tastes awesome so i hope you give this recipe a try whether you want to do just sugar coated or the sugar sour it's a great recipe i'm sure that you'll love it if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to put them in the comments i'll always get back to you and i think that's everything i've got for you today well thank you so much for joining time diamond delight edibles wish i could get that straight um thank you for joining diamond delight edibles it's been a pleasure have a wonderful day [Music] you", "KhuUuxCVrSw": "hi I'm crafty Patti today I'm going to show you the proper way to cut your strips of fabric for making your roll bowls by cutting it on the bias you get a nice stretch when you're wrapping the rope and it will eliminate all the fraying if you're cutting it just with a grain of fabric [Music] here's what it will look like if you cut it with the grain of fabric all these little frayed ends are going to come out this is cutting on the bias and look how clean the edges are that's what we want to do you'll need a cutting mat an omni grade ruler and your rotary cutter with a nice sharp blade and let's get to it so here we've got a piece of fabric and as you can see it's a lot larger than my cutting board and that's gonna be really awkward to cut so what we need to do is fold it in a way that we can cut it so it's easier here's my - so much edges this is the raw edge that was cut from the bolt of fabric and of course about the other raw edge on the other end here and it doesn't matter how much you've cut whether it's a metre 3/4 a metre and a quarter it doesn't really matter so what we're going to do is we're taking this corner this is our Salvage edge this is my raw edge and we're bringing it up and forming a triangle so I'll just bring this over it doesn't have to be exact it's my salvage edge you can see that there's absolutely no gift there whatsoever here's one of my raw edges you've got a little bit more gift there but on your bias it's going to pull and stretch a lot consume much that stretches and that's what we're after so it's still too much fabric to cut so what we're going to do is we're going to bring this corner and bring it down to the other corner I'm just going to lift this up here a bit so you can see what I'm doing and this corner it's going to come right down to my other corner and we still got too much to go through so at this point in time you'll see here's your two folders one layer and there's a layer there okay so those are the layers that you want to match up so now let's just turn this so we've got it squared up with our our board here and just as a good reminder you'll know that these two edges have got the two poles this has only one inch so you'll know that when you fold it again you know that this edge is going to come over the double edges okay so this one is not going to come over like so and we can bring that break down to our little corner there and now we have something that we can cut through you can bring this up if you want it doesn't really matter and our first cut we're just going to cut off all the folds so I'm using my Omni grid real ruler and I've put in a new blade because you're cutting through lots of layers here so that's if I'm a sharp blade so let's just go through here and we're going to just cut off that edge that is all folded ok so now you've got your nice clean edge and now we can start making our cuts now if you are going to use this for actual bias tape you'd probably cut two inch strips but being that I'm going to use this for my rolls I'm only going to cut one inch strips so he was my one inch mark so they can come through and here's our first piece of binding so you've got the angle in which will come in handy and there's one strip and there's another strip cut two strips at once I'm going to hold this on my ruler right here and then I'm gonna pull and you'll see I'm gonna pull I'm getting an almost an extra inch of stretch that's cutting on the bias and my edges look really nice and clean now I'm left-handed so I need to flip this around so it's easy to cut my next trip so I'm just gonna slip this underneath and turn this around and now what I can do is I can come in with my Omni great ruler place it on my guide line my one inch overall my Omni grid and then I'm ready to make my next cut and I don't have to keep moving your fabric this way you're just using your ruler to measure your one inch mark and away you go through your all your fat [Applause] you and when you get closer to the end of your folded fabric you'll be making smaller pieces so there's one piece and there's another little piece so you might not want to go that far down because you're just gonna get little tiny pieces but you might want some just a little bits of color here and there in a basket it's a little work up but I'll show you how to piece these together if you want to make your shorter ones longer so here I am teasing my little pieces together there's one join in another one and another one now make sure when you if you're doing a few of them together make sure that you've got your right side as the top not be joined side nice side is up and then let's go to the next one we're matching up or two right edges but we're going to slide it up so we've got a point showing on both sides so you've got the point here and the point extending on this side and these two sides are flush together and bring in the pin to hold it in place a little bit and again we're going to sew from this point to this point so this edge is parallel to our slow machine here and I'm going to try to match up that point so I'm going through and just watching where the split is in my foot here and we're going to try to make sure that we hit it dead on a presser foot down I've started just a little bit up on the fabric because otherwise it might bunch up so I'm just going to start here before it back stitch and away we go and I'm going to try to hit it so we're right on that point there [Music] and we have another one sewn together open it up and there we have it and then you can just come over and you can just use your fingers to press a little pin and there we go have we've attached another piece so you'll notice that when you go along you'll see that one is going in this direction and the next one will go in the opposite direction and then to clean up her Aegis for using this for the rope baskets just come in and take off the little corners and there's your finished joint now you'll be able to make more professional fabric wrapped ruffles that you will be proud of anyone to give as gifts or even sell them I will soon be posting this video so if you don't want to miss out click that little bell icon and it was sent a notification to let you know but I've just posted another video so I hope I have inspired you to do a little crafting till next time bye bye [Music]", "o_Tboe1SWD4": "[Music] welcome

you spend the most time with are some you are some of the people you spend that type of time with one we're not gonna we're not on here on that self deprecation whatever i already know that you're an amazing person um and so in regards you you obviously serve our country uh shout out to you and i appreciate that but in addition to serving your country you are amazingly creative you express yourself especially in the creative space of you know photography graphic design um you know media audio all those different things so let's go back so you have a military career right one how did you start getting into the space of you know expressing yourself or honing your skills uh with creative endeavors you know what's crazy um i think people say this all the time and now that i'm sitting here under the mic i'm probably saying it i'm gonna say it but um i feel like i've always been a creative person to some degree but just not recognizing it you know what i mean um i grew up in south central los angeles right and so growing up in an environment uh unique to me in la uh there are other things that uh you probably were looking out for you didn't have the opportunity to pick up a paintbrush and start painting you were kind of worried about ducking you know more paint or something like that but as far as i can remember i've always been a creative person i just not not realizing i've always been fascinated with cameras from the video uh perspective um i've sang i've danced um i thought i wanted to be a magician at one point in time just always trying wild things man um speaking that i had this one time i did this magic show i i just got this magic kit for my birthday um and it was like two weeks later i hadn't even practiced these tricks i just understood them like maybe one good time and i put on a magic show at like the community center man every trick i tried went horribly man it was it like i loved that a little failed every single trick but uh it was just it's just always been something i've been i've been into um just being creative it's not until um she joined in the military uh you know in the navy where you spend a lot of time traveling i had taken some trips and told some people about the amazing fun i had i was like hey man there was a giraffe that poked his head in my window at my hotel and then people were like man you lying you know you talk to your boys they're like man you lying ain't no giraffe poked a window in your hotel room man shut up um and deal them dominoes uh but uh i was like man the only way i'm gonna get these dudes to believe me is if like the next time i go i'm gonna take a camera so i took a camera uh a video camera at this point in time and i just tried to record everything man i recorded everything that was odd and crazy um ended up turning into a micro recruiter with that because people were like man you did what you did what and it just evolved from there so um so so with that being said so okay so you grew up uh in los angeles um for the listeners where did you go to college and then was when did you start like you're right like you said your boys didn't believe you when did you start tinkering with these different modes of expression like the photography and all that stuff um i went to college at howard university in washington dc uh military uncle saying pay for that thank you uh but a bison you know my hu people out there you know uh gotta represent uh howard uh out there um and and to the tinkering question um assuming like i've tinkered always but like really taking it serious um kind of going back to that deployment kind of story i gave you um you know sometimes you record stuff when you first start off and you're like man everything is interesting so i got this two hour long video and i'm trying to show somebody this one interesting part and then like i get to the point you like nah but hold up hold up oh and i'm telling i had to learn how to shorten that stuff so that's where the editing came in i was like i got to make these more interesting i got to find a way to put music to these videos then i put music to my videos and people were like oh they were actually watching you know my whole little creations and just that that dopamine that you get from people just loving what you what you want you know i'm an old cat so facebook instagram that didn't exactly exist i'm literally you know pulling out a little cd player with a screen on it trying to show people this video about a uh you know tiger i touched in in at nook animal park or something crazy like that but and it just grew from there um as social media kind of like is sprouted up just like during my time frame um i just saw that as a canvas to start putting some of those those pieces of work filming my kids or you know making addresses to um my friends or you know talking about things that i thought were interesting and drawing attention to it you know instagram stories right now has my attention like you would not believe man um i just like the idea of how do i tell a story in 15 seconds to keep somebody engaged or how do i section this off so the tinkerine has not stopped and i doubt it will because there's just too much fun technology out there i love that so okay so you weren't from los angeles you went to la uh um and then you're deployed in the military and while you're in the military uh just to show people what you're doing keep in touch stay connected you started to start diving into media and a little bit of uh you know videoing yourself and editing and all these things when did you start to realize that like this wasn't just maybe per se a hobby this was something where i wanted to like in addition to your career which you know you have a full military career this is something i want to invest my time and really get better at you know and and really hone that that skill uh i realize i made it last week when you told me i could be a guest on your podcast i was like yeah man you know what this hey i'm about to go full-time media man you know i'm on a positive field to podcast man i'm good it's only up it's only going to keep going up from here man so now um i think um the to answer that question man um something like yeah the military is typically not a type of environment where uh creative people you expect to see creative people but it's wow because um you you you see a ton of creative people you ever we all look the same we all wearing uniforms that look alike right so you just make assumptions that dude is just like me he does the same things i do and you see people out of the uniform look completely different or you know you hang out with your buddies you do some karaoke and then the person you out there we've got pipes you're like dang i didn't know you could sing and then that becomes uh becomes a thing so we're really analytical by the book and it kind of forces you to use a different part of your brain so i think that people who are creative types really want to get away from that and just express themselves in some kind of way so you pour all your personality into your art i pour more personality into you know my photography and videography and media than maybe you know the average person will pour into their clothes because i don't really think about my clothes i'm wearing a uniform most of the time and when i come home i throw some t-shirts jeans alpha hoodie and call it good you know so but hey i want to take a photo shoot so hey time to go shopping let's go get some clothes let's do a photo shoot of myself hey let me you know set my wife up in some kind of way that would be interesting to take a picture of and it just goes from there i love that because i was about to say like i definitely love the like hidden karaoke star like you definitely realize that like uniformity is what the military is about but like uh being me i'm a military brat and so i know the real world behind the uniform my dad's military you know and all that stuff and you spoke to that where a lot of people may have that nine to five wearing a uniform but at the end of the day they're individuals right like yeah i think that you just spoke to it like you wear your nine to five but then when it's time to take that that uniform off you found an outlet to express yourself creatively um when did you start saying okay uh first of all for the listeners i'm gonna say you my pro fight obviously you've been in the fraternity longer when did you start living your skills of being creative to the fraternity in that creative space that's a that's a dope question i would say uh before i even joined a fraternity uh being at howard university um i had some good friends who were alphas uh down at howard university um on the you know on the beta line uh 2007 uh no line 2008-2009 but i shot some videos for step show actually organize a good portion of the media for those students man and uh that went ham they ended up winning this step show maxed out every uh category and then from that point forward at howard man people started taking like the video and audio game like super a mega mix series um at least that's the way i see it it could have been dope before that but i know we won that year so um i was i was like man i really like this and then you know after the step show i got to see what those those bras were doing out in the community and i was like man these are multi-faceted dudes not just stepping and wearing letters they actually are you know doing some community service and so i kind of led some media assistance to some of the community service um and i started to develop a reputation around campus as like a the video guy okay so some other organizations approached me as uh they were like hey man if you could make our step show video this year you'll walk across line we won't we won't talk about what organizations that will as well kind of pushed me kind of pushed me away from it i was like man i'm a military dude man i never appreciate enough tonight i have to earn um but back to your point uh from day one um tried to get down at howard and you know being in the military that creates a whole bunch of different complications um well by the time i got to the i the decision to make the grad chapter which again is another silly story i'm in flight school trying to learn how to fly airplanes and i got this bright idea while i'm in flight school with a high washout rate this is also when i'm going to try to cross alpha i'm gonna try to finish my alpha process uh i love it hey can i just really interrupt uh i think that it doesn't happen when you want it and it probably is not the best circumstance they always say it's never so shout out this is a random implant shout out to my wife for putting up with me for doing it while she was pregnant with my second son shout out to her uh but i get what you're saying like yeah definitely if you want to do it you you're very determined so we did it so don't matter we're both in but go ahead with that go ahead yeah i was just in that place at that point i was like from from i made the decision i literally walked in there with the idea that i'm gonna join this organization they were like what do you want to do i'm gonna be the next ed i'm gonna be the editor sphinx one day you know i'm gonna bring alpha into the 21st century that has been my goal since walking in in the door um it's kind of been like on the calling card that one day somebody's going to look at something that alpha has done in a technology realm and think wow those guys really turned the corner and led the way and i want to be a part of that committee that team in some way shape or form i want to pull the rope on that one so from day one i've been trying to you know lend my skills um and uh honestly i'm trying to reduce my level of responsibility in the organization so that i can just focus on those areas of practice i love it so so you came in with the mindset uh which is not very i mean it is organic like you know they say what can you do uh for the fraternity right and you're like okay i know what i can do because i brought these skill sets honestly i'll give you mad shout out because i really when they asked me that question i was more like uh i'm good at talking to people i got a podcast so you know like you got a little bit more clear vision but so you knew that you brought a set level of skills um and i think that's what kind of what we we revived about and talked about is one of the things that we're we're learning is that whether it's the military whether it's the fraternity is being placed in a organization that utilizes your strengths and one with that organization is like finding your length and so one of the things i want to ask you is like like with that like you got all these skills how do you really determine whether when you're representing whether the military or representing uh alpha or representing something else whereas like you're still enhancing yourself and you're not losing yourself in a grand organization you know saying like yeah at the end of the day you're still regardless of letters or the uniform you're wearing you're frank and you're frank that's growing your media skills for you not just growing your media skills because of alpha not just going to look uh your skills for the military or whatever you're growing those skills because you want to get better how do you determine so two ways i probably would answer that question um overarching idea which may sound weird at first is i'm always trying to fail forward um and you've heard you've heard other you know big people communicate that concept but for me what that means is um i like to look for things that i'm mostly uncomfortable doing but are still in my wheelhouse so at work guys know me as the photo guy they definitely know that anything involving the camera guys are like hey uh siri can you do this hey siri can you do that if it's something i'm like hey this is real simple anybody can do it i will partner with someone and train that person so i can just lend them some assistance there's no real benefit in in that way it's a selfish way to do it but i'm like hey i'll help you gain this skill so there's two of us but then there's those tasks that people are like they ask you to do and you're like man that might be more than i can i can do that might be more than i can pull off um and those are the ones i'm like all right dog time to fail forward like i i i i'm a procrastinator sometimes man but when you got those big deadlines man those juices get flowing and you really try to push hard to uh to accomplish whatever the the goal is um and and i know my reputation whether it's alpha or in the military is on the line you know because there's already the buzz hey that's the camera guy that's the video guy that's the media guy um you know my call sign in the military is siri oddly enough um probably a topic for another um podcast but i siri like the phone like the phone yeah the leaders have call signs they're like like they know that you want to take care of business yeah i could literally i know viewers at home probably aren't paying attention we're doing a little video i could go to the back of my office you look at those plaques that are right there in the background office they actually say siri yeah that's my call sign all my orders and everything so that's a known thing but it comes from much more than being a tech dude but you your tech guy and your call sign is siri come on your reputation then becomes you know they associate that so um failing forward in that regard you know people have high expectations they're like hey okay this dude named siri is the tech dude okay this dude is about to uh do i think we do to covet we had to do a a a ball we had to do a whole ball online um and this is for i think our community is just north of 2500 people you know high ranking officials up and down to you know a three-star uh that's out there watching this presentation and uh they're like hey who can handle this who can knock this out and i had an opportunity to play a large part in that that's failing for me i've never done anything like that before where i'm trying to plan something from beginning to end but the fear kind of pushed me and now that instilled the confidence i could probably take on a you know a bigger task yeah so like so big i'm sorry to cut you off but like you're saying like syria got the answers or you'll figure out and one you take on new ventures um so what i'm hearing though is that people literally yo we're gonna try something experiment i call you right you got a new nickname with me you the mad scientist so with that mad scientist obviously you fell forward but you didn't feel for in a major event the first time so talk about that prototype like talk about like you know leading up to that major event you like just try a bunch of different things and tinker until like the magic show take it with a bunch of magic tricks how do you how do you go about that uh give myself enough time man like just recognize that it's not going to work out right the first time man it's not uh we uh recently chapter wise we were trying to do a community service event during covet again where we allowed candidates to get in front of their constituents in the areas that we serve right that's a pretty broad uh ask we had congressmen we had senators it was a pretty big show and my intent was to try to use a program called obs to do it um because i was like oh i'm gonna have graphics here it's gonna be awesome it's gonna look like a cnn news broadcast so i could bring guests on blah blah what i didn't take into consideration is that the computers that i own they weren't like super powered nasa computers man to do this stuff i was thinking about it wasn't a limitation of my creativity or even my ability it was just like the the machine can't handle that much video going through it at one time and so had i waited to the last minute to like knock that out i mean i set it up i had i was gonna show the chapter everything bring like 10 people on it started failing from like the fifth person joining in there and we had to to to adjust and uh i'm saying we're like two weeks out from the actual presentation we had to shift from obs which has all the creativity you can imagine over to a stream yard um which is you know you can do some stuff with it but i have to learn a new system and then figure out how to still give it that custom feel so it doesn't look like everybody else's and you know to me from my perspective it was a failure from my perspective i was like dang this is what i wanted to achieve and i didn't accomplish it from everyone on the outside looking at it it was a success because they're like wow we've never seen anything like that before and so that that's more that fail forward idea sometimes we have these visions in our own mind of what we want to accomplish and you know we've already exceeded greatness in most other people's eyes but in our own eyes we're like this this is the goal and i got to get there and and we'll use that as an excuse to not you know be proud of ourselves in that success i love that one there's two things why i love that one is i love that we're talking about intrinsic motivation and validation of success and like you know like you you gave me a shout out earlier and i was like uh like sometimes it's external like you don't feel it yourself until someone else externally validates you and you gotta work on that but two is that um i think that is also uh that mindset that we're not settled we're not settling our uh our accomplishments or we're not settled in anything we're always itching to be better itching to be greater um and i i always i did buy with you about that earlier so one of the questions i have though is that as you progress in your skills have you been able to reflect especially with large organizations going back from those step shows i'm going to say it was a dvds or vhs and now are you able to like really see the growth and for someone else like speaking to yourself um by speaking to yourself or speaking to someone else getting creative like how do you just kind of keep up how do you keep up and go back to those archives where you're definitely not using the same stuff to be creative that we were back game yeah um actually uh from time to time because i'm sorry man that step show from howard man in my mind that was like the super bowl um you know i'll talk to people and kind of show them that how i came to alpha and stuff like that and even in looking at the video i see so many mistakes i see so many things i'm like man i could have did that better um and it was a hot show it was a hot show like we had fog and all kind of crazy things going on that sound effects and lights going off sound like a helicopter was about to land on the building people screaming in the stadium it was it was a super bowl for me but i can go through there and i look and i can hear like the mistakes i made with the audio how like it's clipping the speakers and the spot because i wasn't paying attention to levels and i could see some of the graphic art that i had did like the motion graphics was just trash man but people loved it because nobody was doing that kind of stuff um and then to go back to um something you know more recent that i that i put out to the point that it gets the attention of lieutenant governor like hey that looks good you know that growth it's those moments where you're kind of like man i just think i'm boring and average you know and this person thinks this is some great work and it's not until you go back and see some of that past work and compared to what you're doing right now that you can start to appreciate you'll spend most of your time going i'm not good enough i'm not good enough i'm not good enough go back and look at where you started go back and look at the beginning work and you'd be like man we've come a long way you know so i love that so funny thing is i'm gonna say that to you it's like now that we can say that how do we how me and you both of us we're on this podcast together how do we both do you need like a accountability buddy but how do we how do we infuse that we there's a balance right we're trying to fine tune that balance of being better better better every day but also not the end of the day like still celebrate that we're getting better because like you i'm gonna i'm gonna say to the listeners this was um i posted on facebook a while ago it was like uh it was frank right here that told me go ahead and listen to your first episode and listen to it and see where it was when they alright i'll listen to it and i'm going to give you mad shout out that that joke juiced me up because i was like i did not imagine how many times i said um or stutter how many times i was got to myself like maybe i'll stick with this podcast like maybe and i was like three years later and i was like i think that's an exercise and i'm going to challenge all people that are creative to like if you ever create if you make videos and make music or or do anything like i would challenge you to go back and listen to your first ever or watch or look at your first ever just randomly go back into archives and you would be surprised if you really cared about something it's like almost like a tangible like tangible testament to that so i don't know what made you say that to me i'm going on tandy what made you say that to me to do that um the one i had did it uh so [Laughter] i had did it uh but no um ah i'm not trying to get long-winded man but can i just get along with it all right this is kind off topic but i'm gonna bring it back around all right uh all right so in some communities particularly our own uh you come across people who are the fenna people you know i'm finna do this i'm finna do that i'm gonna do this i'm thinking about doing this we bout to do this we bout to do that um and i'm sure they exist in every community but i'm just speaking to what i'm i'm aware of you know um and you as as i'm getting older i'm noticing that the number of people who are actually doing things versus the people who are talking about what they're about to do there is manager the cream is like rising to the top it's like the the numbers of people who are doing things is much much smaller okay so set that in your mind right and here i am you know when you first started the podcast um somehow we connected and it wasn't it wasn't through it was maybe through alpha but somehow we connected you you celebrated me on the vagapath stuff yeah i think i think you shared one of my promotions or something like that yeah i don't know but i was looking for content i was looking for content i was like i'm not gonna share something i'm not genuinely interested in because nobody's gonna read it and then that caught my attention i was like oh man that's that's pretty dope this is this is awesome this guy is dope so i go through and i listen to your podcast and then i look at the number of podcasts you have in there and immediately you went from a finite dude to uh i'm doing it dude because it wasn't like ah here's another analogy i'm sorry i'm speaking analogies right so i'm doing it dude is the dude who uh is who takes you to chuck e cheese right and he shows you his i'm doing it pit that's that ball pit right it's got blue balls green balls yellow balls a whole bunch when you use a little kid remember products i used to get and you would just take a big leap of faith and just just jump on in that ball pit like wow and it's just like throw the balls around and just hang out in there oh man chuck e cheese's greatest place on the face of planet um you swimming around like scrooge duck the finido is the dude that has like one or two balls in that big old pit and expects you to jump around there and be ex happy with his accomplishments i can only get so excited when i can when i can look around me and i go there's a lot more here for me to explore than what you told me about when you when you under promise and overproduce you know i jump i jump in this this pit of creativity and there's a lot of stuff in here for me to interact with the fennep people will have one or two things and they expect you to celebrate the one or two things oh look it's a green one it's a blue one it's a yellow one you got all the colors great now fill this thing up and you existed that was chucky cheese man i looked around and there was a lot of stuff for me to interact with a lot of different topics you know some of them i was like okay i don't know anything about that let me click it another one's like oh this is my thing let me listen to it before i knew it i spent like four hours with you you know what i'm saying so that's um the reason i would say something like that to you is because that felt like the journey that i was on you know and as i'm skipping around i'm listening i'm going a lot of audio sounds better oh he sounds a little bit more confident and i was like that's the growth um i did it and i was like man that's powerful that motivated me and i thought maybe giving that back to you would be some motivation i love that one as i appreciate that too well i love chuck e cheese my kids love chicken cheese uh three is i think that i think as i said earlier you know i work with a lot of creative students at mason and so i'm going to definitely employ them that's going to be one of my strategies that i say to them is like you know when someone is beating themselves up i definitely want to tell you that's going to be an exercise like you know what's crazy it does it works even better if you like with something every day think about this for the listeners at home i know this your show i'm going to take you know for a second take it over the list is at home who's like man i'm not that creative you know i don't i don't do photographs i don't do podcasts i'm not a videographer i'm not that you may be like what where's my growth come from go back in time to your very very first facebook post yeah all right i gotta do that okay i gotta do that go back and look how confused you were at how this whole process worked like how you interacted with the people on your feet or the things you wrote in there the fact how long it took before you added your first picture think about that go back to that and then compare that to the last post that you did and and think about the speed it took for you to figure out the exact right thing to say the first five or six times you're on facebook but like right now you could be like oh squirrel and that's your post it's it's it's that you'll post that the growth is definitely there you know natural growth like at bare minimum people have exponential growth but like we all at some form or fashion we're going to crawl into walking we all grow i'm gonna do that challenge man we're gonna call it my first ever facebook challenge i'm gonna tag you on that because i remember what facebook and this is tangent too when facebook was said you had to say is like philip is and it was always his statement oh yeah yeah yeah philip is happy yeah i bet mine are probably pretty embarrassing in regards to social media content but as technology grows we grew with it but once we got more skill um i love that like dang man you dropping gems because i think a lot of people would be embarrassed about their first facebook post so we're talking about being creative we're talking about first ever we're talking about growth we're all over the map but we're at the core of it is expressing ourselves creatively using new skills now with that being said creativity is going to ever change right like uh you taught me new things stream yard skills or not skills but actual technology has grown uh from you doing that first or that step show at howard on a vhs camera to now so how do you you particularly and then how would you suggest someone else that wants to be creative in videos audio photos all that how do you stay ahead in the game and keep up you know because that that is definitely something that's going to benefit you to keep up uh creativity's ever changing technology that were changing so how do you keep up with that that that growing technology for me um i i feel like knowing what to keep up with and what not to keep up with uh some people think creativity is being inspired by everything you see and replicating it like that's a type of creativity but sometimes you just gotta like andre 3000 your way out of a situation man sometimes you just gotta you gotta go look i'm there's plenty of influences out there but i just want to play in my own world and do something that is not being done before i just want to do what feels comfortable i want to do what feels right you know i want to figure that thing out and and and believe it or not you'll get so i believe i believe then speaking of myself um i believe that there's gonna come a point where i'm gonna be so passionate about this journey that i'm on that it's gonna matter to me more than being accepted by other people and it's unique how that time happens and people like he's ahead of his peers why because you took a path no one else took you didn't take the path that was traveled by everybody else you were like i i want to experiment with sepia photos to to the cows come home everyone's on black and white right now or you know um everybody's doing vertical video i want to do horizontal video or i'll go back to square video and see how i can make that happen you know um just experimenting and finding a passion that you you you are so passionate about that you you know how to do that thing better than anybody else knows how to do it technology is a tool to get you there you know like oh sad here's another example we are zoomed out right now in kovic you know what i'm saying right now right as a real zoom like we're zoomed out but we are zoomed out right now as far as covert is concerned but think about it think about the events you see uh in in in the social world right now everybody gives a zoom pass code a key we all sit on the screen staring at each other and we're looking at eight different cameras and the viewers like okay i've seen this before i don't think i care anymore that tool that technology tool offers so much more that we're just not tapping into right um i i said this uh i communicated this to my chapter um today i was like there's so much more to this tool that we're not even tapping into and uh that's when our audio was all jacked up earlier um because i still had those settings and they uh by the time we got through with the presentation we i'd gotten a how in the world did you do this like how has this even come together i didn't spend any money i just spent maybe an hour or two on youtube just trying to figure out creative ways to use zoom how are people using it differently and then came with my own idea hey how have we thought about this for an event you know um people do happy hours right we got the dj the guy who wants to dj uh on instagram because you know they see d knights doing you got the the the happy hour and zoom that everyone wants to do it we've got still 18 different talking heads but you know zoom is a great product why why isn't there a game night why why isn't somebody taking the screen tagging controller screen and playing family feud why isn't someone you know able to do as a perfectly good platform to do something like that or or you know pay the extra money to to get the webinar and and host jeopardy amongst you know some high-ranking colleagues and you know take that to social media to have a conversation about it those are uses of zoom that i personally haven't seen but they're fully capable um fully capable of being done a bingo come on now bingo it could be could be done on a platform so it's sometimes it's not about staying on top of technology it's just using the old technology in new ways like someone like i was thinking about like you know you said using old technology in new ways but you know somewhere out there someone the polaroid camera and the cool stuff with the puller room it's not the capstone of the actual technology it's like like how do you how do you push these instruments to their limits but also it's like you know someone out there someone like took a picture laying on their back you know yeah different angles and yep let me lay on my back and take a picture upward or you know but it's the same camera so i love that idea i love that like you push it like why don't we try this why don't we try that why don't we try this you know like and tinker but it's not the same thing yeah that's crazy you didn't think about that but that takes time though that's that's the one cause we we look at time wild though we look at we look at time crazy like we look at time i'm wrong and something i do i know i do so i i'm the quickest person to tell you i don't have time for that right i'll tell you no i don't think i really have time for that but then my candy crush score is dope you know like like i'm doing decent in candy crush like uh video games cyberpunk just came out you know that's i i i i can sit there and tell you about how that opening sequence went the miles morales i can tell you how that sequence went you know um we we decide how we're going to use time and there's just sometimes we could take some things out to create time for other things you know um i was telling my daughter the other day i said um my daughter i really wanted her i'm not saying that she needs to go vocational but i'd be okay with that because there are some great opportunities in the vocational realm but i was saying to my daughter she was like dad i want to get a job at the roller skating rink and i was like sorry babe i'm not the conventional parent i'm like if you want to get a job at the roller skating rink i'm just going to tell you i'm going to be disappointed she goes why i was like you've been doing some great job with those nails that you've been painting she's like yeah but i don't think i want to be a nail tech it's like great you don't have to be a nail tech but we can do some simple math you can assume what you'd make at the roller skating rink you could get your cleanliness up you can get your skills up you can build an instagram account you can start showing your nails off and somebody pay you 30 40 to do their nails i was like how many people do you think it would take for you to do uh to to pull off 300 and she was like no i'm 10 people at 30 okay minus your supplies and and things let's go ahead and just double that let's say you need to get 20 people you know and and you know you put some money away you you'd have about 300 right 20 people in two weeks i was like how long how much time would that take for you to do 20 people's nails she says about an hour each person so 20 hours in two weeks 10 hours a week and you could make north of four north of 400 even after paying taxes and paying for your supplies i said let's do the math on what that salary is that they're offering at the roller skating rink how do we get to 400 and we couldn't do it in a month and so it was it was the idea of showing her that she's like well dad i don't know if i have time to learn how to get really good and i said okay well we have to how do i put a tour i said because this is this is the gym i was trying to drop sorry about that um there you go dad gems i love it this is the gym much oh i i i i communicated to her that we need to spend more time in this world creating than consuming okay okay i was like we need to spend more time creating than consuming and i was like if you were going to spend that time watching tv or spend that time listening uh to to just music without doing anything else or on the phone talking to friends that's consuming there's nothing wrong with that there's time for it but imagine if you spent more time let's imagine if every day you said i'm gonna take i'm gonna break my nails down and and i'm gonna do a new set of nails every day at the end of the month you'd have 30 nails and that's that chuck e cheese analogy again after one month there's 30 there's 30 balls in the pit after two months there's 60 balls in the pit yeah you know what i'm saying at the end of year there's 365 balls in the pit you're a 16 year old with 365 sets of customized nails on your instagram account who in their right mind when you approach them and say hey i wanna do your nails and i'll charge you forty dollars to do it my nails are so much more expensive than forty dollars they see what they see the work they see what you've been able to do they're gonna let you do it yeah i was about to say i love that mindset i love the time mindset i love you know the value of time we're both very busy parents uh we we uh squeeze in our create creative differs like endeavors late night look at me doing this podcast at night um but i think i i do a lot of things what i call is like stacking right like like um if i got tasked i'm gonna try to do two at the same time i know someone's gonna get out there and say like you know multitasking is not a real thing and but that but i i definitely value that like if i can listen and learn and still do something like i'm definitely gonna grow at the same time so maybe you kind of spoke to it you you broke that down to your daughter about learning a new skill how do you balance learning something new creatively and still doing your nine to five because i know uh even if you're called siri at your job um your job is not the photo guy your job is something else you're adding creativity and learning that so how do you balance that how do you learn that um in addition to your nine to five how do you make time for it if i'm gonna sit here on this podcast and act like i figured that out man i'm lying to everybody everybody yo listen man come on dude he lied man he don't tell the truth i know that uh but if i was to say some tools that i use that help me stay somewhat balanced man being creative man like you're creative your brain is always going 18 different different different directions man and there's times where you know i need to be focused and i'm i'm off wondering why isn't this done different wait i need to focus right now you know um but if anything um i happen to occupy a place where i can i can delegate tasks and honestly it's expected of me to delegate a lot of tasks um i have i've had to dedicate time to doodling in that space if that makes sense of tinkering in that space like understanding how to get better at delegating like hey what should i delegate what should i delegate um and that's that's a that's man that's huge and then automation um is is another big uh a big thing you were talking about stacking trying to do two and three uh tasks yeah uh i have to do the same thing i may want to blow my instagram up um something i'm wrestling with now because i've never really taken it serious you know and i look at guys who have like 4 000 5 000 followers and i'm like i'm thinking wow that's pretty dope you know you you you're validated by those number of followers but i'm like my work is better than yours man like what's up why aren't y'all loving my stuff but i'm not i'm not putting it out um so i gotta automate some of that stuff so you know like you were talking about stacking i need to go out and shoot and then after shooting i need to schedule posts with some sort of automation process to get that information out there and then that's the way that i would end up growing so automating delegating is um one piece and they eat your vegetables man um that last piece of eating your vegetables is as a little kid remember you ain't really want to eat the broccoli you don't want to eat all that stuff you but so some kids were just like they cry and wine and just never do it and then they'd have this like wild vitamin deficiency and then you'd have to pay like a dollar a day to keep them fed or something like that i don't know how it works but the point is um uh it's then there was the kids who were like man i hate these vegetables here's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna shove them all in my mouth i'm gonna chew them up and i'm gonna swallow them and i'm gonna go on about my life right there like i've always been that kid get it over with get over it yeah i like that i always felt like i was that kid if it is like man i hate these vegetables as much as you do i'm gonna eat i'm gonna put all these on my mouth i'm gonna try to swallow them and then since mom is happy that they're not on my plate anymore i'm gonna go in the bathroom if i'm tomorrow or do whatever i gotta do get these vegetables but just get it done and so in life there's tasks at work there's tasks in my creative endeavors just task and alpha i don't want to do and i try to put those vegetables first i try to try to go i don't want to do this so i'm going to focus on getting this done knock it out and then knowing that desserts on the horizon i got a motivator dragging me through that task so balancing i can't give you that answer but those are some tools that i use to keep me keep me kind of going in the right direction yeah i like that too i was about to say like i try to knock out stuff i don't want to do i definitely stack a lot you know like um you know stacking is things like where you do something you really don't like i like to do but you do something you like at the same time for instance like dang i don't want to clean up doesn't vacuum this car that sucks i don't want to vacuum this car but stacking wise is if i'm going to vacuum this car i'm going to listen to a podcast i like like i'm going to do something i like and do at the same time so that i'm benefiting doing this whack ass you know labor but i'm learning at the same time it's overlapping and so i try to do that a lot i try to stack a lot and i heard about that about time because time is limited but um i definitely listen and listen to other people um and then in regards to positive uh not positive but in creativity and learning i do exactly what you say like if i'm gonna knock out stuff so i have a little bit of space to to learn things that i want to learn which is you know you know getting better at podcasting in the mic all those things but i have to knock out my nine to five first before i one of the things i wanted to talk about that is really interesting or whatever for this podcast is that we're both sometimes stifled in regards to the structure of organizations you know uh the brand the brand of organizations um you know and i'm not gonna say but the brand of alpha the brand of our organization the brand of mason there's there's certain things that lend us to that you know if we're going to be creative but we have to be creative in regards to the confines of this space because like i can't say you know the brand of alpha i could be creative but i can't say purple right you trying to get punched in the mouth no exactly right like there is a certain there's a certain parameter to the brand so how do we express ourselves creatively but stay still stay in the confines of established brands and the the message and the goals of someone else that makes sense um i think for me uh right now uh an example of that is uh the branding guy that just came out okay right that brand guide is dope uh i love the fact that we put the time and effort into the branding guide for fraternity right what the brand looks like how do you represent the brand what fonts what colors yes though i've seen that brand again yes yeah i think that's dope i hate it yeah exactly yeah it's like it's like it's like it's like you know me me and you are uh we are non-traditionalist rebels but we also definitely respect i respect and i know you respect the history the the tradition oh yeah it's like how do you be an anti-traditionalist and so you know ask questions why why why but at the same time i respect the traditions i respect the way it is so how do we balance that with our creative brains i'm okay being i'm okay being told no like i'm i'm it does not bother me like i'm going to tell you i hate it i'm going to comply right you just got to get this that's stupid you know but i'm still going to you know do the thing but um how do i that as an example for the branding guide is like a lot of people look at that as like the biggest roadblock i can't do anything i'm just going to stop or i'm just going to ignore it right and we were talking about earlier take this old technology and find a new way to use it so the branding guide no matter how detailed it wants to be in this particular example is not going to cover every single possible case so how can i create something that's exciting something that's new something that's eye-catching and remain inside that branding guy and when you do you're like man you know that that's the created that's finding finding a creative pocket in the space in which you exist how can i put my stank on this thing that i'm doing you know um so i got to use these colors i got to use these fonts but hey it doesn't say anything about depth maybe i instead of making this a static graphic i'm going to go ahead and use motion graphics there's no section in that brand you got about motion graphics so that's what we're going to do here you know um i can incorporate video i can you know i can pull animation you know those types of things take this old tech or take this old this other tool and find new ways to use it um that's just that's fun to me that that piece of it just finding a pocket in which you can play where you can still remain you know create a flying a plane there's stuff you do the same way every single time but there there are always pockets where you can find little pieces of of creativity okay so this plane needs to be at this altitude because the controller told me to be at this altitude but guess what i still get to call into atc and give them a greeting you know and give them my call sign and ask for wants me to go do i just give them my tail number and ask for a heading or do i say hey good morning or good afternoon or happy new year can i be excited when i talk to the dude you know listen for the reaction so just find little pockets you can exist exist in to still maintain your interest i love it i was like basically the human beings are going to find a way and also we find loopholes i love that i love that i love that uh so definitely uh if you're using the alpha branding guide do not use purple [Laughter] that was the lesson and we found a roundabout way please use the right colors use purple but learn how to duck that that might be that might be the better i love it i love it and so i got one more question for you last segment what in regards to your creativity and using technology what is something particularly for 2011 or just the future of technology what is something that excites you oh man that um i think uh i want to believe that like there was a time where people would go to like the little expos like the ones they show at disney disneyland like man this is the future and you go to this expo to get excited about the things to come in the future the thing i'm excited about is like the right now has so much tech and so much crazy stuff and so much access that i don't even have to dream about the future that's a little overwhelming there's just stuff around us right now that's super super exciting um uh like imagine this this podcast right this podcast is not only going to be broadcast to god knows how many people thousands of people but there's a possibility thousands give me credit 200. i love how you're so nice to me but i'm saying i'm okay okay see that's you thinking about the now that's you in that old school disneyland mentality you looking at the numbers right right now i'm saying that podcast is going to be there for a while bro you know what i'm saying it's going to be there for a while and and somebody's going to go back through your entire archive it's going to be listened to by thousands upon thousands of people it's not live on the airways gone and done it it's gone people are gonna hear and have access to it instantly um at the at the tip of their fingers like the future right now is like wow like i can take a photo and frame it in such a way that you know someone goes wow that's a really interesting thing i'd like to i'd like to pay you three thousand dollars for it i can't imagine someone paying me three thousand dollars or something i just went okay done um but the the the future like around us right now is pretty pretty exciting man you have your own tv station in your own house you know i mean you got your own broadcast radio station in your house i got a video studio just back there you know on the camera where you know i can address the entire you know state of virginia at a moment's notice you know so that i just think that's the right now is to intro i'm excited about just our ability to connect our ability to be creative our ability to to to be our true selves you know well one i love that too maybe right like maybe go in the future 15 years maybe this podcast will get a thousand listens you know maybe no i never know but i definitely i definitely feel that so we're at the part of the show i call shot for shot uh meaning you get to ask me any random question i get to ask you a question i like random random is my thing you wanna go first i'll go first oh you go first let's i want to see how randa i don't want to violate any rules you know what i'm saying i'm a i'm a habitual line stepper so i don't i don't want to get you kicked off the podcast circuit okay so you um went to hell right i'm gonna throw a wrench um about the hb uh hbcu experience uh you're in california yes you went across the country yeah what was unique about your howard experience and why do you think it was better for you to go to howard uh than stay in california or particularly even add another layer go to uh predominantly white institution like ucla where i started um yeah yeah yeah um so okay uh to across the country right to howard what made me go there and what was unique about my experience um wow man okay so i thought being from l.a living around a lot of black people um being from the hood watching a lot of bt i knew black people right you come across people you say something a certain way they respond a certain way you're like man that's crazy black people are the same you know oh going to howard oh my gosh man there were so many different types of black people man it was it was scary and beautiful all at the exact same time man um i had a dude i'm gonna leave his name out of here but i had a dude who just did he just was can't get right and maybe that's saying a lot because i'm coming from the military right so to me you you got one chance to stumble on the second time you better figure out right um this dude just can't get right in the college environment and i was like dang i just felt sorry for them so i was like hey let me let me just help you all out let me give you some tips hey let me pull you along and we can study and all that other good stuff come to find out this dude is at howard because his he has family members very close family members that are royalty in another country you like what you know what i'm saying like you struggling writing sentences that you you you were royalty like dang you were down to earth dude like you you did not meet any of my expectations for the position you occupy on this planet right um so that was a wild wild experience i was like dang i mean button-down shirts that's at the time jay-z was doing with the button-down type situation rocking jays and jeans you know funny dude that's how we connected just both having a sense of humor and i'm like that didn't make sense so my experience at howard was just completely just re re-shocking me to how broad and how different our culture really is like i can't say i know all black people because i don't and i can't say you know we're all the same because we're different in so many different ways and lastly i think this is kind of my plug for the hbcu kind of circuit is i enjoy going to howard because most of my time whether it was in i went to a school in east l.a so it's mostly hispanic community i look different everywhere i went from high school on like one of like six black people in my entire school right looked very different joined the navy um and then had some jobs on the enlisted side where i was like one of two black people in my entire division um and then here i am getting picked up for this commissioning program to you know get ready to go fly planes where i know i'm gonna be one of only a few handful of black people to get into a classroom where everyone looks like me and not wonder if the reason that i am excelling is because i'm different that someone is taking pity on me or you know what that's pretty good for a black guy like it's not that it's hey that's pretty good because you met the standard and exceeded it so it it did wonders for my for my confidence going back into an environment where i look different i was just like hey i'm good because i'm good not because i look different i love it shut up shout out to my few uh hbc experience when i went to bowie state shout out to that for our transfer to jmu but now that i go back into it i'm glad i get started and um i do i do feel that now i wish i wish i could have been put my mind my 35 year old mom into that 18 year old i definitely was still transferring a lot i love jmu i would have still transferred but i would have appreciated doing a little bit more for what it was when i was there i could see it for that space that it was it's crazy all right okay my shot okay uh random it's two o'clock in the morning right you're woken up because you have to go to the restroom really bad i'm talking really really really bad really bad right and uh you have a wrestling uh downstairs you look over your wife is uh in the bed with you and between you all of your kids so you know it's not your kids you know it's not your wife you got a big rustling downstairs no pets you got to use the bathroom really really bad what are you doing hitting the bathroom first we're going to go figure out what this uh surprising situation is why that's your question yeah i might go pee first i don't care yeah like we're gonna let the enemy advance on your position before you defend your family i'm gonna defend my family if i gotta pee you got a point you got a point that and also i uh you know um i'm not alone uh and i'm gonna say this on the podcast my wife is the boss of the house whatever and i'm not i'm not allowed to have firearms in my home i lock it up because uh i'd probably be like billy bob and shoot myself on accident um so uh i definitely have a lot of people on my roster uh i have i mean maybe like what happened to me but you know if the zombie apocalypse pops off right i got about 10 brothers and 10 people that got firearms at least i know i'll be safe okay if i get out of my house yeah if you can make it out so with that exit strategy if the zombie apocalypse was that happened today yes i have to connect with at least i got the people i got to connect with to for my survival camp okay okay and with that i already know my role my role in the zombie apocalypse would be that guy you know that person that um that connects the clans you know kind of the recruiter yeah that would be me the broker the information broker yeah the one that goes out like yo go go out there and don't get killed but be really nice and join our clan that would be me gotcha do we only get one question you want to get one question you can get another one because that one was kind of like i was about to say i'm going to be the rest of what happened my family might get you know done so but you know whatever i can ask that question man i know you're honest so um my question is you have 30 seconds you did they we invented time travel you have 30 seconds you have 30 seconds with a version of yourself how old are you and what are you saying at 30 seconds hey so i was like well you got to go so can i can i like like if i knew i had a threes if i knew if you told me i had 30 seconds i'd probably write out what i want to say this is like me overthinking it but i'll be honest i would write out what i had to say so i know i can fit as much as i could in the 30 seconds you know like write a little speech to myself and i would write that speech to hey there's two moments i really want to do so i'm gonna can i i'm gonna do two because i don't care i'll break through one moment be right right after i got married like right after i pulled myself aside right after i said i do and i'll speak to myself and say you know uh you're marrying your best friend please do this that and this but just know that you're gonna have kids and it's gonna be hard like like some kind of like pep talk you know like it's gonna be hard that's a pep talk no i mean i got the 30 seconds i don't have my full 30 second speech out man hey uh you you're marrying your best friend you're gonna have kids and you're gonna hate your life no no not hate no all right bye gotta go back to the future i was gonna be like hey you're marrying your best friend you'll have kids and i was like yo make sure you spend time make sure you do this uh make sure like within the five years before you have kids do as much do crazy stuff do as much as you can definitely i'm writing it out right now so it's gonna be a bunch of mo it's gonna be like a full monologue but just encouraging myself but but you know talking to myself now and but also just being rear from it this is probably the best i would say this is the best thing that's ever happened to your ass like honestly yeah you marry and your wife and the future you're building together is the best thing you're doing so congrats to you congrats that myself i would gather myself up and i would zoom out that's one and then another one would i'd be i would talk to myself uh right so before i got married i would talk to myself about uh right after i graduated college like i pulled myself to the side right after i graduated and i would say like almost like a career counseling speech i would say you know hey you graduated you really enjoy jmu uh your first job is definitely not going to be your last job you're not going to know exactly what you're going to do just keep holding on to doing what you're doing that you did good at college which is making friends and being nice and just being goofy as hell and uh being open to new things like you did in college because i was good at that i randomly went to china and studied abroad i randomly took classes all like how to so i would say always learn continue to learn but that's more than 30 seconds so i'd have to write that real quick so i'd read it to myself i'd pop up and say hey uh you're good at connecting with people do things like you went to china and be open to new experiences and keep on trying and learn keep on learning so those are people too love you two moments i love that question but i'd have to jam pack it and i'll have to rehearse it yeah i can get so i can get the most into my 30 seconds that i could get oh man that was a good question man that's right can i give you credit that's probably one of the best questions i've got answered on the uh chopper shop oh man one of the best i don't know i got like top five but that definitely was one of the things okay thank you i appreciate it i need that first question to soften you up to see what you're gonna give me well the first question was basically you're going to get murdered with your family because you want to go first i appreciate that whatever second one hit me thinking a little bit you got two people man you got the guy who always wants to look cool in front of everybody man it's your podcast man so you got your listeners your viewers at home know you're honest man that's the thing they know you honest i could believe everything you ever told them on this podcast man and my best friend told me he said uh he said he said it's odd because you know i got the wild hair going on right now too just because i'm doing the natural thing but he said frank uh i want you to look at most of the successful african-american men in our in our history and he said none of them got shape-ups yeah i'm about to go look at everyone i i got pictures i got like the whole i'm not going to look of frederick douglass you know saying that that frederick douglass was was going a little wild out there you shouldn't have okay but the king had to shake up nah i mean most of the pictures he pulled out he was not shaped up man he was looking a little fuzzy man like you know somebody would have hit he would have been in the club somebody be like hey man do you i got a card for a barber i like they would have hooked him up or something you know and uh we we was looking hard because at the time president obama was still the president and i was like i know he's been shaped up before but at that time in his presidency he was like man i don't even care about these he doesn't wear his wave cap no mo it was can i tell you about the time randomly this is another tangent i did uh shook hands with obama one time oh you didn't tell me about that [Music] because no because i was at a conference yeah and it was a health care conference shout out to my father-in-law families usa and obama was on stage and i said obama i reached my hand out and he grabbed my hand and i was like yo his hand is bony as hell ah but i think he was you know he's skinny but i did not i did not expect for like two seconds when i grabbed his hand and he held my hand that his hair would have felt like that oh you wanted it to be like a nice warm hand that was maybe not slimy warm i wanted to be warm and like strong like strong fingers that jump was not that strong that's your next shot for question you should set it up and be like hey i should stick president obama's hands my wife was there too she got evidence i think i could i think i thought i was like this is like uh this is the second term the phone wasn't that great i gotta find it i got like a selfie obama's hand you know what's crazy i got like all of my friends like i feel like all of my close friends have pictures with either president obama or michelle i don't have no pictures with with president obama i don't know i don't know how that's a thing everyone my commissioning certificate is signed by president obama and i've never seen him or shook his hand or anything in the store that that i washed my hands when i went to the bathroom so i'm like what's so there it is i'm not gonna wash my hands until i do yeah i love it my wife was there too so she could verify that story business back i touch obama's head um with that being said it's been a great podcast uh this

alright", "MzUEJeHdi9k": "hi guys welcome back to my channel I'm so excited yes you guessed it that's right this is my favorite can be over it so does yours so it's good it's like these bug light red licorice with notes I wrote I'm sure you seen it usually Americans didn't let me out it's a wash Briley and let's do this it is the best 6:50 chew toy how's this see-through no way there was a safer note on there don't stop this video before I die okay", "yoSyu3YCr3w": "what's up guys welcome back to the channel it's been a minute but we actually have a lot of spare time now living this coronavirus today one of my favorite candies as a kid growing up with these nerds thanks to this day so we're gonna do our own little experiment and see if we can't make them myself so I got a big bag of gummy bears and we're probably just gonna pick out like the red all the raids in here probably to raise you know but if there's not enough we'll just use so we got a big package gummy bears 10 boxes emerge a nerve growth to kind of compare the mind to the actual see you know which one looks better and then we have parchment paper we're gonna go ahead and get into this [Applause] so we're going to start by taking and putting all the red ones in here that should be enough straight quarters of a cup full of gummies so what we're doing is we're gonna get them to put the microwave and let them get melted and while that's doing that we're going to get the nerds and stuff laid out I'm gonna go ahead and get these nerds laid out across this parchment paper and then we'll heat up the wines and wiping notes so what you really want to do is just kind of justice I guess I could have them all together Dean just kind of make them a little bit flatter alright so now that that's how we got the merge done and we're going to go ahead and heat up the gummies get them melted and we're gonna put them across pull the hopefully it melts down how we need it to and we'll pour it across here put some dogs over it wrap it up put it in the frigerator way to cool yeah I got so it kind of turned out like we needed it to so let's go ahead and get this poured across here we can make another one alright so now we're going to take these nerds now take your cuts of paper and you fold it like that look we're gonna make a mess but it's okay just like that for this next one we're gonna make huge one so we got both of them here I left them in the freezer for about 10 minutes but I started thinking I hope this stuff does not stick to this parchment paper when it cooled down in the fridge rater just so that's one screw it up is the original that's a very very don't know what I've never looks like come on looks I could be known better you know now some see what might look like and what might taste like so first the first we're going to do is the one that we try to make the original size she stuck that I let y'all see that looking good gonna look bad now I could get it up okay you ready to see the water just a masterpiece and hey we got a thing now well I think huh Hey oh yeah well you're thinking it's a little deformed that's okay though let's try let's see what it tastes like believe it or not it tastes just like undergrowth identical Luke the same tastes the same do it for me I just blew it right there so I did this one so we know it turns out good let's see if this big one turned out good okay well y'all think y'all ready for it I am going to get these extra hurt play it out oh my yeah that was a lot okay so ready for it masterpiece Oh ready I'm kind of scared I know this was I know this was probably like this was gonna be messed up 2,000 years later look at straight what Hey so my wife said I couldn't good look at me Shep it with Chan one time so if you want to try this yourself all you need is some gummy bears obviously you don't need that big of a batting that's a pretty big bag there's another smaller size you can get nerds some parchment paper or you can get some wax paper whichever one you prefer and what I did was I put my gummies in a glass measuring cup and put it in a microwave first put in there for 15 seconds and then look at it see what you think and then I did 30 seconds and I stopped it like 10 seconds earlier I think so then 15 and 20 look at it see what it looks like think it needs more put it back in there for a couple more sayings just monitor it you know you don't want to put it in there for a minute walk away because it's lovely blow up or just yeah it's not gonna work okay then you put it in the frigerator for 10 minutes they didn't turn out too bad they actually look pretty good except with this last one that won't just come screw around I probably could have made about three or four these nerd ropes with just $10 and it was $10 one I spent like six books on the book gummies which I didn't even use half of them yeah guys if you ever just want to make some nerve ropes instead of going out bottom maybe just do something fun especially in this quarantine know if you're in the quarantine get your mom to get you some stuff or your dad or you can go get it and so you wanna make it yourself so you know guys I definitely had a lot more time that'll be making videos but I need video ideas it's actually super hard to think of video ideas so if you watch I went to the end please leave a video idea please and thank you guys so much for the support and I'll see you guys in the next one", "zL3T8_MT8Dk": "welcome back lovely people for another snack song by the way let it mention this before all of these snacks I've never tried so there are new experience with y'all I've never eaten sweet tarts I just I really don't like too many sweet things but I was like why not why not try something sweet with you and again if you guys don't like me being fidgety I'm in school it's cherry punch flavor no artificial flavors or colors oh goodness a hundred and eighty calories per serving and one serving is one package 27 grams of sugar and this is not a sufficient source of anything so except fat sugar okay okay okay I don't like sour things that's a good see from my face the sweetness is actually not all that sweet it's kind of like a small hint of sweetness but when they said tart they mince it they're tart in the middle it's not a bad card it's actually a really interesting one it's not like super like I can't handle anything sour so like I'm gonna make a face like you give me a sour head and I'm gonna die but these are actually pretty flimsy I thought they would be a little more stable I thought this would be a way more sweet it's not probably it's all part because it's just sweet huh and kind of pulls kind of pulls like gum and if you're not into the that's kind of a flavor of a crane or something when you first bite into it but then you're hit with like it's tart I'm sorry guys this tart flavor I'm not gonna finish all of these like [Music] two out of five [ __ ] y'all think alright see you guys in another either mukbang her snack bun bye have a good day", "cRY4WQIBc3E": "yummmm I got these raspberry chews off an assorted gummy stick and same with the strawberries I found these cute gummy kababs at my local grocery store they taste like sweet strawberries hehe lmao up next are the eye ball gummy jelly balls if I manage not to drop them all mmmmm classic this is what my eye balls look like every morning peeling them off my pillow they have a sour filling inside... that is so stinkin good guys the outside is made of marshmallow a really sticky marshmallow... lol I could eat a whole jar of these eye balls muhahahah mmmmm cherry sours these are so underrated I love how they aren't too sweet while still containing 250g of sugar pretty sure the candy is good... when your hand gets frozen into one position while eating them gummy sharkies :D these are cherry flavoured the sharks really compliment the sours in such a rich and intellegent way wax lips time these are made of wax guys, I do not eat these and apparently I don't chew them either Wax Lips come in all kinds of flavors these ones are cherry you basically just chew on them like gum I love how fun they are I'm not sure what happens if you swallow these but I'm sure its not good for you why do I love saying Nerd Ropes in different accents these are sour cherry Star Wars Nerd Ropes I got a box of them and they are almost all gone lmao sprankles I guess it doesn't that the slipper was broken if you just bite it in half no one: where's your shoes?

then we have a baby baby key he's cute ok so today we're gonna be showing you how to make so you want to take your container and then you want to add in your clear good okay so now we're adding in clear glue we're using crazy our bland because we could not find the Elmer's glue we were so mad about it - we're just gonna let that drip and okay so we're gonna add pink food coloring Hey and then Marie is gonna add in some red glitter just to give it a little to give it a little bit and we're gonna add in also wait let's mix that first right yep we're gonna mix it first the next Saturday mix mix well that's so pretty think of Christmas sign one long yeah and then obviously for your nerd rope time you all need your rainbow foam beads [Music] I don't know why beats hi parody yep for as much as you want in breathe we're using quite a bit so it's kind of crunchy extra country extra kind a we're gonna add more later once it's we're all done activating and everything we just want to put it in a little bit so it's just a week another experiment if we need more if it need less or whatever okay now it's time to add your activator when you're done right add two pumps of activator this is actually not dope it has activated and it's not your strong one so it's not strong activator it's actually a later activator because we do not want us to be over at why do pictures of your big bowl for just a little slide but I know I feel it so bad no more activator I just look a little bit sticky so much powder two three I could Worcester okay so we're gonna check it out and start beating that mean yeah do you think we need a little bit more foam beads or more activator it's not really that stretchy do you need it we just need to add out to be here because it's a curly yeah a little bit of lotion because it's a little and it goes to be kind of opaque I have no idea what that means but [Music] [Music] so now we're going to add it because it's really stiff and like not that is often we don't want me to fall out oh this is like a clear notion though yeah so we're good we're all good I'm just gonna keep beating and this looks like a mess but trust me I always do this I always make

Factory and you can see it in every every product that's made here this is what the sweet dog process starts first a wave of sugar feeds from an outside silo into the mixer twenty-five thousand pounds of sugar a day that's roughly about the weight of 20 adult sized elephant flavor and color mixed together with a special ingredient that adds the tart it's called malic acid yes it is to get the hanging flavors to sweetheart the sugar mixture blends for several minutes then moves through pipes to the pressroom pressure on the powder to make a solid the tablet press spits out more than two thousand sweet tarts every minute different machines make five sweetheart flavors fruit punch cherry grape orange and green apple here's a secret for you do you know sweet tarts have a relative with a shinier shell these candies press out the same way then move to giant pans where they glaze and polish for several hours the now brightly colored candies with the sweet tart centers are called sprees

simple a pulley setup that you can set up for your kids I for this project you're just gonna need some simple carabiners you just happen to be those who say do not climb on it they don't have to be super strong but you need them to be at least these the metal type and you're also going to need some string some rope this is just some paracord I had now it doesn't use true pulley so it's in a true pulley system but it's the same basic concept with the carabiners that I showed you a second ago you can tie your rope to one end of your carabiner just one carabiner here you take it you take a second carabiner and you need something nice that supports real heavy this is an old sawhorse I had to put a couple nails in for one kit bearing a carabiner up let me put the Rope through it first put it up here put the other carabiner and what I have here is a nice heavy pink can give it a tug now this is this right here is a super simple setup because this way is 10 to 15 pounds you're going to be pulling roughly 10 to 15 pounds down to get it to lift it up let me show you another way to make it even easier for the kids taking care of being are off that's tied to the rope and you want to hang it up here now you have to they will say two carabiners hanging up there you take a third carabiner put it through the Rope get it down here to your paint pane [Music] it's a personal stake then you now give it a good tug and it's so much easier to lift up reason being it's because now that you have to support these supports are roughly each supporting half of the weight so now if this is ten roughly ten to fifteen pounds this would be roughly half the pull needed of that weight to get it up in the air now doing this you will create a lot more rope you have to pull but it doesn't really matter as long as your kids are having fun right they're gonna love to see how much weight they can put on there and lift up or you have fun playing with your kids now", "QZbmhvs2N20": "hi friends

"5dTpQy_PngY": "what's up guys it's your girl shae and i'm back with another video today we're going to be doing something a little bit different i'm going to be showing you how to make some edible nerd ropes i had so much fun making this video if you want more videos like this hit the subscribe button and comment down below for more all right let's get right into this video here's all the things that you're gonna need parchment paper two boxes of nerds a squeeze bottle one cup of gummy bears and one tablespoon of your tincture i did this off camera but you're going to want to put your parchment paper into accordion like shape so it looks something like this now pour your nerd ropes onto the parchment paper make sure you cover the bottom of them so that way the melted gummies will only stick to the nerds this is like my second time actually recording this video the first time i used foil which you'll see later on in the clip my first batch i had actually had a really hard time getting the gummies out of the foil it was impossible to get out i hated to throw them away so i just gave them to somebody see if what they can do with it next you're going to want to heat your gummies in the microwave for about 30 to 40 seconds pour your one tablespoon of tincture in and make sure you mix that bc real good so that way you can be leaning baby yes leaning and i mean leaning you can always substitute your tincture for a cbd oil as well it does work the same exact way i poured my gummy mixture into my squeeze bottle because i thought it would be a little bit easier since i have arthritis in my hands but it actually was way harder than i thought it would be um it was pretty hard especially since i'm really working with one hand but you guys shouldn't have any problem make sure you find a squeeze bottle that has a nozzle that's actually a little bit larger than mine because baby my mixture was super thick like me and didn't want to come out the bottle but try not to pour too much of the mixture you want to make sure you get you a little slim thick layer and cover the rest with your nerd ropes i'm going to let you guys watch the clip here as i struggle my ass off and it wasn't coming out for me very well but just cover as much as you can get as much mixture out as you can make sure your liquid is pretty much as warm as possible and you guys should be okay here is the aftermath after i left my nerds in the refrigerator for about two hours they did not stick at all on this parchment paper i'm so happy i did this video twice because when i tell you doing it with the foil was a no-go for me but i think i'm actually gonna try the foil one more time i wonder if i actually put some coconut oil or some type of oily substance so it won't stick but we will see if you guys want to see how to make a tincture or any other videos like this let me know they did come out pretty good and they're actually really really bomb so after the process of actually taking it out of the refrigerator you just want to shake the access nerds off and it should come out pretty fine i'm so happy i did this video for you guys if you like this video please give it a thumbs up as well as comment down below if you want to see more share this video with your friends your family your grandmama if she hurt and just make sure you put some cbd in that bz and here is the final look you guys oh and i actually made some little nerd bites too that you can see in the middle if you are some triple g's to the channel some of you may know i did have a half baked series going on and i think i'm gonna actually bring that back for a little while and show you guys a couple how to get that ass baked videos but until next time guys make sure you stay tuned then and never too", "1KW9G2kSkCQ": "Hi friends, today I will be talking about fungal infections. Fungal infections are also known by their symptoms of itching and redness. Nowadays the weather is hot and the rains have also begun. People usually suffer from fungal infections in this kind of weather which can occur anywhere from our head to toes. Today I will be speaking about fungal infections that happen on our body and also specifically about fungal infections in the groin area. The fungal infection that occurs on the body is known as Tinea Corporis And the fungal infection occurring in our groin area is called Tinea Cruris. How does fungus infect our body? We should know that fungus spreads through contact with each other. That is why this is usually transmitted between family members or school kids acquire it through contact with each other when they play, walk, hold hands etc with each other How can this infection be transmitted between family members? If even one person gets a fungal infection then their towel, comb, brush, pillows, bedsheets etc also carry fungal spores and can infect others if they use these items. Similarly, if you have dogs or cats in the house, then they are often prone to getting fungal infections in the monsoons. And if we come into contact with their infected skin, then we can also pick it up from them. Besides this, if you go to public swimming pools, then their mats towels etc which may have been used by a person suffering from fungal infections can transmit the infection to you also. Another place from where people often pick up fungal infections is the hairdresser or the beauty parlour. if their instruments have not been cleaned properly Or if their linen has not been cleaned properly then you can pick up fungal infections through these agents. What are the symptoms of fungal infections? The most common fungal infection that people suffer from is known as Tinea Versicolor In this condition, round, red dry patches develop on the skin especially on the back, chest, shoulders and neck and these patches also cause itchiness. These patches appear as light marks on people with dark skin whereas those who have fair skin exhibit darker patches. Another type of fungal infection that happens on our skin is called Ringworm. It is called so because it has a red, inflamed border enclosing a circular patch of normal looking skin. So this infection gives the appearance of \"Rings\" on the skin, hence it is called Ringworm. Ringworm either occurs in 2-3 isolated patches on the skin. Or these patches are found all over the body, which also causes a lot of itchiness. What do fungal infections in the groin area look like? Now I will talk about the fungal infection which occurs in the groin area. If men wear tight clothing and they also tend to sweat a lot in their groin area then they are prone to getting this fungal infection, especially in the monsoon season. The worst thing about this infection is that it itches a lot. Which topical creams can be used to treat fungal infections? Now I will speak about the treatment of fungal infections which occur in the groin and elsewhere in   the body. For treating these infections, topical creams are usually used. Such as Clotrimazole Cream, Miconazole Cream & Terbinafine Cream. You can apply these creams in the following way - After having a bath in the morning you should apply these creams properly on all the affected areas. There is no need to wash off the creams at night, but you should apply them once again before sleeping. These anti-fungal creams must be used twice a day for atleast 2 weeks. And if necessary, then they should be applied for 3-4 weeks. Usually when people notice an improvement in their condition after 5-6 days then they stop using the cream. And then the fungal infection returns as soon as the effect of the cream decreases after a few days. The fungal infection that happens in the groin area causes a lot of itching And to reduce this itching, you can mix a small amount of 1% Hydrocortisone cream in your anti-fungal cream this can help to reduce the itching quite a bit. But as soon as there is a decrease in itchiness you should immediately discontinue the use of Hydrocortisone cream. Because Hydrocortisone is a steroid and you should never use Steroids on your skin for extended periods. Steroids cause the skin to become thin whereby they can enter your blood stream. How to use Ketoconazole Lotion? In order to completely heal your fungal infection, besides applying creams you can also utilize 2% Ketoconazole lotion. The method of usage is as follows - First off have a thorough shower with clean water thereafter apply the 2% Ketoconazole lotion all over your body like soap. Leave it on for 5 minutes, and then wash it off with Lukewarm water. The advantage of this is that even if there are small fungal infections on the skin which you have missed or you have not seen then this lotion reaches those areas and helps to completely rid the skin of all fungal infections. 2% ketoconazole lotion should be used twice daily for atleast 2 weeks. Thereafter you should use this lotion TWICE a week for 2 WEEKS. And finally, you must use Ketoconazole lotion ONCE a week for 3 MONTHS. This will ensure that the fungal infection does not return and give you trouble. Besides this, those who are suffering from fungal infection in the groin area or who have repeated bouts of fungal infections on the body should thoroughly dust their entire body with 1% Clotrimazole Powder after having a bath. This prevents fungus from growing on the body. Use of Oral Medicines to treat Fungal Infections If after all this, you are still suffering from fungal infections. then you will have to take oral medicines to combat it. For this you must visit your doctor and get a prescription from them and then follow the prescribed course of medicines. Oral medicines include Griseofulvin, Terbinafine, or Fluconazole tablets. These tablets must be eaten for atleast 4-6 weeks. The exact dosage, as well as duration of medication will be told to you by your doctor. What to do in case of repeated fungal infections? Friends, if you suffer from repeated bouts of fungal or bacterial infections then you must go to the hospital and have a thorough check up done. There are many illnesses which severely weaken the body's natural immunity. For example Diabetes and AIDS Besides this, people who have taken long courses of anti-biotics also have weakened immune systems Similarly, those who have undergone kidney, liver, heart transplants etc are given immunosuppressant drugs, which weaken their body's capacity to fight illnesses. Such people are very prone to fungal and bacterial infections. If you are suffering in this way then please go to the hospital and have a thorough check-up done.

Thank you!", "luXEJcIAZpE": "hello and welcome to lofty pursuits in public displays the confection in Tallahassee Florida I'm Greg and I'm here to celebrate our hundredth video with a tour of the shop and some special hundred emoji candy so I've already added the flavour to the pot as I pour it and what's the flavor you ask while I'm doing two different flavors with two different candies for this assortment there'll be a brown wrapped candy which will be coffee flavored but it won't be a standard coffee it'll be a Kona coffee a Hawaiian coffee that Kahlua is based off it's delicious and the second one is gonna be amaretto because I like amaretto on my coffee and we're gonna do this with a hundred emoji logo and until I made this video I didn't know there were two versions of this emoji one is used by Apple and one is used by Android of course and the best part about this we're gonna give the candy away free with an order and we'll give more information about that later in the video these videos were actually created for two reasons I guess three the first one was to preserve some history in a public forum another one was to get people off the interstate were right next to i-10 and Tallahassee Florida and ten thousand cars a day drive by and I was a little offended none of them were coming into my shop so I thought I would tell people I was here I figured they'd want to come if they knew about me so I ended up putting up these videos and inviting people in and you know what you guys have come and I want to thank you so much mention in the comments if you've come by the shop in person I'm always interested in how many of these people who visit still watch my videos and number three of course was I wanted more people to experience the candy that I make I'm very proud of it you know so for the last 99 videos I made videos about history about candy making and I made sure that candy was the star not me this video is gonna be a little different because I realized a lot of you don't know the history of lofty pursuits this seemed to be the time to share it lofty pursuit started as a outgrowth of another business I had originally called gravity specific I started it with Jonathan Lyons that later became a firm called infinite illusions and we manufactured juggling equipment and shipped it worldwide I branched into yo-yos and eventually we need storefront and the storefront opened in 1993 on September 17th Here I am juggling in front of that storefront and we sold stunt kites and things like that we moved five times in the history of the business picking up something every time we expanded into toys with one move and board games with another and we eventually expanded into a scream and we expanded into candy making and lastly two and a half years ago we expanded into serving brunch seven days a week over the last 33 years one thing has become clear nothing stays the same your customers change every four or five years and I'm convinced if you don't change with them you get left behind so I keep on changing and I keep on figuring out new creative ways to do things and that's what lofty pursuits is about a reporter once called lofty pursuits a performance art project that happens to turn a profit that reporter might even be right I mean I don't have employee the month photos I paint portraits of my employees instead and the things that decorate the shop aren't like a Cracker Barrel where I'm always afraid of going into one and finding a photo of my grandparents on the wall everything is something special something that interacted with me or the store of the business from paintings I did four of the Creature from the Black Lagoon because it was filmed 20 minutes from here and I at one point ran the soda fountain out overlooking the springs where it was filled to things like the musical instruments which I painted that our marching band uses to circus memorabilia gifts I've been given things that I just find interesting and things that make me laugh and all of this with the candy and everything else on a background of a soda fountain where we use glass serving dishes and we have a menu with 52 sundaes because there are 52 Sundays in the year how many Sundays do you want me to have and the food that you may know from the videos is wrapped by our toy store the toy store we started with back in 1993 it's still here and it's bigger than it ever was we're known for a board game collection on our general toys that I try to pick out to make people smile once again and find things they can't find elsewhere people ask me what we sell here at lofty pursuits and I try to sell happiness that's my answer if I can put a smile on somebody's face it makes me happy and it makes what I do worthwhile and that brings me back to the YouTube channel and the YouTube channel now allows me to make people happy it seems around the world I can't tell you how much joy that brings and that's why I made a hundred videos and you guys keep getting the candy that I can ship because I haven't figured out how to easily ship ice cream I seem to be making you happy and it makes me happy and you know too many people don't worry about enough happiness in their life and I have a lot and you know that's good well back to the candy and the candy you can probably tell because I used yellow when I stirred in the food coloring is not going to be the coffee this is gonna be the amaretto and we're going to pull this on the hook for a couple of minutes and I'm pulling it here because I left the candy unfortunately cool on LY evenly and I need to fix my problem I'm gonna put it on my candy pulling machine and if there are hot spots when the Machine goes it'll tear where this candy is hotter than others bits and of course what I'm doing here is I'm folding in air bubbles and each of those air bubbles make the candy reflect light and that makes this candy white this is gonna be the white part of the candy now for certain candies it's either too hot or too heavy for me to pull unlock and I use this machine to help me but those few poles on the hook really made a difference to make this machine happy with the candy staying on it if you've seen a bunch of our videos this music is probably familiar to you this band is called bounce house and it used to be the house band of lofty pursuits years ago they split up and went their separate ways but we still love their music and I thought I'd bring it back for this video being that it's the hundredth video at all to make the hundred design we're gonna start by making one of the zeros and we're gonna do that by wrapping some white candy that we've cooled a little bit more than the rest with some red candy if you'd like to try some of our candy for yourself go to www.hawaii.edu and you place an order worth ten dollars or more we'll toss in a free sample bag of this candy which is of course a blend of the sama red oh you're seeing us mix and the coffee flavor I told you about and keep in mind we're only going to have this candy for a week or two but this video will be up four years so before you try the coupon code look at the date we posted this video and see if you think it's up and working now that we've built the two zeros it's time to build the one the one was tricky because I'm trying to hold a sharp corner and I don't want it to round out and I want the flat side to be round I accomplished this doing a lot of temperature control of course for colder candy stays straighter but if I don't do it right it won't pull evenly in the next step now we end up putting a spacer on the one and all that's left are the stripes that go under the one [Music] and now that the design is done it's time to wrap it in the white-hot sugar [Music] and lastly the outer wrap of yellow I [Music] placed the hot sugar on our batch roller this cool little machine from about 1910 and it keeps the candy spinning to keep the design from distorting and I'm gonna size it down from about a 7 inch diameter log of candy down to about a half inch rod of candy at this point the way the candy behaves is really cool it's a non-newtonian fluid you may have heard of it like it behaves like a thick version of that I can pull it out slowly and if the Hays almost like a liquid but if I hit it hard with the back of the scissors it shatters at a clean wide [Music] [Music] all that's left for me to do is to cut it into individual pieces on our little candy anvil and we have thousands of pieces of candy to send to you we're gonna blend this with the coffee flavor make an assortment make little bags and we'll include if you use our coupon code 100 just the numbers thank you for watching this video and all the others we really appreciate it we're lofty pursuits were located in Tallahassee Florida if you want to buy our candies for yourself go to WWE net and for the next week or two remember coupon code 100 and if you're over in Tallahassee we're right off i-10 on Thomasville Road in Tallahassee maybe four or five minutes away please come and visit we'd love to see you we open at 7 a.m. and we close at 10 p.m. we serve brunch in the morning and ice cream in the evening and it's a cool place with toys and stuff but I've already shown you that thank you for watching and subscribe to us here click that little alerts button and you know follow us on

First bite is all yours :) Thanks for watching!! <33 See ya next time!", "vux8ud6CzJE": "what's going on everybody it's brain with your code you find jewelry your personal jeweler and today I'm shipping pretty much every rope chain size that I have up to the six millimeter so I said let's make a video I get questions all the time especially we're talking about like that two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half millimeters and I got them all so I just wanted to show you guys talk about the Rope change rope chains have been my most popular chain way out in front than any other change so I know you guys want to see these type of videos with that being said let's get started here's all the shipments today and if you noticed these aren't the Jacuzzi boxes I have run out of boxes these are the original boxes actually were approaching two years on YouTube so these are the original boxes I uses now the delay is because I didn't know Chinese New Year's was a whole month and I ordered them before so they just started making them so I ran out there's a little laughs there unfortunately so have to ship out the old boxes you guys are in a treat though I want to showcase these chains because why we have a solid 18 karat gold Franco diamond cuff Franco chain now this baby is rare is a special order but you just won't see a chain like this very often rose gold is not very common 18 karat gold the United States is not very common as well so this thing is kind of like a mythical creature and I put it next to the 5 millimeter diamond cuff Franco and there you go just this is solid 14 karat gold but these franco's are so nice so I'm gonna put together the rope chains that we need for this video and let's get this thing started alright so here's all the sizes or these sides we're gonna go over today starting from left to right we have the one and a half the two the two and a half three three and a half four five and then the bigger six right here now I kind of space these out because if you're in looking for kind of a simple starter chain you're gonna start looking from the one and a half maybe to about the three millimeter now people ask me all the time should I go with the two and a half or should I upgrade to the three and I realize I don't have the two I'll put a picture on the screen of a 2.9 side-by-side with the 3 this is actually the threes actually gauged a 3.2 millimeter the thing with the rope chains and this is unique to these rope chains is they're gauged before the diamond cutting process so they'll take a true 4 millimeter like this one I mean this one and then they'll put the diamond cuts or apply the diamond cuts and it's shaved some gold off the side so you end up maybe a 3.7 it varies and so that's a story with the diamond cut rope chain so you got to look at I would just screenshot this picture right here so you can do side by sides but every width you go I always recommend going up 1/2 millimeter because it looks different on camera than in person but these ones more simple and then as you get up to like the 4 5 & 6 you could definitely tell the difference between the 5 millimeter and let's say the 3 millimeter here there's a big difference so I always recommend go up a little bit if you have to say for a while it's definitely worth doing so I'm gonna put these on so we could see these chains around a neck so starting off with the 2 chain rope link we have the 1 and 1/2 20 inch and the 2 millimeter 22 inch this does not look bad at all it's something simple for a starter with me right now when I buy this as my two chain setup no but when I started out I definitely would consider it it definitely looks nice now I'm two chaining the two and a half millimeter at a 22 inch and the 3 millimeter at a 24 inch I'm breaking these up in to so you guys can get a better idea if you're debating between a 2 millimeter and a two and a half millimeter I would say save up the money and go with the two and a half millimeters start short like a 20 or 22 that way you can add longer and wider later that is the number one tip when styling your chains is start if you got a little budget start shorter and that way you can stack it and go down the neck so to chain two and a half three millimeter right there 22 and 24 now we're getting serious I have a three millimeter 22 inch three-and-a-half millimeter 24 inch and the 4 millimeter 26 inch and this is what I mean by starting I mean a 3 millimeter is good for a nice sized budget if you're just starting now you have a nice budget go with the 3 mm leader maybe a little shorter like a 20 22 this is a 22 inch 22 inch by the way is my everyday length sighs I love 22 inches for some reason it just it's it's well it's not too much I don't like when it hangs out for an everyday chain now if I'm going out just like on a Saturday night then I lengthen it but every day I keep it casual so here we go we have the proper spacing the 4 millimeter three and a half and then the 3 millimeter 22 24 and 26 last but certainly not least is the 5 millimeter the 24 and then the 6 millimeter 26 inch and I really feel if you're in the ballpark for a thick rope that stands out it's still classified as an everyday chain in my book the 6 millimeter is kind of borderline but honestly I love the 6 millimeter as a solitary chain and a rope chain 6 millimeter is the best and the 26 inch length is the best as well but here you go this is to training some nice size chains right here I really think if you're kind of standing out want to hit a home run not a grand slam the grand slam would be like the 7 millimeters and up but a home run a modest home run then you have to really look in the 5 and 6 million 5 is versatile can you put a nice pendant on it 6 millimeter is just a very stand out is chain all right here's one last look at all the sizes I really enjoyed the rope chains I know why people buy them so much because they are great chain the weight on them is good the price on them is good as well so just keep on looking you have to see kind of what realm you're in if you're gonna if you're in the 2 millimeter range or if you're looking more of a 4 millimeter range and narrow it down from there as far as what length you want and I'm always available to you guys email me or DME all my information will be below or on the screen reach out to me if you need sizing help lengths help if you want to chains param up with different chains I love that that's why I got into this is for the love of that and I'm always down to talk some change with people so feel free to reach out to me if you ever need advice because I wear them well don't I so that's it for today's video and we will see you on our next jewelry video", "9MrVvLgMXbQ": "harpoon gun this is the most insane below dart gun i've ever seen the world's most powerful laser that's okay we should turn it off before it burns a hole through the garage door i'm losing my mind everything that you see in this merch shop is for sale right now everything has to go all this stuff is going to be for sale at ten percent off even these things we got these per se we got these for sale we got these for you we got these for sale we got this shirt our squishy toys are even on sale check these out the collectible lunch boxes we also got the frisbees that work really well everything that you see in this video is for sale but only for the next 48 hours it's gonna end on august 29th so check out the link in the description and go go go in today's vlog we're doing the 100 layers challenge we're gonna start with a hundred layers of golden duct tape right here we're gonna see if we can break through this we got a bunch of crazy weapons today even the world's most powerful laser i'm excited this is gonna be fun next up we got a hundred layers of shirts unspeakable shirts to be exact and then for the final hundred layers we got 100 layers of steel right here i really do not think we're gonna break through this guys look how thick this is 100 layers what power of power oh it's falling it's falling it's really heavy all right let's begin we're going to start off with 100 layers of duct tape i honestly think it would be pretty easy to break it through this especially if we have something sharp and we have a lot of sharp things pick it up ready you think you're tough duct tape you're not tough we made you you're not tough we're gonna break you super easy all right let's get serious let's destroy this thing all right so throwing it on the destruction table i feel like we should do light weapons first yeah just because work our way up yeah let's let's work our way up the line um soccer ball all right first uh first objective damage [Music] the police could not beat it zero damage yeah your chocolate didn't do anything i'm sorry yo try to jump off the top and onto it yeah i'm good okay yo it's actually kind of tough yeah i think we broke uh one it looks like we broke ah it's probably like four or five maybe all right i have the weapon that's going to go through all the layers you ready do it with it is that a helmet it's a unicorn helmet with a horn oh the horn that's magical i see all right watch out guys okay hard swing i'm trying to hit right there oh okay we're getting some layers that's actually a lot of layers that's probably like a good way to say 10 maybe maybe 12 15. i give it a good okay 16 and three four step it up we're stepping it up a notch we're on the second story of the lego house and now we got some sharp objects here we go with a ninja star yo please do not miss right now yes oh that actually went kind of deep nice hit how many you got i got two more you guys want to try careful it's very very strong i've never thrown one of these oh you can go for it hope you want to watch how you do it i mean this is how nathan through nice i'm gonna throw mine it's definitely sticking pretty deep but not making it through the hundred layers so for our next weapon we're gonna step it up you guys remember the indestructible cube the 45-pound one here it goes yo why didn't you go through it huh was that the wrong key it felt a little lighter oh wait here it is i found it right here i just picked up the wrong one that one was wood this one is tungsten ready boys this is damaged three two one [Music] yo it didn't make it through it bounced it was like a trampoline yo i told you you can survive jump that cube is 45 pounds i am 160. i will probably go through it should we go check the damage let's go check the damage how many layers it went through all right let's take off the cube here oh okay we got a pretty deep cut right here oh my gosh yo that had to go through did that go through it went about halfway through i want to say look at that stick your finger in there it's pretty deep wow so probably about halfway through with the cube all right well the cube didn't make it through so um step it up huh we need something bigger i think i have something up my sleeve i can't find it guys i thought it was up here i thought you put it up your sleeve bro i thought it was up there no it's not in there no it might be in the other one no i'll just use it up my sleeve all right we'll just use this right okay why not yeah go for it drop the chair oh oh there goes the camera at least it fell slowly it didn't do anything i don't think it did anything nothing at all i mean the legs broke leg on the chair oh yeah good job i tried oh get it get it pick it up all right full speed just doing a burnout yeah do a burnout burn through it all right we're going 18 miles per hour right now only 18. yo spin it around oh yeah oh yeah yeah we're getting some damage yeah [Applause] electric scooter power it's struggling what is it even doing to the duct tape i don't know it's like come on come on dude it's not doing anything it's just taking off the top layer of gold all right all right yeah okay oh is it warm hot damage report oh yeah uh it actually melted the duct tape a little bit because it got so hot but you know what melts duct tape lasers go get your laser gauge you see this you know what this is it's a laser it's actually a lightsaber it's like the world's most powerful laser it is ridiculous it will blind you instantly if you do not wear protective goggles everyone here has protective gun it's actually so powerful that if we shined it near the camera it would actually crack the sensor and just destroy it it's going to burn a hole through this yeah so we're hoping the camera doesn't get destroyed as well everyone got glasses on battery in battery in two giant batteries all right laser is live ready to turn on all right hit the lights james all right here we go what's going on and there it is already burning the duct tape crazy it's literally going straight through the duct tape i don't know how many layers it's burned i think it's ready i think it's already going i didn't even focus the laser it's just doing its own thing has it burned a clean hole yet oh wait it's through no way it's on the garage door it's already through all the lanes it's through it went through yeah you can see it oh my gosh okay we should turn it off before it burns a hole through the garage door dude it burnt just to show you it literally only took like 20 seconds let's go look at the other side oh the garage i don't think it did it did oh yeah yeah i see it it's a tiny little hole it's still working on it right there it's a it looks like a little thumbtack oh it's really warm crazy 100 layers of duct tape just like that we have succeeded to go through 100 layers of duct tape yeah we have with a laser but since we have succeeded going through 100 layers of duct tape should we draw a happy face oh yeah i like that all right put the goggles on we're going live all right let's attempt to draw a happy face should i use the previous hole as one eye no make like a big circular eye okay got it oh my gosh you can see it burning the smoke oh my gosh what all right there's one eye let me head the little middle down boom let me make a little another eye oh my yo that is insane with a laser right now how crazy is that i wonder if this laser will go through the metal you know if it will just reflect and then hit us and burn us you know normal people you know they carve their names into trees no we we carve smiley faces into duct tape with lasers oh it smells awful yeah burnt duct tape does not smell very good no it does not smell like a good barbecue that smiley face is so good all right all right i got a smiley face let's draw better with a laser than i can draw with anything it looks so good i'm impressed oh it smells disgusting yeah the eyes are a little lopsided but hey so it's a goofy smiley face [Music] all right so next we're doing 100 layers of unspeakable merch this feels so bad to do this i'm so sorry guys there's going to be many more 100 layer challenges in the future so what i need you guys to do is click that red subscribe button so you won't miss out on any future hundred layer challenges and also let me know in the comment section below what we should do a hundred layers of next all right i got this big old crowbar this is the biggest crowbar i've ever seen in my life and we're going to see if we can do some damage give it a good old whack harder that merch is indestructible literally hasn't made it through this is how strong merch is it didn't even go through one shirt it's literally just a trampoline it's not doing anything i don't think that's how you mine in minecraft bro that's not how you mine in minecraft you're right you guys got something sharp up there we got something sharp i got my shoes all right i'm coming up in order to make it through the fabric we're gonna need something sharp like these are you gonna throw it or drop it i think i should throw it let's see how it goes throw it all right you missed look i got three of them for a reason okay hey that's pretty i made it in the woods there's some damage yo i'm scared now to be fair it hit the shirt it just bounced off you hit it with the handle though all right let's see what you got three times okay i got my oh my good old handy dandy blow dart gun this thing does not mess around no this is the most insane blow dart gun i've ever seen let me look look at that that's the dart that's big for it that's like yeah that's ridiculous all right you all ready what are you shooting what are you doing well i don't want the dart to fall so i gotta bring it down all right ready yeah go for it go for it [Applause] oh we'll have to go check that in a second all right james what you got i got a spear gun a spear a spear gun a spear just a spirit all right we got a spear here don't miss it went through the box it bounced off the shirts it ricocheted off the shirts did it move and went through the minecraft block i'm glad that's actual wood over there because like it would have went through them all right let's check the damage if it didn't make much damage we might have to get something hot uh let's look at the throwing axe damage first there's no throwing ax damage because i missed i mean there's something in that wood right there okay so this is your spear right here it looks like the spear went through i would probably say 10 layers okay so it's it's to the purple how many layers does that look like sometimes i'm still going i'm still going up my gosh what if it went all the way through here so we got one nine ten so 20 layers not bad the front all right let's see the dark i'm gonna pull it out i'm going to put my fingers right where it is on the shirt and then i'm pulling it out get stuck oh wait you're there you're there that's really short all right so that's where it was in the shirt so that's about how deep it went a little over an inch not bad that's probably like 50 layers or something okay so those are the sharpest weapons we have i think this needs heat because it's like like for like hot coals hot rocks all right so the laser versus 100 layer of shirts we got a fire extinguisher on standby because it is cloth and it may catch on fire we'll see blow up all right we're on live everyone's glasses are on we're good to go here we go i'm kind of nervous but i am also very confident that the laser will make it through what's your what's your prediction i think it's going to go up in flames yeah yeah i think it's just going to come bust all right ready all right go for it going hot oh my god it's sorry and this time already it's on fire there is a flame draw face oh my gosh let me draw a face real quick before it goes out of hand hey now you can say this is the hottest merch in the game yeah the hottest march in the game is literally on fire yo it's actually there i know it's fine it's actually there's like a big flame it smells like marshmallows yo do we have sprinklers in here no okay all right good gonna say we're all gonna get like soaked all right i made a little smiley face it's on fire oh it's catching fire um but we all know how this is gonna end should we cut it out before it um there's there's a fire oh yeah it's it's fire huh what do i do i don't know did we just like watch it wow look unspeakable merch ladies and gentlemen get your merchandise no that looks like a whole marshmallow it smells like marshmallows yeah yo can you eat the merch no you can't you can't don't do that oh that's a cool flame you ready for it to go bye-bye say bye bye fire fire merch fire in the hole are you supposed to shake these before you go pull pin hold up right stand back 10 feet no it's on fire you got to read the instructions man we're still on fire a little bit there in the top right one more time for safety just yeah yeah that's cool why does it make that noise i don't know it's kind of fun all right let's burn a hole through it this time boys all the way through all the way through oh my gosh wow that's bright yeah it is even with the glasses yeah like everything's purple right now i could see it oh it is definitely catching on fire i think it's through like probably half already honestly let me go let me go on the other side let me check yeah oh we have a flame don't look at the laser okay it has not made it through yet it's going come on a hundred layers of shirts laser right now you can do it i believe burn quicker oh my gosh dude come on it smells great it has not made it through yet what do you think it's probably like halfway maybe uh it has to be dude yeah the fact of this laser can make it through a hundred layers of clothing and duct tape it's only been like 30 seconds it's gonna make it through i know it will that just shows you how strong this thing is yeah this is insane you know that's so crazy just seeing it on camera because you can't see it in person put these glasses on because it protects you yeah like i literally i cannot see the laser right now at all i don't even see the light like if you ask me if it was on i couldn't tell you until you see a burn coming off on the shirt i see it smoking come on make it through i know we can do it because i know this laser is not going to make it through the steel there's no way what if the laser doesn't go through the shirts yes it's like nicer now it's on full power every time you saw it was on half power it should go with this right now it might take a second because it is a hundred layers of clothing listen if it could have went through 100 layers of duct tape in the matter of like 15 seconds in half power it could definitely go through the shirts it has to it's just gonna take a minute or two i'm seeing a lot of smoke coming from the top of that shirt maybe there's like a shirt on fire inside i don't think it's actually gonna make it through the shirts the laser is overheating so let's see how far it did make it it made it really far i think i made it really far let's see how many layers it made it through thick zip ties tastes like barbecue chicken the heist okay so let's see how many layers i went through did it go through that back layer what the flippy oh wait look it stops right here that's the laser look see it how many did it actually go wait there's the laser right there okay so oh wait it's still there ooh this shirt is really warm there it is that's the laser so it looks like it made it through about half the shirts so 50 layers that right there is the other half and it was sitting on there for about what two minutes maybe three minutes of just straight lasers not bad i will have to say we did not defeat the shirts but um we're gonna step it up to the 100 layers of steel but we have even bigger weapons for that so i'm feeling confident so what can you say about our merch though the strongest and the hottest merch in the game [Music] 100 layers of steel this thing is extremely heavy oh you got it the edges are sharp yeah you go on that side there we go all right all right so since this is the most difficult thing to get through we are stepping it up with our most powerful weapon no that is not our most powerful one actually is it might be we got bigger things we need different types of power our first weapon for the 100 layers of steel is a harpoon gun these are made to shoot underwater and they also told us to never shoot it out of water and here we are and here we are so james uh you're probably the strongest out of all of us so try to load this thing okay before we start rolling i tried to do both at the same time and i could only get halfway down we're only probably going to have to load one at a time do you need help i don't really know how to help you oh my gosh i don't really know how to help you it's clicked in it's clicked in oh that's oh oh that's okay should we only do one no do the second one we're gonna do it might as well do [Music] oh my gosh okay just leave it pointed just don't up please in okay all right uh let's go upstairs oh we probably should have loaded it upstairs just in case it goes off in the lego it goes straight to the roof all right so here goes nothing are you ready ready as i'll ever be i guess let's put the string on that side where do i even hold it harpoon gun's made for you like little sharks with them don't you fish i'm so scared i don't even want to look so scared all right i'm ready i'm ready i'm backing up safety off all right three run two one roll the kick back oh snap did you have it up against your shoulder no i had it like this yeah it was it kicked back a little bit all right let's see how far it made through okay so uh i mean it definitely didn't make it all the way through but let me see if i can get it out oh okay i mean definitely a deep hole guys look at this how far that's the name oh probably about an inch i would say that's quite a bit to go an inch of steel right through that's a hole i didn't have it like pressed up against my shoulder like how you're supposed to so like when it shoots it doesn't kick back and lose a lot of power so like if it was pressed up against something it would have went deeper i mean that's that's a good sized hole right there all right it's time to beat this boy up you mean it's time to beat this boy up is this still trying no oh not anymore yeah not anymore no oh oh oh that's glass all right here we go hold on hold on hold on hold on what hold on hold on hold on safety first i have some safety goggles yep i'm looking for him working on light hit medium hit full power i think i made it even through one i think you're putting dents in it but that's about it oh no you went through eight layer maybe maybe three you know boy i'm sorry you didn't even go through the first one did you did you not what about my wife all right yes ether you're using the wrong end bro it's so loud uh anyone want to give it a swing i don't think it's going to really do anything there you go all right not gonna lie guys i'm literally haven't made it through the first leg nice keep it going yeah give it a swing smells like pop tarts a layer maybe maybe two we're gonna need some some better equipment here yo go get that bulldozer i'm gonna get an anvil keep hitting it yes sir full power baby i went through the first two layers come on boys brute strength yeah you got it all right now move out of the way hurry move out of the way andrew coming in hot wow it literally did nothing i think it broke the hole in the floor now it's a good sized core hole in the floor now the envelope is so good uh give me the tungsten cube i have more faith in it [Music] you can see an outline of the uh the base of the handle a little bit but it didn't even go through there tungsten cube here we go oh did it even do anything okay let's let's inspect the damage here um that's the damage you can even see it it probably went through like a layer yeah it went through like a layer and a half maybe we should have rethought the 100 layers of metal yeah yeah it's pretty strong um can we get a tank yeah that would be great let's get a tank it didn't even do anything why didn't it explode yeah i thought it was supposed to like shoot a missile i thought it was going to no shoot a missile all right fire yeah i don't think metal catches on fire does it it melts at a very very very high temperature yeah guys i don't think we can make it through the hundred layers of metal or steel it's just not gonna happen this is about the farthest we made it right here it looks like we made it through two oh no three layers three out of a

Want to win the prize? Knowing a little math is the key to winning\nthis popular contest. You will need A jar filled with spherical\nor oblate spheroid candies Calculator Tape measure Vernier calipers (optional) and computer\nwith internet access (optional). Step 1. Ask for or estimate the total volume of the\njar as best you can. Convert the volume to milliliters. Convert to liters quickly by typing \"convert\n(your original units) into liters\" into a search engine. Step 2. Determine whether the candies are spheres. If they are balls, like gumballs or jawbreakers,\nthey're spheres. If the candies are round, but longer than\nthey are wide, they are \"oblate spheroids.\" Step 3. Find the volume of one candy, also in milliliters. First, find the radius of one candy, either\nmy estimating, using a tape measure, or by using vernier calipers, which will provide\nthe most precise measurement. If your candy is spherical, use the formula\nV = 4/3\u03c0r3, where r is the radius of one candy, in centimeters. Round pi to 3.142 if you don't have a scientific\ncalculator. If the candies are oblate spheroids, use the\nformula V = 4/3\u03c0a2b, where a is the longer radius, and b is the shorter radius. Step 4. Calculate the percentage of the total volume\nthe candies take up in the jar. Calculate 64 percent of the jar's total volume\nif the candies are spheres, and calculate 66.5 percent of its volume if they are oblate\nspheroids. Step 5. For spherical candies, divide your estimate\nfor the size of one candy into 64 percent of the volume of the jar. For oblate spheroid candies, divide the average\nsize of one candy into 66.5 percent of the volume. You've got the answer; now amaze your friends\nwith your guess! Did you know Did you know?

just click the link below", "kUrtIu9DYME": "hey everyone this is Alex or Polly momochi and today I have a video is showing you to make these cute little candies and I made three different kind a lollipop and a wrapper some rock candy and a lifesaver and a wrapper as well so I hope you guys enjoy so first we're gonna start out with the lifesaver which is probably the easiest one so we're taking a ball of translucent clay and we're gonna flatten it out into an oval and we're gonna poke a hole in it with a dotting tool so it looks like a nose shape and then here I'm putting on some letters that spelled lifesavers but you have to make sure it's big enough because I barely have room so once baked that light painters this beautiful translucent red and really looks like candy so next we're gonna make the wrapper so I'm taking some UV soft resin and I'm flattening out and curing it but before I cure it I'm gonna add a little face because I decided to add a face to the wrapper instead of the candy itself so I gave it some dot eyes on the line smile and once cured we're gonna take off our little UV soft resin off with the face on it and it cured beautifully just like so and we're gonna cut it into a rectangle shape so next we're gonna place our lifesaver face down with the letters facing the face and we're gonna fold the bottom half of the wrapper add some UV resin to that bottom half and we're gonna pull the top half on top of that and let that cure then for the size we're going to take some UV resin and I put it on my blending tool and we're gonna rub it on the sides and I'm gonna pinch it with some pin sets and cure that as is and we're gonna do the same thing for the other side then I'm taking some crazy scissors and I'm cutting the edges off so then we have our little lifesavers candy like so and the real key hint about this one is that you want to have the right amount of translucent clay with red next we're gonna go on to the most fun one some rock candy so I'm flattening out some tan beige clay and I'm cutting off one end and placing a little wire and this is just a base of an eyepin and next I'm rolling the clay over the eye pin making sure it's fully covered cutting off the excess and rolling it all again then once it's fully covered I'm just gonna place a little ball of beige clay at the end so it looks like the little handle next they took some translucent blue clay and I just chopped it off and this is unbaked and here is my stick that is fully baked along with my chopped blue and purple clay that was translucent I chopped up into little pieces so the way I attached the little clay shards onto my stick is I placed some hard UV resin onto the stick and I placed it into the shards letting the resin I stick onto it and I cured it and I place some more UV resin on top and I let it cure in layers so with each layer of UV resin had some more shards of clay on it and I cured and I just continue with that method until the handle was pretty much disappeared like you couldn't see it anymore and after that I gave a nice layer of UV resin to glaze the little translucent clay just to make it more shiny and of course I was kind of iffy about it but I decided to give it some dot eyes and a line smile because why not and I let that cure under the UV lamp and here's the finished product now we're gonna make a similar handle for the lollipop using white clay and the wire again [Music] and I cut part of the clay on one side so the wire is exposed now for the lollipop I had a fat white cylinder and I wrapped it around with some color so I alternated so is a color to white cylinders color to white cylinders and once it was fully filled I rolled it out so it's super thin and made the colors blend together very nicely and once the clay was thin enough I gave it a nice twist so it looked like a swirl then to actually make the lollipop I cut one end and I rolled it into a little spiral and cut off the other end and I really like the colors on this one and we're gonna add the little wire stick into the lollipop and of course what's a little candy without some dot eyes and a line smile [Music] and here is a lollipop fully baked I'm sorry for being super overly exposed on the camera next we're gonna make the wrapper so I'm taking some soft UV resin and I'm making two sheets out of the soft UV resin for the wrapper at this time and I'm cutting one end of each sheet with the zig zag scissors and that's gonna be placed face down so I'm placing the lollipop on and I'm adding some UV resin to where the handle is and this is on the zigzag side and we're gonna place the second sheet of soft UV resin on top and then using my polymer clay blade I'm using the dull end I'm using that to hold the kind of wrapper in place and I'm using my UV light to cure and I didn't show at the bottom part but I'll show you with the sides and top I'm just placing my little UV lamp and I'm curing it on both sides of the blade and it cures the resin in place so it has a nice box shape that I want [Music] and this is the rapper fully chirp and finally we're going to take our crazy scissors and we're gonna cut off the rapper so it has its exact pattern all around the one thing about those exact scissors is that if they're not very good they don't cut very easily with two sheets of soft UV resin one thin layer is really like easily cut but two it's kind of a struggle but this is how it looks like and so here are my three candies I have my rock candy my lifesavers and my lollipop so I hope you guys enjoyed this video I know I've been making a lot of candy themed kind of videos lately and it's not even Halloween so it's just kind of like why are you making so much candy I I don't know it's just on I'm

to do a little experiment with gummy worms and tincture so i just bought some like these are from walmart just walmart brand gummy bears or gummy worms this should work the same for gummy worms gummy bears um anything with this type of gummy texture um so we're gonna do an experiment and we're gonna soak them in tincture i don't know how long it's gonna take i don't know if it's gonna be like a few hours that we're gonna need in there or 24 hours but we're going to see how that's going to turn out all you're going to need is some gummy bears or gummy worms and some alcohol-based tincture [Music] so here i just have some gummy worms like i said they're just the walmart brand i have my tincture and then a little container that we're going to put our gummy worms into now i'll just line up the gummies trying not to overlap them too much and then i'm going to pour my tincture over them just enough tincture to cover them all or at least the most of them and then whatever tincture isn't absorbed you can just pour back into a jar and use it as you would have previously so as you guys just saw i pretty much just pour tincture over these gummy worms i did add one or two more because i was taking a thumbnail for it but that's how they look we're going to leave them uncovered and we're not going to put them in the fridge we're just going to leave them open on the counter and then i am going to check back in when i feel like these are ready so we'll see how long that's going to take and we'll see if they work out hi guys so it's been about 24 hours a little bit under and here is what the gummies look like so they don't look that much different so far but it's kind of hard to tell they might be swollen a little bit um but yeah so i'm just taking these out and i'm gonna set them out to dry and then once they're mostly dry but not completely dry we're going to cover them with some sugar of course that's optional it just because extra sugar is nice and then plus the sugar on the outside will help with that tincture flavor like as soon as your tongue touches the gummy now that they've dried so they're pretty much completely dry except for a little bit of stickiness i'm gonna cover them in sugar so i just have a little container with just plain sugar you can add citric acid if you want but if you use citric acid just please use a small small amount like one quarter teaspoon for like one cup of sugar type of thing because too much citric acid will draw out the moisture and then they'll get wet and they'll never dry so yeah so i'm just shaking those and it's kind of weird how um they're coming out not completely coated in sugar or at least that um orange one did but then this one here is only like parts of it picked up on the sugar so i'm not sure what's going on there um but here is how you want them to be sticky wise so if you put your finger on it it like kind of sticks but you can pull it off pretty easily still and that's a good consistency for it to be when you're adding sugar to it um but yeah so some of these the sugar attached properly and then some of them they didn't and i'll show you guys how we can fix that though it's not exactly the most efficient way but i mean you got to do what you got to do when you're playing around with these things i'm thinking for those spots that aren't filled with sugar i'm just going to use like a regular paintbrush i think this is just from the dollar store whatever it doesn't matter um and then i'm going to dip it into the tincture which i should have got a separate container for my tincture so the sugar wasn't going back and forth but um and then i'm just going to lightly wipe it on the areas of the gummy that didn't get any sugar attached to it and not too much you just want like a light light coat and then i just put it back into the container of sugar and shake it up and then take it out and leave it to dry and it came out very well it was all covered it just would be time consuming to have to do this for each gummy [Music] and i'm going to try one of the gummies that we're soaking so far they don't look like they've soaked up that much like they don't look much bigger than how they looked before so just doing a comparison here the ones on the parchment paper are the ones that were soaking and then this one my hand was not soaking so for size difference it looks like the soaked one may be like a millimeter bigger but i don't i don't know it doesn't really seem like it um and then with this one over here um which one is bigger the soaked one definitely looks bigger for sure but also looks skinnier and the other one looks wider so it's hard to tell i'm not sure if the gummy bears maybe just aren't all consistent or sorry the worms okay and then for this one the one on the bottom there is the not soaked one and it's significantly bigger than the soaked one so that leads me to think that the gummy worms are just kind of have some variance in size and that they didn't look like they've gotten bigger and expanded or absorbed anything so let's let's try and see how it tastes and see if we can taste the tincture you can definitely taste like the strong tincture on it right away i kind of got like weird texture on it it's like from i don't know if it's just the brand of dining rooms that i use but like kinda like slimy i don't like that well i don't not like the gummy worm i just don't like the slime it's kind of like a weird texture so far like but i don't know i feel like that you're i can only taste the tincture on the outside i don't feel like it actually soaked up anything so i'm gonna try it rinsing one off and like washing wiping it down really good with some water so that if the if it is just tincture on the outside then we'll be able to find out because if i rinse off water it should still taste like tincture on the inside right so i'm gonna go do that and i'll be right back and we'll try and see how that tastes okay so here's the gummy i just rinsed very well i taste exactly like the original gummy worm did so it does i have no taste of tincture in it at all which is proving that it didn't soak it up which is really weird because if gummies soak up alcohol to make alcoholic gummies why wouldn't it soak up tincture so i'm very shocked and i'm like wondering if i did something wrong like why didn't they soak it up i wonder if it was the brand should i try this same thing on a variety of different brands of gummies like buy a bunch of different brands of gummy bears and see which one soaks up the most would you guys be interested in me doing a video like that but yeah since um essentially they didn't soak up anything it's kind of a waste so i think a better way to be going about it is to just put some tincture on them like put them in a container and mix it up or something and then set them out to dry a little bit and then cover them with sugar i'll try that and we'll see how that works as well so here we're just gonna place some fresh gummy worms into a jar of tincture then we're just gonna close the lid and shake it up so that they all get covered in the tincture and then we will take them all out with a fork trying to be careful not to waste too much tincture um from holding them from the jar to the drying area so just kind of shake them off a little bit so there's not too much dripping and then just leave them to dry until they're just slightly sticky and depending on how much airflow you have it can take anywhere between 20 minutes to a couple of hours so once they're not wet anymore and they're just a little bit sticky you can put them in sugar you don't have to but it's nice so that you're not having that direct tincture on your tongue so i'm just shaking these up and then i'm gonna put them back out to dry but these were not dry enough when i did this so you guys are gonna see what happens so i could tell immediately as soon as i opened it you see how the sugar is almost like chunky on there i don't know if you can really see it but um so it chunks up in i kind of shook it off there but you can still see it's like the sugar crystals gather together so that's what happens when there's too much moisture and these are not going to dry so yeah they're nice and chunky um even i can try leaving them out but they probably will very likely not dry they'll just keep pulling out moisture so you guys can see this is what the sugar looks like because now it's been contaminated with moisture i guess you could say so you can see it clumped up immediately just from that little bit too much of moisture and i'm gonna get some regular sugar so you guys can see a side by side of what it should look like so there's a regular granulated sugar and then i'm gonna pour the one that had a little bit of moisture in it and you can see those clumps that it's made and how it has a less fine of the texture so just when you're making your gummies make sure that before you put your sugar on they're fully dry because this is a very common thing people their gummies get all like wet and moist and it's because your gummy was too wet when you coated it in the sugar so here's one of the gummies that was coated when it wasn't wet and just only slightly sticky and you can see the sugar looks perfect there's no wetness and it's not clumpy and then if we pull up one of the ones we just did where it was too wet you can see the sugar is starting to pull out the moisture and the whole thing is getting that wet look and i'm just gonna continue to keep doing this um in this case i'm just going to eat them like that because they're not really salvageable because rinsing them off will remove the tincture that we dip them in so you want them to be just sticky like this so they're not wet at all just only a slight stickiness we're not going to use that sugar that's been contaminated with the moisture because it's going to not give us nicer so i'm just dipping these little sticky ones into a dish of fresh sugar and then again leave them out to dry and it'll probably need about 24 hours to fully dry before you package them up overall i think the best method for trying to infuse store-bought candies is using my sour patch method um i'll post a link for it in the description box and i'll try and post one on the video as well um but yeah check this out this is a lot

[Music] my [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music]", "vlLo3VBV9X8": "hi everybody and welcome to Baker madness I'm chef Scott and this is a cannabis friendly cooking and baking show where we sometimes cook things and sometimes we no but at least once a week I eat some edibles from one of our Washington state dispensaries something that I wouldn't make in the house something that's probably more industrial then I might have the tools to do so we're gonna get started right away with today's friendly panda candies by hot sugar hot sugar is a subsidiary company of the fact and a company you need to go to their website fat Panda there that's fun I've already eaten a few of these these are our Panda candies these are the caramel apple flavor they have a bunch of flavors many many many not for kids this is THC infused tetrahydrocannabinol okay I'm not sure what the regulation is because this is a really new package as a matter of fact this package that you see is a redesign of the package WIC in the past I don't know six months but this is a new look whichever I like it's really aggressive in there I like that but this package doesn't have any of the nutritional values of anything whereas some of the other ones really do they have act it looks like you bought it at the grocery store it's got all the nutrition and the sodium and the all the stuff so I'm not really sure it must be a voluntary kind of a thing I wish cannabis companies are you listening please put the nutritional values on your products you see these words how tiny can you see the tiniest words ever so I wrote them down over here so he's sharing with you easier I'm gonna read some stuff here and you'll be able to tell from my face how I feel about any of it okay the following pesticides have been used to grow the cannabis that helped create this product Newcomb botan Agard max safer brand three-in-one liquid sulfur Zehra tall regalia PTO gannett role and as a guard which I think sounds like a place that Thor lives as a guard as a guard anyway that's one two three four five six seven eight different pesticides used on the cannabis on the flower the stem portion that's a lot of pesticides in Washington State you have to declare what pesticides are used if any so we have some other companies that we use a lot of flour from that are organic the cannabis was extracted using a proprietary blend of hydrocarbons winterized with ethanol and then molecularly distilled leaving no residual solvents I don't know what any of those words mean but it is forcing me to believe it sweetie okay all of these words are printed on that little half inch tall paragraph okay this is not necessary here are your ingredients today isomalt we're gonna talk about that in a minute pure cane sugar corn syrup vanilla beans cannabis can't can't cannabis oil propyl paraben artificial flavor with the brown color which is six colors like a [ __ ] Crayola box okay corn starch vegetable gum citric acid sodium benzoate potassium sorbate potassium sorbet really caramel flavor and a natto and a natto is just like a it's a vegetable color it's no problem isomalt let's talk about that that's the number one ingredient in this product isomalt is a sugar alcohol and if you're not a baker if you don't work in the food industry you may not know what it is if you go to Vegas or you go to some fancy place and they have those big gorgeous sugar sculptures and it's just tall and beautiful and sculptural and architectural that's made with isomalt sugar real sugar your table sugar that you guys are using right now is known as hydro scopic that means it pulls all of the water near it to it that's why if you leave should sometimes it'll get all mushy especially you live in Florida it'll get all I mean you can you know I mean I so melt on the other hand is not so in the pebbles candies they use pure sugar and corn syrup and those candies as they melt in your mouth they become pliable and kind of bendy isomalt does not these candies do not ever become bendy they get smaller smaller smaller smaller until I usually get bored with them and crunch them to death which is probably terrible for my teeth but I do it anyway because I have no control isomalt is really low on the glycemic index that means that it does not trigger an insulin response so it is not as sweet as real sugar but you can use it like real sugar it is granulated and it melts like sugar it acts exactly like sugar it is not hydroscopic so it's very firm that's why they use it you know to make stuff there is a national prohibition on cannabis so companies that operate in Washington state that also want to operate in other states or want to have their product in other states have to open separate companies separate facilities separate grow houses all separate if they want to for example fat Panda is the company that it originated here and it is also you can get it in count in Canada they have fat panda in Canada as well and here and I guess just recently in California what I but it's coming soon to Oregon Michigan Ohio West Virginia Florida Arizona Nevada and more to come caramel apple delicious first of all you get a sticker whose love a sticker [Music] all right I got this is what they look like this is ten milligrams of THC this is a caramel apple caramel apple flavor I like these because they're stupid packages really weak it's supposed to be childproof but clamp doesn't seem like it yeah [Music] but the flavor you guys super flavorful also the distillate that they're using is really front like I can really I can feel it on my tongue yeah it's really good hmm yeah yummy that was really nice okay I promise to set this one okay I promise chimera Lamia I will zoom it [ __ ] [Music] so the Panda can be worked I already know worked I didn't worked but it really works good so let's do a little let's do a little test now let's see I'm gonna mix these up these are some of my tarot cards I will do a little tarot card reading for you right now mmm tarot cards so special so maybe tippy do so magical oh so controversial pick a card any card to pick a card one pick it for you let's talk about this dope shall we oh my god yeah so these Panda candies I don't know what they're using how it works this the strength of the stuff if you call a few episodes ago I told you it's 10 milligrams per candy but they don't tell you what strain they've used or how strong that strain is so 10 milligrams of one kind of weed can be really much stronger than 10 milligrams of another kind of weed seriously the way they make these I feel them almost immediately this is one of the only candies is one of the few candies that really just I seriously I feel it within 30 minutes two or three of these are some kind of strong ass [ __ ] okay so on my scale let's give him four tastes an eight I'm gonna give him a 7 they have you can really taste the distillate and I mean the caramel apple flavor is good but you can still really it gets overpowered so a7 what I say think of it 7 and for efficacy a 9 and for price an 8 they were good plus no my Wizards discount love that ok so we've picked a card you picked a card - Jeff you picked a card this would be 10 of cups the 10 of cups now if you don't follow Tarot this is a great card oh gosh so family unit everybody's happy they got everything they need often the distance is their house it symbolizes family and stability and the river of emotions flowing through the promise from the divine through the the rainbow everything's gonna be fine so hold tight you guys find the people you love if you're not close to call them and it's gonna be fine we'll be fine see you next time on Baker madness [Music]", "26QFC69UK1E": "okay uh this is an episode we've been looking forward to for a long time um we are joined by the uh system of a system guys uh we have adam lehrer and uh and uh ben i i'm just gonna call him ben and uh from system of system how you guys doing hey thank you so much for having us yeah thanks so much guys this is going to be great yeah yeah i know so everybody everybody go check out their podcast um i believe uh you guys have it linked in your guys's bio correct on twitter which yeah system of patreon.com perfect so we'll put that in the episode notes um you guys twitter handles will be on the video screen as well so um yeah lots of stuff to get to so i'm going to jump right into it um i'm going to start with ben here ben uh originally when i reached out to you a while back about about coming on it was it was about like small business kind of discourse where uh you'd see uh i i thought this was kind of like a i'm kind of new to the whole leftist twitter kind of thing and i kind of thought we were all in agreement on uh where who who's the bad guy right like that who's the who's the bad guy and um there there was a couple pieces that were written um i don't know exactly who by that like small businesses are getting just crushed by covid and yeah there were a lot of like leftoid people going yeah good like that's yeah that's what we should do um and and you know the cool lock all those words that i i don't know what those mean but um anyways like yeah like tom's pool supplies is a cool lock you know right yeah so sure um and and uh you had some interesting stuff on on twitter i won't put the actual tweets up because there's people in there i don't want to give them any any clout uh for that but but um i'm of the thinking that like hey i would rather have smaller businesses that you could then i guess consolidate or whatever rather than like hey let's nationalize amazon i mean did you want to just break on that real fast yeah i mean it it all kind of has to do with this uh this notion i think that a lot of kind of leptoids or i like to use the the term mark soids because it's more specific like um like that they they kind of are obsessed with which is like the notion that um i think it partially has to do with like cultural signifiers right because the small businessman is known as the petty tyrant right he's like oh the the evil guy who will you know uh uh you know cut you short every you know uh every chance you can get and you know the the bigger kind of capitalist the scene is like oh he's like he uh he's more intelligent as to how the how to run the company or whatever so he's gonna always give you uh your kind of deserved chair even though he's you know exploiting you just like uh the small business guys right but um their like their conception i think of like like how they want to get to socialism is so [ __ ] warped because i mean a lot of the sentiments i was seeing in my replies for like the 48 hours were those kind of tweets blew up and that was really in the discourse was like oh you know if um if amazon has all of the power if it's consolidated the entirety of the market it'll be so much easier to nationalize right because like all we need to do you know is is to just seize you know jeff bezos's um means of production right and then just incorporate into the state apparatus it's like well i mean a like for one uh what the [ __ ] like how how the [ __ ] are you going to uh come up with a politically salient movement that's going to challenge jeff bezos's power if he already owns and controls everything like how like how you're just making it easier for him um to kind of expand his his [ __ ] empire and also like um i think marek the the co-host of the good old boys podcast pointed this out which is a really good point it's like do you want to be fighting like um 100 baby-sized horses or one horse-sized baby like that's kind of the uh that's kind of the the bottom line here so i mean um i won't get too much into the weeds of like what i think about small businesses personally because i you know i i don't think that like that the small business model is the ideal way to like organize society or the economy or whatever but um i just don't see this uh kind of marxoid accelerationist frame of oh you know if we hand over everything to jeff bezos uh we'll get socialism that way like i i just i i think it's pretty vile actually and i think small businesses have um like much more value as like kind of communitarian structures than like a faceless kind of amazon monolith does i think we 100 agree on this yeah both of us 100 agree go ahead yeah well i think it's funny because the small business thing has been like the primary thing that people on twitter have used to discredit uh ben and i recently and part partly it's like to be expected because you know we're like this sub underground podcast with like a very kind of parasocial relationship with the people who listen to it so you know in that it's it's likely that people are gonna start like becoming our whatever our antagonists or our critics or whatever which is fine but i'm what bothers me about the whole thing and i'm always like i always like to point out that there obviously is a critique to be made of small businesses the closeness between the workers and the bosses the sort of warping of the exploitative nature of that relationship but then at the same time these people who claim to be like oh i think karl marx was [ __ ] right about everything they're not even getting that critique right because karl marx even even said that uh petty bush small business owners are a fluid class in that they unlike the owners and unlike the workers they don't share a universal interest in the same way in the same politics and there he even said or prophesized or theorized that there would come a time when big capital would monopolize small business out and basically make it extinct well here we are that [ __ ] time has come so you know yeah so he's like so basically you can have this you can have a petty bourgeois small business owner be folded into a more radical or like a revolutionary workers movement or at least align their interests with their workers or they can also get folded into the bourgeoisie so that's like what he actually said so like uh the whole like got you oh you're not a marxist which honestly i could give a [ __ ] thank you yeah thank you yeah people think that i'm uh like like uh a super orthodoxic marxist or not like i i do adhere mostly to a marxist analysis but a lot of this is so kind of rooted in just like like they aren't like the the not like they've taken on our analysis is mostly correct the left is basically functioning as a reactionary movement um propaganda movement for the bourgeoisie but they're also still gatekeeping for the left like oh there's a real left out there and i don't give a [ __ ] i don't think there is there is nothing left yeah so it's like uh you're not gonna get me with that ben and i are just you know we're not even like political scientists both of us are writers and artists so it's like we're just kind of responding to things in the way that we see them from the way that we understand them so the whole like got you [ __ ] you're not a marxist i don't give a [ __ ] i will surrender i will surrender happily yeah exactly yeah yeah and this segues perfectly into what i wanted to ask about because we're we're [ __ ] dumb bros we're not theory you know we we've maybe read like a lick of marks you know we're so we're like look at all this from the outside kind of i don't know how to describe it but the way i see the mark zoids i love that term it's kind of kind of like kind of like a jazz bro that learns a charlie parker song or the whole catalog note for note and then gets mad at like fusion or something thinking that charlie parker today would be doing the same [ __ ] he does back right is that a good analogy you think and where these guys are so so tunnel visioned into this marxist thing where marx wouldn't be marx today well he would on some fundamental levels but he would have a totally different analysis of big tech and different things right i think it would be a lot more new yeah yeah so um talk about yeah like just more broadly the the what you think of today's marxist left mark zoid left and how that how that kind of how that kind of obfuscates the the things we need to do and again it ties into that small business discourse i think yeah i mean i can i can just jump in and say that i think the uh kind of mark soy left um as it exists not as it aspires this is something i always always talk about that i want to hammer into people's heads because you can be the perfect revolutionary you can you can say that you're the perfect revolutionary you can larp as the perfect revolutionary but at the end of the day if you don't have a revolutionary movement you're not doing revolution right correct it's it's lifestyle right i think marxism as it exists is a subculture really i mean it's a way for people to find like-minded individuals online or in person to talk to and to kind of vent about political analysis right but like i think it's not really doing politics because doing politics you have to have some leverage over the world around you you have to be exercising some power and control right and so i mean i think like um like marxism as it exists is mostly just a a lifestyle and like like i think really um the analysis is useful like by all means like um uh marty mcmarty made this point that like he you know he's like i i accept certain things about marxism because i think they're incredibly valuable for analysis like the understanding of class contradictions and class composition but i throw the rest of it out because it's not useful anymore like um i don't think that uh like i mean personally like i think this has kind of been proven like uh like industrial capitalism didn't end in socialism right it didn't proceed to socialism it proceeded to post industrial capitalism or whatever you want to call it like uh neoliberalism or like i'm i'm fine of the term actually neo or techno feudalism because you know this like kind of like technological consolidation of the market is leading to a new kind of feudalism and many people are talking about this um but yeah i mean it's just it's a lifestyle more than anything and i don't blame people for wanting to like fit in somewhere but absolutely they should be they should be honest with the stakes of what they're doing and the role that they play because most of these people are extremely delusional like they're either in like a little they're either in like a little like trotskyist cult where they read theory like 13 hours a day and discuss it you know very deeply or like left communists whatever or they're like maoists like um trying to infiltrate the labor movement and getting like you know like uh like voted out by workers who are like we don't we don't like we don't want a a revolution we want like higher wages like we just want to live like a decent life exactly if you if you brought that into my company where i work in like a blue collar thing they would be like yeah there'd be there'd be slurs i'm just saying yeah what the [ __ ] like they're just like okay so what get to the point you know what i mean like why why do we have to they they're still caught up in the aesthetic of it too i i still yeah aesthetic of all of it yeah um yeah and like a couple points here i remember you know because i i mostly adhere to like um a left-com analysis like if i was gonna square myself into any ideology but i don't do it anymore just for like i don't want to [ __ ] engage people about what any of these things mean but like another thing that drives me nuts about this super rigid marx orthodox orthodoxus is like they're acting like we all know a hundred percent what this [ __ ] means and as if marxism itself hasn't been the subject of like almost two centuries worth of debate um by the people that adhere to it and you know there's actually a piece by i mean this is not an endorsement but i just read the piece and thought it was interesting by moldbug and as many as many things as uh that there are certain some certainly things in mold bugs work that i find a bit confusing if not uh repugnant from my own like petty bourgeois morality but he made the case in this piece that today not only is socialism fake but capitalism is also fake and then he kind of explains the way that capital is accumulated now like none of it makes any sense it's not just like the simple extraction of surplus value from labor anymore it involves all these sorts of like metaphysics just like you know the actual value of like stock prices and [ __ ] makes no [ __ ] sense so with everything so kind of confusing and or like liquid as a sigmund bound would call it i think it's helpful to just remain a little loose in how you think about and how you perceive and analyze the things that are happening around you and of course like karl marx is to this day the best critic of capitalism there's no doubt about it and like you know and for that we should forever take his work seriously talk about it discuss it but it's also important to be open to the idea that there might not be things you know a century and a half down the line that karl marx could have foreseen yeah the way that value is now accumulated often is like you know very strong abstract abstract yeah sign value beaudrillard so a little bit of egg god in here i was going to say that's what a guy was literally talking about that last week like a couple episodes ago no exactly perfect no yeah yeah but um yeah why don't you uh uh talk to adam about his piece uh the american greatness piece because i know yeah i love that i love the the oh i love the piece and again it's a lot of it's over my head you both you are more eloquent and intelligent than i'm gonna pull it up right here so people yeah and uh so again a little bit was over my head and i i definitely did not know like 80 of the guys you talked about in this article but i think i got that the gist of it and especially when you're talking about the um how the left is just functioning as shock troops for the left side of capital and how the left can't allow people like angela nagle or amy teresi or even michael tracy to to kind of express their opinions which are oftentimes right on the money right oh yeah yeah and totally and um so yeah and just get it get into uh what this was about and also just the backlash especially when you got killed man i was looking at the quote i was looking at the quote tweets on like the net because i'm like oh this is cool let me check it yeah and then yeah yeah like i didn't even look at any of that probably a good move saying about it no that's that's good and but again everyone like eighty percent of people are just calling who are [ __ ] which is again that's our that's our word of choice on this pod but you know not for stuff that's not you know that's like a compliment right yeah yeah but yeah no critique of anything no yeah no critique and um again we don't want to get into like you know specific twitter beef per se but i think it i think it exposes a lot that they can't even see like just yeah like just the shock troop thing that you talked about that's that's completely uncontroversial to anyone with eyes this last year right but they just they think it's like some huge attack on their ideology or something or they think it's not oh yeah yeah but go ahead yeah well um you know the title wasn't my choice it's uh a little more edge lordy than i would have intended but i did want to clarify that like yeah the definition of reactionary right was yeah yeah yeah people yeah yeah because like you know a lot of people think reactionary and they're immediately going to think of fascism or whatever hate that word they hate it yeah yeah yeah and i'm more interested in like the broader historical idea of what uh reactionary means which is just like deeply skeptical of a liberalization of society in a reform and maybe a sort of nostalgia for a system that came before it and you know the one thing that i saw that people were like uh pining on as i opened with amy's tweet but i don't care what they [ __ ] like that was like amy's tweet was the thing that got me thinking about this because i had known that karl marx and angles were of course very uh they're huge fans and great admirers of balzac um and you know i didn't think about that before but it makes much more sense to me now you know karl marx was basically criticizing a lot of the bourgeois socialists and reformers of his time and even though these quote-unquote reactionaries but you know i i dc miller actually him and i have talked a little bit on email because he was i got fired from a job over the summer for showing support to him so him and i correspond sometimes and he wants to clarify that he considers himself a quote surrealist of the right so maybe i would just throw that out there that he kind of rejects the term reactionary but basically i wanted to you know come at it this way that these guys don't agree that you know they're not going to be supporters of the working class overthrowing the bourgeoisie but in their rejection of the current system it's like visceral the visceral rejection of the political economic order as it is now and balzac for instance the reason he hated the reason he hated capitalism so much and he basically wanted to restore like a noble aristocracy tethered to land and people is that capital and bourgeoisie society empowered the most conformist kind of managerial pieces of [ __ ] yeah and like that's only gotten so much more extreme now like they're like a billion think about who the billionaires are there isn't one [ __ ] like not one of these guys could like um you know prevent themselves from getting their ass kicked in like a bar fight you know yeah yeah just like nerds who have no regard for anything other than domination of the markets so guys like like dc miller was incredibly important to me in developing my critique of how in neoliberalism and late capitalism all art and culture has basically been folded into the left side of capital as a very sort of disciplined propaganda mechanism he's been talking about this [ __ ] for years way longer than i have and and then nick lan and nick lan everybody should read i mean he influenced people on the left mark fisher cotto wishon and people on the right because it should be it should be a literary experience reading nickland but before foremost right yeah yeah exactly because like because um nickland writes in a style that's very sort of like trans like his book on batai for instance it's a very interesting work of literary criticism and philosophy because he's basically trying to like fuse himself or like commune with bataille himself like become one with bataille it's a very interesting way to write and then welbeck who the [ __ ] doesn't like michelle welbeck i'm sorry like like uh he's one of the greatest literary artists of the last [ __ ] 25 years how is anyone like i don't even know what people were so offended by with this piece but that's what i'm trying to figure out yeah i don't know i don't know why is it just because it's you is it because it's you or is it is it because amy amy's name was in the first paragraph i i really don't know that's what well they what they were saying was that you were comparing uh balzac to amy to theresa or something they were saying that you were like equating the two yeah i was like i don't think that's i didn't get that from the piece and uh but amy only comes up at the beginning she doesn't like yeah i just cite her tweet as a way to describe launchpad yeah yeah yeah yeah like that was like how the idea came like it's not like amy therese is the annoytee balzac of our time that's how banging her twitter is and this will be the end of my spiel with this but yeah the two pieces that i really like from you were the one we just talked about and the and they're connected too and then the arts moral fetish one where you bring it into the art world how there's no radical art anymore comedy or music and and and how it ties into the trump era how i remember in the ver when right when you first got voted in and i was thinking to myself is like is this going to create some crazy like revolutionary art or some crazy like music and that just didn't happen right it's the same [ __ ] it's everything is so corralled and so like you said it's just function as like a neo-liberal propaganda tool more than anything now and yeah yeah and is that going to be is that going to change in the next four to eight years you know just to look at it from a political time frame well that's my ultimate goal is to create a space from which some sort of dissenting dissenting aesthetic or some sort of dissenting consensus can form alongside this and obviously i do have friends and collaborators and stuff that of course we're all talking about this in like in whatever dm's and texts and whatnot but there are still very few people willing to say it out loud and god bless that magazine cesura like after i had been basically totally kicked out of art literary and music media they they totally gave me a new platform to get back because that's i mean at root i'm a uh an art critic and uh art historian so but basically you know the problem is as i see it is that the cultural hegemony has internalized and regurgitated and leftist aesthetics cultural aesthetics intersectionality for instance has like become the the dominant ideology of like the corporate hr it's original like there's no there's no escaping like if you are going to talk to a musician or an artist or filmmaker nowadays there's inevitably going to be some mention of like kimberly crenshaw's like uh her frame of intersectionality like there's literally no way robin deangelo yeah yeah right and and and what happens is is you know it's not like it's not abnormal that like the art world or the institutions of the culture industries have like a very close relationship with finance capital it's pretty much always been that way but yeah but but but the phenomenon of all artists not just like your big sort of like blue chip people but basically everyone trying to get a foothold in the universe and the schools and everything right all of it and um like they have lost sight of like there's a whole disciplinary sort of ideology to ensure that people do stay within a certain window of expression i mean you'll be ostracized if you even question the idea that like judith butler whoever is anything less than like an infallible genius and and with that you have artists who are you know they've basically made anti-trumpism the only kind of expression of like radical politics in the art world so ultimately we have like you know and you can even see this and how the way protests are going like pink [ __ ] hat like this transgressive this sort of transgressive expression at the service of hillary clinton losing the [ __ ] nomination yeah i hope i don't get killed for this everyone's gonna hate this it's like you will not get killed for that yeah it almost fits in with like mark fisher and capitalist realism and and all this kind of thing that the most people can imagine the most that their creative energy can be directed towards politically is the left side of capital the other party and its and its owners and the security state taking power again for four years you know there's no sort of like imagining a world beyond it there's no questioning like because at this moment right now especially black lives matter should be exposed as an ngo apparatus that is fully dedicated to the mystification of real politic on behalf of the bourgeoisie but black lives matter was just ranked by art news or something as the most important person like they called the movement the most important person you know corporations are people too yeah explanations are people too there you go yeah time person of the year healthcare workers with like the masks it's like a particularly anarchic form of libertarianism and i i do get sick of like because i feel like oh [ __ ] am i just becoming like you know the critic of cancel culture but i hope people understand that i'm trying to go a little bit deeper than that and understand the dynamics because like you know i'm writing this i just finished uh this other piece on these artists that i think are amazing also for sasura but at the same time i end up having like a little tidbits here and there about these ideological underpinnings because you just can't escape it it's just constant and it keeps happening yeah yeah yeah that's great it's exactly especially especially right now with with what's happening like uh i i feel bad not bringing it up because it's like that wasn't going to be what we talked about this week really at all but it happened was the capital i mean the stuff that happened at the capitol like so let me i got to ask ben ben what is your just your rough take on like what happened did they cops let him in did they did that i mean you know what i'm saying what do you think happened what was or was it was it overthrowing the government yeah well i know i mean i can say something with certainty that the whole kind of uh push by silicon valley to uh to kind of categorize this as a coup or an insurrection uh or i i even object to the word mob because this was this wasn't like just a mob they had a political intent they had a specific political intent which was to um interrupt congress from from uh you know certifying the like whatever you think about that intent there was an intent there it wasn't just like yeah you know like ah like just like yeah right yeah yeah yeah so um but i i do like i mean one thing we know is that it was not a coup or an insurrection because it i mean categorically just like definitionally it's not like if you know the definition of an insurrection or a coup it's it's not either of those things and um i just find i mean like the the whole cope of the left was that oh these people um uh you know they're white right so they don't uh they're not considered by the mainstream media and the kind of white supremacist um establishment to be uh like uh criminals or whatever they're just protesters right there was a meme of you know a peter griffin with the the race like the the cop is holding up the race card right right right get some new memes i know yeah i know and but the thing is they weren't they were calling it a riot they were calling it an instruction and a couple people five people died and um like i'm not gonna say i don't know certainly if it's a psyop or not i'm not gonna say that it was orchestrated by the democrats or orchestrated by the kind of um you know the swamp the the neolib cons if you will uh i will say though that it certainly played into their hands if it wasn't a if it wasn't an intentional kind of um inside job or whatever it certainly benefited them um wholesale because a they uh started uh a kind of drive to to basically um censor and and kind of um uh like limit the the avenues of information through which trump and trump supporters and anybody considered to be even tangentially like associated with the so-called insurrectionaries for them to communicate with the public at all like what's going on what's been going on in the past 24 hours has actually been kind of unprecedented in a sense like in a very it's yeah in a very scary way like um you know like uh like imagine um like just the transparency of this blows my [ __ ] mind because a private corporation right exercises the power to um silence the sitting president of the united states um uh for uh a breach of their own kind of uh terms of service right this is the primary mode of communication that he has with the public right i mean if you're going to like if you recognize the uh the role and the the kind of um the responsibilities and and duties that the president has this is one of the fundamental ones like clear and transparent communication with the public obviously he has other means of doing it but this is the most um kind of approachable way for most people i think it's the place where he probably has the most like active listeners and followers right this is a president of the united states he's the most powerful person in the history of the world right so um you'd think that it would be a little bit concerning to the kind of liberals and the marxists and the leftwoods that this private corporation is is exercising this un previously unforeseen power this is something that's been rolled out suddenly it's been rolled out um basically without warning it's been rolled out um in a way that was meant to be a kind of political and ideological bludgeon to basically tell anybody who had qualms or questions about the so-called um uh free and fair elections that just happened in november anybody who had qualms about that and this is not me being maga i'm just saying like if you didn't pay attention to those uh there was certainly something fishy about them like 100 yeah like yeah i i'm not even coming to any conclusions about it i quite frankly i'm not well read on the subject i haven't really been following all of the details and the developments but um like there was something [ __ ] fishy about like they don't just stop counting votes at eight p.m on a tuesday afternoon like it's just like right so you know yeah shout outs to the class rituxikilla who was calling this super early right yeah yeah i'll probably forget half of them on this whole thing that happened that i'd love to hear your guys takes on all you guys um number one is like i kind of reject the notion that that trump is inciting violence with his twitter per se right that's the excuse they use they they're it's a they wanted they wanted this to happen they wanted they wanted an excuse to do this right and i read every one of his tweets and i'm like you know it's like it's it's whatever you know it's it's no it's awesome i [ __ ] love it yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly yeah i miss it bad already yeah yeah oh yeah yeah i mean can we acknowledge that this is the greatest poster of all time that they just ever like it's so sad yeah it's when they made it they made michael jordan retire from gambling yeah yeah yeah that's what happened this is what they did trump will be back in four years yeah that's why like any trump art and comedy and [ __ ] sucks so much as trump is like an infinitely better he's better better yeah they all are yeah so it all kind of fails and you're and you're as a as a creator an artist you're always on your back foot when you're trying to like defend against some irony bro or some like some like trump tweet and you're just like actually that's bad and that's not a creative space to come from right you know yeah yeah well he has kind of like a lenny bruce thing about him yeah the way that he's so off the cuff yeah yeah but also the just the that again you said the left cope of the fact that and you know we have we all have different critiques of bernie sanders campaign both in 16 and 20. but the fact that it did get stolen from him by the dnc undemocratically and we did nothing about the left did nothing about it basically we're just like oh shucks like you know and it's like and then we and then we see like like just these these mega bros just like pop off randomly yeah they're just like let's do it and like we're like oh [ __ ] where i thought we were the revolution it's tragic it's chat yeah yeah yeah not defending i'm not saying it's like you know well thought out or anything but just the just the energy of it is there right right it's an authentic expression of alienation and a refusal to be cucked at the same time it lacks sort of like the coherent analysis or like thank you right or like institutional backing one would need to actually make any dents but i do think this whole thing is incredibly useful for outlining some of the contradictions so the same [ __ ] who will tweet abolish the white patriarchal colonial state are now blowing their loads over the capitol building being stormed and like oh how dare they yeah the dude the pelosi feed on desk guy is like that guy that guy's getting like 10 years or something probably oh my god it's like if anyone is that is so wrecked and then the same people who say abolish the police are like mad that the police didn't shoot everybody on the spot and are justifying the death of some like regular woman who wasn't even acting out violently i mean not only justifying did you see charlotte climbers yeah i just want to comment on this because okay i'm sorry this was the best yeah oh my god with the crown with the tiara or the crown on in the picture yeah so i'm blocked so i had to see a screenshot but it's yeah because i used folks wrong in a tweet but yeah yeah that's a whole story but yeah yeah that's yeah but yeah psychopaths oh my god i was just gonna say you know charlotte climber was like oh uh you know this woman she knew what she was doing she deserved her death anybody mourning her is you know uh you know being senseless because you know at the end of the day like why would you have sympathy for somebody who's overtly marching for a white supremacist right and she like imagine just like imagine god imagine if one of us tweeted the same thing about like george floyd or any one of these i i i happen to think that so execution by the state is wrong whoever [ __ ] gets i'm principled on that belief i have a i have a hard line in the sand yeah yeah yeah it's not malleable like it is for these people like where it's it's so it's so weird and and you'll see the people say the the false equivalencies look at standing rock you had such a great first off obama did that so yeah all right yeah yeah yeah i sent you a liberal already second off that was for like big capital i'm sorry it's way different we're talking about like putting you know reservations and all that kind of stuff this was just like an act of like okay let's not pretend that it wasn't provoked it was totally provoked it was years of just media slamming all that kind of stuff anything trump says is wrong all that we knew that was going to happen now i truly do think that the police let them in and and like yeah probably they let that i had to like yeah well i saw somebody a tweet i i don't remember the guy's name it was a great tweet he was just like one thing america's really good at security and police yeah when you see a bunch of guys wearing like catchers gear from like their uh little league and pepe shields and stuff right yeah they're gonna they're gonna uh it's all around so i think what it was was like you know i do a lot of sports metaphors but um it's like it's like a screen pass in the nfl where you let you let all the blockers come in and you're like oh no the play's done and then you just throw it right over their head yeah i mean and then all of a sudden oh [ __ ] it's done so now there's been consent manufactured and i'm sad i'm i don't know why i'm always shocked when the left is like they're gonna be so close surveillance yeah and they love the surveillance part of it oh yeah twitter's a private company i thought you didn't like private companies right yeah this it always reverts back to a kind of vulgar libertarianism with the left that's one thing that it's always it's always a return a reversion to the mean right they always come back to their roots which is this kind of like uh you know oh this you know trump should have known the consequences of what he was doing he was implicitly agreeing to the terms of service laid out by the private company it's like okay then the other flip side of that the other side of the coin is that you believe that a private company has the right to uh relegate and to determine who and who cannot say certain things in an ostensibly public sphere and that's what i'm getting at out of this like aren't you the guys who are supposed to be about abolishing capital and about abolishing uh private corporations and private ownership of the means of production it is the dumbest line of argument it is the dumbest i was just thinking because well i i'm the hillary clinton state department for instance like it had pretty much one singular goal which was to stymie and silence sort of any kind of populist uprising anywhere around the world whether it was left or right it was to put down populist movements with imperial violence and enforce american global capital and you see these tactics happening inside the u.s now which is basically why you can it's an easy way to understand why sort of uh fascism or like uh in like um at-home terrorism or whatever has largely superseded islamic terrorism as the the ideological basis for reactionary security state measures like like fascism is now the specter that the status quo uses to protect itself from its own descent and that is what i kind of view the capital building reaction as is the final nail in the coffin of these populist uprisings we've had and since 2015. bernie and the left are [ __ ] cowards who are ultimately at the service of the left side of capital anyways they were easy just say bernie's like whatever and anti-semite that he hates women and there you go the movements don't orbit corbin the same thing that's it same thing and then but but trump voters are a bit more idiosyncratic and they're definitely not gonna [ __ ] listen to any of the narratives that are shoved down their throats and culture right so what you have to do i like to i like to i'm working on this thing that i'm writing but i call these things like microcosmic death spectacles which is these like little brutalities or violences or outcries whatever that are then they're sort of like very small in the grand scope scheme of things but they're magnified to drown out everything else so it becomes a huge smoke screen that you direct all your attention to and that's clearly what this is you know it's like a couple hundred people outside the capitol building pissed off also kind of having a good time it looked like and and then that's reported and regurgitated as sickening violence or so there you go you've discredited the trump movement once and for all and i think this one will actually stick and i think they're also going to use it to discredit holly going forward but i you know oh yeah what was the credit like josh oh didn't the penguin what was it penguin or who does simon uh yeah yeah they just got bought by was it amazon or something they got bought by google some big company i want to say maybe i'm wrong but they got bought by that and then josh howley's not allowed to publish his book in it now which is hilarious because how did trump start by the way like trump started by the way where everybody feared him it was like oh we can't have this that's gonna put way more people they keep making the same mistake over and over again running yeah you can de-platform the person you can't de-platform the thought you can't yeah if you don't change anything else like it's so dumb it's so dumb and on the deep platforming thing the whole thing they did with trump which is obviously taking up all the discussion right now and for good reason but the thing that caught me more off guard was they took the parlor app off the google and apple play stores you know immediately like they had it ready to go which is way scarier for me than than just banning one guy even if he is trump or whatever because that's that's huge that's like that's like they had that ready to go like kamala drafted it up or something and they was collaborative and they and that um yeah and it's just nuts and it's and yeah just sorry not to go back on the whole argument of like it's a private corporation thing that is so dumb to me because because it's first of all it's not you know and all the leftists now their cope is saying we got to nationalize twitter which is so difficult like if it functionally is nationalized in the sense that it's just an nsa front at this point right right no this is yeah yeah go ahead yeah no no no i was just gonna say like uh no actually no i'll let you finish this is kind of something i wanted to yeah yeah well they say that they say that it's just it's so trite all their little all the conclusions that the leftists come to is like you know we got to nationalize twitter and it's a private corporation just so dumb i remember that being like an extreme right-wing talking point when i was growing up right right as a private corporation and yeah i don't know it's just so it's so crazy and the inciting violence thing which is like the whole like we have to protect hate speech which is of course ambiguous and can be used in anything deliberately ambitious yeah and the one other thing is that we kind of alluded to before briefly with like standing rock and everything is that and they have a point here is that they're like well leftists get banned all the time for the dumbest [ __ ] for saying you're for saying like a saying like you know basil should be decapitated or whatever right so therefore so therefore i'm happy that it happened to trump which is kind of that's not really the that's not the thing that i think they think and you can literally say i don't want to kill trump and you might get a netflix special so yeah probably with the same it's not even the same yeah i mean like what what all of this is pointing to and i think i mean this might sound hyperbolic now but i honestly don't think it's going to be in like a year from now it's the emergence of a real one-party state like right now the gop if you look at the gop the state of it right now i just saw a video of lindsey graham walking through an airport and getting harassed and screamed at by trump supporters um for not you know pushing back hard enough against the like the the whole uh biden certification right and this is like this is the end of the republican party as we know it i genuinely think that because the democrats now what they control the the the house the senate um and the presidency um you know de facto already like they're already trying to they're trying to impeach trump with like 11 days or 10 days left or whatever right so um you know this is like this is the emergence of a kind of one-party state i genuinely believe that and basically all of the kind of emergent um power uh like centers um which is you know silicon valley and uh the kind of like um the the kind of like online kind of retailer giants like amazon and whatnot um they're you know just lined up behind the kind of democratic party consensus like progressive like progressive neoliberalism is a salient political force like identity politics is not just a uh identity thing it's not just a rhetorical thing it's not just a culture war thing it's a political tool it's not like these things uh they serve as a kind of material kind of uh bludgeon against um solidarity uh wit but you know between working-class people and even just between people who don't want to be uh kind of dominated by the kind of you know uh liberal kind of uh surveillance therapeutic state right like um like they are kind of a salient political force and like my point is when it comes to the kind of left-wing analysis of the so-called like capital uprising or whatever is that you know they were like oh these people aren't working class they're petty bouge right and i'm like it really doesn't matter because like the the so-called like petty boost tyrants and i'm sure there had to have been working-class people there i mean you don't you don't you're not just like it's not solely like it's not really boat dealers right yeah like um yeah thanks to them for that whole like [ __ ] messiah yeah yeah but like my point is that um like the the kind of petty boosh tyrants and the working-class people of the trump coalition are already a politically salient force they have organizational capabilities like we've already seen and they have a political movement they've stormed the [ __ ] capital for christ's sakes right so why the hell wouldn't so-called class first marxists and like workers leftists take advantage of their anger at progressive neoliberalism and channel it into some kind of because fascism because yeah right because it's they are sorry go ahead ben no no no i was just gonna say that's exactly it like the like uh there is already a coalition of economically disenfranchised and politically precarious people the lefties are just too afraid to go near near them because they don't want to uh they don't have the correct you know cultural and aesthetic predispositions that the left has already married itself to like if you're going to do a working-class movement from from the way i understand it like it won't even matter what these people's social beliefs are the fact is that yeah they're angry at the system they're angry at the elites they're angry at you know you could call it the capitalist bourgeois order i'm honestly not a fan of that it's just this system it's the at least we all know what you're referring to by saying that right i don't know i'm sorry it just happened think about it think about it like that uh think about it like this i mean you have how do how does the dsa people respond to any kind of critique point are you saving the world right now and a privilege adam yeah that's too loud uh yeah i'm so glad we brought up the dsa i actually wanted to hear i want to hear adam's thoughts on the dsa because i love it please yeah i i i ended up doing back and forth with some of these guys and i try not to be too cruel on the internet but they make it really [ __ ] hard yeah because they neutralize any criticism with like what are you doing to save the world right now like things you couldn't possibly respond to and not feel like an idiot like what do you what how does that have anything to do with this or start start your own organization right and then they never asked the question of why like when you're actually throwing ideas out there that are a challenge to a bourgeois state the bourgeois state doesn't respond by putting you on the [ __ ] cover of time magazine and if it does it's because it's trying to neutralize whatever radical energy you have in your analysis so so you have you know like um amy for instance they're saying she's an idiot she's not saying anything correct she's getting her twitter taken down every five [ __ ] weeks so clearly yeah it's it's hitting home the state responds with either brutality or or silencing rosa luxemburg got her [ __ ] brains blown out antonio gramski got thrown in a [ __ ] jail fred hampton killed in his sleep yeah yeah 21 yeah buying housing yeah yeah when i think of these people like the fact that fred hampton who i admire my favorite yeah me too and like they've taken his energy his aesthetic his sort of like not his politics but maybe his kind of like libidinal appeal and then black lives matter has basically fused that with like uh a sort of neoliberal neoliberal political economic disposition and anything that was actually emancipatory or had any sort of energy for real kind of radical politics is totally subsumed into the cultural hegemony and this is why i tweeted the other day like you know for the last like the last couple like a lot of people will come at ben and i and be like um there's you know there's a real left this is the [ __ ] that i used to do like during the bernie days no no no they're just they're they're dumb asses they don't know they don't know they're just woke they're just woke libs or whatever but they're all lips you know they're they're all and what we're seeing uh last couple days is how true that is because here is this chance to take a step back and analyze things from a sort of um neutral perspective because you know you should if if you don't if you're a leftist you don't care about the capital building here's a a real sort of opportunity to analyze these class dynamics but instead they all kind of fuel the overarching propaganda narrative and at this point because of that even though i still like what yeah sure in like any kind of political economic sense i'd probably be squared on the left if not like at the farthest whatever but the left itself air quotes who [ __ ] cares it's dead it doesn't exist and whatever it calls itself whatever the left is or whatever it calls itself is a disciplinary ideology of the ruling elite and neoliberalism so why would i waste my [ __ ] uh brain capacity trying to save something that can't be saved it's like you're just kind of like it's like you're fetishizing a name or like something that made you feel good or as ben said like an identitarian marker but if you really want to understand politics right now divorce yourself from this [ __ ] like yes be outside of it we're not going to lead a revolution any time soon so try and understand these dynamics as they're happening only through that right someday and that's the only thing that staves off nihilism for me because i get accused of nihilism a lot but i just think right now is not the time to propose to propose like um ideas for how we're going to deal with this stuff because i think that's all just snake oil but i do think we can i think the most healthy thing you can do now is just sit back as g x says sit back and think yeah you know you got to change we haven't we have to undergo as a society like an entire mental change like before any stuff happens like like and and i don't know adam that sounds pretty post-left to me all that stuff yeah yeah yeah yeah and i i i the last thing i wanted to talk to you guys about uh um because i think this could get uh kind of interesting too is is the i don't even know how to say the guy's name was it carl carl what uh beijing uh if you want to call it that honestly i thought this guy i've never read his writing before it sucks like it's like it's not like like you know i just and i'm saying even if i agreed with what he was saying like it's just like cheap propaganda yeah it's like yeah i was like okay whatever you know i mean and and that's i'm not even trying to dump on his like writing style too much but if you're gonna say this [ __ ] and be wrong like yeah maybe i will but yeah he says what is the post left right and uh you know i to me he you know he took off the deadlifting gloves and said you know what i'm i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna write this piece today take down the post left um and and all it is is just like they're republicans that's what the piece is they're they're republicans which isn't yeah which isn't true we're not like i mean i'm not i still have the same economics that i did a couple years ago i didn't change that i still want the same things that a lot of these people do but it's just like such a like a bad faith um not no pun intended but like a bad faith uh argument for for what he's trying to say and like you know i don't know have you guys read this yeah yeah i mean it only takes like four minutes to read yeah it's like yeah and the whole thing of him is like it's nothing but it's something it's nothing like that yeah yeah nothing yeah but it's something i just want to read before we get into it like this whole thing he's saying like they love tucker carlson they don't like any crystal ball they don't like any of these people they love tucker carlson though oh my gosh they call everybody else sheep herders and stuff and the last sentence of it is just fantastic to me it says for now this is more of an annoyance for socialists than a significant threat but if any of the oligarchs ever decide to write an impulsive check yeah uh the us's chronically pinched marxists are going to have a fight on our hands so um real fast for anybody who's not plugged in to uh like we have some listeners that are just kind of casually into politics they don't actually know so there's the left right which they have it as like bernie bros right that's kind of what they they think of it as is bernie bros and and all that but ever since bernie lost my i i don't come i wasn't on twitter for a long time i don't know any of this kind of stuff for me i was like okay we gotta try something else you know i mean this didn't work right it was obviously taken it was a pretty damn good effort and and it was taken um the left went to like aoc right after and [ __ ] like that and she's over here saying google play sensor like she's doing all that kind of stuff um what give me a couple your thoughts uh uh adam or ben whatever which everyone wants to go first on this for uh post left stuff i mean i'll i'll just say that uh like and i i i mean i [ __ ] i hate saying this i tweeted about this a couple days ago i hate like referring like i hate referring to the fact that i even have a twitter account in the first place that's the cringiest [ __ ] thing no no but i tweeted about this a couple days ago i said like the post left is not if you're going to uh categorize somebody by a label that they didn't come up with themselves then it's just a a means by which you uh kind of uh cheaply uh throw out their ideas right because none of us i don't know except for edwin aponti he kind of put the post left thing at the top of the bellows for like a week and then he was like oh [ __ ] what have i done right but um like i i don't know of anybody who identifies as a post-leftist it's not an organization it's not a uh even an ideological thing it's not uh like a political project it's just a bunch of people who happen to have been bunched together by the left who uh the left are kind of angry at because they don't conform to um any of their kind of um cultural or political or they don't conform to even some of their cultural and political kind of predispositions right so i mean like i said like you have everybody who are quote unquote under the post-left umbrella and i know this because i interact with them every day you have everybody from like catholic distributors to like um like uh economic nationalists to like even right-wing guys you have uh like really staunch marxists you have kind of left communists so this isn't even uh uh a political project it's not even an ideological project we have nothing in common really except for a critique of the left that's the only thing that all of us have in common so-called post-left and that's why they want to discredit us because at the end of the day they see somebody who are really not that far removed from them in some ways like honestly i would be fine with a leftist candidate if they were actually committed to a working-class kind of cause right but the fact is none of them exist so you have to look elsewhere right now right as we all were like a year ago with yeah you know it's basically yeah it's like yeah i i volunteered for bernie in [ __ ] march like i feel like a [ __ ] for that but it's like like this is not like i like i really like okay i mean the post-left thing i don't like identify as such i don't know anybody who sincerely does at this point in time it's not a coherent ideological project and what carl bazier um is doing is that he's saying that oh look at these kind of disparate group of writers and thinkers and um i don't know just twitter personalities really like if you look at a oh comey's like he doesn't really post about politics but he's still considered like a post leftist drew is the working class candidate true that's what i thought we were doing yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean um but like like it's not uh it's not a political thing so at the end of the day what carl beijer has to do is he has to uh kind of invent the specter for the left to rail against right because uh he sees a kind of ideological challenge right people who are saying no like you're wrong and you're dumb and you know like much of what you believe is just patently false and hasn't been proven by reality um so you have to invent a kind of uh easy and um kind of easily discreditable group to uh rail against right and that's what he's done basically with that article and but he's right about one thing which is like like where else are you going to get money like where else like all of the jacobinites all of the intercept guys they're funded by like pierre omidyar who um he's a billionaire but he he's kind of like a progressive billionaire right yeah and then like um you know like right-wing guys who i don't know if even even referred to any but like yeah obviously right-wing guys are gonna write for a right-wing journal like why the [ __ ] not um and they're obviously gonna be funded by the claremont institute or the coax or whatever right and i'm not saying those guys are post-left at all they're not even in this sphere they're neocons right but like what you're gonna i'm sorry you're like you're like i would happily write for like you know like adam just did like chris buskirk's american greatness because chris buskirk didn't make you cut anything out like you were able to you were able to express yourself as you wanted you didn't have to conform to his ideological green walls greenwald has to go on tucker carlson to to talk about anything exactly yeah yeah yeah because he's he's deviating from the pierre omidyar intercept line right so um i'm sorry like we're all inscribed like by the system of capital there is no true communist all of the communists are writing for publications that are funded by progressive billionaires and all of the conservatives are writing boxing people at capitol building yeah [ __ ] at the same time yeah at the same time busker paid me better than i've ever ever hello hello yeah and uh that's why carl mentioned that's why carl mentioned him yeah he's he does the work for free as adam says he's he does it for free he writes his jacobin articles for 12 dollars a pop all right you're angry don't get me wrong like i've writ i've written things for free especially like in the art world because there's no [ __ ] money in any of those places so i'm not like averse to that if you're trying to just get some ideas out there but the way i approached that whole thing was like oh here's an opportunity like you know here's an opportunity to build a bridge with people who might immediately just have like a like a visceral kind of guttural aversion to marxism or whatever and and here's an opportunity to be like no we're not all [ __ ] crazy goddamn aoc worshiping dsa morons you know there are people who are trying to think about politics and culture more coherently and like ben said um like i don't i i recently also published a thing for like a more sort of like left-leaning magazine and my piece got chopped up like a bunch which is fine but it didn't it i felt like it didn't even sound like me so at least postcard and i think buzzkirk too is also kind of like generally an estate who loves writing so he's like more open to just like letting you see like like like making a an attempt to hear what you're trying to say or whatever uh post left okay so i've never claimed it but you know we are like i don't want to deny the fact that we're all sort of like collaborators and friends on the internet sure like that's definitely true but as f like but there's so much like ideological like uh fluctuations in sort of the people that have been like like thrown into this kind of thing i mean one of ben and i's friends from the contain podcast he he like is like a trump supporter who thinks trump is the most authentic expression of marxism you have amy who's like who's like a more she's pretty much like a strict left-com and then you have more kind of like reform as soch stems but like we're all sort of like because it's it really is once you see it you just can't [ __ ] unsee it correct like once you understand that the left is part of this like vast patronage pipeline that serves a very specific function of like it's almost like whipping the votes and the support of people who might be temperamentally inclined to reject the two party or a bourgeois state but the left at the last moment is like democrats are evil joe biden's a reactionary [ __ ] brain dead [ __ ] also vote for him yeah that is kind of like yeah and that's kind of like how the disciplinarian uh measures of that work and i don't know i think what we're doing as like a collective or whatever is interesting i think we're all kind of producing good work and like we were talking about before if people calling me a [ __ ] on the internet i wouldn't be pleased with my work if it wasn't triggering people's visceral reactions and rage like that that's that's the point of what i'm trying to do that's what art that's what literature that's what theory should do is rewire the [ __ ] brain and challenge the person and good i'm challenging the people that i want to challenge and i hope if if like one out of a hundred reads that is like oh i don't think adam's a fascist i actually think this guy's uh decent whatever like or thinking about things in an interesting way then it's worth it let the rest of them say what they will do do you think you're striking a nerve a little bit with that adam like sometimes where people deny it like at first but you can tell maybe you might have you might have yeah i don't know it's like to me like seeing themselves in an unflattering angle like if i take a picture of myself and i'm like [ __ ] that sucks you know i mean like that's not a good angle this looks like [ __ ] i look like [ __ ] or something you know like but then i might be like delete that picture you know or just something like that do you think it's more so do you think that there's maybe do you think maybe these people aren't exactly rejecting it as more so they're just mad that they saw it they're projecting yeah you know it hurts to come face to face with something that means something to you and i'm empathetic to that to an extent you know tour i mean i got swept up into the bernie thing and i i still to this day think it was an important thing to support even though in retrospect it it seems like ridiculous that we ever thought like a bourgeois state would have bent to the will of a socialist president that's just not how this [ __ ] works but it was still worth supporting in that it was worth supporting in that bernie was sort of like rejecting intersectionalism and bringing class analysis back to mainstream discourse and i'm glad i fought for that for a few years even if i feel a little taken in by the whole thing but this is just people you know it means a lot to them their politics i get and they just don't want to they're just having a visceral reaction to being confronted with their own ideological limitations yeah i mean at the end of the day like um back to the whole like the left understanding the left as it exists not as it aspires right because as they exist the only utility they have for their kind of patrons and the reason why they're allowed to be kind of out in the open kind of as forthright as they are is because they always come back to the democrat plantation at the end of the day like if they didn't the only leverage that they have the only usefulness that they have to um not the only usefulness but like one of the aspects that they're useful to the kind of like progressive elites is that they do pull the lever for joe biden and they can be um you know counted on to do so you know like um bashkar sankara was writing new york times op-eds that said we'll accept biden readily because trump is a fascist right you know nathan j robinson you know pushing right he was he's the worst offender but i'm sorry like that you know like true leninist types are not that different from those people like at the end of the day it's it's really not that like these people aren't all that removed and the reason they're allowed to have so much kind of uh mainstream representation is because they serve a useful purpose for the progressive elites otherwise they'd be censored like the trump guys are exactly i wanted to ask you guys something uh and i'm willing to change my mind on this or whatever because because i've been thinking i've seen a lot of our like twitter sphere go let's talk about like say like the kyle kalinski's and the crystal balls and like those types who are for sure rad libs like i don't doubt that i don't i know who they are but is there any um is there any usefulness in them because they will be like i'm not going to vote for biden like klinsky was like i'm not going to perform friday or this whole forced the vote thing he's like yeah [ __ ] aoc like they are in that circle but they they do function as like pretty strong critiques of that and i'm not saying that there's something that they're not but is there is there any like usefulness in that you know what i'm saying from like the broader mainstream what people call the left like are they helping people get on wake up within this system basically and i've seen both arguments for both i kind of lean towards defending them in that context but again i'm willing to change my mind on this and maybe i'm just i don't know but yeah i think whatever usefulness they had has sort of outlived itself i think yeah i am sorry i um i think i think you know during a sanders presidential campaign to have like some sort of propaganda media apparatus out there to dispel like the non-stop smears that that man was faced with was useful but i think like i think a better example and i know people get upset because he tragically passed away this year but michael brooks and i i want to say this as like i think michael brooks was a very i mean i corresponded with him a little bit just a really lovely guy and smart yeah and he was i think towards the end shifting in his politics and i think he was trying to you know challenge sort of race reductionism etc but at the same time he has someone like ben dixon on his show all day yeah yeah so is he there's this thing is he forcing in a marxist class analysis into this reductive media sphere or is he legitimizing the reductive critiques of someone like ben dixon with like a light marxist analysis and i'm not sure which one is true but i am at the point now like i think that these people like the more idiosyncratic sort of left celebrities i think they're at a point now where they just legitimize the whole thing as a structure because there's a limitation to where it's always like i won't vote for the democrats i'm all the but the leftists are democrats and you're still propagandizing for them constantly yeah yeah yeah and and and what's by just getting to the post-left thing like i because we're cy and i are a bit different like we we where where i was was i got into twitter because we were gonna start this podcast um like earlier this year and i really got into like that field of twitter like the leftoids and i couldn't sort them out and i liked a lot of stuff from different people i've been following crk for like three years yeah i mean like no just like and even he you know he was never he wasn't the way he is now you know i mean but but i i just i was like i like what this guy's saying but then i might like something that a critic of him might say you know i'm not of him about him i'm just saying like they might have a different thing i'm like hey i kind of like that too but the the thing i found was interesting was we him and i are not allowed to have certain takes on the left that's what that was right that was and it's getting back to like oh greenwald's got to go on carlson to say what he just actually speak his mind and it's kind of that wait like him and i are like legit covet truthers like you are not allowed to be on the left that's the that's the thing you're not allowed to be you're considered a murderer and all that's up the same liberal talking points first of all like like that that are used against you um right and and like we're not too big on that covet vaccine and like whatever i'm just saying like yeah when i got to whatever this post-left thing is whatever that realm of twitter is i was allowed to have that take yeah yeah i don't need everyone to agree with me but they might have disagreed yeah and i allowed to have the allowed to have a take and still be friends and friendly with the people you disagree let me be me that's all i'm saying anything that lets me be me i can work within that that yeah you know yeah no absolutely i mean i think one thing that i admire about the kind of like uh 2000s anti-globalization left is that they saw the kind of koch brothers kind of consensus for what it was the kind of neocon consensus for what it was which was kind of this horrifying like um kind of you know big oil military industrial complex conglomerate of people who were um basically uh like uh forcing uh like a lot of you know billions and billions of dollars to to shape people's opinions in the kind of public uh mind the public sphere right and one thing that um i think is worth preserving is yeah like the koch brothers are still around neoconservatism is still a force even though it's not as powerful as it was maybe 10 years ago now when we're talking about the left we have to have the exact same analysis of it we have to have the understanding that um the left the kind of so-called like eco um the the the kind of like you know climate um uh you know climate uh what do you call it like activist kind of spheres are also financed by massive non-profits and sometimes you know even you know like um [ __ ] like i don't know solar panel like uh manufacturers and stuff like all everybody has like economic interest into the kind of ideas they want to put into the public sphere especially those with money and power right and so at the end of the day like i think the value of somebody like kalinsky i think maybe crystal ball less so because she's been kind of proven to be a little bit more careerist like five years ago she was like a hillary kind of democrat right um yeah but somebody with kalinski like yeah i i probably agree with him like 70 of the time like he you know i've been listening to him for years he was the first person yeah good intro it's a good idea yeah yeah yeah you don't know anything yeah in like 2013 i was like uh you know young impressionable kid i was like holy cow this guy makes a lot of [ __ ] sense right he got me into all of this right but at the same time like i think um we have to like understand these people um by like the degree of separation they have to the power centers and you know somebody like uh kyle kolinsky and crystal ball like i'm not saying they are kind of in the tyt orbit but they still are loosely affiliated right um you know somebody like anna kasparian regularly kind of um you know like like uh like you know goes on their show and whatnot all of this kind of thing this overlap right and so i think like yeah that you like you can you can agree with them like by all means and that's one thing that i really like about our sphere whatever like like you guys were saying like there is a strong commitment to kind of freedom of speech and expression and thought and a real kind of emphasis on generative thinking like we're not using old ideological dogmas we're trying to push for a new kind of understanding and one thing that um i think is really necessary is that kind of greenwald carlson uh kind of overlap that kind of syncretism right like i'm really a fan of this idea of syncretism where you take two disparate ideological things and blend them together and see how it plays out because we do need something generative like i'm i don't know i i like i find a lot of use in somebody like kolinsky's analysis but when i kind of look deeper i find that like the degree of separation he has from the kind of left as an institution as a kind of force in the kind of um hegemony manufacturing sphere is not that far like he affiliates with him yeah and i can very pedestrian yeah yeah i can agree with a lot of what he's saying with also like you know and also recognize that he plays a role for them and he um you know he does his job and at the end of the day like yeah like he he's not that all you know all that far removed but what i am interested in is a kind of syncretism like a weird kind of crossover between dissident right and dissident left and seeing where we can go with that like i'm not saying i'm not this is not some kind of third positionist fascist appeal okay people are going to be like oh this is this is what fascism was all about right no but like just like look beyond like ideological boundaries and barriers that these people put up like just look beyond that and try to think of something um that kind of challenges the the hegemony of both like you know emerging progressive left but also um old kind of neoconservative right and you'll find some interesting stuff i mean i think there's a really easy way to kind of illustrate this dynamic here what is the most heinous abuse of power and corruption against freedom of expression and thought these days well clearly it's the kafka-esque treatment of julian assange waiting for extradition hello absolutely yeah who are the only mainstream institutionalized media figures certainly on the right and to a less extent on the left talking about the [ __ ] disgusting thing that is happening to julian assange right [ __ ] now it's tucker carlson and it's [ __ ] glenn greenwald yep so meanwhile and this is what's so scary about the left is i would say like 90 of them are people who just like watch the young turks and [ __ ] like as far as like the young left jankuger and anna kasparian were on their [ __ ] show i i i've been watching jimmy dore recently because i think he's like fantastic doing something strategically interesting he's based yes yeah yeah and he was showing a clip of jank uh and anna talking like basically regurgitating security state propaganda about assange's political allegiances aoc the same thing it's the exact same thing this is this is very like this is as disturbing as anything because this should be something any sort of left political project committed to emancipation of the [ __ ] people yeah should be like uniting behind a free assange campaign right now yeah yeah i mean that's really like something symbolic that's what i thought it was that's what i thought and when i jumped in i was like cool we're anti-authoritarian we're pro free speech we're this but we want health care we want this we want that that's what i thought this was yeah and then all of a sudden you get in there and they're like at the minute bernie lost the minute bernie lost and i and i we we started this party we had like three listeners dude at the time yeah and some of them had the same last name as me i think but like like when it happened we saw our first episode was super tuesday and like super tuesday he got [ __ ] killed you know i mean yeah yeah in my head and he was a little bit more optimistic i was kind of like dude it's done yeah i mean i was like you pulled me out yeah he's [ __ ] torched like the whole thing was the left you know and matt christman's going no they're they're not ready for this they're gonna [ __ ] do this and it's gonna be like the wizard christmas yeah yeah this is like episode 39 of star trek yeah and so when they when that happened i was like this is done okay this is done and then but i'm like okay what's next right what's next was jk rowling's transphobic i'm like jesus christ this is next you know what i mean i'm not good i'm not saying that that's nothing i'm just saying like come on you know what i mean like we you're like there's literal like people who are basically protecting our liberties that are in jail like like just just you know assange and all that stuff and i don't know man like i thought that's what this was and i was that's probably naive of me i wasn't online for a long time so like i i didn't understand what that was but i was like man i'm not i'm not so much post left as the left doesn't value what i want to say yeah exactly that's that's all it is like i couldn't i couldn't i could read carl's thing and be like all right carl i'm ready to be on the left and then i say what i what's on my mind you're not on the left yeah okay yeah all right you're post left yeah yeah all right well that's what glenn greenwald he just sums it up he's just he's like it's basically just a political realignment that's happening that everyone is ignoring or everyone in the mainstream uh yeah kind of thing is ignoring yeah i mean yeah like to me anybody who calls the kind of like technocratic like uh surveillance state for what it is is a friend like i i really don't i don't care if they call themselves a [ __ ] libertarian for christ's sake as long as we can as long as we can like agree on the very basic fact that like this is an erosion of like human freedom that's more palatable and that's more palatable to somebody like who doesn't know anything that you can tell that that might be like hey this is what we want okay we want higher wages whenever we want all this kind of stuff we're going to try to seize the means of production it might not happen but we're going to higher wages yeah we're going to do that instead of just as [ __ ] here's das capital [ __ ] throwing right yeah yeah i mean one of the one of the things that i'm so kind of [ __ ] tired of is the rejection uh on the part of leftists but also on the part of some ideological ritus the annoying rejection of any kind of electoral politics or any kind of incrementalism because these people are trying to play kind of uh playpen revolutionaries right they they want to be kind of like oh you know like say all of the fiery incendiary things without any of the kind of costs that comes with that which is you know ordinary people start to lose interest because ordinary people don't want a [ __ ] revolution they want a decent life they they just want higher wages they want health care they want all these things right like like and then they'd accuse me of essentializing ordinary people which i like i've gotten into some disagreements with people about this big time it's like no like maybe uh this kind of compulsive radicalism is called compulsive revolutionary thing in fact takes you further from power takes you further from um a good reception in the public eye takes you further from ordinary people's interests and maybe you can make a more reasoned appeal to people that um does uh kind of meet them where they are rather than meet them where you want them to be right straight up um just like basic like i i know malcolm shayna he's brilliant about this like he's actually like he's not like in power per se but he works for a think tank that's affiliated with one of the kind of emerging parties in sweden a kind of non-denominational populist party and he like he knows like what it means to have some kind of foothold in the state and he's like no like this is way more like simple and bureaucratic than you think but it's also um you know way easier than you think right because the leftists have like you know they're trusting the plan but they're trusting the plan of das capital from 200 you know well not 200 years ago but like you know 150 years ago it's just it's not going to work like it like like look beyond that like have a sense of like uh perspective in the present day you don't need to be like i mean back to like what i was saying with the kind of like subcultural thing like they they're also escapists they're they're ideological escapists they live in a fantasy land where the soviet union still exists in the form of china in the form of [ __ ] totalitarian china china yeah you know she you know emperor she is based it's like no dude like you wouldn't even be able to say that i don't know excuse me you're going to jail yeah exactly yeah you know ben and i ben and i sort of coined the i mean it's one of the things like that we're clearly kind of being like [ __ ] posty and jokey about but like our haters will just instantly say what we're morons for for saying is our little like we describe our podcast ideology is data populism and and we're referencing dataism of course but really what i take that phrase to mean is a sort of broad-based populism that embraces creativity that can stay loose that can respond to the world and reta real time and re-contextualize it uh and create some new ideas you know that's all we're [ __ ] trying to do straight up yeah i also was thinking about something else about assange oh yeah uh just to throw this out there when i first started the show and i i kind of consider the show starting when ben came on because it like hadn't i started it a little before but it hadn't really coalesced and i i needed him as a it's tough it's tough by yourself yeah yeah it's tough um but the original kind of like concept of it was to explore this contradiction because you know i'm whatever i'm a hipster what they say is true i'm a hipster douchebag from the new york art world so um and i was exploring the contradiction between the fact that these people in the art world who all read truth butler and get like really kind of brain warped on intersectional theory and gender theory and [ __ ] also we're calling julian assange the most arguably one of the most courageous figures for truth and justice in our lifetimes they were calling him a fascist because he leaked true documents about the dnc wow yeah just like traders at the capitol and then this one and then and then at the same time these people who will cancel anybody or just like destroy their lives and careers for saying something like oh i think it's more important that i think people need a basic living standard regardless of their race more than they need symbolic representation in the media so the same people who are so hardcore about their like politics and i'm gonna [ __ ] destroy anyone who i'm gonna destroy anyone who questions these ideas they were like during the primary they're like oh i love buddha judge now i love they have they have no politics so that was kind of like what i was what i what i wanted to explore but the way it's evolved is i've i've come to understand that it's not just like intersectional libtartery that that goes there but it's it's the left as well and the left is like an equally part of that sort of top-down structure absolutely yeah and yeah so yeah it's great oh that's that's that's great and uh no i i mean i think that's a good stopping point for us because i i i could talk to you guys all day but uh there's one i have one thing i want to talk about completely off topic from what we've talked about thus far uh directed at adam one thing one thing i feel connected with you on uh that i had never heard this take before and i was i think people were scared to have it you and i both don't get musically kamazi washington i was like i was i saw yeah i was like yeah yeah i was like i do not i've tried i've like i and everyone's like he's great and i'm like i just don't get it man i'm like mozzie washington is taking a very rich history he i mean he's taking a bit i mean i i used to be in the noise scene and there was some overlap with free jazz and [ __ ] like that so i love albert eiler and sun raw and yeah yeah but kamazi washington is literally jazz made for arcade fire friends like kind of college no wonder my mom likes it yeah [Laughter] like these college kids they're like college kids who like read pictures i think what they have to take seriously yeah and like it's not made for like people that are actually interested in experimental music or yeah no 100 yeah i actually have like like i have friends who are kind of going to college for jazz right now and they're obsessed with yeah i'm sure you guys have heard of snarky puppy too like yeah kind of like ground up like you know new fusion scene right all of these guys and like it's like you know i like i can't say i hate the music per se but i really don't like there's nothing revolutionary there it's a kind of like it's like like it's like taking like all of their favorite elements from like i don't know like latin music and middle eastern music uh and african music and just putting them together into like this like gentrified blob and then like oh this is like new and cool it's like this is not new or cool at all like i don't know listen to like [ __ ] brew if you want something jelly and kind of like transgressive yeah i don't know yeah it's like some just yeah yeah yeah and uh it's and i will say like i i do think because like i know kamazee washington's part of like that la circle that does include artists i do you respect you know like there's final flylas in there and thundercat and stuff i think are good and same with snarky puppy like corey henry is one of my favorite yeah yeah yeah i saw him live i saw him his first show with um the funk apostles i saw them oh yeah 15 yeah oh wow that was that was before i knew knew about him yeah but yeah just specifically kamazi i was and i saw you tweet that and i was just like i was like i've never seen that take in the flesh and i was like thank god right i thought it was crazy i mean after i got fired from the quietest i was like really ready to just say let's go yeah shitty music broke the chains yeah man well i really appreciate you guys coming by man um so uh go ahead uh each of you plug everything you got going twitter handles uh plug the podcast as well uh both you guys go ahead yeah i um yeah so my handle is uh at underscore self optimizer adam and i are the co-hosts of system of systems which you can listen to on patreon and soundcloud and yeah thank you guys so much for for having us this was fun this is a we'll have to get you we'll have to get you guys on our podcast i would love to i'm uh i'm a shameless self-promoter it's going to be 10 minutes do it i'm going to narrow it down to i'm gonna narrow it down to a couple things but i do have like a shitload of projects right now yeah anyways i got another essay coming out on the a croatian art duo called tarwook which will be published on cesura magazine in the next couple of weeks um it'll also deal with themes of human extinction which will be fun and i am i have a i'm working on a book right now which is due in may and i want to start generating some buzz there so i could go fill out the first edition yeah right on okay we'll come back come back on in may too so and uh and once or whenever that's getting ready whenever you're doing the uh the tour the public you know the pr tour for that so i mean it's a tiny ass publishing company whatever touring i do it'll probably be on my own yeah i mean yeah it sounds good all right um yeah and well i guess for us if this is your first time listening to us if you're a system of a system fan thanks for uh listening to us the first time i'm at glenn rocney he's at crypto psy that's crypto psi um this is at rarecandypod1 um yeah no thanks again guys it's a great conversation thank you so much thank you yeah perfect all right guys", "DbR0uILCLFQ": "please pause the video and reread the question if you haven't done so already in part a our task is to draw a force diagram for the beam so we'll go ahead and do that now because there is a bear standing on the beam the weight of the bear is going to press down on the beam the beam itself has its own weight which acts right at the center we have a basket of goodies hanging down and so there's a weight there as well there's a tension force that's pulling upward to try to counteract these downward forces and then over here it turns out there are two forces the question itself gives us a hint as to that it asks us in Part B to find the components of the force exerted by the wall on the left end of the beam so the wall is actually exerting forces over here and it turns out that these forces are acting this way and also upward and if that's hard to fathom just keep this in mind the beam is being pushed into the wall so the wall actually will push back to the right on the beam and then also the beam is trying to slip down the wall and as a result the wall perhaps through friction will be pointing upward will be pointing a force upward excuse me so here we have it we should probably label all these forces but there are numerical values when given and then we might call this H for a horizontal force and V for a vertical force in Part A is complete in Part B the first question asks us to find the tension in the wire that's supporting the beam and it turns out in order to do that we're going to use the concept that the sum of the torques is equal to zero now this basically means or this basically applies when an object is not rotating and so certainly the beam here is not rotating so therefore the sum of the torques will equal zero now the formula for torque is equal to a force times a distance times the sine of an angle and to get a better understanding of what's going on here we're going to have to choose what we call a pivot point and a pivot point is best selected on the object so in this case it's the beam and you want to position the pivot at the point through which the greatest number of on forces passes I'll say that again you want to place the pivot on the beam at a point through which the greatest number of unknown forces is passing now notice right here there are two unknown forces passing through that point H and V and therefore it would be the best choice to put the pivot there the reason we do that is because those two unknown forces will produce no torque through that pivot point so we can ignore them in the formula a couple of other points to note is that all three of the downward acting forces are producing negative tortes and the reason for that is because they're trying to pull the beam in a clockwise fashion and clockwise in physics is negative and the tension on the other hand is trying to rotate the beam in the anti-clockwise direction and as a result that torque for that force will be positive now that we've settled those points let's go ahead and fill in the information into the torque equation using F times D times sine of theta remember that D will be the distance from the pivot to each force so all of these distances here will be the DS when we plug them into the formula and we might as well go ahead and label them so this was one meter this was three meters and this was six meters so here it is just notice that each term in the equation is an F times a D times the sine of theta and I want to point out that most of the Thetas are ninety degrees you can see them right there the reason is that those forces that are acting downward are acting perpendicular to the beam and so their angles are 90 degrees on the other hand this force the tension force is acting at a 60-degree angle which was actually stated in the problem so if you look at this formula carefully you'll notice you have only one unknown and that's T so we can go ahead and solve for T and when doing so you should get 343 Newtons if you have any questions about that algebra please let me know in the comments now Part B still wants us to find other things it wants us to find the force components exerted by the wall so in other words we have to find H and V let's start with H which is acting in the horizontal direction and in order to solve for H we're going to use the idea that the sum of the forces in the horizontal direction or X Direction is equal to zero so we're gonna go ahead and plug in those forces we only have a couple of forces in the horizontal direction we have h which is pointing to the right and is therefore positive and then we have the X component of the tension recall that the tension can be broken up into components you have an X component pointing to the left and then a Y component is pointing upward we just want the X component for the current analysis here and that would be the tension times the cosine of 60 because it's pointing to the left we have to make sure we make that negative so it's minus tension cosine 60 but we just found the tension in the previous question so we can actually go ahead and plug in the tension that we had found and then we can easily solve for this H force it turns out to be 172 Newtons and it's pointing to the right of course now to find the V Force which is also what Part B wants we're going to do a similar analysis except we'll apply this Newton's second law in the Y direction now there are many more forces acting in the Y that in the ax and we can see that there are three downward forces so those will all be negative we have the upward V Force so that'll be positive and then we have the Y component of the tension and that's pointing upward and so that two will be positive and that'll be T sine of 60 now again we know T so why don't we actually just back up and plug in T we found it earlier to be 343 and then we have sine of 60 and that's set equal to zero so we have only one known once again and we can solve for it that turns out to be 683 Newtons upward and Part B is complete now in Part C of the question we're actually being told that the tension is 900 Newtons it's not an unknown unlike it was in Part B but what is unknown is the distance that the bear is traveling so basically we're going to be using the same Freebody diagram except that this time the tension is known to be 900 Newtons and the distance that the bear is walking out is unknown so we'll just call that axe otherwise the diagram is the same and we can use the same analysis that we did in Part B that the sum of the torques is equal to zero keeping the pivot at this point right here because that's the point through which the greatest number of unknown forces passes so we're basically setting up the same torque formula we're just having different values plugged in for a couple turns so let's go ahead and set that up notice once again that most of the torques are negative it's because those downward forces are trying to rotate the beam in a clockwise fashion also note that we have just one variable to solve for its X so we can go ahead and do so and we get five point one four meters so that would be the distance that the bear could walk out", "KdPEwlJCfyQ": "hey guys today's video is going to be my July candy club I just got my candy club in the mail the other day and I'm very very excited to share with you guys this month Kennie club because my membership has been tweaked a little bit so candy Club just launched this new feature on their membership where you can actually pick the three types of candy jars that you guys want delivered for that month which is freakin amazing I can't even imagine like when I started this membership the candy club my first time doing candy Club was back in February and every month I've been giving you guys a new candy Club video where I get the three surprise jar in the mail so the membership that I originally had was the Sowers Club and it basically they send me three random jars of star candy every month I didn't know what the candy was on their website they have this list of they tell you every single different type of candy that they provide in their service but their membership was random so you didn't really get to choose which kind of candy you wanted each month I absolutely loved that I thought that was such a fun feature of the membership of candy Club but now that you are able to actually pick the three kinds of candy that you want is just mind-blowing to me I'm absolutely obsessed with that feature because I was looking at their website all the time I would always be like I hope I get that candy or it would be nice to try that candy and now that I can actually customize my three jars of candy that I want each month it's just amazing I can't even tell you guys how cool that is and I absolutely love that service so now if you are new to candy club and you are signing up for the membership you have the option to either choose to have them pick the three different types of jar of candy or you can actually pick three types of jars of candy the candy they don't just have style candy they have sweet candy and they also have chocolate candy so it depends on what kind of candy you guys like you guys can't take the little quiz for free I always link it in the description bar below their website you go to their website if you're not a member you can actually take the little quiz and it gives you like a little question to determine what kind of candy you want what kind of service is perfect for you and if you want to just go ahead and pick your you guys can go and do that which is what I did for this month so I have my candy inside this box I'm trying to unbox it for you guys and show you guys types of candy that I got ok so I open the box and this is what it looks like as usual the candy comes wrapped in foil protected inside has three jars and the free candy that is in the month so I'm gonna go ahead and start out with the free candies that are inside my box so they're all individual wrap pieces of chains for this month and I got this little I don't know this is called ok so inside this little plastic envelope is cards with the three time can you guys I got for this month including the free candy right here they're called the Primrose assorted honey filled candies this unique candy features an assortment of citrus flavors and as an added tree is filled with a sweet and soothing burst of luscious honey honey inside the candy I'm being dead serious right now I have never tried honey in my life I'm so scared I don't even know if I want to try this for you guys have I tried honey I seriously have never tried honey my life actually I take that back what doesn't account honey bunches of oats the cereal I'm so scared like I don't even know what honey tastes like you guys I'm scared she's like a cough drop okay I have my coke here next to me so in case something goes wrong I'm literally just gonna douse my coat down okay so far it's good kind of just tastes like a cheery like cough drop I have to I just got to bite and just get it over with I don't know if I can taste it you guys I'm so scared I don't taste it just honey just not have that flavor well wasn't that scary as I thought it was gonna be but I leathery still have no mouth huh these pieces are huge well maybe I can't taste on you because of the red flavor try thank you for me these are hard as hell I'm everyone I guess it wasn't not bad have you guys had honey before I mean is it a literally no flavor to honey I guess that's why when I said I've only had honey bunches of oats but that doesn't really count because you don't really taste anything so I guess honey just does not have flavor so it really wasn't as bad as I thought I thought wasn't like bite into it and there's gonna be all this like gooey honey miss inside it but there literally is like nothing inside the candy that I could taste so that wasn't that bad I take all of my little crazy reaction yeah okay so now it's at the fun part oh you guys when I said that I would be able to pick my candy you guys probably saw the jar yes girl Tom freaking threw sour belt I told you guys that don't play like when I got my membership I won I want every freaking jar to be sour both now that I had the option like hopefully I mean I'm gonna try to switch it up you guys - you guys don't I watch every video in years old tower bells again come on like seriously I was obsessed I think I only had our belt one time I don't even remember what flavor it was so let me just want to tell you guys this first so these ones are the door balls our power wild cherry bells so these are a wild cherry flavored oh my god I can't wait to open jar it's gonna be freakin amazing let's not break a nail girl okay I can't I can't oh man it smells so good you guys freakin late for sour belts bury me in sour belts I'm so excited my mouth was like literally can't even handle this right now okay so watch it what flavor is this cherry wild cherry let's try this mmm Oh bless america that is so good you guys if you have never had sour belts I mean I don't even know what you're doing with like you're not living life because this is life it's so good and too ridiculous you guys these are freaking amazing so good yeah I mean what you guys I just had every month sour sour bell you're probably like unsubscribe okay well let's try the next one can you guys guess what it is ah another sour belt so these ones are the door falls our power Quatro bells so these ones are different from the other ones because they're rainbow and I see to have like five flavors so let's see yeah a sour knockout strawberry green apple blue raspberry and tutti fruity flavors will definitely go all 12 rounds come on I mean five flavors was it five out of all four flavors oh my god this smells better than yeah it's much better than that last one I mean I can't can we just have a fragrance I mean why there are so many fragrances out there in the beauty market and why has nobody tried to do a fragrance that smells like candy or just our belts oh my god girls stop okay let's try this one it's just gonna be freaking wild I honestly can you literally taste oh my god this is our you literally tastes like five flavors it's so good I mean look at this I mean my dentists is just gonna love me so done I can have candy for breakfast lunch dinner deserve to a.m. snack that's just amazing I can't okay and then the last one you guys this one was a surprise for me so these ones you guys can see what they look like these are called the Garrett's gummy pink Cadillac saw go ahead and read you guys the description first I assume they're little cars okay they are super sweet natural mixed fruit flavored gummies will take you on a sweet ride back to the Nifty 50s flavor notes of cherry currant and strawberry made in Holland so on the website when I said that I would everything like I actually picked a different candy and they sent me this one so that was surprising to me but at the same time I'm excited to try this this candy because I literally would have never picked this Kenya anyways so let's see what it smells like there's no scent to this one so that's kind of that's exciting I'm gonna be something crazy when I try it it says that flavor notes of cherry current strawberry I don't know what current am i smelling am I saying all right Kurt Koran see you are our ANC Lord knows what that is but alright let's see so they're literally like little gummy worms that they look like they're supposed to be cars they look like the dinosaurs to me I mean alligators literally doesn't like anything so as they're gonna get all three flavors in one Oh God I think that's the current flavor what is current oh that's just like a spice or something I hope this is cherry just like no flavor to this weird hmm hmm yes okay clearly I did not pick this one for a reason I don't understand this is their like cherry Kurt and strawberry all in one it says it will take you on a sweet ride back to the Nifty 50s god I was not born in the Nifty fifties because that's what the candy tastes like I mean is this darker and it's so weird okay so yeah they're different flavors this one that's clearly darker than this one yeah see that this is light and this is dark did I just eat I'm gonna try one more hmm oh my god no I'm so sorry you guys you guys probably that's so gross oh that's so nasty I can't I don't know I'm gonna give these to my other you maybe don't like them you guys do nasty - what is this that is not taste like candy you guys that tastes like medicine that my mom made me because I didn't have a sticker so I can't yeah so so far the last candy was a bust I literally never had a candy from candy glob yeah that I did not like him this was just not my cup of tea so I wish I would have gotten the other one that I wanted for this month but I didn't get that so next month in August I'm gonna stick with my membership where I could pick the kids that I want because I really like that um feature and I really like all the candies that they have on their website so I'm going to try to get new candies every time that I've never tried before I can't guarantee that it's gonna be a lot of belts coming up because that's my favorite candy and I just absolutely love them so overall I'm obsessed with two-thirds of the candy that I got this month I do actually like the free ones as well but I'm really glad that candy club is letting me now pick the candy that I want every month clearly I have never canceled my membership since February when I signed up I signed up for a year membership because I knew that I was just gonna be obsessed regardless every single month and Kenneth my life it's my I breed candy ish everything about I eat all the time very popular at my dentist like I mentioned earlier and I just absolutely love it so thank you so much for watching this July candy club video and I'll see you guys all next month", "9-Cu5axqy38": "what's up guys today we are going to be making some nerds rope and we melted some gummy bears we got color red orange and yellow white and green so for the first step we need nerds and we need and what you want to do next is grab one of your gummy bears i mean your your melted gummy bears which it was in there for like 20 seconds and what you want to do is you want to like make into a straight line it's probably not the best but make into a straight line and then once it's in a straight line you just want to coat it put your hands here with your hands this is messy it should be messy that's how it should be just coat it now we flip it around i guess yeah you flip it around and then you add more oh just like yeah this i can help this is just getting all over my hands this is like slime these are like the pomades these are this is like slime they're like the homemade this is this is so sticky go you wanna just keep putting it [Music] [Music] [Music] go this is more like a slime no drop i didn't think this was a success all right let's try to do the red one i mean not the red one green green this is hear that crunch you're still eating okay this is way too sticky okay all right okay i'm gonna put mine right there i'll grab okay now we're gonna try here's your messy the green one so we just want to grab the green one out of here sticky slime already we haven't even added anything yet you should just add [Music] i feel all right i'm all done with my green one now i'm going to start doing the yellow one isn't that yellow yeah this is the yellow one i already did the green one nerds that's it it gets messy so if you like being messy i guess so yeah we're technically always messy this looks real pretty this looks pretty good well guys i'm done with mine and oh it's so hard let's try them should we try i'm going to i'm going to try this one see here's the yellow one can you describe your flavor this tastes like pineapple oh tastes really good i don't really know how to describe the yellow one because they're mixed so that's gonna wrap it up for today um we done strokes i don't know what you should do next comment down below and we'll see you bye", "BlURVlo8USY": "Please subscribe, like, and click the bell icon\u2665 Rainbow dessert party!

up YouTube lazy llama here and if we are playing some candy box - this game has been requested and a dozen times I don't really know what it's about it looks kind of dumb but I'm judging it big time let's I was told the same of a bunch and yeah they throw them like ground and I was told not to eat them at first I did not know what this was and this just came up right as I was starting the video so let's throw these on the ground you threw ten candies on the ground okay so things are happening I was told it's weird start exchanging faces it's getting more upset and more upset about a hundred still nothing happening I'm gonna try this button because I wasn't told with this did I was told that this is like used for later on I guess like you need like health and stuff in this game and I believe eating them is what give you health I do think I need like a ton of candy so I'm probably gonna like cut out for a bit what to say but I do wanna see what this does oh you'd like to stat bar above of course another four five candies a convict oh okay I don't know if this game saves so I'm hoping it does I don't know if we'll beat this game I know there is an end oh just keep getting oh there's a Save button cool save on slot one cool there's more there's our health I think eating candies gives you health I'm pretty sure finally the last request 10kgs just be worth it the map okay so we have a map I can't go anywhere these ones light up locked house can't go there shop hello welcome to the candy merchant would you like anything you need okay what's the shop oh is buy talk about for 800 candies what does the chocolate do being in these four lollipops 460 okay don't know the point of that leather locked house if you have to forge a house a house let's go to the forge first the blacksmith's I can set various weapons and equipment so you click on weapons now Oh buy wooden sword 400 at the canyons I don't think we need that yet in this house oh you can open it up alright I just stole a lollipop can I do anything of the fire no this is definitely not gonna be a game for everyone again I don't even know if it's for me yeah Oh went up here too so I'm looking for my box I guess I can open this drawer I guess back to village check out this house he's got a cellar hello the cellars full of rats and I need to get rid of them only somebody would help me with what I guess she probably bio weapon can I go down there I can't probably come back with a weapon um I guess just keep throwing candies on the ground I don't know how many need to do but I know you're supposed to do certain amount of them alright so nothing seems to be happening I am probably gonna end up looking at I don't know if there's a wiki for this game but I'm assuming there is I'm probably gonna end up cheating and looking at the wiki cuz I do wanna make this a shorter series only a couple episodes is what I'm aiming for so we'll see how that actually plans out but uh anyways I'm gonna hold out like candy save a bit I'll probably come back honestly I've got a couple other things to go record and do so I'll probably do those and I'll come back and hopefully well bid to make some progress because we've got 200k knees on the ground so that's the goal alright so I've decided against waiting to save up to like getting a thousand or whatever we're gonna go buy this stupid sword oh we can buy it iron axe for more let's see if we can do this how do I do it um Oh inventory weapon sword map let's go I got to do anything was it us fighting a rats oh my god that's awesome it's like an old text-based game like I mean I assumed but like this is like an old style of video game like back in the day like way back we found candies down here I don't know yeah we should live right that's the end of the that's right yeah we should beat this cool I think we've got it our health can low I don't know how if we have to heal up by eating candies or what we do it nice you get it candies you man just kill the rats exit keep what you found boom thank you for getting rid of them here's something very precious word the map or the world map I think you use more than I do yeah Oh Oh God oh geez where we appear is it the castle thing Oh No the village okay um well it's gonna go lonely house oh god this is oh god no is where I lose open the box it's locked break the lock the lock resists shake the box nothing happens kick the box your foot hurts a little bit nothing happens asked about so you're talking a box what was that there was a box of candy take the box with you probably eat Oh anyway okay alright now we we go in a box all right so that's our inventory can we do anything else in here which have the world map alright nothing crazy we almost have enough money for the new weapon which I don't know if we need I can throw candies on the ground there's gotta be something else maybe on the map - I can go explore I don't know what that is that the base tower like the big Tower ooh one of the trees we can go to um alright there's a little squirrel that's really good art that's actually really cool oh my god that's awesome hello I'm the squirrel I come variety of candies lots of knowledge knowing things better okay blah blah blah blah how can I help you I ask you a question if you answer correctly sweets to be yours first one do you really love Candy's answer in English I'm assuming yes that's right look at that you're 20 cans candies and for you to complete a sequence of letters and you get a new reward oh god I can unscramble or why is our question mark is that part of the sequence this was me more I don't know what it wants a sequence of letters what [Music] yeah I don't know what it wants to be completely honest with you it doesn't really make too much sense can go to the desert I'm into the desert palm trees oh my god these things obliterate us all there's no way there's no way we do that and I'm assuming to go anywhere else we need to go through that yeah I can't click on any of this other stuff all right well we've got to forget that sequence of letters which I'm assuming we're stuck on yeah I have no idea what guy said ah probably gonna look look that up cuz I don't feel like doing that you should could it be completely honest I hope that doesn't ruin it for people what is this that's new a ring first time that's all these are new - there's boots made of camel other keep your feet warm pair of gloves oh there's tons of stuff in here - by now well we can buy the new weapon let's do it cool so now we've got that is Paul ship with mm how long does this want you to go idle for can we go in any of these now um all right well can we destroy them now we probably need like the leather and stuff I don't really wanna know what happens if I die I'm just gonna see if I can see how many of these there are yeah we gonna get destroyed two of them it's more about half our health and those are these slowly regens okay um again I don't really know what this one's for me s II it's not on an unscramble oh it's a sequence oh I think you're supposed that like finish other letters on the end runner of it's one letter there's like a ton of space here like it wants multiple letters question mark and then it but it doesn't show how many it's looking for or and I don't even know what it would be anyways I don't know if it's me being I get it it's candies backwards it took me a second yep there it is one hundred candies cheese okay still I've been kind to go looking in anything up yet how many are there Jesus I'm bad at this step is off how many candies is one does the candy one hmm candy is person in the world possess what they spent my candies or is it the number 100 because it gave me a hundred no that's not it let's try what we have three student oh that's not three let's do it at 320 and when we talk 320 the head under I'm curious if it's like what we have yep that was an easy one next word should be even more inches that's 500 kgs here's a little riddle and an ancient force grows a very old tree on which live most intelligent animal animals on which ok so like a squirrel probably in the world it is said that this tree has 60 roots 360 branches oh God a ton of leaves basically how many marks what how many marks can you find it struck how am I supposed to know that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 let's try it nope I don't know that one I I think it's supposed to be like not an actual math question but I don't know I was thinking maybe it was like all them I don't know if it's individual ones but I'm not counting that um give me a minute alright so I was on the perfect like track of that it is talking about the squirrel and him on the tree and it says how many are on the on the trunk and still I would have only counted at 9 which is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 oh sorry 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 oh yeah 9 10 I think it was there when I saw it that's what it looked like yeah cuz I couldn't see I didn't I don't know maybe I wouldn't have counted that one but anyways there are ten markings here and that is the actual answer I didn't like what the next answer was so on the wiki it's actually like blacked out so you have to like highlight it to see which is school so we can try this one legit or probably end up looking it anyways we're gonna do this whole thing like I said I'm not dilly dallying with this game or anything so congratulations I was talking about my tree indeed there are three lollipops for you oh so I have five lollipops in total now make sure you make good use of them I don't know what they're for but okay the riddle listen carefully under a full moon I throw a yellow hat into the Red Sea to the Red Sea what happened to hat please it's gonna make perfect like I'm gonna get wet under a full moon through a yellow hat into a Red Sea did what I hate these type of things riddles are not my thing I'm not a big fan of riddles under a full moon I threw a yellow hat into the Red Sea oh it got wet I know it's not the answer but I'm gonna look it up again alright I'm kind of upset because once again I was basically right on there it said either the floats or it says wet instead of got wet I'm really aggravated because I had it I literally said got wet but it was just the word wet what happened to the other hat wet it doesn't really make sense I said got wet because it makes sense I don't know I feel like it should have give it to me but obviously they can't program everything into accepting so I mean I had it you can't blame me I had it I've done fine on this reel so far I've had the idea for everything so far we've been good that wasn't too hard here are three chocolate bars for you okay I don't know if those do but they're like eight hundred a piece so that's a lot for the next award we'll change the rules a little bit you'll have to play game with me are you ready sure AM the game is tic-tac-toe we played on a 3x3 game board we will use the X sign I'll use the O's we replace their signs eternally the goal is to get three in a row I'll let you go first do I mean all right we could probably beat it now it knows it's gonna counter anything we do I knows how to win all right I have one idea here this is actually a trick that I've actually it's a little riddle I've done to people and it's playing outside the box and yeah it worked yep think outside the box that's like the whole like trick of the whole thing like that's like one of that's like one of my favorite things they do to people it's like it's not exactly tic-tac-toe and I'm not gonna explain in this video but it's the idea of think outside the box as you're trying to do something inside of a small box so you literally say that in part of the riddle and you basically have to use outside of the box to do it it's it's a slightly different than take like oh that's cheat see anyways we win sadly no more challenges thanks for playing blah blah but but but all that was it what do we get the third house key which allows you to enter the third house in the village oh let's go do that actually what we're gonna do before we go check out the house we're gonna wrap this video up guys I'm gonna keep playing because I'm like in it so I'm not gonna let things accumulate anymore we're gonna go check this house out and see what is up", "7E71_IYhPGc": "hey guys welcome to hot box

stay saucy thank good to be monday let's get high see y'all next time skittle smack", "c1pWPeoQVls": "hi everyone well today I'm gonna show you how to set up your brand-new rod good on you for buying one I say so we're gonna set this up so you need to put the p2 pieces together first of all and make sure that they these bottom bits line up with these other top bits make sure these are nice in line so this right here is built for a 3 to 5 kilo sort of weight on it so the line that I've got here is a 4 kilo line because you want the line to break before the rod breaks so make sure you do that now I've got another rod here now this is a different ride I've got here it's got 300 meters or 300 yards of line on it this reel here is a lot smaller than the other one so I'll only need 150 metres a line on this one so to start with we'll grab the end of our fishing rod here and we'll stick the line through and we'll work our way all the way down the rod until we get to the bottom and then we need to tie off on here with the line so now you've got the line towards the end of the reel here you can either flick this up before you tie the knot or just go underneath yeah I'll just flick this up then I'll tie the knot I just like you doing the left over right and under tight try and hold it there and then a right over left and under pull it nice and tight I'll cut off any excess and now we flick that back and that will allow you to wind this on if you don't do that you won't be wanting it on so now we just need to wind on for this real a hundred and fifty meters all right so I've been winding this on because it's a small real I've only wound on about a hundred and fifty meters worth so now it's time to start setting up the rest of the reel and for that you'll need a sinker a hook and a swivel so I still got the line here what I'll do is I'll just cut the rest that off and then I'll need a bit of a leader line so I'll grab about and a couple of feets worth and then I'll cut that off here so I've got a bit here sticking out from the end of the rod and onto the end of this bit I'll stick my sinker put that through now grab my swivel and a tie and knot you just need to put the line through there and then twist it so you'll want to twist it between say five and ten times I like to keep a fairly loose and that leaves a nice gap at the end of this swivel then at that little space at the end of the swivel there you stick the end of the line through there and pull it through sometimes it's good to moisten this with a little bit of saliva and that will help it slide down and that'll just self tighten on itself and I'll cut that off and short as I can now you grab the other piece of line that extra two feet that you cut off before and you just repeat the process stick that through twist it five times ten times some people are superstitious and they'll do it as many as they want my grandfather always did it seven times so I'll stick that little line through that hole pull it tight again again maybe moisten it with a little bit of saliva and cut that off and one more time find the end of this line and now it's time to put the hook on so once again stick the line through the hole twist it as many times you want between five and ten four five six I'll go seven and we'll stick the end of the line through that little bit of loop there and pull it tight trim that off I show it's pulled nice and tight because otherwise that'll just slip out like that that's why you need to pull it nice and tight before you cut it off because if that went in the fish's mouth and he's pulled tired on it he's already swimming off now with a hook in his mouth so twist it say seven times line through the gap beat us alive over there pull it nice and tight beautiful now we'll cut it off and there we go look at the line wound on up through all the holes here coming out the end to my sink are there that's sitting on top of the swivel it's been tied both times there and this end bit runs to the hook there's only one thing to do now let's catch a fish I'm actually using chicken today so I'll just feed the chicken onto the hook I like to just twist it once like to twist it twice maybe feed the hook through there so the hook is sort of hidden by the chicken okay so here we go let's see if this works nice now of course there's a whole different bunch of different sinkers and hooks that you use the bigger the sinker the further you can throw it or cast it so for here we've got a small sinker that won't go too far it'll probably only go about 10 or 15 metres whereas this one will go about 50 meters so it does make quite a bit of a difference and of course different swivels depending on the size of your line I just use the small one for my line and the different hooks to much the time you probably just want to use a smaller hook and that tends to catch any size fish really so make sure you get one of those at a cavea all ends all right got the first fish on the new line so we go oh yeah look at this beautiful nice brim new rod happy fishing everyone", "gV6EGhamRwM": "yes this equation here and this time with more than 101 weird candies weird and

a different experience than smoking how does it work and is eating pot Actually better for you? When you heat cannabis you effectively change the chemical makeup of compounds within it called Cannabinoids Smoking heats it to around 800 degrees Celsius and converts thc a to Delta 9 thC which binds to receptors in your brain making them continually fire and causing your imagination, thoughts and perceptions to magnify this is why every thought can feel like a significant one and Because it travels straight from your lungs into the bloodstream and to your brain the drug works within minutes and lasts about two to [three] Hours, but when making edibles the weed is heated to around 150 degrees Celsius burning less of the actual plant and minimizing Carcinogens ThC is Lipophilic not water-soluble so the activated Thc must be dissolved into something fatty like oil or butter and once the substance is consumed the onset of the high is delayed as the drug is absorbed more slowly through your gut but this high typically lasts four to eight hours and most report feeling more high than Compared to smoking marijuana [this] is because when you eat edible weed the ThC is first metabolized by the liver before entering the bloodstream and here Delta 9 thC also becomes 11 o h thC which Passes the brain barrier more rapidly and is a more potent chemical so using the same amount of marijuana You actually get more high with Edibles because it ends up creating both Delta 9 ThC And 11-OH-THC which is a stronger compound and because there are more? psychotropic types of Cannabinoids acting on your neurons you'll be high for longer of course you also get to skip out on the toxic chemicals that smoking provides like Carbon monoxide Bronchial Irritants and tumor Initiators smoking anything means you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules so if you can get high without smoking it will be healthier for your lungs and body the downside it's much harder to control the High you'll get because it can take up to one to two hours to feel the full effects and the dosage can vary significantly modulating the effects or Titrating as it's called is much more difficult [and] as a result you can end up a lot higher than you intend - but unlike those who consume too much alcohol Opioids or other drugs you won't be suffering any serious long-term harm Toxicity [or] Lethal overdose if you do consume more than you intended [if] you've ever wondered why marijuana gives you the

you think this can go through three yeah one three one three two three it can go through three layers all right that might be four four and a half i can't count but that's pretty deep all right boys i'm gonna keep working on my hole here i'll get this side it's actually doing quite a bit of damage you hold my my tool real quick oh you're gonna wrap the tool oh look at this look at that i got two one two three four letters that's nice my tool has cool looks to it probably got a custom skin oh i got four layers i got a new tool for it has extra grip wait we have other ones here we go this one has like grip of 16. yo we're like it's kind of nice splitter from what cardboard would the problem is is with this i'm just beating it in the cardboard it's not really doing much damage i made a smiley face it's pretty bad honestly yeah that don't work yeah you got some big brands but that don't work it's my face oh is that a smiley face oh nice too oh nice epic it has a zit now that's a big exit it's like that episode of spongebob everything's like i get stung by the jellyfish everything's like that episode of spongebob that's what everything is so are we like in that box where it's like they're imaginating everything imaginating i imagine that's getting to the other side of this wall run into it nine and three quarters run into it right into it full speed i'll give you guys like the three two one oh yeah the the drag flap yeah the drive all right drop ready all right so i'm gonna like put my left shoulder into it okay i'll put my right so we can like stare at each other all right are you ready are you ready yeah yeah i want to move kind of go okay wait you said we were gonna look at each other you said that was awkward it's just ridiculous it's like a cardboard right there i i think i made it through one layer i just want to this is what i made it through so all i'm saying is is i didn't realize how strong cardboard was this is kind of ridiculous this isn't gonna work this is not gonna work i just figured something out this isn't gonna work yeah yeah that's that's what that's where i can hear that from this right here is our new furry friend look at this needs to be a happy camper happy camper should you give it a nose um yep two legs eyebrows two big nostrils give us some like tongue twisters front teeth freckles more freckles whiskers yeah we're good all right there it is it looks like spongebob yeah it kind of does this is the battering ram we're just gonna just all right okay ready oh no it's supposed to let me see it i thought it was supposed to like give you leverage so you could go into it oh yeah yeah oh it's kind of nice [Music] those are like those are like perfect circles it's not doing anything wow what if you did it backwards that's really big now you can like smile at him while he smiles at you it's really heavy here give it a try uh the boy all right watch out boys i'm just gonna throw it nope wait wait wait wait wait watch out watch out watch out watch out okay what if we break through the bottle it's probably where we gonna go there's floor underneath yeah concrete and stuff that's not the best idea sorry yeah that seems much harder than the other oh someone's at the front door someone just oh oh hello pizza delivery i can't hear anything it's really quiet my finger hurts you made the perfect noise for it yeah it was like dead all right so uh we have a chainsaw i'll be in this corner 45 centimeters 18 inch blade that should make it halfway through halfway halfway just kind of big giant doorway trap door like that wow did he break it oh i feel like i got your superpower oh there's so many particles in here those are molecules huh come on why is it going up it goes that way wait what if i try the other way oh no he's gonna go down yo this is scary here you take this have fun buddy okay um i'll just hey hey hey hey huh there's already a hole why don't you just well you forgot your safety glasses then oh thanks safety first i didn't even get safety glasses so you cut this way i cut that way okay you can go do the top or you can go up yeah i'm gonna go smells like burning [Music] cardboard we can take turns you can do the next cut before there you go how do you even work one of these uh there's a he has bite right idea that's how you're supposed to do it we're doing it wrong yeah i couldn't stay in the hole i see that but i mean we could probably like cut right here give me the chainsaw oh yeah yeah yeah oh yeah maybe that's what we're supposed to do what are you talking about oh yeah oh yeah did you uh did you do the top uh i went diagonal okay oh oh wow yeah [Laughter] yeah you're like covered in dust yeah that is oh it's like a german habitat all right let's assess the damage all right pull it out ripped nice epic that's like four layers what else we got in there oh that's like probably six layers no that's me right there bro i did that all right that's like another six layers i got more out epic dude cool you got like another six layers yeah look how deep this is yo it's like a picture frame oh my gosh there's still more he'll destroy yeah it's kind of hard to pull out yo use the box cutter wait it's like dusty in there dog you know that might be easier if we had a crowbar yeah i think that's the end of it so we made it through probably like 20 layers no we went through more layers we just can't pull how many layers is this oh i found this under cardboard epic you want me to try this one yeah epic it's like changing bro i really didn't think it'd be this hard to break through only a hundred layers there's only 100. on this video we should do a part two and we'll do a thousand layers we will just grabbing too many at once we'll probably have to get a car and drive it through it say my phone symmetra spikes yes snow plows snowplow not gonna happen james i'm sorry no so i think we're about not even halfway through that yeah i don't know bro that's not bad are you what i thought you were painting water oh it's a water gun you have a water gun yes think about it cardboard water destruction dude it's literally not doing anything see if that makes it weaker hit it with the axe oh okay no no the axe yo this ain't gonna work look you gotta get creative with it yeah there you go exactly yeah do that do that oh it's oh man that's not working oh no what do you expect it's the top of the hammer big brains yeah big brains big brains it's actually doing something there you go now it's stuck yeah it just didn't want to hit it it's actually doing quite a bit of damage since the cardboard is wet hold on stick it in there it's not sticking get it stuck it's not sticking yeah it's just not really hit with the ram yeah five bucks just says he hits the cardboard i don't have five bucks but yeah we're in a room of cardboard go for it go for it go for it all right i owe you five bucks we tried that it didn't work yeah now turn it on all right now go for it it's wireless now it's bluetooth the entire floor we're stuck in here boys just admit it yeah we've been stuck in here yeah [Applause] i think you're losing your pride we're going on a trip in my favorite cardboard ship going to the wall look at my saw hey why don't you continue the hole we've already started yet noob it's not really doing anything to be honest it broke in half the cardboard broke the beyblade that's how i cut my burritos in half i got one of those hey that's pretty good it bent the blade it's sideways yeah i wouldn't use that anymore that probably isn't safe yeah i'm gonna say it now i can see the light where i don't see it i can't see the light all right yeah this thing's gotta retire yeah you got cardboard you won't believe this to find more cardboard more cardboard that way more cardboard no way cardboard no way yeah cardboard cardboard what are you doing hey hang on boys we're getting through some layers here yeah i literally just cut it with a saw home slice forget the saw forget the battery ham forget the paper cutter we got one of these roller yeah look at all that debris coming out holy mackerel did you try turning it on and off again no do it oh the whole chainsaw is gone it's stuck we're getting out of here today did you break it did you plug it did we break to get out of here so how are we gonna fit through that hole i'll just push you through okay and then you can like unlock it yeah once you're on the other side how deep does this go all right well what'd you do it's really warm look how dude we have how deep we are now we have to be how deep this is bro we have to be at least halfway through dude look at this look at all the shavings we still have to go deeper yeah we still haven't sideways we're good probably like two feet in the wall right now now it's voldemort now it's scarface now we have a harpoon gun this is very scary it's meant for underwater and big fishes it's also not made to be shot out of water and or at cardboard go for it no that's all you know whoa oh what what whoa be careful where you point that thing dog what are you talking about yo chill man all right all right look how close it is i know right it's like as big as the room all right i'm ready three two one my gosh we caught ourselves a cardboard wall it's not wanting to come out it's not when you come out oh oh i got it wait okay see the outside oh i see light really i see light okay this is how long the harpoon is right it's literally as tall as me it went all the way to here oh there's the hole bro we got a lot of cutting to do we can do this where's the chainsaw go go go stop stop stop stop stop stop no i said stop oh it sounded like stop stop stop yeah i'll keep going i think i see the light like legit on the right side oh i see it keep

looks like granola or stuffing from thanksgiving ah don't eat it though all right there's uh two two layers nice good cut job yeah i like your cut jeez we should have made a circle yeah that would have been nice or a bigger hole so you can fit through it yeah i don't know how any of us are gonna even like go through this but we'll try right i think i'll fit ah yeah dude keep going with it yo wait wait watch out watch out with you watch out dude nice i would clap but i have a chainsaw yeah don't do that all right put them down turn it off dude i cut this part a little bit i think it's dusty in there it's dusty in there oh it's real dusty in there all right we got like four layers there right dude all i'm saying is this is tough this is more than a hundred layers i think we miscalculated why don't we create a tool that grabs cardboard like in this situation yeah almost oh yeah because how many people you know get stuck in a cardboard box other than youtubers four right oh yeah four of us yeah right okay well see i'll create it and i'll sell it for a thousand bucks so i'll make three grand off you guys and then uh we'll get out yeah yeah let's just move a little bit

see the light boys go go go go go go grab those lights oh i see it i see it we did it but not here there's still one more layer and we fit through it technically making me a box cutter do you want one with a blade in it oh there it is there you are so you don't need this anymore no i'm good okay oh why is it wet sorry okay so how are we supposed to fit through it i'll push you through yeah you said

see through it and go it's really cool it's really tasty I found this at a gas station you can find it on online or something but I hope you have a good day [Music]", "kiyU7x_H1YY": "[Music] hi guys I'm Jen John's welcome back to the channel today I have another episode of my amazing homemade candies for you now this is probably the one that was absolutely most requested out of all of the homemade candies that I've been receiving and it is homemade Jolly Ranchers I'm gonna be showing you how to make homemade Jolly Ranchers there the little rectangle ones you can also do them square if you prefer and I'm then I'm going to be showing you how to do them in lollipop form so kind of like two videos here and you know like at Christmastime when you have gifts that you have to give to people that are like not always on your list but you want to come off as like this really cool person that gives gifts to like everybody but you don't have a lot of money and you kind of want to be cheap with your gift or is that just me but anyways I think that making these homemade lollipops and giving them away to gifts for Christmas time to like anybody that you meet is a brilliant idea so let's get started on this tutorial to make our homemade Jolly Rancher candies we're going to be using one and a half cups of granulated sugar we need 3/4 of a cup of clear corn syrup you can use dark corn syrup if that's all you have but it will affect the color and it may affect the flavor of slightly we need 1/2 a cup of water and then the secret to Jolly Ranchers is in the citric acid we're going to be using 1/4 of a teaspoon to a half of a teaspoon you can even add more if you want to now citric acid is a natural occurring fruit acid and what we use it for is to enhance the flavor of the candy we're going to use a gel paste to add a bit of color to the candies you don't have to but if you want that traditional Jolly Rancher look you do need to add a little bit of color to it and for the flavoring that your original flavors are watermelon grape raspberry apple and cherry my favorite is a blue raspberry so I'm going to be showing you guys how to make the blue raspberry but all of the flavors you would follow the exact same procedure that I'm going to show you up next and if you're looking for the candy flavoring I find mine at bulk barn in Canada and you can also get them at different times of craft stores or cake decorating stores and I'll also put a link in the description box to everything that you need here so I've got my sugar here in a saucepan on top my element I'm going to put it on to around a medium heat and I'm going to add in my water and the corn syrup and these are the only ingredients that we put in at this point so what I'm going to do is just stir it until the sugar actually dissolves and once the sugars dissolved I can put my candy thermometer in to the pot and then we're going to heat it to what's known as hard crack which is around 300 to 310 degrees Fahrenheit once your candy has come to temperature we're going to add in our other ingredients so I'm putting in my coloring and it's going to bubble and hiss for on us here and I'm putting in a 1 and a half of these little gems of the color of the flavoring you can do that adjust it to your flavor to your desire whatever you want it to taste like I just found that one wasn't quite enough to get that real Jolly Rancher flavor so while it's still nice and hot here I'm going to add in half of a teaspoon of the citric acid so again if you actually like when I was testing this recipe I kind of I had a real jolly rancher went you know what it's way tartar then I remember it being so you could even put more of that citric acid in if you so choose so I've got this nice blue color here you just want to keep stirring it until most of those bubbles are kind of gone it's kind of working them out here if you leave the bubbles in it's really no big deal it just gives a little bit of texture to the candy and you might want it to be a little bit more smooth you can see it happens quite quickly now I'm going to pour it into I've just got a bread pan here with a parchment paper lined in here I'm just going to let it cool in here now I'm going to let it cool for about 20 minutes or until I'm able to start cutting it and then I will show you how to score it after we've let it cool for a bit once the Jolly Rancher mixture has cooled we can remove it from what we're going to do now is for it so I'm just taking a sharp knife that I've got I've sprayed it with some nonstick spray and I'm just making the places where I want the candy to be able to break or cut once it's cooled completely so you want to do this while it's still relatively warm because that's the only time once it gets really hard you aren't able to manipulate it like this it will just crack on you so if you wait too long it doesn't work but if you do it too soon you actually will find that it's really difficult to cut and that your cut lines will disappear and that it will just melt back together so what I'm doing is I'm just starting at the center and then I'm working my way towards the outside here and once your knife starts to get a little bit sticky you can reapply the nonstick spray or vegetable oil whatever you've got handy so once I've got it going that direction I'm going to turn the other way and I'm starting in the middle both times because what I found is like when I'm working it does press the Jolly Rancher little area here it changes the shape of it and I just found that working from the middle and outwards towards the outside had the least impact on the shape it still does change it as you can see but it's kind of the easiest rather than starting at one side once the Jolly Ranchers slab has cooled you can start you can either break it with your hands here or you can use the knife or something to to actually cut it in half it's quite easy to break into these little pieces so I just kind of prefer to do that and if they just have they end up like together like that you can take a sharp knife and then just help it along like that so I'm just going to finish breaking these all up and then you can wrap them up in like little pieces of plastic if you want to and you could put them in a little jar and give them to your friends makes a cool little gift so I'm going to show you how to do the lollipops next so to make the lollipops what I'm going to do is use this sphere mold it's just got nice little round domes on the other side now you're going to take the lollipop or the Jolly Rancher pieces that either you didn't like or you just have extras if you want to and you want to really squish them into the mold it's going to miss shape the mold to start with but what you want is that to have enough inside of it when it goes to melt it fills up the whole thing or you'll end up with like kind of a weird wonky looking a little like sucker there so I'm going to pop these into the oven it's preheated at 375 degrees and I'm gonna put it in for about 15 to 18 minutes I want to make sure that all of the Jolly Ranchers have melted completely so once the Jolly Ranchers have melted in the little mold all you have to do is take a lollipop stick and insert it into the center there just pressing down to the bottom and it will be a little bit wobbly if you try to do it while they're still super super hot so you can let them cool briefly before trying to put the sticks in so you can see that a start kind of starts to tilt over but I've got some ones over here that I have already finished and I'm just going to pop them out you just have to like play with the mold and cuz you have them like shoved in here quite hard you got to pop them out so there we go a little Jolly Rancher lollipop so there you go everybody how to make homemade Jolly Rancher candies it's a totally easy and I hope you guys thought so too don't go easy on the citric acid because that is definitely what makes it a true Jolly Rancher or you just made yourself a plain old lollipop now you know that I love the blue raspberry like I told you guys and the watermelon though mm-hmm it's delicious too totally amazing if you liked the video please give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and leave me a comment about what homemade candy you want to see me make next and I might just pick yours and thank you so much to everybody who suggested Jolly Ranchers because this was a delicious tutorial see you guys all again next time bye",

Halloween [Music] thanks for watching ladies and gentlemen it was nylons nice ithe it was me the whole way", "eo5Qc4bWO78": "[Music] hi guys welcome back to my channel today's video we're gonna be doing another cook with me video type style video I have no other ideas and today it's gonna be a little bit different because instead of baking we're actually gonna be making a candy this was one of my favorite candies growing up and I just I honestly miss it I honestly forgot that existed and then I kept seeing these videos of people literally making them at home and I was like okay I have to do it so basically I'm gonna be making nerd ropes now this is supposedly very easy I'm one that normally messes up literally everything I do it so we're just gonna see if I can like do it so we're just gonna like that's what we're gonna be doing let's just spoke let's hop right into it okay so basically all you need for this is some sort of gummy obviously nice parchment paper to put your Nerds on and then I'm literally I don't have a nice form of like directions written down because I'm just thinking we're interesting that way so I'm just gonna I read somewhere that you just like heat them up for five minutes like the gummies you just heat them up for five minutes so like that's what I'm gonna do okay I sprayed this bowl with some Pam yeah and I'm just gonna gonna heat this up for five minutes I also bought a nerd root this is only the original one this is the berry women they didn't have the original one but we're just gonna when I'm done we're gonna compare the real one to the one I made and see if which one's better so that no one's gonna be boring because I'm super low energy because I I should have made one but I don't know how people just make iced lattes right after they make the Express no shot cuz it just melts the ice so I after I make the espresso shot put it in the freezer for like 15 to 20 minutes and then it's like cooled off and then it's perfectly fine but I hate waiting 15 to 20 minutes or coffee so I'm just lazy I'm gonna scare [Music] okay you I guess that's right damn it smells kind of burnt so I think I should like to read aha why did I do that why don't I think that was gonna be a good idea why yeah it melted the spoon that I was stirring with so grand trying we're gonna try again the dumbest thing I've ever done in my entire life first shirt [Music] my mom is going to kill me yeah we're gonna try we're gonna try it anyways [Music] the dumbest decision why did I think eating up gummies was like gonna go well like I did I mean it really didn't I don't suggest trying this at home at all this is what we have I mean it I mean it's the concept of a nerd rope so I'm still gonna go through with the trying it and everything because I mean it low-key kind of worked if I had some sense it probably would have worked a lot better but okay I'm gonna try it now my finger still hurts here we go the gummy bear is like very chewy I don't remember the gummy part being that chewy oh I'm good I still don't recommend trying this at home I just go by in their group but good now we're gonna try the real deal just so much sugar advice crime wears it up we're gonna think about it there's a lot more nerds on this so this just tastes like nerds what does this taste more like the gummy they're both good like I mean this one's obviously

craft tutorials", "HvKJz4M585c": "hi everybody this is Jen from cookies cupcakes and cardio comm today I'm going to be showing you how to make homemade rock candy we recently made a cake Penguins of Madagascar that used lots of rock candy and I was reading through the comments and people were asking of ways that they could make it themselves at home so I put together this video for you so let's get started so we don't need many ingredients to make the raw candy we need just 1 cup of water 3 cups of white granulated sugar now these parts are optional I've just got some colouring you can also use food coloring for this I have gel paste out in front and I also have some different flavorings and you can use them or omit them it just depends if you want your rock candy to be flavored and then we're going to be growing the rock candy on these little wooden sticks you could also use popsicle sticks or you could also use cake pop sticks so the first thing we're going to do is bring our cup of water to a boil which is 100 degrees Celsius or 212 Fahrenheit so once the water is boiling just turn it down slightly and then by the 1/2 cup we're going to add the sugar so I'm just going to add 1/2 cup here and probably start off with a cup here and then I'm just going to stir it and I'm going to keep stirring and letting the sugar in here dissolve while I'm stirring it we're gonna get the 3 cups of water in or sorry the 3 cups of sugar into the water which is going to saturate it and that's going to be how the rock candy forms so I'm just gonna keep stirring and adding the sugar and it looks like it's dissolved from that first addition so I'm just going to add some more and then keep going so I have all of my sugar in it's nice and thick and the sugar is dissolved into the water mixture so now I'm going to just give it a final couple stirs and I'm going to set it to the side for about 15 minutes to let it cool and in the meantime I'm going to set up the where the rock candy is going to grow so what we need to do next is give a surface for the rock candy to grow on so I'm taking my wooden sticks and I'm just dipping them into the water here just dipping the stick and making it wet and then I'm going to roll it in this white extra sugar so you don't need too much you can tap it off and this is just going to give the rock candy something to stick to and so like I said it's gonna help it grow so just stick it in the water and then dip it into the sugar so we're gonna let those dry and wait for our mixture to slightly cool so what I've got set up are small narrow glasses and if you you can use anything that's kind of like long and cylinder like this in order to help grow the rock candy and what you're going to do is if you want one to be color just gonna put a drop in to the bottom you don't need very much because it is quite a small amount so I've got some blue and some pink coming in here and if you want coloring or sorry if you want flavoring if you want to have one flavour for all of your rock candy you could put it in while before you take it off the heat but I want to show you how to make different flavors so I'm just going to put a little drop as small as I can get here into that blue one there and then change the flavor and put another drop in the second one so this third one that's on my right here I'm just going to leave it plain because the clear rock candy also looks kind of cool so I've transferred my sugar mixture to a container that I can pour from and the mixture is still hot you just want to make sure you've given it a little time to cool down slightly so we're going to do is just pour into my containers here and then I'll give them a stir so I'm filling it you want to leave a little bit of room for this for the stick to go in there and just give it a little stir so it mixes up all of the color and the flavor I'm just going to repeat that with all three and then I'll show you what to do with the sticks so what I have are large clothes pegs you could also use the regular sized ones these ones are just like because they have a little hole in the middle which just happens to fit perfectly with the stick so what you want to do now is you want to put the stick right into the center of the mixture but you don't want it to touch the bottom so what I did is I just go down to the bottom so I can feel the bottom and then bring it back up a bit because if you put your stick too low then the candy won't be able to grow as far as you want it to grow so that's as simple as it is and then you're gonna leave them for at least two to three days in order for any candy to grow and some of mine I left for a couple of weeks and so I'm going to be bringing those ones out to show you and I will show you how to get them out of the container after this so these rock candy growths have been growing for about two weeks and what you want to do at that point is take them off take off the little clothes cake and then the surface is hard so you just want to break it and you can do that with just a butter knife and make sure that you're not breaking it right by the stick and then you want to dump the excess out here like that and then inside you can see that the rock candy has grown around the little post here but unless you're really lucky you might have problem getting it out so what I've had success with is just holding hot water from the tap along the bottom of my container here and then gently prying it away once it gets a little bit soft so I'm going to go and do that and I'll show you the final product so I have the piece of blue rock candy out now and it's all ready to be eaten and I'm going to take the rest of mine out as well and I'll be back to show you all the finished colors so there you go everybody how to make your own homemade rock candy it was a pretty simple tutorial today but something that's really cool that you may not have done before so I hope you enjoyed it and you learn something new so thanks for watching remember to subscribe to the channel and I will see you all again next time you", "b4TijTKCbDE": "munchpak this is so what munchpak does munchpak is a

like I'm physically right beside you looks like the typical munch pack uh-huh garbage Jubjub is right here by the way she stretched like a freak so we've got and this is what we like about munch pack they they've evolved to the point where we don't care what this is we only care about this little sticker right here as you can see it says that these chips are from all the way out in Canada ah Columbia maybe you guys at home see this and you're like my treat Columbia again coffee coffee coffee today that's what we're making not the usual tea that we always end up going Mexico rockin rockin a top rock leg out I don't know what they are but they look all right Canada again I guess if you're like out in some other random country like India and then you end up getting munch pack maybe then maybe then Canada would be impressive Germany hurry bah now what my question is is if these candies are from all over the world how come they're always in English characters mmm food for thought or should I say candy for thought speaking of which we've got from Thailand Pocky without any flavor who those Thai people really know how to live Pocky without the strawberry or chocolate it's Japanese on it look it's written in Japanese yet they say it's from Thailand yeah I can do from is real that'll be interesting because it's actually like across the world instead of all the sour stuff that's just all normal editor fridge Lim orange and then most importantly we got the box so watch this I can show off my newfound strength to you guys now little little camera little action I said I'm trying to punch through it with my willpower but instead I just completely destroyed the box itself wait a minute I didn't know this entire time I can build this into a house watch see it's a little hell assistant nice little house projective oh she's trying to eat the box go jump ship go eat the box beat the box you always just want to eat everything right here you go ah it's a rocket ship suits stupid munchpak box it's not even powerful enough alright so we're gonna start with these these you're gonna clean that up oh oh vacuum [Music] [Music] no they were nothing extraordinary just normal old ketchup chips which one should we do now ah Marcus oh gee I found a secret with me not Hockman Wow it's Thailand here yeah but here yeah look what I can't read it um product of Japan munch Pat you gotta get your facts right guys it's butter flavored oh ah butter flavored you you butter flavored look out dentures hit what what ah no I slowed down we can do the that Disney show is nice you see we can do this okay what what I'm not supposed to know buddy we're in debt we were supposed no it's too late now it tastes just like normal oh I see you can clean my ears don't actually they're not bad they do taste like butter it's weird I don't know okay then there's these weird ones from India and I can feel that we've got a nice yeah yeah it actually says product of India this time so I guess that means that munchpak just did mess up legit with those other treats okay I got you guys does word we're like the Mythbusters of treat Pandey's can't get this on anybody else's channel where we're going to be this honest ooh look you guys in India must really like your Oreos vanilla cream sandwich you mean an Oreo but in a weird shape that's an Oreo in fact no oreo is complete without a glass of milk let's find out if it's an Oreo yep however fun hundred-percent fine nose that's banana chips chips with lemon so that's banana chips okay these ones these ones I won't destroy because these are actually like good ah yes and Jubjub can probably eat them but I'm not going to give one to her anyways [Music] my good did then the last like five videos that's why I'm doing it now we noticed it in editing afterwards these are kind of gross thanks munchpak for adding lemons to bananas because I totally want to cut up a banana fantastic these are disgusting like I really don't want them sorry munch pack but that is just absolutely gross let's get to these ones the China sour blast fruit explosion things aha this is gonna be one that I'm you know like America one what the okay this is gonna be something that's really weird that I'm gonna like and no one's gonna like this is strange so we've got let me see I'm trying to be careful here because there's a bunch of Kuh there's a bunch of poo like my lizard reptilian look it's dripping my lizard reptilian blood what are they doing to my brother what are they done to my brother's so you take the weird gross french fry delicious on its own cuz it's just rubber but then you dip it in the goo in my the blood of my brothers my reptilian brothers why it's better if I knew the blood of my brothers too this good I would be eating them all the time like seriously when I get back to the reptilian Kingdom there is going to be a literal slaughter so that I can have this every day it's really good it's a little too sweet but it's really really good and it's a little bit too sweet wait a minute look at this this this rock elect er whatever comes with a free something they're giving us a free thing three three free lollipops you guys the Germans Germany Mexico the Mexicans know how to live except they certainly know how to make a package to keep a strong fellow like myself oh this is why I work out so that I can do stuff like that economical candy alert so we've got a package here to contain other packages it's stuff like this that's making the world die this is like a chili flavored sucker huh alright well we'll open one of them cuz we don't want to eat more than one of them better way to eat Rock are they gonna seriously have like why I've never seen a sucker rack like this like help oh my gosh and then it's like all sticky on the inside and it's that same aluminum clone super-powerful 300 pounds and I can't open this like seriously I know I know I don't even want to heat it anymore it's not worth it any good she's not really an answer see then you can pay them ah the aftertaste is good when it's in your mouth it tastes like vomit look look this is this is I guess in Mexico this must be like a tiny little plunger and then they go blink and here's the poop out of the toilet ah I like how they call this a sucker when it's clearly like taffy on a stick it does kind of taste like whoever's poop this is like they had a lot of fiber like a lot of grass swap around swap time this one's way bad you you're both disgusting equally disgusting like this thing really does have some weird chili flavor to it and then there's another Island I'm throwing this out I'm Kara organic waffle another one from Canada does it actually stance from Canada product of Canada yep okay let's find out if this is one of those waffles noodles yeah except it's a shock right I don't really like chocolate ones did a really bad job with this waffle it's it's not so much the taste that's bothering me right now it's my like I can feel my pride taking a hit where I'm a little bit a little bit sad inside that I'm Canadian which is even slightly associated with this like this is this is one of this is one of the worst things it's bad there's no redeeming quality it's not like oh this is something that I don't really like the taste of there it's kind of gross or something like that that Mariko's having that's all weird flavored and stuff no this is just like like it has no soul I guess like all Canadians okay like my insides Heriberto Germany snacks this is for all of you gutentag is that German let's see what these are cuz German German usually is very sweet very sweet as sugar tooth mmm why is it sour Oh cuz munch pack cuz Nick loves stop it's weird I don't particularly like it I'm sorry to say so we got two left and then we gotta make it brew this coffee which is probably gonna be kind of group number one coffee brand saying it's the number one coffee brand does not mean that this is their best coffee they almost got me there okay we'll have the fruit limp orange thing now I'm like curious now I want to make sure manufactured by Lud week something around it yeah okay so that sounds German it

gosh it's like I'm playing cards you got any threes I smells good it's like a juicy fruit or something ah that's why it's called frit juicy frit is gonna move yeah oh my gosh and then the candy itself each one of these packages come on camera as like one two three four five of them individually in it okay I see what you're doing you know what else this is like I like this candy because it's like mission impossible remember Mission Impossible one where you fold the gum up and then it explodes the exploding gum oh I like it I don't I like it especially because you can do all sorts of things like you can put them on your eyes you can fill your nose with them yeah you can put them in your ears open hi mer mer szczepan chawla I guess we should be reading the names of these off to you guys

hair candies huh okay what that smells good oh man that's sweet holy cow it's like oh my gosh that's way too sweet for me oh gosh what is sugar and bread coffee instead of tea number one coffee brands

double crisps cool it's peanut field pumpkins pumpkins double crispy monster mutt money and fudged fudge and they've got these M&Ms white pumpkin pie that sounds really good honestly I've never tried those before but this I'm good at the Dollar Tree I think it's the same it's not one actually it's the bloody bites glow-in-the-dark plastic things with using candy blood bags while I'm on flavored so they are the plastic fake teeth and then they give you the ruling candy jewelry supposed to be like a bling so there are 16 pieces it's about bracelets and rings and I think that's also a good class for those over here they've got three fully flavor bubble-gum fireballs Oh spooky I'm scary that's about 40 I think that's 40 I'm not sure if that's a 40 but I think there are 40 pieces truly sour

dollars so no actually no that's not on every other section right let's go at that one this is they have so they've got these school candy rings doesn't so much but 3.8 ounces so I think that's quite

interesting they're sour but they don't have like ghostly gummies these I guess are supposed to look like pumpkins and ghosts they're all the horrible brand and they've got the brush I think this is called batch right batches classic candy corn that's a small bag for a dollar honestly I think you can find it for like a dollar and some sense that Walmart or somewhere else probably cheaper because they're bigger bags remember last year I got like a very big bag that was six ounces or even more than six ounces because this one is only four ounces so it's probably like three times as big as that

start but we are live and this video is trying sour candies or not sour candy sorry trying weird candies live so as you can see behind us we got a whole bunch of really weird candy some of them are

behind us we have all these weird candies and we're going to be trying them and seeing what they taste like so yeah i've only tried a few of these before but most of these are ones that we've never tried or heard of before so this should be really fun all right so we've got two people already watching three people hey guys what's up hey riker's watching hi riker all right i like her which one should we do colton [Music] um wait the middle first round let's see okay so uh you guys comment what candies you think we should try first i think that we should start with these snow cups or snow caps what do you guys think let's just start with snowflakes no that's okay i don't know [Applause] hello sir what did you get you got the piano bench yes these are small i didn't just break these i don't think these are going to be small i thought they were going to be like goodly sized why is it so there we go there we go all right so don't eat it yet i'm just going to do these should i eat that okay we're having some trouble sorry about this guys we're figuring this out come on there we go finally got it okay so everyone watching everyone like this stream let's try and get to five lives

five it was gross if it's above five it was better but this time i'm giving you that neutral what do you mean you keep on eating a ton of them you love them i think usually like a 10 out of 10. no i

know it's like five bucks from every person and anyway people are saying that shouldn't do it but and then i wouldn't do it but you did it i did it was the wrong person to give that to them because of course you can handle it oh i made a hundred bucks man what yeah why would you drink cinnamon oil well because i wanted money and yes it was it was hot but it wasn't any hotter than having just the cinnamon stick because you know once your mouth is on fire it's on fire what difference does it make yeah and so but i could not taste anything for three days oh wow i totally wiped out my taste buds i wonder if that's what it's going to do to me with that i don't think so that was not that bad was it bad so far nothing nothing to me wow and i actually have some oil that i you know on my tongue

or canned dog food the dog food is disgusting yeah okay guys the bag looks so disgusting ew we're not gonna eat any of the other weird changes until we get 35 likes so if you guys want us to do it soon it's the 35 likes and we will do it as soon as you finish are you sure it's a dog food and thankfully what it doesn't taste good or bad it's probably just pudding it tastes really good and that's how much i chewed it right why are the mints next to the other candies oh oh because owl toys are curiously strong that's why why are there mints in that pile these are superiorly strong minions they are all right guys we just need to get to 35 likes what other one are we doing we can do runs raisinets pixie stix um these you can do and then you've been going for an hour and 15 minutes all right guys we just got four more things if we can get how about if we can get to 45 likes by the end of the stream we'll do all we're we're at 30 right now so we only need 15 more no we only need less than that 13. ohio oh hey hi logan i don't know okay guys let's get to 35 likes 35 likes 35 likes and we will do one of the weird candies that you guys pick we're not going to do boston big beans because we already did it if you didn't see that and they just taste like [Music] they just don't taste like anything but peanuts just plain pieces why is it though um i don't know i wonder if youtube was just deleting on martha too careful she just did it she used okay guys just like oh my gosh we're super close we're super super close to 35 likes so everyone like and everyone will pick one of the weird candies we could do uh what else i could do we could do raisin nets we could do i literally hate these ones if you guys if everyone votes on it we could do one that we already did no every single person voted on that uh-uh one of the bad ones we're not doing bean boozled okay not being losers we did thrones but we could do another one like the sour one we do yeah i like the salad no like not in the sourness level it's too sour but i like the taste whoa wow all right guys make sure to like everyone like and let's get the 35 likes so that we can do this and then i have an announcement at the end of the stream for the stream actually i have two announcements two announcements yeah well they're kind of one announcement actually but they're just kind of good all right guys share this video with all your friends let's get to 35 likes we got this is there still on yeah hi arrow okay guys let's get to 35 likes we can do it hey travis okay hi let's we're trying to get to 35 likes because if we can get the 35 likes we will do any of the candies that are left that people choose what's up man and we could bring something back yeah you can bring it back there's only two people in on the finger on the app thing oh really yeah they've gone two days oh wow look at that two days and 47 minutes wow i wonder how much you bribed that person for for real or he just accidentally turns me back okay guys it's going way quicker than the other one did yeah 70 hours versus like three days versus two days in an hour so far i think it's because the most people that are on it the less of a chance that they rack up in their head that they're gonna actually win yeah probably okay guys come on we can do this let's get to 35 likes and we'll try one of the weird candies behind us that jayden hi jayden what's up dude okay so in this video we have a whole bunch of weird candies behind us let's do this look what is that it's a dabbing guy how do you do a dabbing guy don't know youtube emojis but yeah hey jaden we're trying these weird candies so if we can get 35 likes we will try them he does a winky and then dabbing [Music] don't do that don't do that moving the camera print or no that's a cat not a printer and now he does another wink and dab what why okay if you guys want to know how to do this when you type there's an emoji next emoji next to it everyone

elbow cough not dab oh wait it says elbow cough not dab oh it looks like a dab to me okay guys since we got 25 likes let's bring back everything and show them what their options are yeah read them all

[Music]", "wZ_SJbeGyLk": "the run off our set of 20 examples on work energy and power let's look at climbing stairs and how much power it requires to go up stairs now let's say that you're in the gym and you're using your Stairmaster and the stairs just keep coming like an infinite number of stairs and let's say that the height of each stair is 7 inches or 18 centimeters and they're coming at you at a rate of one step per second how much power is required to keep climbing those stairs so again the idea is that power is equal to the work done over time or the change in energy over time and in this case that thing change in energy over time works quite well because we're gaining in a way potential energy all right so that would be equal to the change in MGH over time and of course the thing that's changing is the H over time right so this is equal to mg times Delta H over Delta time so here we're talking about a man with a weight of 80 kilograms the acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 meters per second squared and of course the change in height over time is 7 inches per second or 18 centimeters per second which of course we have to convert to meters per second so that's equal to 0.18 meters per second and that would be the power required to keep climbing those stairs so let's find out so this is 80 times 9.8 times 0.18 equals there would be 141 watts all right that's 141 joules per second that is how many joules per hour or how many food calories per hour how many calories are you burning by doing this for example okay so that's 141 joules per second and if we convert that to hours so we need hours at the bottom and seconds at the top that would be one hour or 3600 seconds so if we multiply that times 3600 we get let's see here 500 8,000 rounded off so this would be equal to 500 and 8,000 joules per hour of course if we then convert that to calories or food calories per hour and of course we need to convert from joules to calories so that would be a food calorie so I'll go ahead and indicate that and joules at the bottom here and we have one food calorie is 4,186 joules so if not divide that by 4186 we get a hundred and twenty one food calories per hour so going to the gym walking up the stair master and climb it one step per second you're burning up about 121 calories per hour of course again that's ignoring all the other things your body does so that's the only port that's only the portion that is required to lift you up to that particular altitude and your body also needs other things as well so it's typically about three or four times that amount so walking up a Stairmaster you can safely say you're probably burning up somewhere around 350 to 500 calories per hour doing that particular exercise now it's kind of interesting if you do that for an hour how much height you think you will have gained so if we multiply this height times 3,600 seconds because that's indeed the number of seconds in an hour so we go point one eight times 3,600 and that's 648 meters or about 2,000 feet so if you do that for an hour you will have gained about 2,000 feet or 648 hour meters in an hour of vertical height and that's the power required to do so in one hour that's how you do that", "KAycqbqNaes": "[Music] thanks for coming back to my channel my name is Karen a and you are my bluff I am you need to eat edible for the first time I

it okay oh man it's coming with the package most of it stayed together okay so good right this is what we have so I'm going to take this off and here we go here we have our Nerds rope I asked it in the ex-head recording so I'm just gonna continue from here but here it is I'm gonna try it the gummy rope covered with narrative trees when it tastes like our globe or interesting the sort Maynard's their ring bow just a bunch of random colors it's very glue gummy whatever dude can't put it in for flavor in a clear part of it of it nerds I know nurse they said of course and II just itself that's what looks like pretty good how much - mm-hm definitely part good it's a very interesting go so many flavors but it works for together Peggy but not too tangy I just couldn't thank you that's pretty good candy one charm for a long time not quite as crazy that I expected but still not everybody needs bad that's my review thank you for watching I like", "NVTIE-x5q60": "you", "9arfQ-bzYhY": "[Music] as you can see we're at the store we're buying candy right now for the candy shop and we've got quite a bit and we still got a few more stores we're going to go to but they got a pretty good selection so we're going to try to get as much as we can and without like completely cleaning them out but I will see you at the next door so guys is what we got for candy right now looks a lot less than it actually is but I will show you once we get into the store and we still have a lot more in the store that we're buying right now we just finished going to the candy store and this is the receipt we got the list as tall as me suppress the candies in there and we'll see you guys when we get home or to the next door so guys I never really intro this vlog but um how you guys doing what's up I don't know what to say I've been gone for a little while but I've been taking a break I've been doing some stuff I've been doing some rock climbing hanging out with me and Zach doing skiing getting the shops ready stuff with my horse school I finished my math class all I have left is language arts and I only have six assignments left so that will be done pretty quick I've been trying to get a lot of work done I've been just doing stuff from been busy and I filmed a vlog the other day I didn't edit it so that's why I like you guys haven't seen a vlog and I think over a month but I'm going to try to film this today and edit it tonight and post it tomorrow when you're seeing it or if you see it when I upload it hopefully that'll be the plan but um ah let's see what's next so we got all that candy or we got a lot of it and then we're going to another store we're going to get more candy and we'll go from there and I think we'll put it in our store or fill our store or something but um pretty cool so we just got back we're going to set up all the candy on the table so we kind of see what we have but there's a lot of candy over there the kids there they're there it's candy everywhere but we'll get it set up and I will show you guys after you this is going to be the longest time to set up for a thumbnail but we're also doing this so we can see what we have and what we don't have but it'll be pretty cool if it works I don't know if my camera angles wide enough full of see where let's return to the time lapse okay so after about ten minutes this is what I see on the screen we got all the candy on the table which it's a lot - like a couple things that won't go in our store like there's some peanuts that we're going to do but those a goner storm does not really candy and then some popcorn is candy but it's morph to show what we want to do and some other stuff but it's a lot of candy so I'm going to show you guys right now hopefully I can get a good thumbnail and we'll go from there so we got a lot of the box stuff over here bags regular candy or just candy and then those are mostly like bulk items that we're going to split up and divide then there's the peanuts I

to find out when playing candy crush is how do you make a striped candy well one of the first things that you can see is that if you take this green candy and swipe it to the side this way the stripes end up being horizontal what happens is that when you swipe this candy in and this candy becomes activated it's gonna shoot a line vertically across now if you end up having two candies that are next to each other and both are together if I shoot this candy towards this candy this will be the line that will go straight and this will be the line that went across now what happens when you have used up all of your lives and you have no friends to give you their lives back well one thing you could do is you could wait 30 minutes or you could use this handy-dandy cheat all you have to do is exit candy crush go to your home page enter settings general date and time set to manual and then move your time one day ahead go back to open up candy crush see then you have five lives but don't play first go back change back your settings it's automatic and then later your heart's content with impunity there's also that dastardly treat chocolate that's constantly responding and making a really hard time to get rid of your jellies so you have to remember one thing it's that when you get rid of a chocolate on one round you have one free round that you don't have to worry about your chocolate reproducing timed levels in candy crush are levels in which you have to hit a certain score in a set limit of time the cool thing about timed levels is that you will get a +5 to your time as long as you make a cascade of four other candy crushes on their own after you've hit one set of candies so we'll catch the cats one cascade two three four five got one two three you see so each time it hits four levels I get another +5 suddenly appears on the screen as one of the next pieces that fall off if you want to take a break while playing a timed level all you have to do is hit pause leave it there and then if you want to go back to your game turn back on the game and press play on and your time is saved sometimes the starting position of your candies is really important to the completion of your level such as the dreaded level 65 you can change the starting position of your candies without giving up a life take a look at your game position and if you don't like it all you have to do is before you've actually changed any position of any candies exit out and then you can see still have two lives start up the game take a look at the next set of positions don't have to worry and you can start off with a super-sweet set so those are a few super-sweet tricks for candy crush fans we'll be heading out with the whole bunch more soon hope you enjoyed them and I'm Georgia from I'm lore

Hey guys! You may already know that I love bracelets. I love making them, giving them\nand most of all, wearing them. So in this tutorial, I'll show you how to make 5 beautiful\nbracelets using string. These are perfect for beginners, super easy and fast to make.\nYou can make them for yourself or your friends. I'll show you how!\nFirst, we are making this beautiful colorful rope bracelet. You will need a small piece\nof cardboard, any rounded object, a pencil, a button for the closure, 4 colors of embroidery\nstring and scissors. Start by making a simple bracelet loom. Take your rounded object, I\nam using a glass, place it on a piece of cardboard and outline the glass to get a circle. Cut\nit out with scissors. Mark the center of the circle and make eight little lines on the\nouter edge dividing the circle into eight equal sections. Take the scissors and make\nshort cuts along the lines. The cuts should be about half an inch long or shorter. Take\nyour pencil again and push the tip through the center of the circle to get a little hole.\nAnd here we have a bracelet loom, which we can reuse to make bracelets for all of our\nfriends. Cut four pieces of embroidery string, each\napproximately 25 inches long. Fold the strings in half and knot them together like so. We\nhave 8 strings coming out from the knot, but we need just seven of them. So take one string\nand cut it off very close to the knot. Push the loop and the knot through the center of\nthe cardboard loom like this. Next we need to randomly arrange the strings around the\ncircle by placing them into the cuts. There must be one string in one cut and since we\nhave 7 strings and 8 cuts around the loom, one cut will stay free. Hold the loom so that\nthe empty cut faces towards you. Count one, two, three, take the third string and place\nit into the empty cut. Rotate the loom, one, two, three, take the third string and move\nit into the free cut. This is all you need to do. Rotate the loom and move the third\nstring into the empty cut. Well after you get the hang of it, you won\u2019t need to rotate\nthe loom anymore. Just count three strings left from the empty cut and move the third\nstring into it. After a while you will notice a lovely rope bracelet on the other side of\nyour loom. You can make your bracelet as long as you want. I want to wrap it around my wrist\njust once, but you can also wrap it two or even three times. Just remember to cut longer\npieces of thread to begin with. When the bracelet is long enough, release all the strings from\nthe cuts and take it off the loom. Make a little knot to secure your work like this.\nFor the button closure choose one thread, I like to go for the color that matches my\nbutton, and thread the button on. Slide the button as close to the bracelet knot as you\ncan and make a few small knots to secure it in place. Trim the excess thread away and\nyou are all done with this beautiful bracelet. It only takes about 20 minutes to complete\none, which is just awesome. I\u2019m in love with the button closures because they are\nsuper practical and very cute at the same time.\nNext we are making this color blocking spiral bracelet. We need embroidery floss, scissors\nand a button. I decided to use four colors of thread, you can use more or less different\ncolors, whatever you prefer. Put all four thread colors together and cut at about 50\ninches. Now fold this big string of threads in half and make a knot slightly below the\nfolded end to get a little loop for the button closure. Finally, it's time to start knotting!\nOut of the eight strings, chose one, and start making normal forward knots around the remaining\nseven threads. To make a forward knot take your working string, make a four shape over\nthe remaining seven strings like so and then simply go under the seven strings and up through\nthe loop of the number four. Pull the working string so that the knot slides and tightens.\nTo keep the spiral going smoothly, I like to go under the seven strings with my working\nthread when the knots arrive to my right side. Then just continue knotting forward as usual.\nAfter several knots you'll notice that the knots automatically form this knotted spiral\nshape around the bracelet. If you don\u2019t have this cool branch to hang your bracelet\non while knotting, you can totally tape it on a flat surface or pin it on a blanket or\npillow if you like making your bracelets in bed. To switch the working color, simply pick\nup another color from the bunch and continue making exactly the same forward knots. My\nspiral has now reached the right side, therefore I need to go below the seven strings to the\nleft side with my working string before I can continue knotting. Time to switch the\ncolor, good bye green and hello blue. Of course you can use any colors you like for the bracelet.\nI'm using four different colors here, but if you want you can use two, three or more.\nThis time we used four thread pieces to begin with. If you would like your bracelet to be\nthinner, use only three thread pieces, and if you want it to be thicker, use five. That\u2019s\nthe beauty of bracelet making. You get to decide the details! When your bracelet is\nlong enough, make a final knot to secure it. This time I am using a cute flower button\nfor the closure. Thread the button on one of the strings, make two knots to secure it\nand cut the excess thread away. This bracelet is seriously so straightforward and easy.\nOn top, it will only take you around 20 - 30 minutes to finish it. I love to cozy up in\nbed on a cold fall or winter day, turn on some music or a TV and make bracelets at the\nsame time. Ta-daaaa! The bracelet is all done and look how beautiful it is! Yaaaay!\nNow let\u2019s make this lovely fishtail bracelet. We\u2019re gonna need four string colors, scissors,\na button and a needle. Cut 40 inch long thread of each color. Fold the threads in half and\nmake a knot. I decided to make this bracelet on a pillow. Pin the threads in place using\na needle, by going through the pillow and the loop like so. Separate the threads into\ntwo sets, one of each color on each side. Arrange the threads in a mirror image pattern.\nWhen making a fish tail bracelet all you have to do is take the outside string on the left\nand bring it inside to the right. Then take the outside string on the right and bring\nit inside to the left. To make the braid nice and tight you\u2019ll have to take the strings\ninto your hands while braiding. The concept of fishtail braiding a bracelet is the same\nas fishtail braiding your hair, so if you are familiar with that, a fishtail bracelet\nwill be a piece of cake for you. And even if you never did a braid in your life it is\njust super simple to learn. So take the outside string on the left and bring it over to the\nright. Then take the outside string on the right and bring it over to the left. This\nbracelet will take 10 minutes top to complete it and honestly I think it looks so cool!\nFinish with a knot to secure the fishtail braid. Take a button, I have this beautiful\nyellow flower and thread it onto the chosen string. Slide the button close to the bracelet\nend and secure it in place by making two knots. Trim the excess string and voila our fishtail\nbracelet is all done. If you want to have a thicker bracelet you can use more than four\npieces of string, if you\u2019d rather have a thinner bracelet go for only three string\npieces. Let's add even more cuteness to our hands\nwith this always beautiful striped friendship bracelet. You will need some embroidery thread,\nscissors and a button. I\u2019m gonna make the bracelet using three string colors: yellow,\nblue and corally red. For the button I\u2019m choosing this red heart. Cut about 80 inches\nof each string color. Fold the strings in half and make a knot like so. Finally we are\nready to start knotting. Set the bracelet in place using a piece of tape. Arrange the\nstrings by color. I have red strings on the left, yellow in the middle and blue strings\non the right. Take the outside string on the left, red in my case, and knot it over all\nother five strings on the right until the working string reaches the end on the right\nside. Make a forward knot by creating a four shape over the second string, loop the working\nstring under and back through the opening. Pull the working string to tighten the knot.\nMove on to the yellow and finally blue strings. Make two forward knots by making a four shape,\nloop the red working string under and back through the opening. Pull the string to tighten.\nMake sure to always knot twice! And our first row is complete. Let\u2019s continue with the\nsecond row! Take the outside string on the left, which is red again and make two forward\nknots over the yellow string next to it. Then continue knotting over the remaining four\nstrings until the working string reaches the right side. It is super important that you\nalways make two forward knots over each string. And repeat: take the left string, which is\nnow yellow and knot twice over all the other strings. You just need to keep making these\nforward knots and adding rows by rows to your bracelet until it\u2019s long enough to fit your\nwrist. I already made heart and chevron friendship bracelet tutorials, which you can find on\nmy channel. This diagonal striped bracelet is the easiest and perfect if you are a beginner\nin bracelet making. Similarly as with other bracelets in this tutorial, using more pieces\nof string will give you a wider bracelet. So if you are using four strings at the beginning,\nyou get eight when you fold them and the bracelet will be for the width of two knots wider than\nthis one. Let\u2019s see the forward knot slowly once again. Take the outside string on the\nleft and make a forward knot by creating a four shape over the second string. Lead the\ntip of the working string under the second string and back through the opening. Pull\nthe working string to tighten the knot. Make one more knot before moving to the next string.\nThis bracelet takes a bit more time than other bracelets in this tutorial, but I think it\nis absolutely worth spending an hour for something as beautiful as this. Continue knotting until\nyour bracelet is long enough to wrap your wrist. When you reach that length, make a\nfinal knot to secure your work. Take a button, thread it on the chosen string and make two\nknots as close to the bracelet end as possible. Cut off the excess thread and there you go,\nthe bracelet is finished! Wear this classic friendship bracelet on it's\nown or combine it with other jewelry pieces. It's so sleek and simple but ads a nice pop\nof color to any look. The last bracelet we are making today is this\nlovely floss wrapped chain bracelet.\u00a0We will need a chain, a clasp, embroidery thread,\nneedle, scissors and two pliers. First we need to shorten the chain so it fits\nour wrist perfectly. Note that you need to leave some space for the clasp. So I\u2019m taking\nan inch less than the size of my wrist. To split the chain into two pieces simply open\nthe chain loop. For a thick chain as mine you will need some strong pliers. So thanks\ndad, these work perfectly! Next we need to add the clasp. Open the little ring on one\nside of the clasp and attach it to one end of the chain. Do the same with the other clasp\nring and attach it to the other chain end. Try the bracelet on to see if it looks good.\nI am happy with mine so I can proceed to the string part. We will need quite a long piece\nof thread to dress up the chain along the entire side of the bracelet. It depends on\nhow thick you want to wrap it but I used about 130 inches of thread for this bracelet. Knot\none thread end to a big needle. The other thread end needs to be tied on a chain end.\nMake two knots to be really sure the thread won't untie, because that would be frustrating.\nStart wrapping the thread around the chain by leading the needle trough the chain loop\ndown and then up again like so. As you can see we are wrapping the thread only along\none side of the chain, while the other side stays golden. You can switch up the color\nof your thread to your favorite color or a color that matches some particular outfit.\nI love how a coral color looks paired with gold. If you run out of thread in the middle\nof the bracelet, just knot a new thread piece to it and continue. This way you can also\nswitch the thread colors along the chain and you'll end up with a cool color blocking bracelet.\nWhen you reach the end, make a couple of knots to secure your work. Cut away the excess thread\nand you're ready to rock this gorgeous chain threaded bracelet. Even with bracelets made\nentirely from thread I like to stack on some metal jewelry pieces. So this bracelet is\nperfect because it has both by default. Two in one ya know.\nFriendship bracelets are meant to be handed to your friends as a token of love and connection.\nBut I don't blame you if you make bracelets just to rock them yourself. I do it all the\ntime! And these were my five easy friendship bracelets.\nI hope the tutorial was helpful and you'll try to make them too. If you do so, don't\nforget to share your pictures with me on twitter, facebook and instagram. I love you, sending\nyou big hugs and bunch of kisses.

with Jared and we're doing a tape place first look of dropped that candy a game that we can probably guess how you play before you even play it you want to want to guess before I when you cut a rope i'm guessing the drop can help mechanic to drop candy to get stars Lassie alright so we start at the candy store camping little dude likes lollipops I can get behind that I mean who doesn't like lollipops right but don't understand the escalation of I guess gotta get more lollipops well I'm being hypnotized oh alright okay so not exactly like set the rope what kinda matching colors have to connect and glow it's just like the game we were playing earlier where we were talking about the touch stuff to remove them game monopoly in fewer snaps earn more stars really chowing down on the candy yeah probably want I want to figure out how you get these greens together huh yes the blue monkeys green blue or tap oh not well you should've waited see now is there any kind of like failure okay we didn't get three stars like here let's just for instance if we can just really try to not do good threw it out uh you passed no stars but you been they maybe there's a failure point if I keep going or maybe oh you know I bet you probably need like stars to unlock stuff Oh up too early all right now these home down so you since seven taps two three four five six we'll do a that's fine I want to get to a point where like you can die with a possible most are gonna all right here we go so if i give my sweet zapped cuz that that's what just counts to town all right we got to figure out a way we can fail at this game the challenge is in how do you fail they're like what's the stopping point I guess I'm like genuinely curious I don't think there is one I think this is a you can just get the candy down you beat it but the challenge just gonna be going back and trying to do it and better than part time or whatever yeah it was just cool I don't know this is this is like that other game to me where it's like there's so many games that are similar to this that Oh seaside one more here you go any 30 stars to unlock the candy museum and then 365 to unlock the candy station with more levels coming soon so I guess it's not as much as a failure thing as much as you need those stars to progress yeah that makes sense that's a good way to do things i like that yeah I don't know that's uh let's drop that candy it's a game of popping candy", "S4zjNt10xYA": "hey lovely people so I just wanted to do a quick update and review of stony patch stony patch edibles because I noticed that in the video and the first video I posted about this edible a lot of people were telling me this isn't what they were getting so poor oh wow like the first five times I went to go purchase this in DC they came in a cube shape like this there was just like cubes and very chewy like they're just like a barian gummy type of edible now this is the first time so I've been purchasing these things for a couple of months now and this is the first time I'm actually getting the pack that people are talking about which look exactly like the original sour patch kids and they look like this okay so I'm just gonna eat one right now this is the first time I'm seeing them looking tasting and feeling like actual sour patch occasion I have to admit that when I tried these compared to the ones I had been getting before these the ones that look like sour patch is are less powerful less potent I got what I would eat like - I really wouldn't feel anything but these I would need like a half of one of a half of one of these squares and it would be good the texture is different as well so I really don't know what's going on according to both packages they both have the same ingredients they both say they are in compliance with the CA prop 215 SB 4 xx section blah blah blah I'm sure there's some type of DC law but I don't know um so yeah maybe I would have to eat more of the sour patch kids ones in order to feel something but the other ones we're buying like I am not sure why they're such a difference but yeah I just wanted to make it update to let you guys know that I did I finally know what you're talking about when you're saying oh my pad looks just like the sour patch cake okay I get it I know I know what you're talking talking about now but when I like I said like when I first started getting these for the first time they look like the squares like this this is like what I was introduced to when I was interested introduce this Tony fetch as a product so yeah I'm wonder with that Bell no idea everybody look it up anyway if you have any questions comment below and I will get back to you of course yeah and have a good one here", "NYzRpAEe1g4": "today I'm paying homage to one of my all-time favorite chocolate bars it's a classic Australian treat the cherry ripe it's coconut and cherry and it's coated in dark chocolate and is simply divine so taken those basic elements and I've turned into this gorgeous dessert slice so let's make a cherry ripe slice on the one pot chef those things first we're going to work on our cookie base so into a bowl I've got 250 grams of plain chocolate cookies which I have just crushed up in the food processor and to that I'm going to add 125 grams of butter which I've just melted then simply mix that together with a wooden spoon until it's all combined it should look a bit like wet sand next I've got a shallow sliced tin which I've just lightly greased and lined with some non-stick baking paper and make sure you've got a bit of an overhang on at least two of the sides it makes it easier to get the slice out so into the pan we're just going to put our cookie mixture and just use the bottom of flat-bottomed glass to press the mixture out so it's nice and flat and even all over and just place this into the fridge to chill while we work on our other ingredients to make the filling for our slice into a big mixing bowl I'm putting four cups of desiccated coconut a 400 gram can of sweetened condensed milk 200 grams of red glossy cherries which I've just cut into quarters you can also use fresh cherries if you want if they're in season but I like the glass--oh cherries the color looks nice and 125 grams of white chocolate which I've just melted and just give that all a good mix together until it's nicely combined and just to add a nice little bit of color to this I'm going to add a couple of drops of rose pink food coloring now with food coloring just add a couple of drops mix it in and then if you need more you can add more transfer the cherry and coconut mixture on top of the slice and just using the back of a spoon we're just going to press it down and compact it so it's nice and even lastly I've got 250 grams of semi-sweet dark chocolate which I've just melted and we've just spread it over the surface of this slice and this is ready to go back into the fridge for our last time we're going to chill it for about an hour until the chocolate layer is set then we'll be ready to slice it up and serve and here we have some of our completed cherry ripe slices looking absolutely gorgeous you've got that beautiful crunchy base the soft chewy coconut and cherry Center and that crisp cool chocolate layer on top absolutely gorgeous definitely not something to have on a regular basis but lovely as a treat rich and sweet and undeniably pink in places but you've got to love that so I'm going to jump in and have a quick taste mmm oh wow that's so gorgeous mm-hmm you've got the taste of cherries all through that mmm that beautiful sweet coconut crispy cookies on the bottom that wonderful semi-sweet dark chocolate on the top it's a wonderful contrast to the sweetness of everything else

this and it's working great so there's the rotors and it flies and it usually lands right like that if it's flying right and it's not too windy now I can put it on here and kind of show you a little but it keeps falling off we will take this outside though and give you another perspective so when you're pulling this here the copter blades start to spin and then this thing just sails you just pull it hard goes up in the air and there you go now it's going to want to fall off and that retracts so that's it how about we just take it outside so you could take a look at it oh did I show you the cool glass on there made in China airborne this one's coming up to the underside well I think it's time to fly so we'll see you later I'll do this outside alright we're outside let's give it a shot pretty cool thanks for watching our eBay product video and always remember if you see a Lucky Penny pick it up", "cMOL5PijlKE": "hey guys clever pup here I'm trying to get the ball earlier running well I'm having electrical issues okay basically what another guy did was Jerry rake all these wires and I was trying to put it back to factory but I don't have the money right now so I'm trying to figure out the way he routed the wires to make the folder start I'm trying to use the push button switch right up here I'm trying to use that to start it and as you can see I have this off that's why it's loose as you see it's not starting okay what I did is I went and bought a new brand new battery I went and bought brand new starter circuit relay okay this is a little ones in here somewhere find it there's the old one okay I already tested the new one it works it clicks this one works and clicks if you are wondering why the wirings like this don't worry about it okay just tell me how it goes together tell me how this wire if this wires were right right here because I I edit this one on tell me if that's right tell me if this one's right just tell me all the wires and I even tell you all
