{"YFKNLym1r3w": "what is up ladies and gentlemen boys and girls it's your boy goblin and today we're coming in with a hoot and a holler hey we're coming in with something a little different a bit of an educational video if you will now hope you guys enjoyed this one drop a like if you do and without further ado let's dive right into it so first and foremost i want to clarify why this video is being made right i get a lot of people coming into my twitter dms or my instagram dm's and they send me pictures of edibles they get and they're these like nerds robes or these gummies or all of these different things and you know up until recently i didn't have as much knowledge on the topic i guess you could say as i did now right like i never really bothered to actually learn much or educate myself because i kind of stopped buying edibles for a while but as i got back into edibles you know i kind of started learning more about what the current street edibles are like and listen alright ladies and gentlemen there's a trend going on that when i mentioned it on stream the other day the vast majority of people in chat not the vast majority but a fair bit of people were like what are you talking about like oh i didn't know that and today we're going to address that right i'm going to give you guys some tips on how to spot a fake edible what a fake edible even necessarily is but first and foremost right i think it's important to note that there's really only two cases where you should even be buying edibles right a go to a dispensary dispensaries have great edibles that are made in ways that a lot of street edibles just can't be made because it requires equipment that is so expensive no dude in his garage is going to have it 99 of the time right or b buy it off a friend of yours who makes it right if you are buying a street edible and it advertises a milligram amount 99 of the time that is wildly inaccurate nothing close to the real dosage right but we'll get to that part later because the real thing i want to push here is like folks make your own edibles okay before i get dive into how to really spot these edibles it's so simple to literally just get together with your homies smoke some weed and cook edibles it's some of the most fun i've ever had in terms of anything weed related making edibles is a blast dude if you've never done it before it's literally it's so easy dude brownies are the easiest thing to make give it a go okay but now let's get into the the real beef of this video okay so first and foremost there's something i want to highlight right not all edibles are made the same way right there's some edibles that are sold on the street you know specifically if you're buying a pre-packaged edible if you buy nerds ropes i guarantee this is probably what you're getting 99 of the time right i know these are a huge trend right now everyone's eating these [ __ ] nerds ropes dude there's probably a few of you guys smacking that [ __ ] right now while you're watching this video okay listen i'm on to you okay i'm on your ass now all right listen so there's different ways that edibles are made edibles of course can be cooked and that's more common when you've got like a brownie or a cookie you know they take an oil or a can of butter and they actually cook something but there's a new and kind of i wouldn't say new but a what's becoming more common trend which is spraying right and a lot of people when i mentioned this on stream the other day this is the whole reason i'm making this video a lot of people didn't know this exists what people will do is they will take distillate and just spray it on the edibles you take a [ __ ] piece of wax paper and you lay it out on a table right and you take nerds ropes obviously are such an ideal candidate for this because you could just put them so tightly together and just spray them down and waste no distillate right so you take this wax paper and you lay these [ __ ] edibles out you lay some let's say you go buy some candy you know you go buy some cheap wholesale candy you lay it out and you just spray the [ __ ] out of it it's so much quicker than actually cooking and think about it for a minute do you really think your plug knows some guy who is handcrafting some [ __ ] nerds ropes one by one in his garage or has like a nerd's rope machine listen there's machines that do a lot of things but there's no machine making nerds ropes and there's also no guy dumb enough to hand roll a bunch of nerds ropes when he knows he could just buy them and spray them and sell them for a shitload of money right you have to understand that this is a very common trend in the comment section i'm actually going to link an article that talks about this right there's a couple articles i found i'm gonna link you guys can actually read some stuff hey you don't gotta believe me that's fine i'm not always the most trustworthy source hey but these articles are okay these will tell you some facts right but moving on from the whole sprayed part there's a couple prop well not moving on but there's a couple problems with it a you don't know what the [ __ ] the dosage is right you have no idea what these people are putting on you can't dose it they're not actually cooking it the spray is uneven but that's really the least of the concerns of the sprayed edible because you have to look more at the fact of like what are they actually spraying onto this product right when something is cooked like you know let's say let's say someone takes an oil or like a can of butter and they make a brownie or a cookie or something like that with it typically you're you're more going to be questioning the strength of it you're not going to be concerned about a synthetic or something fake in it but when you spray an edible you are opening up the door for synthetics to be sprayed on it and this is becoming a more common thing people don't realize that not all edibles even have thc in them sometimes you can get an edible that is just sprayed with synthetic [ __ ] right k2 for example they spray that right that's not like an actual plant they spray some plant matter and you smoke that [ __ ] right they can do the same thing with edibles if they really [ __ ] want to right they can spray it with some synthetic chemical [ __ ] that you don't know what it does to you you don't know where it's from and there's a million different chemicals that they can choose to spray on these edibles and that's why you have to have due diligence when you're buying and you have to look at what you're purchasing and honestly in my opinion the brownie in a ziploc bag is a hundred times safer than your prepackaged nerds rope or sour patch kid is ever going to be okay because like nobody like sure there might be exceptions i know there's of course gonna be that one guy in the comment section he's like well goblin you know i actually have a sour patch kids nerds rope factory in the shed in my backyard and i have over 15 employees churning out nine different machines of nerd ropes you know what good for you you're the one in a million all right but the rest of the people watching this video they aren't in that scenario they're buying it from some guy who is spraying some hoopla right they're buying it from some guy and they're not buying it directly from that guy either it's passed through a hands on hand so you're getting marked up sprayed [ __ ] you're not you're not even getting a good deal on this you have to realize your plug like if you hit up your plug and you asked to buy like a hundred of these edibles in bulk i guarantee you're gonna get some ridiculous price that makes you realize wait a minute how does that even work and i'll tell you how it's probably sprayed specifically if [ __ ] are selling these little nerds ropes or whatever man are these other candies that are on you know trending nowadays you know you go on tick tock and you see these people claiming they they make these edibles you know oh look at these candies brother just spray that [ __ ] dude 99 of the time they don't actually cook something into it but even when they do cook something into it here's the next concern the next concern is that there's no actual viable way of really testing a street edible right you you can't really know you know nobody's taking dispensary weed where they know the exact percentage and cooking it in edibles they're taking street weed that's never been tested and cooking it into an edible that that that's then also never been tested so they really don't know what the dosage is in these you know they could tell you how much they put into it and you can maybe ballpark it but when you get something that is packaged and your plug says yeah it's exactly this dosage don't believe them right if you've got a plug it just tells you yeah these [ __ ] are strong eat half that's honestly probably more reliable going to be a better product than the guy who's trying to sell you some thc milligram that he doesn't actually know exists right so always should have your due diligence and once again this should just be a an advertisement to cook with your homies dude go make some edibles hey go hop in your group chat right now all you need is literally like like a half ounce an ounce and you can make a small little batch of edibles bro that's all you need you and the homies will have a good [ __ ] time you know what i'm saying listen and you don't even need good kush you can get mids bro you don't even need good [ __ ] but hey that's for another video all right another thing that's very important to talk about specifically i see this on some of these right this is a small little disclaimer that we're going to talk about here is i see some edibles advertise activation time and that then and there should tell you to run if if there's ever a packaging on an edible you purchase that says oh man you'll be stoned in 60 minutes oh dude man activates in 45 minutes dude everyone like it's your digestion dude like everyone digests products differently the only way you could advertise that is if you're spraying it with some boo-boo [ __ ] that does actually activate that quick but if it's actually cooked into the product and you have to digest it right that's a whole different story right that's a whole different story and obviously you can't advertise activation time like that so just what i'm trying to say here in this video guys is is really think before you purchase an edible and it's really sad that the street market has become this way you know when i was young and i first started smoking it was just you'd buy some mids and you buy some mid wax and edibles was something you made with your friends out of one of those two things nobody really sold them unless it was your homie with a tray of brownies who was selling them right pre-packaged edibles were unheard of around me right now that's like the norm everyone's selling this crazy carts [ __ ] fake edible [ __ ] it's crazy man and that's why that's why i make some of these kind of informational videos just spread the word about it dude hey man listen if you're a plug out there selling these shits dude you're guilty okay you should feel terrible about yourself but either way hope you guys enjoyed this video drop a like if you did hope you guys learned something let me know in the comments if you did thank you guys for tuning in i will see you guys next time peace and subscribe if you haven't already peace out everyone", "6J9aM0Gh0iE": "[Music] and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and it's old-school today guys cuz we are taking a look at an edible just like good times good times I mean old times but the old times aren't necessarily good times anymore because here in California we are fully in the new recreational world which includes this ridiculous hundred milligram cap on edibles not just that but makes absolutely crazy packaging requirements for all edibles here in California so what edible are we talking about that is ridiculous today what we are gonna take our first look at Plus gummies that's right another gummy review I normally tell you to avoid the gummies but I have heard a lot of good things about Plus and I am a little curious I'm always hoping to find another gummy I like cushy punch or flourish or Tiki killers that's actually worth something so I'm definitely looking forward to reviewing these plus gummies first thing you're gonna notice is how crazy this packaging is so here it is here is our plus gummies I believe they are sour blueberry blue in case you don't know is objectively the best flavor of everything if there is a multitude of colors and blue is available always go with blue because blue is much like a like a law of thermodynamics or whatever the case may be blue is always the best fruit flavor even though I don't know of any naturally-occurring blue fruits other than blueberries and blue tasting foods are hardly ever blueberries usually blue raspberry or something it's always the best trust me on this though so we have a sealed bag with you know all these insane requirements on it batch number this that and the other I mean it's great because it has all of those wonderful serving sizes and ingredients and all the testing results all this stuff you know I like seeing but it's a bag and then a fancy 10 on the inside I think all edibles now have to be bagged in addition to whatever kind of thing holds the edibles they have to have these sealed maggots it's insane it just boosts up the cost because this uh 100 milligram 20 piece edibles so I believe it's 20 gummies each worth 5 milligrams of THC cost me 20 bucks at my dispensary which is outrageous of course but that is the world we now live in and we shall review it as if it's the world we want to live in who knows I don't know what I'm saying I know I'm sad I'm disappointed that the edible world has changed so much and so for such and in such a shitty direction over the past year but let's stop the bitching and get straight to the review of the plus gummies cannabis infused sour blue berry so we're gonna open up the first layer of the packaging here it looks like it's got a little tear thing nice Oh and then then we got our second layer the zip sealed bag on side of the tear bag and then we gotta figure out how to open this the childproofing I think you ground push down and that breaks the seal yes there we go so second layer of security through now we're finally to our chin on the inside and to the gummies in here ah so here are our blue raspberry or blueberry gummies whatever they call it blue flavored the best 20 gummies in there give it a smell oh definitely a cannabis e odor which is not a bad thing I I'd like to know that there's some cannabis in these but also a hefty flavor and aroma of blue but certainly in a cannabis aroma there as you can see just a bunch of little squares dropped one there and let's pluck it into our mouths but before we do in case this is your first week to review the way they work when we do edibles we reviewed the whole experience I'm gonna eat all 20 of these gummies and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in about two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling because it's you want to know how have it tasted like [ __ ] but you what you really want is it gonna get you [ __ ] up it's gonna get you high are you gonna get what you paid for it and that guy's is what you need to stick around for but first the taste test so here we go first cube in the mouth um very spongy gummies very very spongy almost hard to bite into because they're so Airy um a surprising cannabis taste them it's not awful but there is a 4 what is 5 milligrams of THC in these cubes definitely a cannabis taste to it but the blue the blue sciency flavor counter sex but if you don't like cannabis taste maybe you don't stick with these because you're gonna taste it again not terrible not overwhelming but it is surprisingly noticeable for what is just 5 milligrams of THC so guys I'm gonna eat me about what 16 more of these and I said I'm gonna eat me which is very back woodsy and folksy way of saying I'm gonna eat the rest of these so guys I'll see you in about two hours I'm gonna scarf these down and I'll let you know then if they're worth your money or not so thanks for staying tuned this far sticking around this far sorry guys this is really my second video back here on weeds and this will probably be another video between season 3 and between season 2 and season 3 so forgive my rustiness see you guys in two hours thanks for sticking around 2 hours since I have had the plus cannabis infused gummies looking at the camera for the first time now since coming back the fuse but I also see now I'm saying the word let's just start over one more time BAM I'm back guys it has been 2 hours since I had the plus cannabis infused gummies and I think there was an even yeah it says create on there as well there are a lot of nouns and adjectives and verbs on that packaging I'm really not even sure what it's called I'm just gonna call it plus gummies plus gummies uh guys I am genuinely pretty impressed uh for a gummy and for a hundred milligram edible this brought the heat um I'm not outrageously high but I am at like maybe a 6 somewhere in that range which is way higher than I expected it to be after a hundred milligrams and especially after a gummy I am pretty pleased with this now that is in the relative scale compared to you know this new world of edibles because this is a very expensive product you don't get a lot for your money here compared to the old world but in this new world this is a pretty good little solution um I found myself not maybe quite as high as if they were like akarova or a Kanaka mini cookie situation but for a gummy and for how much less you have to eat then which is very important to me you have to eat a [ __ ] ton of those cookies from like all you know Pete's and Korova and Kanaka all those ones you just mentioned you have to eat like 20 of those you know many cookies to get the hundred milligrams the gummies here were a hell of a lot more manageable that 10 was no problem to eat by myself I didn't didn't feel like a gluttonous badass after consuming that whole thing at all so really really pleased with that aspect um have a cannabis taste for sure but not awful um I didn't feel like retching after eating that not even close there was a cannabis taste but it was not the primary taste and again didn't have that just incredibly bitter kind of almost you know a cynic that Pacific we've tasted no no just the taste is there but then again for as potent as these came you know turned out to be you would expect that so guys this is a a nice win I think I'm I'm pretty impressed with Plus cannabis infused gummies and then also that were to create for some reason on there as well so I'm really happy with this I think I'll be reviewing some more stuff from plus in the future and if you see these in a dispensary near you and you guys want to eat all of something to get the hundred milligrams Jesus it's it's almost easier to recommend this then which is hard to say which is hard to believe actually then like the Kanak o or the kirova because it's just such it's so much easier to do and they're they're sort of equivalently priced you don't get quite as high but it's it's it's easier to it's easier to manage for sure so really surprised me on this one guys and what the [ __ ] let's just shoot the moon here guys I'm gonna throw a cherry on top - my little cherries on top here just little things I like to add that aren't necessarily we related something you can just do to enjoy throughout your week and I'm just gonna throw this one out because I am having an ever-loving blast playing spider-man on the ps4 from insomniac holy [ __ ] guys it's so great to see insomniac get this win I assume this game it's going to be an amazingly huge hit it seems to be it's only a couple days since it's been out but reception seems to be great and it seems to be doing really well sales wise I'm so happy for insomniac I love these guys since the ps1 days back in like Spyro loved them on the ps2 days Ratchet and Clank so my favorite you know 3d action platformers ever even love the resistance franchises back on the ps3 days and then they have been one of the greatest VR developers as well and I'm a big big fan of VR so you know what [ __ ] it I'm going to this endorsement is not for spider-man which is an awesome game I am having an utter blast with it it doesn't rewrite the rules anyway it's it's not a you know changing the genre it's just a hell of a good video game you know it's not rewriting anything but it's it's wonderful I'm having a blast with it but instead this cherry on top is just for insomniac in general they make great great games they've been making great great games for like 20 years I love them as a studio I'm so happy to see them having this huge success with spider-man so insomniac you'll never see this video but great job guys really proud of you and that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review what a great time we had great gummies that were so good here's an extra piece of packaging we had [ __ ] spider-man and insomniac on our cherry on top woohoo this guy's has been a [ __ ] good review let's just acknowledge the fact that everything went aces this time which doesn't often happen so great job plus great job insomniac and great job weed thank you so much for watching this review it's gone way too long and I will see you guys on the next one peace", "BzQ9i6EeCZQ": "all right so boom this is the official Twain 20 guy on how to safely consume weed edibles or any year for that matter because this is time that's advice you know I'm saying so I find that consuming edibles I eating it it's a lot more natural and has a less health risks than smoking anything you smoke and inhale into your lungs as the potential to affect your breathing cars in such as bronchitis and just overall get lungs see lungs other basic necessity of life right but at the point to note that not all edibles are created equal and being knowledgeable of the dosage level that you take is crucial in order for you to actually enjoy and have a good experience rather than be one of those people on YouTube that gives a story time about their worst experience of marijuana [Music] three hours later welcome back to no song edutainment yall already know what's going on subscribe to channel cuz I'm a fun guy I'm a cool guy I go through my day pretty normal like I'm a normal guy I'm a swell guy I'm a nice enough guy I'm a cool kind of guy I'm a pretty groovy guy I call this honest entertain you make you laugh but most importantly educate you on a variety of subjects that make you learn something they can apply it to your own personal personal life so mister my research the general consensus I see for a serving one serving of an edible is about 10 milligrams but not all will be dispensaries created equal like I said before some of them serve a bit more some of them aren't as precise and having each in each serving wrap individually so depending on where you get it from one serving we have a bit more THC than you might expect usually if it does have more THC than the 10 milligrams like limit it should have this image or however you wherever you see this image on the box right there but in the meantime products with too much THC must have these warning labels so I've told you why edibles are better than smoking or vaping me but how and what do you do to actually enjoy it safe so I got about five different steps for you to follow if you listen to me if you listen to me just listen to me you will enjoy your edible experience simple because I know it all I just played so most places require or from what I've seen research most states and my keys most provinces in Canada require a limit of ten milligrams of THC in a serving of edible but my suggestion Prasad is to tone it down a bit more and actually do five milligrams as your basic reduction to an edible cookie gummy bears or whatever so number one is important to read the packaging carefully so that you don't overdose or not overdose you can't really overdose on wheat but you can definitely take too much this easy there go anybody take a tab hallucinate you finished our trip the trip but chill out I got a heartbeat I can't feel [ __ ] so no longer do you have to play Russian roulette with your dosage amounts there's now a legal dosage of ten milligrams as your basic level of attaboy experience but if it isn't made at home then in that case be extra careful with how much you're taking in a given set or given serving size so especially if you're new to cannabis or you don't take it regularly it's important to dip your toe in the water a little bit before you dive in headfirst rather than taking the recommended ten milligrams take instead to five milligrams and then wait another two to three hours before you take another serving size just so that you are easing yourself into the whole edible experience and you can actually enjoy the high rather than you know some of the other stories I've seen on YouTube and even if you are a veteran cannabis user you should also implement my foot dosing which is start with five milligrams or even you start with the ten milligrams wait two or three hours and then add another one why should you do this because it gently stimulates the body's cannon but receptors which results in an increased high or increased mood productivity creativity without the sudden high effect that you might get if you were to just like consumer all I was in fact Oh Oh cookies very important to me I mean I love to me but they mean much more to me Tommy so the high is a bit more noticeable noticeable and more enjoyable like is you're kind of like on a roller coaster type of thing rather than already being at the top right so you're gently taking yourself to that peak or a high rather than just as soon as you get to the rides everyday at the top which is not ideal so again five milligrams as your basic level especially if you're a beginner and then every two or three hours just gradually take another serving size just so that you can safely and enjoyably each edible our number two is important to consider your tolerance having a low THC tolerance makes you susceptible to negative side effects of taking too much weed or taking too much THC such as paranoia anxiety and dizziness definitely without a doubt it's better to have an underwhelming experience than an overwhelming experience where you are shaking your you panicking whatever it is it's better to be disappointed than to be on the other spectrum if I'm gonna say okay do what you want you an adult but take heed take heed all right one word is good enough for the wise so he was so it's your first time trying a screen or not well since you interacted with marijuana in general don't try and keep up with the veteran smoker so don't try keep up with the rest of the crew just go at your own pace because there's it's not a race I see alright I got this off like that got the sauce little ketchup those sauce little ketchup thank you keep up with them because people that consume meet regularly already need a higher dosage to get their desired high effect and this is why I say it's important to take weed tolerance breaks the tolerance breaks for weed are important because it allows you to get higher for a longer period of time so your high or not it won't be like twenty minutes it'd be like two plus hours or so and you can get high on a small amount of weed which results in savings yeah I put it all together see it and trying to save y'all money I'm looking out for you looking out for your pockets so take means haulin sprigs periodically so that you can continue to not need a higher dosage and that your high can also last for a longer period of time simple so number three it just be patient like I said be patient with the THC and how it how long it takes to affect you depending on your metabolism and your body fat it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two or maybe even a few hours so these snacks are not like your regular snacks at the grocery store or the corniche story these aren't regular snacks that you can - to eat as you're watching a Netflix videos or Netflix shows or movies whatever it is take heed to the serving size and be patient for 330 minutes any for 30 minutes to two hours if you feel the pips this is the moment you feel the effect is when you can like perhaps take another one but even at that let it right out for a bit on number four you want to be mindful of your stomach's contents so the more food you have in your system the longer it will take for weed to get metabolized in your bloodstream and take effect however in empty stomach I lost with the edibles to activate Kruger so just keep it just keep that in mind when and if you are eating edible did you eat already because if you didn't it'll take effect quicker and if you haven't eaten already before it then start with half a dose or what you usually take or what you want to take just so that you know just you can slow yourself in micro dosing same as the same thing micro dosing is the wave don't just jump in and if you drank alcohol beforehand alcohol can increase the THC blood concentration in your system so it's important to use caution if you're mixing alcohol with edibles and number five just this is more of like the nurture you know they say nature is the nature this is more of an immature type of thing it just be mindful of the environment like are you around people that you or as you care about you want people that care about you right and are you comfortable around these people so if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or long much more it's better take it at your home with your loved one or parent or francica with it your brother sibling romantic partner whatever it is just be around if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or just in general you are taking a new strain it's best to be around people that you actually are familiar with and you actually care about just to that part of for you to experience some type of anxiety or panic attack or just seeing a familiar face will keep you a bit more grounded if you did end up eating so much but again the more experience you have the more likely you are to be comfortable the easier it is for you to be comfortable in different situations or different environments but yeah so my kudos take it easy five milligrams or as your basis for anything for the most part and then just gradually increase your high once you start feeling the effects and its best it's always better to have an underwhelming experience then an overwhelming experience londo and take these five steps into consideration you will have a very enjoyable read hi and again have other videos above or edibles from marijuana lay the topics in the description pink ominous video and we showed with an addiction to read if you like you're smoking too much or you feel like it's no longer serving you I will hold mini course mini program that dancing walk you through steps you need to

weeks the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary guys it's really hot and because it's so hot we're gonna do ourselves a hot review I don't actually know what that means I just thought I would say it what we are gonna do is we're gonna do a follow up review on plus gummies the ever-present ubiquitous plus gummies see them everywhere here in Southern California this is the uplift sour watermelon flavor I reviewed them about a year ago I think they're blue raspberry flavor liked it quite a bit on found them to be very pleasant tasting and to be quite potent but in that year they have grown and grown and grow and I see billboards for them everywhere and it is sometimes true in this industry where a company will get really big really quickly and in their quality starts to drop so I decided to go and take a second look at Plus here a year later see if I like it just as much as I did at the beginning especially with their brand is expanding I think they're doing mints now so let's just without any further adieu here go ahead and take a look at these plus uplift sour watermelon gummies so I actually went ahead and took off the plastic wrap because I knew I was gonna have trouble with it but I have not opened it yet I can actually smell them they smell very very pungent not weedy just very fruity that watermelons scent is quite strong okay so I've got it unscrewed there there are the gummies hope you can see them there don't want to pour them out that is 25 milligrams sour watermelon gummies plus gummies five milligrams each and I will be eating all 20 of these probably over the next 30 40 minutes or so unlike all our weeks reviews I'll come back to you guys two hours after they consume the last one unless you know exactly what I thought of the whole product how I got all that good stuff so plus is pretty affordable they routinely sell for about 20 bucks which is what I picked these up for any legal dispensary in Long Beach which is on the low end of the hundred milligram edibles so that's a good thing you always like your edibles to be affordable and I remember them tasting great as well so here we go very gelatinous very very soft gummy mmm wow that is a cute that's really good sorry guys my dog is gonna go crazy if I don't do this um that's as good as I remember the blue raspberry except not really because no flavor is better than blue raspberry there is a little bit of a weedy aftertaste now just a little bit but that first hit is a great great little gummy snacks if it weren't for the weedy aftertaste I would have no problem eating these sour watermelon gummies just pop them right in speaking of which let's do a couple more of them here now they got sandy fingers oh yeah now that punch mmm sandy gummies okay well so far looking really good impressions are super positive on these but we've done nothing important all I've done is a taste test and told you how much they cost what's important is two hours after I eat this last one am I gonna be pretty [ __ ] high I hope so I think you probably hope so so I will be sure to let you guys know I'm really excited to find out if they're as good as they were before so stay tuned right here and I'll see you guys back here in just a moment ciao dogs three and a half hours actually since I had my first plus gummy and spaced them out over about an hour or so and I am pleased to tell you that these three three and a half hours later I am still pretty buzzed these are as good as I remember they even taste a little better than I remember and I remember them tasting good the only thing is they have a slight weed aftertaste but in comparison to most gummy edibles it's it's they're delicious 20 bucks low end of a hundred milligram edible costs here in Southern California so a great deal and they're potent I mean these are on me you know these are as strong as any other gummy at the 100 milligram level and they just happen to taste a little bit better and a little bit cheaper so I I guess they I am pretty happy with my plus there wish I had some more to be honest um so yeah a big thumbs up still for Plus look forward to reviewing some more of their stuff now that I know they're branching out in those mints and all that other kind of stuff if they're half as good as their gummies I'll be uh I hope I'll be just as pleased uh well guys that's gonna do it for this review then that was the plus up lift sour watermelon gummies they tasted good to me big big thumbs up and before I go here guys I'm gonna give you a little cherry on top something that Yuka you kiddin you know enjoy with or without weed just to uh you know a little recommendation for you so this week I'm gonna recommend the thing that has been overtaking my life in the past two weeks and the Fire Emblem three houses is that the name of it on switch it's pretty pathetic I don't know it because I've been I have played maybe 60 hours in about two weeks which for me is pretty obscene but I am absolutely loving it if you don't know anything about it it's basically the strategy game blended with a sort of Harry Potter ish kind of skin and it's great if you like any kind of strategy RPG game you have a switch Fire Emblem three houses get yourself hooked it's crack and that guys is gonna then do it for the cherry on top which is then going to do it for this review and what's gonna do for everything so to recap + uplift super good Fire Emblem three houses maybe even better alright guys thanks so much for watching and we will see you all on the next review goodbye", "9EUFCgxEVYs": "[Music] hey everybody jay ping here checking in live respectmyregion.com back with another west coast we tour review 2020 edition today super excited because man i visited steezy downtown la the other day picked up a nice group of items these little assorted bits beets i'm not sure 20 pieces a bunch of different colors bunch of different flavors i'm super excited hundred milligrams in this container are you guys ready it says low calorie gluten free let's see what else what else what else 4.78 milligrams of serving this package actually only has 95.54 milligrams of thc so always read the packaging because you're not actually getting a hundred it says total 100 milligrams on the front on the sticker 95 milligrams dhc take a view of the colors of these gummies i'm pretty excited got the green pink orange blue purple red look got a bunch of these here look at that red one oh almost dropped it so you know an assorted colors here super excited let's check it out one i'm gonna eat two of these today one bite i'll talk about the first one two bites we'll give it the official score you guys know what's good and the rules here we go first one what color should we go with chris what do you think purple i like your style i'm a grape guy so this is perfect this is a great way to start i'm really judgy about grape flavored [ __ ] it's really it's really sticky like it tastes good it's light it's not a great flavor at all unfortunately i don't know what flavor it is but it's really sticky it's slightly sweet it's berry something i don't know if it's grape does it say can just say what the flavors are peel here let's see let me see if let me see if there's something here peel here ah here we go here we go here we go here we go oh yep it has the flavors oh it's not grape it's black cherry interesting okay so the flavors black cherry orange green apple strawberry watermelon and blue raspberry cool now that i know that just ate the black cherry that was pretty good it's a sour black cherry against your sour so it was slightly sour all right that makes sense way more sense second color blind taste test don't tell me don't tell me what i get all right now you guys see here we go what'd i get chris i can't tell you oh all right so i have no clue what [Music] strawberry okay hmm all right so very chewy it's stuck in my tooth it makes me think of the consistency between like the dots times starbursts and chewiness and like stickiness and like how you have to get it off your teeth it takes like some effort but also there is a very much like a uh uh what is it the uh sour patch kids yes there's a very much a sour patch kid aspect to this it's not quite sweet enough i can't give them that these are slight these are definitely tart i wouldn't say they're sour though at least for the black cherry and the strawberry uh those two again let me see do these they don't really have individual smells let me see what we got here presentation beautiful front label sticker there that was in the top of the lid i love it they've got the warning labels on it all appeal you know i gotta say the steezy does a great job of presentation i'm going to give these a solid 10 out of 10 appeal um sour gummy cubes i'll give it a 9.5 there's nothing that makes me feel like this is healthy whatsoever um color super wonderful branding the colors of the gummies are all super on point like i feel like that's all good 10 out of 10 smell definitely don't get me if these gummies had individual smells with each of the gummies i'd give it a perfect score but they don't and because of that that's ah man to me that's like a 7.5 on the score because there's just no smell to this jar whatsoever so it's just smells like sweet candy although that's what candy should smell like that's why they get a the 75 because it's like okay cool they get the candy smell right like that's it but like i really needed like five different flavors of stuff uh potency let's see uh total of 100 milligrams thc but this pack specifically only had 95.54 a little disappointing right but to be expected right it's hard to get this 100 dialed in if that's not your model so it's tough um potency i gotta give you guys you know it's not a hundred milligrams it's five milligrams less i'm going to give you guys an eight out of ten that's kind of hurting there taste i did like the black cherry i thought the strawberry made sense afterwards it was nice and light and kind of tart uh taste uh uh you know to read the full to get the full taste score i'll have to eat a few more of these and then make sure you guys check back into the written review or in the description that'll kind of help that but for now i'll give it a give it a i'll give it a 7.5 out of 10. um not not that sour and not a very strong flavor that made me know exactly what it was if that was grape would have been hyped but it wasn't um purple usually goes with a grape flavor let's see let's see let's see experience experience so far is around a 7.5 to an eight out of ten again i wish there would have been a smell i wish there would have been greater flavors kind of hard to identify what all the flavors are unless you peel the sticker off i was always bad at reading directions i assume lots of other people are makes it going to be tough for them to figure out what these flavors actually are so in my experience i'll give it a i'll give it an 8 out of 10. more information there is a lot of information on there i notice again steezy does a great job of uh you know educating and teaching and they're good with pads and vendor days that they stop all out of their stores so i give it to them for that it's tough i'll give them i give them the information was there it was peelable i'll give them a nine i'll give them a nine out of ten what i recommend i would recommend probably some other different versions of these gummies i've had better ones than these from them but i definitely would recommend this 8 out of 10 solid recommendation the only time i would recommend switching away from this is if there's a specific flavor you want or if you feel like price point it's kind of that kind of choice for you or you know maybe get a better deal so that uh overall i'm going to give them an 8.5 out of 10 but we'll cut we'll also see what our slider method kind of aggregates it to once we enter in all the exact scores so stay tuned i appreciate you guys for all the love we've got the steezy bits here 20 assorted flavors a lot of good ones a nice sour candy look at all these cool colors that we've got here um i love the experience man stevie you guys do a great job i look forward to doing some more work with you all please stay tuned for more reviews facebook instagram twitter linkedin youtube man we're all over the place respect my region here with the west coast we tour shout out to chris for filming everything it's a long day of work

folks make sense of your dispensary uh accidentally jumped the gun forgot to record this once so i already opened this package that was just a moment ago haven't eaten anything welcome to weeds guys with a review show here on welcome to wheats everyone the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary classic ass episode today which means yes a good old-fashioned edible and one of the most old-fashioned kinds of weed edibles the gummy that's right we're taking a look at wanna one of the makers of the cannabis infused sour gummies these ones your standard 100 milligram edible 10 different uh pieces at 10 each however these ones are also a cbd blend uh at a ratio that they actually have listed incorrectly there of 10 to one even though it should be one to ten the way they have it listed in that it is 10 milligrams of thc per piece one milligram of cbd per piece 100 milligrams of thc total 10 milligrams of cbd total in this package in these strawberry gummies i picked this up and i accidentally already opened it was recording didn't realize my bad haven't tried any i picked these up for 18 bucks at a dispensary here in long beach california which is a slight premium i would say over there traditional gummy edibles which probably average about 15 so a definite premium there not a whole lot but something to notice and again it doesn't have that nominal amount of cbd in it which i'm curious if it's going to have an effect on me that's not a lot of cbd i'm guessing it probably won't but we'll be on the lookout for it um and on here as well as all the good stuff you want to see they've got lab testing results although this is nearly a year old at this point which is a little disconcerting but whatever uh nutrition information all that good stuff so let's go ahead and take a look at the most important stuff the gummies themselves these 18 gummies and here you go looks just like that 10 of these squares in there oh smells very strawberry not very weedy at all mostly just strawberry well let's go ahead and give it a bite give it a test see what it's like gummy weedy strawberry a lot of wheat flavor actually more wheat flavor than i was expecting not grotesque but for the gummy candies higher than average but otherwise a totally fine gummy candy nice soft chewy okay well i would say in terms of taste a slightly weedier taste than your like plus or your steezy gummies but not revolting in any shape or form but it's there uh but of course guys it's not the taste that we're in this for trying to figure out if they're gonna work or not are they gonna make you hide and for that well that's what we're gonna have to wait around and see um so uh any time i do gummies i like to try to do them under the optimal conditions i don't think i said this i did have a little bit of fat beforehand just to make sure it's going to hit me just right not necessarily for you or for everybody i do it just in case so i had a little bit of fat before just for the optimal thc absorption um but it's still going to take a while to hit the old bloodstream so i'm going to finish these gummies off of the next i don't know hour so do all 10 as we do here on wheats we review the whole product i'm going to review them over the next or as i said eat them over the next hour and then two hours after i have that last one or thereabouts i'll come back to you guys and give you our wrap-up thoughts the most important part of the edible review is it gonna get us high and for that guys you're just gonna have to stick around and i'll be back in just a bit to let you know our wrap-up thoughts about these wanna sour strawberry gummies well here's one for the blooper reels guys i'm back two hours two and a half hours later with these wanna cannabis infused sour gummies uh and as you can see with my eyes they are pure as the driven snow uh and i came here with a really bad review i was gonna come and really trash them as i was like these are pretty um non-existent non-existent in terms of the high that i feel from these wanna cannabis infused sour gummies uh and i was gonna say something along the effects of well maybe it's the 10 to 1 ratio and maybe that little 10 percent of that welcome back to wheats guys it has been two and a half hours since my first uh bite at the wanna cannabis infused sour gummies and if i look very very sober you're correct um i this guys is gonna be one for the blooper reel uh i came here to excoriate the uh folks at wanna i'm saying that these gummies basically did nothing to me all ten of them felt practically nothing and i was originally going to think well maybe it has something to do with that um strange 1 to 10 ratio of cbd to thc and maybe just that 10 cbd was enough to totally blunt the thc and but not provide any of those cbd benefits that was just i've said i was gonna feel like i felt just kind of peaceful but that's about it not really high at all uh and that's because that is actually the case uh i had it wrong not them well actually the bud bud tender had it wrong uh i ordered the one to ten and they gave me the ten to one uh so this really is 10 cbd milligrams to 1 thc so this is 100 milligrams of ca cbd 10 milligrams of thc the exact opposite of what i thought it was um at least i know that i know when i'm high or not and i was definitely not high in any traditional sense with these but that's on me not on them this one's for the blooper reel we'll have to review wanna again in the future this was just a fun little [ __ ] up um and an 18 mistake so uh wanna i am sorry i uh did not mean to disparage i don't know anything about you just yet i do know that my bud tender [ __ ] up the order uh oh well uh [ __ ] happens but we will check you out again in the future apologize for that it's been fun it's been funny anyways that's gonna do it that's gonna do it for this non-existent review here on wheats no cherry on top just a big shame on me thank you so much for watching guys stay high and more importantly stay healthy and we'll see you guys right back here for our next review live stream or even [ __ ] up see you then

we're not talking about Peter Barnes but I'm on camera one because they're good too because they're high in fat and three because we're actually reviewing a hundred million gummy bears what's correct we are reviewing the ED of your 100 milligram Getti gummy bears today looking at in another this is another in this series if that appeared that we're going to be reviewing smaller dose to the last time we took these if history is going to repeat them itself these will taste awful and won't get me that high I'm hoping against hope that both of those things aren't true but there are no guarantees so the peanut butter minims just that just bad to help me get some of this as the best part of this th e so that's why I'm eating news those are gonna taste so much better than these I have a feeling alright let's open it up here oh man I thought last time this packaging was easy to open but now it's not looking so good balls all right I'm gonna have to grow grab some scissors technical difficulties back that's a negative anytime you have to go for the scissors she'd never have to do that finally finally let's give it a sniff oh man Oh smells like gummy bears with weed here we go that is awful oh and it gets worse it's got that harsh aftertaste oh oh they're so bad oh why would you do this to yourself and get gummies guys why why candies and goes-- why I don't understand it I really don't but I'm willing to keep doing it for you guys just because you seem to like them I I I'm not sure I get it so the head of pure 100 milligram gummies guys I'm going to finish these bad boys off not looking forward to it and I will see you in two hours to let you know how they are feeling and let's hope against hope one last time that they are the exception to the rule and I am coming to you blazed in two hours but not too optimistic see you two hours peace it has been two hours since I had the head of your gummy bears 100 milligrams and nothing really I can't say nothing I little high it's sort of as equivalent if I had maybe smoked a small bowl recently so on about in line with what I thought not a good value proposition at ten dollars not at all they tasted awful tasted really really bad and I'm not very high there isn't really a lot to say about the etta pure gummy bears and then they taste terrible and they really don't get you that high I have a few more and appears to review and I hope things turn around for them and again I want to I do want to say that I think these are more potent than like the infused creations that I've had so take that as you will but you know just gummies and candies just don't do it for me they may do it for you edibles you know can everybody experiences them a little bit differently maybe they just don't seem to work but I'm willing to give ed up here a fair shake in the future reviews guys and I hope you will too should you stick around for future reviews and thank you so much for watching this episode we'll

Happy Trails out there by [Music]", "UqzhgZjdpAo": "what's up everybody my name is Sara Vee and welcome back to the haze today I'm gonna be doing another review I'm gonna be viewing the BAM Camino by the very famous brand Kiva confection now you probably recognize the name Kiba because of their chocolate products that you see at most stores they're very well known for them they're very very delicious but today I'm gonna be talking about their gummies now this is the Bliss they do other flavors but I'm gonna be talking specifically about the Bliss which is their hybrid gummy let's talk a little bit about this awesome container it comes in a tin container which I really love it keeps the flavor really nice and fresh it is all summer themed and in the front they'll tell you how much milligrams which is a hundred for the entire one in every little gummy is five milligrams in the back it will also give you you know all the nutrition facts that you're counting your calories if you're trying to get high on a diet that will be there for you to open it it's just a quick little push down and turn voila and you'll find your gummies on the inside too it does give you a little bit more information on why they're called Caminos which I really love when an edible company kind of gives you that it kind of sets the scene it gets you in the mood for getting high every little gummy looks like this look at that little gummy how cute it is and it is five milligrams now the taste is delicious they're very tasty they're nice and sweet they're not crazy crazy good but they kind of remind you of movie theater candy like chewy sweet and something you just want to shove in your mouth all day for the high because these come with 20 of five milligrams your will needle II eat a lot of candy to really get super blown if you're willing to go down that road more power to you're willing to down twenty of these but I would say this edible is best use and best for people who are trying to micro dose specifically for the fact that every one of those little gummies is five milligrams if you're kind of a lightweight or you're doing something that you don't need to be high doesn't it take a little bit of the edge off even one or two of these or eating just one or even half of one if you're looking for a 2.5 is really great and it makes micro dosing so much easier with these guys yeah I can't say enough about how how nice these are for micro dosing and how great these are for also traveling if you're someone who gets nervous going on an airplane or something like that these are great because you won't get to blown where you'll get like super paranoid but you'll get high enough to take a little bit of that edge off which is really great if you're looking for something and that's gonna get you super high if you're looking at like go to a party and you don't drink it but you want to be stoned as hell these I'd I wouldn't it wouldn't be my first choice maybe if you have a slower tolerance or you're just getting into edibles this is for you especially if this is gonna be your first edible a try splitting one of these small gummies is so easy and they have like had like a fake little line between them that can kind of give you a little idea where to split it right in the middle these are awesome if you are working from home like a lot of us are these are great for that too because you won't get high you won't feel stupid you can get your job done but it also helps with a little bit of shaving off a little bit of that anxiety which is great yeah if you guys see these which see them a lot I've seen the prices range I've seen them from twenty dollars all the way up to thirty dollars so I guess it just depends on what dispenser you pick them up from these were pretty average for me nothing crazy that's before tap that's after tax and everything so if you guys see them out of dispensary if you got some extra dollars in your pocket I would say pick up the Camino by the Kiva you won't be disappointed you'll get high you might not get superstone but you'll get there so alright guys well that's my review for the day my name is Sarah P again

review we review number 10 today I'm doing something a little bit different we're going to do an edible review it is Incredibles indica Fruit Chews it's a hundred milligrams each one of these is ten milligrams and there's ten of them in there so each one of these right here is ten milligrams so I'm gonna go ahead and give those a try I'm gonna pause the video wait till I start feeling the effects and then I'll start the video back up again and we'll see where we go from there are these it's been about 20 minutes and yeah they're pretty effective you can feel it right off the bat I'm sure as time goes on as time progresses they get stronger and stronger but about 20-25 minutes in boom you can definitely feel that they're definitely there it's you know I mean it's definitely very very very effective no indica I don't know how you're going to feel the difference between indica and sativa when you're eating when you're eating edibles I don't know because it affects your body so much I don't know how you would be able to feel the difference between an indica and a sativa but these are in different shoes so yeah I don't know you know I'll be able to tell but um yeah these are pretty effective the price point for these ten of these gummies which equals a little over a hundred milligrams cost $17 they were on special for $17 I think they were normally like $19 or $18 so they weren't special for $70 I think it's well worth it for seventeen dollars you get blasted out in your brain basically 100 milligrams is pretty good thousand milligrams is insane so yeah we just keep trucking with that once again it's your boy Seth we would do Channel Denver coming to you with another weed review and a mouthpiece you", "Qqm0eS5nKmw": "okay so in my current attempt to worry less and experiment more I'm coming out of a sixteen and a half hour fast into this is a candy bar with a hundred milligrams of THC see how it is okay so when you finally wrestle with the childproof packaging which is also micro proof you get this it's a pretty little gold bar it's pretty being that this is the first carbs I've had in a few days it's actually really good you actually don't get a hint about cannabis flavor and who raped you oh no how far hundred milligrams are gonna take me cuz I believe I have a pretty high dollar okay so it has been one hour since I had my candy bar and while I wouldn't say that I feel high I I feel good there's definitely an edge gone a little bit of a body low I'm very uh positive okay now it has been to two hours since I ate my candy bar and now yeah I'm high I'm very tingly and they calm my body weighs a lot it turns out that 100 milligrams just write him out for me okay it has now been three hours since I ate my candy bar now I'm feeling just absolutely fantastic you'll notice the we're on the road because we've had to go buy 20 cheeseburgers I love you okay so 100 milligram bar we're probably five six hours now when I lost count awesome I really think I could even help my dosage coolest thing about all this is just the availability of something like this it was $25 at the dispensary the fact that something like that exists at

taste\u00a0\u00a0 like and all that good stuff i'll even walk\u00a0\nthrough what is delta 8. i do have a prior\u00a0\u00a0 video that i made that goes through what is delta\u00a0\neight so you can watch that if you don't wanna\u00a0\u00a0 hear about what the gummy bears are like but you\u00a0\nwanna go straight into the what is delta eight so\u00a0\u00a0 right now on our site we carry delta eight in two\u00a0\ndifferent flavors we've got a few other flavors on\u00a0\u00a0 the way but for right now we've got two flavors\u00a0\non the site we've got a berry white which is an\u00a0\u00a0 indica indica is really good at night for sleep\u00a0\nbut it's got all the same benefits as the sativa\u00a0\u00a0 which is really good in the daytime because it\u00a0\ndoesn't make you as drowsy the sativa comes in\u00a0\u00a0 an orange crush flavor and the indica comes\u00a0\nin a very white flavor they're both delicious\u00a0\u00a0 the whole container has 30 gummy bears in it\u00a0\nthere's 750 milligrams in each container so each\u00a0\u00a0 gummy has about 25 milligrams of delta eight\u00a0\nin it so these are the two we carry right now\u00a0\u00a0 we also have these little sample packs so if you\u00a0\ndo order anything from mypaynecenter.com and you\u00a0\u00a0 want to try delta8 but maybe you're not willing to\u00a0\nmake the commitment right now to a whole bottle of\u00a0\u00a0 delta 8 just let us know in the notes section\u00a0\nhey i want to try a delta eight sample can i\u00a0\u00a0 get a sample and we will send you a sample so\u00a0\ntoday i'm going to take a sample of the indica\u00a0\u00a0 the barry white um because about 9 30 almost 9 45\u00a0\nhere at night and i'm probably gonna try to go to\u00a0\u00a0 bed by eleven eleven thirty so this should kick\u00a0\nin way before then and we're gonna have a great\u00a0\u00a0 night's sleep so i'm gonna take this now and\u00a0\nthen i'll walk you through what is delta eight\u00a0\u00a0 okay so here we go so it's just like\u00a0\nthis okay so i'm gonna eat it it's chewy it's pretty sweet too a little sour but\u00a0\nit's like a mixture it's like a sour bear i should also note the delta eight can\u00a0\nshow up on a drug test because there is\u00a0\u00a0 thc in it not the thc that's in the\u00a0\ndelta eight like there's delta a\u00a0\u00a0 thc and then there's delta nine thc and\u00a0\ni'm going to tell you the difference so i will say the gummy bear was sweet and sour it\u00a0\nwas a good taste you could taste the berry in it\u00a0\u00a0 there is like a slight aftertaste to it like a\u00a0\num like a bitter aftertaste to it so it's not\u00a0\u00a0 as smooth as a cbd gummy where you can't taste\u00a0\nany cbd in it you definitely can taste in the\u00a0\u00a0 aftertaste that there is something in this but\u00a0\nit's not gross or overpowering or overwhelming\u00a0\u00a0 but just be aware that there is an aftertaste\u00a0\nokay so we're gonna let that seep through my body\u00a0\u00a0 it is actually 9 54 right now so we can keep\u00a0\ntime on how long it takes for this gummy bear\u00a0\u00a0 to really take impact on me so what is delta eight\u00a0\nokay so i'm gonna i'm gonna make it really simple\u00a0\u00a0 there's delta eight which is\u00a0\nwhat we're talking about today\u00a0\u00a0 and then there's weed and in weed there's thc\u00a0\nand that thc makes you high paranoid stone\u00a0\u00a0 increases your anxiety whatever it does to you\u00a0\nmay make your mouth dry it may make you hungry all\u00a0\u00a0 that stuff that that's weed thc also called delta\u00a0\n9 thc okay this is delta 8 thc the difference\u00a0\u00a0 is a carbon bond and that's what makes the what\u00a0\nmakes them different now they both have the same\u00a0\u00a0 properties to them in the sense of what they can\u00a0\ndo for you they have the same benefits per se\u00a0\u00a0 so just like when you smoke weed to relax to lower\u00a0\nyour anxiety lower your stress chill out calm down\u00a0\u00a0 maybe use it for pain relief anxiety relief\u00a0\nsleep maybe usually for nausea maybe use it\u00a0\u00a0 as an appetite stimulant delta eight will do all\u00a0\nof that for you as well but delta eight will not\u00a0\u00a0 make you high stoned increase your anxiety make\u00a0\nyou paranoid make your mouth dry but this is\u00a0\u00a0 legal and you can buy it without either a medical\u00a0\nmarijuana id or for buying it from a dealer behind\u00a0\u00a0 the garbage can or i don't know i don't know how\u00a0\npeople buy drugs these days i'm really not sure\u00a0\u00a0 um but this is legal because it comes from a hemp\u00a0\nplant so it is legal under the farm bill of 2018.\u00a0\u00a0 i should also note though that this does have\u00a0\ndelta 9 or weed thc in it less than 0.3 percent\u00a0\u00a0 because if it's more than 0.3 it's not legal\u00a0\nanymore in the united states but if it's less\u00a0\u00a0 than point three percent it is legal however\u00a0\nthat means it will show up on your drug test\u00a0\u00a0 so be careful if you are going to have these\u00a0\nokay so i'm just gonna let it sink in um and\u00a0\u00a0 i'll just keep reporting out to you guys as i go\u00a0\nthrough my process here okay y'all i had to go\u00a0\u00a0 lay down because then it started to hit me and\u00a0\ni was like oh my god so how do i feel it is now 10 36 so it's been what is that 40 minutes yeah\u00a0\nit's been 40 minutes since i took the gummy\u00a0\u00a0 um i've been watching tik tok videos\u00a0\nso probably not the best thing to do\u00a0\u00a0 if you're trying to go to sleep but uh\u00a0\ni feel relaxed i feel calm i am feeling\u00a0\u00a0 drowsy like i can feel my eyelids getting heavy\u00a0\num they started watering for a hot minute too i feel kind of like heavy if that makes\u00a0\nsense like i'm lying down and i just feel\u00a0\u00a0 heavy not fat heavy though i don't\u00a0\nknow what's going on over here but like\u00a0\u00a0 just you know like when you're sleeping and\u00a0\nyou're just dead weight yeah i feel like i'm\u00a0\u00a0 already like a dead weight like i think my body\u00a0\nis already sleeping and it's like shut up now\u00a0\u00a0 and turn this off and go to bed so i'm gonna do\u00a0\nthat i'm gonna go to sleep and then i'll report\u00a0\u00a0 back to you guys tomorrow morning how i slept and\u00a0\nhow i feel until then good night good morning so\u00a0\u00a0 i slept great uh i went to bed around i think it\u00a0\nwas like 10 30 when i stopped talking to you guys\u00a0\u00a0 i was feeling sleepy at that point i wouldn't\u00a0\nsay i felt high or stoned or euphoric but i\u00a0\u00a0 definitely felt something and i've been trying to\u00a0\nthink of the word to use to explain it but like\u00a0\u00a0 nothing was spinning nothing was dizzy but i\u00a0\ncould feel a shift in my body but it wasn't like\u00a0\u00a0 a bad shift but i knew something was happening\u00a0\nbut it wasn't like concerning or anything but\u00a0\u00a0 i just want to let you guys know that so that\u00a0\nyou don't feel that i didn't tell you that if\u00a0\u00a0 you do start to feel that it was totally normal\u00a0\num fell into a really deep sleep like i could\u00a0\u00a0 tell i was in a deep sleep according to this my\u00a0\nscore was a 95 out of 100 which was great sleep\u00a0\u00a0 um i i did i did notice that i was in such a deep\u00a0\nsleep that i usually have to wake up in the middle\u00a0\u00a0 of the night to pee um for those of you under\u00a0\n30 and don't know what that feels like enjoy it\u00a0\u00a0 because the minute you turn 30 um like at least\u00a0\nfor me when i turn 30 and now i wake up to pee\u00a0\u00a0 in the middle of the night and i had i struggled\u00a0\na little bit trying to get up because i was in\u00a0\u00a0 such a deep sleep i couldn't wake myself up to\u00a0\ngo and do that like it was like it was a fight\u00a0\u00a0 you know what i mean like my bladder was like let\u00a0\nme out and my resume my body was like no we're\u00a0\u00a0 not going anywhere so there was that and then in\u00a0\nthe morning um even at 8 am i probably could have\u00a0\u00a0 slept more um that would have given me nine hours\u00a0\nof sleep and i could have slept more but the other\u00a0\u00a0 good thing about this is like when i woke up and i\u00a0\ngot myself to wake up because of my alarm clock i\u00a0\u00a0 didn't feel groggy so like i used to take advil pm\u00a0\nand if i woke up before it was time to wake up i\u00a0\u00a0 would feel groggy i just shook this off like so i\u00a0\nam uh excited about these i think these are great\u00a0\u00a0 i'm gonna definitely use them on the weekends um\u00a0\ndefinitely do not use these before you're driving\u00a0\u00a0 a vehicle or if you have to wake up early like say\u00a0\nyou only get five six seven hours of sleep stay\u00a0\u00a0 away from these but these are like my new favorite\u00a0\nthing i cannot wait for the weekend to try one\u00a0\u00a0 of these i will be back with a daytime video on\u00a0\nthe orange crush since it's a sativa it's really\u00a0\u00a0 good for the daytime so i will be back with this\u00a0\nreview but for then i will talk to you guys later", "QImpKpJ-QZE": "[Music] what's up poopypants is welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today's review is a bit of a classic which means edibles and today we are taking a look at spacejam cannabis infused sour gummy space drops and their handmade vegan cannabis treats so the box here is about all the information you want to see on it we've got lab tested results right there made then batch number all that good stuff and at the front we've got our milligram each eight point seven to perserve per serving for eighty seven point seven two milligrams total it was advertised as a hundred milligram edible but it looks like it only has eighty seven point seven two milligrams of THC oh this is a gummy of some kind but I'm not really sure exactly what they are sour gummy space drops let's find out together guys elevate your being with Space Jam okay so here we go inmate oh [ __ ] [ __ ] there are little drops just in a thing that looks just like this some paper Hana in there there's not much to it there as you can see the drops are in there let's give them a taste it was a pretty sour definitely definitely some cannabis taste to it gummies usually do not too bad it's better factious sour flavor and this sort of sugary salary crystals you can see there do a very good job of masking this THC I like the flavors quite a bit um it's pretty good they're a little chewy a little sour but all things considered this is a pretty fine tasting little gummy edible maybe it's the fact that it's made with premium ice hash water hash whatever the hell that is so guys I'm about to go see a movie this new one with Melissa McCarthy that doesn't look like a Melissa McCarthy movie as soon as that movie's over with and don't worry guys with all our reviews I'm gonna finish all ten of these drops gonna go see this movie gonna come out about two hours or so let you know what I think of the movie and more importantly what I think of these space jims cannabis infused sour gummy space drops I think I got all those nouns and adjectives there alright guys I will see in about two hours thanks for watching weeks and I'll see you in just a bit [Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been two hours since I whoa no that's a lie it has been actually closer to four hours since I've had a space gem cannabis infused sour gummy space drops uh I finished up my movie and the title of that by the way was can you ever forgive me with Melissa McCarthy true story weird movie but what you're really here for space gems they're pretty good guys I actually really like the taste of them for gummies they tasted pretty good uh they have an excellent sour sort of snap that really matched the cannabis flavor and then most importantly they got me pretty high um this isn't the top tier gummy brand out there right now this isn't like Plus which is truly amazing but this does proclaim to have a little bit less milligram \u00e4j-- however and I neglected to mention in the first half it is actually a little bit more expensive this time uh this one cost me 20 something dollars whereas the Plus usually run about 15 pre-tax so this was a little bit more expensive for a little bit less of a high and I actually really like the way the Plus tastes as well so my recommendation to you is if your dispensary has both plus gummies and space gem try with the bullet stick with the plus but if you're looking for something a little different and this is the only gummy they've got I'd still recommend space gems again it's got a great flavor not a lot to eat not so much of a fan of the packaging as they almost all spilled out on me but they are a little pricey and they're not gonna get you quite as high I don't think it's the plus but still pretty good so before I bounce with you guys today I actually want to share with you a little cherry on top a little something and not weed related that you can enjoy throughout your week and this week I actually want to share with you the camera I'm using I picked up a GoPro Hero 7 black I've been using it to shoots in these videos finally got a better microphone on it and I love it it's great it's actually worked really well just as a little point and shoot camera for me for shooting reats videos and it's the hyperlapse stuff there are the hyper smoothing whatever they call it has been fantastic I've loved shooting some montages with it really cool really like the GoPro Hero 7 black and very strangely I was as I was deciding to do this as an endorsement billboard right up there so you know maybe that's what they were asking me to do I don't know all right guys well that's gonna do it for this cherry on top that's the GoPro Hero 7 black and that's gonna do it for this review the space gem handmade vegan and cannabis treats thank you so much for watching guys and we will see you on the next review peace", "obJwJv5JPzg": "[Music] what's up boner biters and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary decided to do a little bit of traveling today and buy travel I just mean about a mile away from my place here in beautiful Signal Hill California Long Beach right down there is looking a little hazy today so not quite the view what I was hoping but really I was here because I have a new camera that I want to play with so if the sound sounds terrible that's because it's just using the camera's native microphone and I suck and if the image is terrible it's because the sun's right there and I haven't looked at a few finder so we're just gonna do this one rock wild guys let me disturb hello guys and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I am sorry if I sound a little shitty I'm testing out a new camera that does not have an external mic so it's just the little microphone inside the camera today my apologies also I'm sorry if that sign sucks I don't have a viewfinder right now but what I do have for you guys is a really elaborate package one that I'm sure I'm gonna have trouble opening it is district edibles cannabis infused gummies indica raspberry hundred milligrams and as you can see this is some pretty crazy packaging and I was like these two little hooks here got a slide open I don't know we'll try to figure it out um I have had some luck with gummies recently like plus plus is great so my opinions on gummies are starting to change especially as like the shitty players leave the market like ed appears or infused creations I know they're still out there but they're not as present as they once were so now it seems there are a lot of legitimate gummy makers so I'm looking forward to this and guys I did do a little fad right before I took this bit or went on this video here so that way you are sure that I'm getting a hundred percent of this THC coming in so let's see if I can get this open here let's see it has some directions lift cap while pressing side tabs well it looks like one of the side tabs might be broken so well this is a bad scheme for for our guys at district edibles if they require such fancy packaging but their packaging is broken how are you supposed to get into the good stuff oh boy yes so this one is broken so you cannot get into it which means I'm probably gonna have to get some scissors for a crowbar because this is pretty solid plastic pretty shitty job there district edibles on your packaging I mean come on beer we all just want the weed yeah I've almost gotten it I'm just gonna break the damn thing tada we did it guys as a family as a team and here are our goodies that we are rewarded for all of our hard effort on the inside these 10 gummies right here in the back they say we are things like orbiter and gravity check and booster who knows weird little gummies they're kind of plush shaped and green as you can see and they've got just this little standard of lumen on packaging on the back of the top and guys like all of our edibles don't worry we'll be doing all 10 of these maybe not all 10 on cameras and won't bore you to death but I'm gonna let you know how they taste and then I'm gonna come back to you guys two hours after I finish the last one to let you know how they're actually because that's what we're so here we go taste test number one for the blue raspberry district animals and their shitty now broken ass packaging okay in terms of edible taste definitely has a cannabis taste still has that blue rat sour e blue raspberry taste not the worst edible I've ever had not the worst gummy I've ever had either but there is a strong cannabis taste to it which has me a little optimistic that it's going to be pretty poached but if you really hate cannabis tastes definitely want to give these ones a skip because they they have it for sure so here's a close-up shot of their little + or diamond dirt whatever you wanna call this cross shape do what second same as the first yep fairly strong cannabis taste but it goes away pretty quickly it's not that over overpowering style of cannabis taste either these are easy to get down they just pop right up just do them up and that guy is gonna do it for this first half I have seven more of these to get through which I will do in the next 15 minutes or so and then I will come back to you guys once we're all said and done in two hours but you know how we're actually feeling so thanks for watching wheat guys and I'll see you in just a bit deuces hey jerks welcome back two weeks it's been Oh two and a half actually I think closer are three hours since I last checked in with you and I am still talking district edibles blue raspberry indica and guys original intuition is correct in this new legal world of edibles in California gummies are pretty good now you can sort of safely by gummies that are securely vetted and lab tested all that good stuff I think a lot of the bad actors are gone um just because I don't think you can go buy a big bag of gummy worms at Costco anymore slather a couple of milligrams of oil on it and call it a product anymore that just doesn't work in this world for both good and bad so the district 9 or the district to start district 9 the district edibles is actually pretty good the taste wasn't too bad there was a decent cannabis taste to had not the cannabis haze was decent is just flatly pronounced but I am actually rather high I got up to I would say I almost even hit an eight for a second maybe that's because I was playing some Red Dead - and everything just felt a little bit more euphoric in that moment anyways but regardless I can tell you these are pretty potent I picked these up for 20 bucks in the dispensary in Long Beach which is about the going price of any easily and between this and plus it's pretty much a draw for me they're both now legal edible brands basically the same format each I think plus has five milligrams these have ten so these are about as strong as like the cushy punch hundred milligrams or the plus hundred milligrams so I don't have any problem recommending them I just think they're packaging sucks it's unfortunate that this one happened to be broken but you know it shouldn't break so that's one downside but other than that actually really really liked the district edibles I keep forgetting that name I keep forgetting that name so guys that is gonna do it for this review I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you guys on a next review this is", "b8c9ekc6-yg": "[Music] yo what's up guys that blind toker back here again and welcome to another [ __ ] video guys in today's video i got an edible review today's edibles review is from trump these are cherry gummy edibles this is a hundred milligrams all together in the bag there is 10 gummies so 10 milligrams each within the bag uh this is super price efficient i can't talk about price on the channel because of youtube's uh rules but i can review them and tell you guys my opinion on them but these are very price efficient uh super affordable uh it doesn't break the bank but uh anyhow uh these are vegan non-dairy and gluten-free edibles and the packaging doesn't lie these are the best tasting edibles out there um honestly so before we get on with today's uh review let's take a mom grip out of the diamond glass bong i got some [Music] i'm kind of stoned so i'm kind of blanking out here uh [Music] i got some banana pudding and wedding cake put it up in the bowl dude i totally [ __ ] blinked out uh but yeah so let's take the uh longer of y'all let me know what you guys are smoking on or sipping on down in the comments section below let me know how your day's going uh but yeah let's get lydia like a [ __ ] to you cheers [Music] [Music] all right [Music] all right i thought i was going to have the coffin attack terry bam but anyhow i'm super [ __ ] baked not gonna lie this is my second time recording the video [Music] this is my second time recording the video that's what i was trying to say before i kind of had like a hiccup there anyhow so i'm going to be pretty honest uh really not like too much to say about him uh metals really don't hit me hard only because i think i'm a daily smoker um so edibles really don't hit me i ate two of these a couple of days ago and probably like two hours later it [ __ ] knocked me out i didn't even smoke a bowl or anything i ate too [ __ ] put me to sleep i got slumped [ __ ] uh put my ass to bed but uh they're not bad and it is indica i did forget to mention that but it is indica but um these are the indica uh cherry gummies but uh let's try it on camera and you'll get you guys will get my reaction on how they taste uh no pot taste uh super tasty uh which is kind of scary so if you guys have a problem being like eating uncontrollably uh too many edibles uh these are probably not for you but if you guys are looking for tasty edibles you don't want like pot tasting edibles these are the best they say that's tasting so super [ __ ] good super truly it's a cannabis infused pure premium cannabis edibles but overall i'm going to give this [ __ ] a 5 out of 5. it's price efficient it's tasty it actually works um and and mine this too edibles affects everybody differently so just because i say i'm saying that it affected me probably that doesn't mean that power going affects you just what i'm trying to say or trying to get a heads up because pot affects everybody differently you know what i mean or marijuana so i'm going to take another rip and probably dip out here i tried to make make this a short video there's not too much to say a lot of [ __ ] it's all positives you know what i mean super tasty uh they actually work but uh i don't recommend you know eating them every [ __ ] night because you'll build a tolerance towards it where you have to keep eating more and more and more but uh you know eight two wait two days eight another two and then next day eight two and then now i did the video and all that all the nights man it pretty much put me to sleep uh i didn't wake up middle of the night having to like pack up a bowl or anything so yeah i don't know helped me sleep uh i like just kept me stoned a lot longer through my sleep you know what i mean but at five out of five y'all so cheers after this i'm going to bow [Music] [Music] but anyhow guys see in the next uploader live stream until then stay litty like a titty thank you for watching today's video stay high stay big stay litty like a titty peace out [Music] so", "vAd2MnnDEn4": "hey guys welcome back to our channel if you're new here I am Judith and today's video I am going to be eating a hundred milligram edible for you guys I did get this on 4/20 and I am barely going to eat it with you guys just because I don't know it's been in the fridge it's been getting cold and I thought why not do it today today is my day off so your grocery and yeah so I'm gonna consume this a hundred milligram edible for you guys and see what it does to me I am a huge smoker so I don't know if it would hit me as much but honestly it probably will because edibles hit different than smoking like honestly honestly if you eat edibles they will hit like major but yeah so I'm gonna eat this for you guys hopefully I don't feel like I'm dying and then from there who knows this video will probably be a short vlog and yeah I'm just gonna go about my day on an edible and see the effects of what happens so let me set the camera for you guys and then open this oh so I am in my little sister's room I am at my mom's house and yeah there's nowhere else I'd rather take a hundred milligram edible than my mom's because if I freaked out which I probably won't but if I freaked out my sisters are here and my mom is here and everybody is here so if your girl feels like she's dying everybody is here hominy yeah yeah so let me set this camera up for you guys and then let's do it okay you guys I'm so mad at myself because I literally broke the freaking edible and I didn't want to do that I wanted to show you guys exactly what it looked like and your girl is just not paying attention if you guys have ever tried these let me know in the comments down below and what you guys thought about them so I've tried these before they were good and let's do this again so here we go I'm gonna break this seal for you guys know it's childproof it's childproof you guys it doesn't even have a little cut for you to follow do you have scissors money so you legit might need a knife or some scissors to open the packaging which is always good that's like an a-plus because if you have kids or you have little adults around you don't want them to easily access these things because yeah Oh Jax is sad he's crying outside right now but I don't want him inside because he's just gonna he's just gonna bark and do odd things possible but he's sad because jenna so just dipped or she went somewhere I'm not sure but okay so I went ahead and cut it open I'm sorry my nails are a little rough right now one is really bitten your girl has been super anxious and nervous and if you know me you just have a lot of anxiety sometimes and believe it or not I get and I get anxiety attacks and it's just a struggle you guys so if you guys know what they feel like or you guys are also going through the same thing I hope that you guys are doing everything possible to just stay calm and everything is gonna be fine you guys I always try to remind myself that but anyways it smells so good these are dark mint chocolate bars and they legit smell like dark mint chocolate they really do you guys let me push them it to the front they literally broke it in there I am so upset with myself but they still looks so good okay let's do it I'm gonna eat the whole bar you guys so let's do this they are look look at how they're packaging for their chocolate is like go ahead and hold that for you guys look at that it literally tells you the milligram of each little bar that is crazy I don't even remember eating the other one and I don't remember being this excited about having the milligrams on the bar I don't know I guess yes yes if you guys how do you say it um if you guys are dosing or how would you say I money you just oh yeah mone is smart she okay so if you are micro dosing and you are a big believer or a big person who does micro seeing these are exactly what you need but let's do this image it tastes like dark chocolate man mm sorry 20 milligrams yeah 820 milligrams right there let's go ahead and eat oh my god I'm such an idiot you guys and you guys are not telling me so apparently it doesn't give you the milligrams on here I just assumed that they did but no it doesn't it actually says THC on the bar d\u00f6 oh my god I'm either dumb or I'm blind you guys I'm so dumb but it does say THC on them on the packaging and lets you know that each bar is 10 milligrams so I just assumed that that's what it was on that's what was written on the bar but you know what it's still cool it still lets you know how many milligrams each little bar is and honestly dude the reason why I like these is because ok 30 more milligrams and then it's 50 milligrams total and you can't argue with that [Applause] and I got this one this one didn't break yeah so this one didn't break you guys and 15 milligrams for this little bit is yes yes I love edibles that are tiny but they pack so much like a little brownie that's 100 milligrams like thighs the best because you don't have to eat as much like it legit gets to the point it's not like you have to eat 50 cupcakes to get 100 milligrams like no I love that they high dose these things so that you can eat less of it but get more of a punch like those are my favorite edibles look 20 more milligrams what is that now 70 milligrams oh my god I'm freaking myself out honey you're gonna be here with me okay my sister said if I feel like I'm dying she's gonna be here with me you're gonna remind me that I'm not dying she was gonna remind me I'm not dying guys honestly I can always have I can always be having a bad day but once I get on camera for you guys and I talk to you guys I just make a difference I do feel better I do feel the best I could be sometimes but yeah like I really like being here with you guys you guys motivate me of course I do want to do big things when I'm older I hope you guys stay to see what the [ __ ] that J and J twins are gonna do in the future my sister has a boyfriend and they're hella cute you guys so shout out to all the couples out there especially my sister's relationship because he is so nice you guys like so next so nice oh hi there any more milligrams and that's gonna be a total of 100 milligrams you guys so recently hmm yeah I would buy these again mm-hmm yes mm-hmm so recently I took half a tab with Hubert he took the pool tab you guys I don't know I don't know people could do the most and still survive but me knowing I'm gonna take a full time I know that it's gonna be full-blown everything like everything I'm gonna see God I'm gonna see [ __ ] mythological things everything so I took half a tab right you guys I swear I couldn't stop laughing like I was trying I was trying so hard to keep it together because like I wouldn't look at Hubert and I was just like in my mind it was so funny like to even look at him was so funny like I didn't know I didn't know why looking at him was so funny and while I was doing that I was applying to new things so that I can get my life together and go find better things so I was on my laptop like the laptop looked cool whatever but then I started to realize oh my god oh my god it's hitting like my half tab is hitting and that's why I only take half a tab Jax our guard dog our long-haired dachshund or jealous long-haired dachshund even after the tab was over and we woke up the next morning I even asked him I was I asked him how his tab fell and if he felt it and he said smack - smack but yeah I am my my half tops max I didn't think it was going through because I've never had great oh my god looks so young with short hair so I never like I never really have good experiences with papertabs usually jalisa gets us gel tabs and those are the ones that really really like always boom like and these paper tabs one time we took them and they just it didn't work out so yeah lesson learned gels are my favorite my point is don't be afraid to microdose don't ever feel like you have to eat the whole edible or take the whole tab like no I even take quarter tabs and I feel good I feel like I could take a quarter tab and go throughout my day or take a quarter tab and drink and have a good time so everything is possible you guys don't hurt yourselves but I will come back check up with you guys and see when this hits so I'll make sure to time this for you guys let me check and you're gonna wash my hands because I do not want to lick my fingers so it is currently 138 I will come back whenever these shit's hit which will be in like 30 minutes hopefully or maybe an hour who knows no one ever knows um yeah and I'll check up with you guys and see you later my dude shoutout to jealous because she is hooking it up with some boiling crab but yes but yes okay so it's been like 45 minutes okay you guys so it's 229 now and oh my gosh that's so weird why is it doing that anyways so it's 2:30 you guys and I am pretty faded I don't know what that means that's so weird oh it's doing it's like something the camera can see but not us okay guys so the edibles definitely hit you guys I was watching a really good movie right now called private life it's called private life and I was crying you guys I can't stop oh my gosh this edible is definitely hitting I was watching this movie called private life and if you haven't watched it you guys need to watch this movie like the movie is so it's real and I like that so yeah the edibles this is like 45 minutes after or 15 minutes after so like about an hour it took me to really get the feeling like I am super faded right now you guys like I'm just like deeply in movies right now if you guys want something that's gonna hit you guys should definitely get some wounds and if you like the mint flavor with chocolate this is definitely that so yeah thanks for watching and I will see you guys in the next video", "6LO90UvI-Bs": "[Music] hey loves welcome back to my channel for those of you that are new my name is christina and i post videos on motherhood and lifestyle and today i'm going to be going over the top postpartum essentials that i used after i gave birth to my daughter so if you are an expectant mama and you're looking to see what you're going to need after you give birth continue to watch the end so the number one thing i want to recommend as an essential for postpartum are depends and woman's like diapers like who would ever go that we would have to wear diapers but after you give birth you were bleeding so much that wearing a woman's diaper just makes you feel so secure down there and you don't have to worry about possibly leaking or wearing some bulky pads i definitely use them for like the first two weeks when i was bleeding a lot and i know there are some always ones that are really cute and make you feel just more feminine but regular depends works really well too so whichever one you like the hospital will also give you pads as well but having these type of women's diapers absorbs a lot of blood because you are going to be bleeding a lot so my number two essential would have to be just to have regular pads as well the pads that i use were super absorbent and they were long and they were unscented the hospital is going to give you pads but they're going to be like hospital-like like i still have the hospital ones because i didn't really use them so if you want to use them and then when you're finished using them use your own but i would recommend getting your own because the hospital ones i'll show you guys the hospital ones are pretty like basic they don't have wings they're long so you're going to want to get something that's long like these but also that has wings and that is just easier to be able to absorb and make sure that you're not leaking so definitely look into getting regular pads as well so the number three item that i found to be a postcard essential was the freedom mom peri bottle this bottle was so important for me because the hospital is going to give you like a squirt type regular bottle but what i like about this bottle unfortunately i no longer have it i got rid of it after i i stopped using it but i like it because i'll show pick above it has like an angled squirter so when you're using the bathroom and after you're not supposed to wipe and it kind of hurts when you weight oh because you don't want anything really sticking down there especially if you have stitches i like it because you're able to squirt an angle and you're able to just use it easily mess free sometimes i even put like warm water in it because it just felt better to be able to do that because after you give birth things like peeing and using the bathroom it hurts and you're going to be sore down there so having something that's convenient to use is so important so the fourth postpartum essential that i found to be really important for me is perineal spray now after you give birth especially if you were mama that had to get stitches like i did you're going to be really sore down there and it's going to be super sensitive so you're going to need a spray to make sure you're healing it and numbing it so i specifically got the earth mama herbal perennial spray i found this one to be really good it didn't make me burn or anything like that it's just really really good to use now instead of this specific brand i know the hospital also gives you something like this the dermablast i use this as well but i just found that at times it was not as like calming as the earth mama so you can definitely use this it just is cool relief and i would recommend that if you wanted to be like cooler if you're burning down there to put it in the refrigerator and just be able to use it like that but i definitely recommend this one specifically so the fifth item that i found to be an essential is which hazel wipes so witch hazel wipes are really good for like being able to clean yourself down there wipe away the blood it's just especially when you put them in the fridge or the freezer they are just so cooling because you're gonna see that you're gonna have like burning feelings if you just gave birth and you're sore and you have open stitches and everybody's healing process is different so being able to use like witch hazel pads i know i bought this specific brand of them they're like round they help with relief they're moist and they were really cheap off amazon they came in pack three i got it at a good price so i use them and i would put it in the freezer and then when i was ready to use them i would just get them and white also believe there are perry nail feminine waves that you could use i'll be sure to link those as well but just make sure that you're getting wipes that you're able to wipe with that you can use that are cool and refreshing when you need to use them so the sixth thing i would recommend is when you do stop bleeding as much you're still going to want to be able to use something like a panty liner so make sure you get something like that because i know for me i was still really like not as tight so if i cough or sneeze i know i would pee a little and if i wasn't bleeding i still wanted to be able to have something to absorb that so i would definitely recommend getting that as well so the second item i would recommend is nipple pads so whether you're going to breastfeed or you're not going to breastfeed your body is still going to produce milk and you want to be able to have nipple pads like this i got these from amazon as well or target both of them sell it and it came in a pack of like 100 and they're disposable because i just wanted for it to be able to absorb and throw them out and not always have to worry about washing them there are ones that are you know reusable but i use these and it came in a pack of 100 for like under 20 bucks and they were just so helpful they look like this and you just put them inside your bra and they just absorb your milk so i definitely recommend you being able to get that because you don't want to have to stain your shirts the eighth thing that i want to recommend as an essential is cotton high-waisted panties you're going to want to get some granny panties for yourself as funny as that may sound but after you give birth you just want to wear something that is comfortable and soft and something that is you know will cover you up your stomach is still going to feel loose so you want to be able to just wear something that will cover you up and make you feel good so definitely get a few packs there there's so many different brands i got a pack from amazon a pack target and you just want to make sure that they're 100 cotton so that you feel comfortable in them the ninth thing that i would recommend is definitely be able to get a pear nail donut type of seat this is so important and i wish i had gotten it when i gave birth but i didn't so i definitely want you guys to get it after you give birth you are so sore down there you can barely be able to set the hospital is going to give you like ice packs and things like that but you don't want to always be sitting on something cool you want to sit on something that's soft and comfortable so i definitely would recommend that i know that freedom mom has a cushion that you can sit on and i'll be sure to link that in the description box below but it's definitely something that you need to get to make you feel more comfortable when you get home postpartum essential item is for the breastfeeding mamas and that is nipple cream specifically i use the earth mama organic nipple cream now this this is so important because when you first start breastfeeding your nipples are just not used to your baby nursing on you so they're going to get sore and they're going to get cracked and it's probably going to hurt i know it hurt me so i definitely recommend getting some nipple cream to just help you with the soreness and the cracked skin and that will help you get through the first few weeks of nursing so the 12th thing i recommend is again for my breastfeeding mamas are nursing bras oh my god when i came home after postpartum i didn't realize that i didn't even really have good nursing bras i definitely recommend i'll be sure to show them right here above and link them in the description box cotton nursing products that are just easy to just whip out your breath be able to nurse because you don't want to have to deal with the ones that have like the snaps those are cute and you know you can use them as well but i recommend soft ones ones that are easy to just wear because what's most important is that you just feel comfortable when you get home because you just want to be able to heal feed your baby get as much sleep as you can even though that's probably going to be limited so i definitely recommend getting those as well the 13th thing that i recommend is stool softener i know that may sound a little crazy especially if you haven't given birth yet but after you do give birth scariest thing for me was not only having to pee for the first time because yeah that hurt using the bathroom for the first time it hurts especially if you get stitches down so i definitely recommend using a stool softener something like the doula blacks you don't want to have to use a lot of it but definitely the first time just to be able to just soften your soul and so it doesn't hurt or rip you or anything like that but i definitely recommend that as well as if you want to just eat things that will make you make yourself soft like olive oil and whatever else works but i know using that definitely helped me to be able to use the bathroom for the first time and it's definitely something that people don't really talk about and it definitely was important for me to get as a postpartum essential now the 14th thing that i believe is a postpartum essential are comfy clothes when you come home you just want to be able to just relax and take care of your baby and heal so you're going to want things like really comfy leggings or really comfy lounge pants and like a comfy t-shirt even something like i'm wearing right now because when you're a new mom you're just lounging at home you will literally be lounging at home for the for like a month at minimum maybe even the first three months because you really can't go anywhere especially now in a pandemic you're pretty much stuck home so you want to make sure that you just have some comfy clothes to wear i'll be sure to link some outfits that i have and use as well as some like nursing outfits that i lived in when i first gave birth as well okay so the 15th item that i found to be a postpartum essential are gel pads for your nipples so if you're a breastfeeding mom you're going so sore and when you're giving your baby milk it's going to hurt sometimes so what i used to do is i used to be able to use these gel pads i would put them around my nipple after after i fed her or if i was feeding her off with one breast i would put it on the other brush and you can either put them in the microwave or you can put them in the freezer just to be able to cool off or just keep them moist and make them feel better because it's going to be sore when you first start learning to nourish your baby the reception essential for sure so the 16th item that i found to be a postpartum essential is gummy gummy specifically for hair skin and nails because your hair is going to fall off you're going to get those postpartum hair i still have it they're just like these little fly aways your hair is going to break off some some women even like get little bald spots so i definitely recommend getting some vitamins that are just multivitamin vitamins that have biotin and that just help your your hair grow back because it's going to take time but i know that when i stuck with using this it definitely helped my hair grow back but i'm 12 months in and my hair is just starting to grow back in this awkward stage probably why i'm wearing a headband because i can't even wear a ponytail like that i definitely would recommend getting a brand like this the 17 item that i would recommend as a postpartum essential are prenatal pills or postnatal pills whatever you want to use but i know that after you give birth you still have to use your prenatal pills it's definitely the vitamin of choice recommended by your doctor especially if you're going to be breastfeeding so i definitely recommend continuing to use your prenatals or if you find a postnatal pill you like but i specifically use the garden of life my kind organic prenatal pills and i absolutely love them they're healthy they're organic and they're the way to go for me and the 18th thing that i would recommend definitely having is a postpartum essential is a reusable water bottle because it is just so important for us to be able to take care of ourselves and stay hydrated especially if you're a breastfeeding mom like me you have to continually drink water throughout the day and as well as like you want to not be dehydrated and take care of yourselves in order to take care of your baby you have to take care of yourself so i would definitely recommend having a bottle that helps you drink water throughout the day 20 items that i recommend as a postpartum essential our food food items whether they're protein bars pro premade protein shake frozen meals you are just going to be so busy taking care of your baby and take trying to take care of yourself that you're going to need meals just to get so whether you have like a family member bringing like a frozen lasagna or you get like a hello fresh like delivered to your house or you're just getting smoothies or fruits and granola bars whatever it is having food items to be able to just grab and go and having snacks ready and prepared for you is just so important after you give birth because you really do not have time to cook you just don't you and your husband are going to be busy so make sure you stock up on some food items so that it could just make your whole postpartum journey a lot easier and the last item that i recommend as a postpartum essential is a postpartum stomach wrap now i don't have mine in front of me specifically i'll definitely show you a picture having a postpartum wrap is really important because it helps your stomach and your body heal it helps you with your uterus contracting and it just helps you keep your stomach and get to get tighter because everything is just going to be loose and you want everything to just feel more upright and together and i know for me it helped my stomach go down and it helped me just feel better about myself so my stomach wasn't always like dragging out like you don't have to wear it all day but if you wear it like an hour or two a day i'll just definitely make you feel a lot better about the healing process so i definitely recommend you using that so i hope you guys liked all the items that i recommended i definitely recommend that you guys keep everything in like a basket especially your clothes when you first come home from the hospital you want to be able to have a basket that if someone is helping you out like your husband or your in-laws you can just tell them where to go and what to get when it comes to the things that you're going to use in the bathroom i'd recommend having a basket in there so that you can easily be able to grab that as well and then i also recommend a hello basket i also recommend having a basket in your bedroom or in your nursing room where you're going to be feeding your baby so that you can grab things from there so i wish you guys the best of luck in giving birth and postpartum experience i hope that you heal well and you feel good and just know that whether you're not feeling good and you don't feel well that's only normal i know for me i bled for like almost two to three weeks after a month of bleeding it did calm down and i did stop bleeding and i definitely felt some pain but i was able to take like tylenol to overcome the pain and that definitely did help because what happens is that you're going to feel contractions after you give birth because your uterus has to go back to normal so having contraction like pain is totally normal and when you're breastfeeding mother the milk is actually helping you contract your uterus faster into normal shape because your body is creating oxycontin from producing the milk so if you're a breastfeeding mod are actually going to help the process of your uterus going back to normal but you will still feel the pain so definitely take some over-the-counter medicine that's what your hospital and your doctor is going to recommend you do and as well as how you feel be aware of how you're feeling and if you're starting to feel down and thinking you possibly have some postpartum depression definitely speak to your doctor and your loved ones about it because it's totally normal to feel that way i know for me i didn't specifically feel depressed and down but i definitely was just super paranoid and cautious about my baby i didn't trust anybody with my baby i wanted to take care of my baby and do everything myself because what happens is i'm a new mom you're just like so aware of all the things happening and you start you know you start thinking about how it was for you as a child how you were treated there's so many different emotions and thoughts come into your head when you're a first-time mom and if you have postpartum not everybody experiences it but i know that's how i felt when i first gave birth so know that it can go away but it needs to be treated and if you're feeling great then that's wonderful i definitely was really happy to have my baby but i know that not everybody may feel that way if you have all these items that i mentioned you're going to be good to go you'll be able to just heal and take care of your baby because that is what the postpartum experience is about getting back on your feet during those beautiful experiences of your newborn and infant baby so i hope you guys like this video and if you did please give it a thumbs up make sure you subscribe and make sure you hit that notification bell so that you can find out when my next video comes out i hope you guys are doing well and you're staying safe and i'll see you in the next video bye guys", "pUB2EPLShGw": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "H6cYs4ZcSv8": "[Music] revue show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I've got my Nutella here pancakes love Nutella and I love Nutella too so I've got my Nutella so you know what that means it means we are taking a look at another gummy that's right we are breaking the cardinal rule here on weeds don't be a dude don't be a dummy and buy a gummy we are taking a look at a very very popular gummy brand may be the second most popular gummy brand behind cushy punch and that is the gummy brand from Chiba choose themselves Green Hornet I had a lot of people asked me to review the Green Hornet's and we're finally gonna be doing it this is their 100 milligram indica variety love everything on the back it's got all the stuff you want to see the batch number from the lab testing nutrition information all that good stuff ingredients it's all they're so good on them for putting all the information on their Bravo to you Chiba chews now if you've seen my reviews in the past you know my Chiba chews I'm really feeling them to be sending my world on fire I found them to be good but not great more okay however I picked this one up for a very affordable price just 10 bucks for a hundred milligram edible which is a pretty good deal so it's a little bit cheaper than most of the Chiba juice and so I'm I'm more excited about this one and I'm an indica fan so let's uh let's give it a go I do have the uh oh looks like my dogs have come back from a walk welcome dogs welcome dogs low hello hello goodbye dogs farewell dogs sorry about that guys so yes back to the Green Hornet really excited about this one because it was more affordable and I've heard a lot of good things about the Green Hornet's now if you know as you know I'm not a big gummy fan really only flourish and tiki killers the only gummies that I've really really loved and cushy punches I find to be OH a so Green Hornet is fighting an uphill battle there but let's give them the benefit of the doubt open this bad boy up and give it a taste so if you've never tuned in two weeks before the way our reviews work it's very very simple I'm gonna eat this whole thing and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review so uh it tells us to cut the gummy into ten ten milligram servings there's it's little cut guide where of course not gonna be doing that I guess that's how they're gonna get compliant with the new regs whatever so here is the gummy The Green Hornet fruit punch flavored and again I picked this up for only ten bucks at my dispensary which is a very good price for these Green Hornet's so let's let's break off half here and give it a taste I forgot my I brought my Nutella to have some fat whoo wow that is woo that has a heavy heavy heavy cannabis taste but that is encouraging hopefully that means it's going to be as potent as advertised and seeing this lab tested results in the back gives me faith so let's add a little bit of chocolate to it here just to give ourselves the best chance of making sure we can get high mmm that Nutella makes that a lot easier to go down alright guys well that's gonna do it for this first half of this review for the second half and the most important part will it get me high I'll come back to you guys in two hours or for you just a couple of seconds through the magic of editing so I will see you guys in just a bit to let you know peace [Music] help I've been stung by a Green Hornet welcome back to wheat skies it's been two hours since I've had that Green Hornet and it's pretty good it's up there with good gummies like flourish I actually like it better than Sheba chews period I think it got me where I want to be some pink there I'd say I'm at a seven and a half somewhere in there not to put too fine a point on it uh yeah I I like The Green Hornet quite a bit uh the indica variety at least is muy bueno uh muy bueno bueno bueno way down yeah I'm really pleased with it pleasantly surprised I like it better than any of the other cheapo cheese I've tried so far a really a nice little edible nice discreet package it tasted like barf but that's to be expected for something that's so small and so potent so I don't really hold out it against it but it does taste terrible so if you're really sensitive as a taste no this one is this one's got a pretty intense weed flavor but on the whole if you can get it as cheap as I got it because I got it for ten bucks but I sometimes see these go as highs like seventeen or higher maybe I don't know the that's why I don't really screw that she would choose that much is there crazy expensive but if you can find this for around that price it's uh I'd say it's worth it I really had a good time with this one that's the Chiba choose Green Hornet's a fruit punch flavored one hundred milligrams indica give it a shot if you see the dispensary near you and before I go guys I want to share with you a little cherry on top something a little extra something that's not reviewing weed just something I like in my life that I want to share with you guys that isn't necessarily weed related and on this review my little cherry on top is let's give it up for the air pod I hope there's not too much earwax on that because that'd be really embarrassing the air pods they're really good I hope I'm saying that right air pods that's the name of them the names dumb but they're actually really incredible little wireless headphones earphones I had a pair of Plantronics wireless over-the-air ones noise cancelling ones that I had for two years that I adored and have been using the air pods on and off for a while and and really come to appreciate them and they're discreteness in their ease of use and the just pull it out pauses the music all that good stuff really enjoy it if you have an Apple product if you have an Apple phone give the air prodigious shot if you haven't already I know they seem a little expensive but I think they're worth the the the Apple tax in this case so guys that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats that's gonna be a thumbs up for the Green Hornet thank you so much for sticking around at the very end of this review guys and we will catch you on the next one peace", "JkSDcNwhijk": "[Music] yeah tastes like weed tastes like gummy bear weed I'm chewing [Music] well I don't feel anything

here as you can see so we're gonna go ahead and try this thing out these gummies are special there are what you call edibles so basically this thing has a 50 milligrams of thc as you can see right there 50 milligrams of thc and uh so if you guys don't know what thc is so let me see thc or tetra hydrocannabinol is the chemical responsible for most of marijuana's psychological effects it acts much like the cannabinoid chemicals made naturally by the body according to the national institute on drug abuse so this gummies right here contains some kind of thc um so basically thc you will find out in a marijuana flower or a marijuana product so technically i live here in washington marijuana pot mary jane dahon whatever you call it it's legal out here as long as you have your state id and your uh as long as you have your state id actually and if you're 21 and up you can actually go to the store and get some marijuana but on this case i have this this is different kind of taking marijuana i'm not saying that i'm taking marijuana you know like i do this i do marijuana i do hardcore drugs no okay no this is a gummies so [Music] marijuana marijuana is so broad guys marijuana is so broad uh some people believe that it can cure cancer can cure illness it can cure epilepsies and stuff like that so they made a different bunch of products that have thc on it because they knew they thought that marijuana can help alleviate you know pain stress anxiety and some illness and you know some people can just smoke that [ __ ] you know some people cannot just smoke and feel the effect some people needs to drink it some people needs to have gummies like this to feel the full effect of the thc so in this case i have these gummies right so man i'll make another video on this marijuana thing okay so for today's video i just want to go ahead and test this out and uh see what will be the effects on me after an hour so basically this is just a gummy it's like you know it's like gummy worms but it doesn't shake like worms and it says here at the back activation time is 45 minutes cannabinoid edibles can take after two hours or more to take effect so that's just another

gonna hit the car like a train but we'll see what happens i don't really eat edibles ever so you've never eaten edibles i have before like once or twice but never like this amount we'll see how it goes you're down to do this oh hell yeah all right he's gonna eat the whole [ __ ] bag yeah you ready he's [ __ ] down that [ __ ] again it's gonna taste like ass no it tastes pretty good i mean it's [ __ ] gummy worms let's see how it goes but um yeah so for those who don't know delta 8 is actually 66 percent the psychoactivity of delta 9 but i mean 500 milligrams you know oh man he's just down and look at that how's it taste [Music] yeah so these are the sour gummy worms so you just downed it we're probably gonna check back in in an hour it's gonna take two hours to kick in but we'll check in every single hour to see where he's at you're gonna he's gonna be drunk yeah i know he's gonna get screwed up dude he's gotta wait 40 minutes yeah no he's gonna get [ __ ] up it's 500 milligrams dude fun fun dude i mean we'll see what happens i don't get that [ __ ] up normally one hit of a bomb and i'll be [ __ ] fried you're gonna be [ __ ] up i'm hoping i'm like paralyzed that's what i'm hoping for so yeah [Music] those taste like real gummy worms though that [ __ ] well no they are real gummies yeah but normally like if you infuse like a cookie with thc and you can still see guy should be [ __ ] up it will be worth it though dude perhaps you're doing that i mean it's not like it's not like you know i mean you don't have to work tomorrow right he's underplaying it dude yeah i'm unemployed baby you're good you're good 25 minutes how do you feel better cousins not bad not bad i don't think it's i feel like it's not hitting yet all right we'll check back in it's a placebo effect right now i his eyes are getting kind of red man i'm baked let's make that right here let's go to the light a bit so these uh people can see how red the eyes are um so guys um i shouldn't say guys i don't like that hey you look at those eyes right there that's what those edibles do after one hour that's 500 milligrams of delta 8 thc um edibles man they're frying me already hell yeah it's been what are you expecting in the next 30 minutes sleeping probably so we'll see if we get any more of this are they sativa indica or what just distilling distillate oh so [ __ ] blacks is that what that is i guess you could call it delta 8 wax i mean wax is desolate um i guess but there's different methods of extracting it like co2 and bho and i guess the consistency determines what you call it but it's just distal it's just super thick and sticky and uh basically the gummies just regular gummies and they actually spray it with the actual thc oil oh wow so you're when you eat the gummies you're literally eating the straight oil on the actual gum that's insane i don't think i heard like a word you said because i'm just [ __ ] just going in and out of my eyes oh okay [Laughter] you feel [ __ ] up oh [ __ ] i can't feel my lips oh no like stuck to my teeth so wait you what do they feel like they feel like nothing yeah basically wow incredible dry can i get some water hey can someone get this man water all right they're saying no man they don't want you to drink it all right homies aren't looking out for you huh oh we gotta do that landscape that's good well let's get oh flip the camera hold on tell me when to alright so go like this and then do it you know like just take the camera okay one two three go dude you gotta flip it man okay okay okay one two three go okay we flip okay so connor just the results are just bad he just he got so [ __ ] up and uh it just didn't feel right filming him he puked so we were gonna do like a one-hour check-in and two-hour check-in three-hour check-in we only got to the first check-in and uh after that he's just like i'm [ __ ] up so yeah uh moral of the story don't eat the whole bag only eat one or two if you want try the edibles yourself and just only take one or two you hit the link down below and try it out for yourself and if you get too high you can smoke some cbd and calm yourself down you can get an eighth for free by the way so uh yeah i hope you enjoyed the video hit that like hit the like", "EjbVn3G-Syo": "what was that the alarm system oh yeah that's the alarm is that going to be picked up in the video [ __ ] where did i leave off at hey man it's mike from bonus cbd.com today we got uh hometown's new gummy bears man this is that delta eight thc pretty [ __ ] excited about this supposedly delta athc is supposed to be some strong [ __ ] it's supposed to knock you on your ass man i'm really curious if it's gonna taste the same as the other blueberry uh gummy bears they kind of had a sour taste to it it was pretty good man so i'm really curious about that so let's go ahead and start talking a little bit about delta athc supposedly what what everybody's saying is delta 18c is supposed to be more of a medical property thc more so than delta 9. delta 9 thc is the one that's regulated that's the one that you can't have above 0.3 percent you have that have to have it below now all the other tastes like delta delta eight thc a thcc all that can just be as high as they [ __ ] possibly can or as low as they possibly can either one there's no regulations on those guys it's just a delta nine thc that has the regulation but let's go ahead and crack this open and try these out now when we got these in they told us two get you feeling real good three you getting couch locked so i'm thinking about just trying out three i'm gonna try out these two and then go from there has no smell so we can't do a smell test let's try these gummies out man all right so let's go ahead and talk a little bit more about the thc's and the cbd properties that are inside these gummies um first off though the flavor it tastes just like the other blueberry gummies if you've ever had that if you haven't it's just a sour patch kid with the blueberry sour patch kid pretty much that's the easiest way to explain the flavor of that one now so one thing about this is it has like hardly any cbd properties in it it's point if you look at the lab results it's going to say 0.01 percent they round it down to zero that's why you can see on the side of this package it says zero milligrams of cbd there's not enough cbd in it for them to say hey these are cbd gummies that's just kind of false advertising now it's only pretty much only delta 8 thc and that's supposed to be good for medical use now as far as recreational side goes we're still waiting on that to kick in so we're gonna go ahead and give it 30 minutes and then we're gonna come right back and i'm gonna tell you how i'm feeling off these delta a cbds tell you how good they are how bad they are so stay tuned i'll be right back man all right man we're back after waiting 30 minutes for these to uh kick in i do feel a little something off of it more so than what i was expecting i wasn't expecting a whole lot so let's go ahead and talk about how it made me feel imagine taking like one or two beers that's about the same amount of feels that you get off of this i can see why it's good for some people and i can see why it's not good for others a lot of people are like oh delta eight that sounds spicy it's new it's not bad i don't mind it at all one thing i like about this is there's like no thc in it so if anybody needs to take it and you don't need thc in your system yeah you'll be all right man now if you're wanting a little bit more of a kick there might be something else stronger i want to say actually i have more of a feeling off the cbd gummies versus the delta 8 gummies that one gave me a harder feeling quicker this one's giving me more of a deep feeling i don't know if that makes sense i don't know how to explain it other than that but that's what i get off of this so it's pretty good i like it like i was saying though earlier the flavor is going to be a lot like a sour patch kid so that's always nice it doesn't have that dirty hemp [ __ ] dirt taste nobody wants that [ __ ] all right so if you're curious man first off i didn't tell you all to stay tuned for the promo code so stay tuned for the promo code y'all are about to get that let's talk about the price point of this guy real quick so the other gummies they're 25 bucks this one's 30. i can actually get behind that price point i did say you do feel a little bit more off the other gummies quicker and i was saying that this one's a little deeper but man you do feel a little bit better off of this one than the gummies five dollars more makes sense i'm cool with that doesn't hurt my feelings now so let's get let's hit you with that promo code let's keep the promo code simple this time we're just gonna hit you with delta eight that's gonna be the promo code it's not going to be the [ __ ] numeric roman [ __ ] delta with the triangle and [ __ ] [ __ ] illuminati [ __ ] okay it's just going to be delta all right man so that's that's going to be it for this video i'd like these gummies they're pretty good so yeah man y'all have a good one we'll we'll see y'all next time peace so quick update video on those gummies uh because it didn't really start hitting me until after i went home those things are bad ass man uh yeah there's he was not joking when he said three will knock you in the couch because i only took two and i would say maybe about 30 minutes hour after i left after we shot the video is when it really kicked in uh yeah they're strong delta a no there's no need for the cbd in it man the delta a if you're wanting something recreational and uh not illegal this this shit's good this shit's good so definitely try it out man all right y'all have a good one hey man be sure to check out our two videos down at the bottom and uh if you like our [ __ ] and [ __ ] support us man uh like comment share subscribe do all that [ __ ] hit that [ __ ] bell you all have a good one born to cbd.com", "zrL0wlu_H-E": "so i had some requests to do a delta 8 gummy review and i definitely was not opposed to that so i decided to try out the 3g brand because that's one of the most common brands of delta eight that i've come across and there's a bunch of pretty solid reviews on there so let's check it out now i actually had to buy this one i didn't get an offering to do it for free but whatever wasn't too bad they're currently 25 off right now so we have here the gummies i got the watermelon flavor they have watermelon or black raspberry i'm just going to give you a quick breakdown try it out come back later let you know what's going on so i got the larger pack there's 32 servings in here serving size is half a gummy i really want to take two but just for the sake of trying it out for the first time and giving you guys a solid review i'm just gonna try one just so i don't get blasted out of my mind because i did see some pretty interesting reviews that even one gummy would do the job for a while before i do that let me first read the back and try to reenact my initial reaction so i turn it around and then i see right here can take up to four hours what to feel full effects that's not really a good actor but i don't know i've seen some of the reviews say it's just been one hour until they feel the effects i highly doubt it's gonna take four hours i did eat some food before this the ingredients i'll post them up on the screen it's basically just a bunch of sugar and hemp extract this feels like one big gelatinous blob i don't even know how these will separate but let's see oh these smell really good they are pretty separated it looks like so it's not that big jello blob i thought it was so let me try one out wow ooh damn it tastes like that old school bubble yum watermelon or whatever the brand was called let me just read a couple of these reviews that i'm looking at on their website here because i'm not going to get too too in-depth with anything with that because you can check it out for yourself i'll link it in the description and probably post some screenshots here too so the first one that got me anonymous may 11th 2020 eat a handful and you will literally be tripping i doubt i'll be fully tripping but i don't know maybe a handful would uh you know definitely do something i don't want to quite need a handful yet maybe at a later date um just to you know cost effectiveness and everything let's see here anonymous may 11th they are tasty great consistency i wish they weren't out of stock all the time that's partially why i jumped on buying these because apparently they're out of stock a lot and for some reason my new phone is freezing when i'm going onto the site so whatever so overall taste is great i'll be back in a while hopefully not four hours and i'll let you know what's going on and then i'll probably based on what i'm feeling have another one so we'll see see you in a bit these are [ __ ] great it's about 6 30 p.m now i took the first one at i think it was around noon so i rode my bike down to the park i usually do this and it wasn't too cold out so i ended up for just a couple hours really a mix of working out stretching riding my bike whatever and then as this stuff continues to just you know kick in it was it was awesome so absolutely perfect especially if you if you've ever you know when you kind of just get in that groove of either working out or stretching or whatever and then everything just feels phenomenal and i just look like a weirdo doing all these weird stretches in the park and whatever so i'm back now i took a shower and like i said it's around 6 30. it definitely would i feel like this feeling would definitely just kind of last feel like it's leveled off and now it's kind of slowly calming down and i feel like this would last this still uh like the euphoric very nice just both uh both body high and then just mental high of just feeling just really nice really relaxed and it's fantastic so i'm sure the vast majority of you know exactly what i'm talking about so these are 100 worth it based on what the price is and then having 16 in here and mind you the serving size is one half gummy and i just took one full i would never suggest just going outside of the full dosage the first time you try it because everyone's tolerance is different but with that said i'm just gonna have one more and i'll be back tomorrow to let you know i assume it's just going to add on to the current effects spike them up again and whatever so i'm just going to enjoy the rest of my evening have this and i'll be back tomorrow morning and let you know what's up the next day wow i absolutely love these so the second gummy as the other one i said was kind of just wearing off after several hours the next one definitely i'd say started to kick in but is the way i experienced it is that that leveling off just kind of built up again and i went to sleep and say maybe around 11 o'clock and i was definitely feeling it for sure no signs of that slowing down or anything i slept great i woke up today i'm still pretty early i've been getting up pretty early even on the weekends and i noticed maybe the slightest bit of grogginess but it wasn't anything that you know made me sleep in for a long time or feel uh bad or impact me negatively or anything but all i contribute that to was just the fact that i had two of them and then the last one i think was around six or seven pm and uh yeah so it wasn't really even a bad thing at all i just wanted to mention that little aspect and that kind of occurred the first time i tried a delta 8 anyway after not having any sort of thc for several months but if you were looking for a gummy delta a thc whatever a good substitute to delta 9 thc and especially if you are trying to find something that's not smokable and edible this is a hundred percent awesome i love this and as with the other uh tinctures and everything but this one was very familiar to the erita hemp tincture that i still need to post a review on but maybe by the time you're watching this video that's already up so check that out but these were very intense very similar to even having a delta nine edible but it was still no sort of paranoia or anxiety or any anxiety or anything i know people mentioned the paranoia and anxiety can be a bit less on delta eight which is you know i find that to be true but even throughout years of smoking or eating whatever delta nine i feel like the anxiety and the paranoia that one can experience with that just in my experience just in my personal opinion it really all depends on your mindset beforehand because i've known that in times of my life when i was when i had much more much higher levels of anxiety in general and you know whether it be anxiety depression whatever other lifestyle factors things that have been going on in my life at the time that the majority of time that i would smoke pot or delta nine my anxiety levels chances are i would my anxiety level levels would go up exponentially when i would smoke until i'd have to actively just force myself to calm down really and just relax and enjoy it and then other times i would have it frequently and that did not occur at all so i feel like a lot of it has to do with your mindset but once again you know thc the endocannabinoid system and everything it's all going to be entirely different from person to person the way they feel the effects as is with these gummies or certain delta a cartridges or certain types of bud whatever the way i experience these gummies here could be totally different for you depending on where you're at in your life your own genetics a bunch of other things but me personally awesome so if you are into this type of stuff which you probably are if you're watching this video and you've been curious what these three chee gummies were like that's how they were for me so i'll put a link in the description below if you want to check out their main website i'm not affiliated with affiliated with them at all but hey if you want a business partner 3g let me know and i can help you out by you sending me more stuff and i can review it so that'll be it for the video if you like it any comments criticisms whatever leave that down below subscribe like all that stuff whatever and i'll be making some more videos that's it see you next time", "UZUy5uWSpSA": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheat's the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary smokey out uh it's quite smoky out here in southern california not just southern california but all of the west coast uh so i thought you know what better day to finally review these smokies edibles than this smokiest of days also the name of the minor league baseball team uh where i grew up in east tennessee smoky mountains uh so as i said these are the smokey's edibles very handsome packaging picked these up in long beach california for 18 bucks which puts them at a slight premium for the gummy edibles that they carry that are 100 milligrams these are a 10 serving 10 milligram edible and it's got all the good stuff on the back your lab testing results your nutrition information all that wonderful stuff and as i said these are 100 milligrams of thc 10 per piece and they contain less than 2 milligrams of cbd per piece really handsome packaging here from smokies i think it's quite nice looking uh i i really appreciate it it's not super opulent or ostentatious or anything it's just a nice print i'm easily impressed that way so let's go ahead and open up these gluten free dairy free vegan no high fructose corn syrup fruit snacks and give them a try [Music] we've got our standard child proof packaging here not gonna fool me today ah and here we are here are our smokies uh these are the jamberry fruit chews i'm not really 100 sure what a jam berry is but let's give it a try uh and i will mention that i did have a little bit of fat uh just a few minutes before this just to take these under optimal conditions probably not necessary i do it jic so here is our first 10 milligram smokies edibles jamberry gummy [Music] i would jam with that berry all day wow that is really tasty vaguely yeah uh berryish berry medley flavor some strawberries some blackberry but uh great gummy i mean taste wise there is just a smidge of that wheat aftertaste um but not much not much at all uh in terms of gummy's taste these are on the better end these are like the uh the plus gummies if not even slightly better tasting [Music] it's hard to say it's good yum again there is just that little bit of weed after taste it's not a whole lot um certainly not gonna ruin it for me uh outside of that taste is really good but the most important thing about these slightly more expensive than usual smokies edibles is are they gonna get you high and for that we're gonna have to wait about two hours to find out for sure like all wheat's reviews i'm going to finish these eight now seven whoops smokey's here over the next probably hour so and then like all wheat's reviews two hours after that last smokies i'll come right back to you guys and let you know exactly how these things are hitting because that's the most important part of any edible review until then stay high stay healthy stay out of this smoke and we'll see you guys soon later [Music] welcome back to wheats everybody it has been two and a half hours since my first smokies edibles not quite so smokies in here uh but still pretty smokies in here i don't know what that means what i'm trying to say is these are damn good gummies i am uh very high right now um i think i would put this in the uh higher tier gummy snacks in terms of both taste and potency um these feel every bit of 100 milligrams if not slightly more so than some of the uh better gummies like your steezies and plus i mean look at my eyes i'm pretty high uh it could also just be that i just finished and what the [ __ ] let's just cherry on top it while we're here uh it could be that i just finished an episode episode four of lovecraft country on hbo max or hbo go or hbo whatever uh hbo noun or verb next to it holy [ __ ] what a good show i'm pretty sure i actually carried on topped the novel upon which it's based years ago years ago uh but now the tv shows out it's really good it's not a whole lot like the novel but that's not a bad thing but also is not a bad thing are these smokiest edibles they are a bit of a premium at 18 uh as opposed to these sort of more 15-ish dollars but they are damn damn good um both in terms of taste and potency and also uh tasting and uh tasting great and being quite strong love craft country on hbo but things i like quite a bit uh both things i look forward to enjoying again at some point in the future smokey's edibles thumbs up love craft country your random cherry on top no effort added but that doesn't take away from the quality at all just like smokies full circle thank you so much for watching weeds guys it has been a blast hanging out with you until our next review live stream whatever it is that you watch with us stay high more importantly stay healthy we'll see you then love craft country", "7U_ET0_HVOw": "oh hi guys just enjoying some splatoon too but that's not what we're here about we're not here to talk about splatoon - as fun as the game may be we're here to talk about marijuana edibles welcome to wheats guys the marijuana edible review show the one where we help you make sense of your dispensary and it's late at night and I'm ready for bed but I can't go to sleep so that's why I've got my cushy punch hundred milligrams here indica variety right here you know Ben so I'm hoping this is going to do the trick this is the second time of reviewed cushy punch I reviewed their TKO formula before 200 milligrams and found it to be pretty disappointing to be honest it did not do much for me since that time I have had several several people come up to me and say and I come up to me I mean comment online that's what I mean by that I've had simple people comment to me online saying give Chris you budget another chance sometimes that their formulation isn't as strong as others but when it hits it really hits so I decided to give it another chance and this seems to be the perfect opportunity when you're ready for some sleep with the indica variety so let's go ahead and open it up give it a taste and I'll come back to you guys in just about two hours after this and hopefully be ready for bedtime so let's find out if that's going to be the case or not okay so we've got our little jar here it looks like a little butter Pat actually a little pad of butter that you would get at our restaurant it's a hundred milligrams of THC in here I said before so let's go ahead and open her up and slope her to him and hopefully get ready for bed in the there we go there's our corner and there she has one big gummy pop her out for little rivulets they're not gonna care just gonna plump the whole thing I'm not it's not super great it's better than the like confused creations or those kind of edibles I've done as good as the flourish it sort of tastes more like a flourish type edible than the infused creations or at a pure or any of those two so it's better than those but it's not as good as the flourish company's in terms of taste so from here guys I'm just going to wait it out and hopefully in two hours I'll be ready for bed so I will see you guys then I'll see you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because that's the way the wheats reviews work for you it's just going to be a couple of seconds so I'll see you on the other side of the break and for me it'll be two hours and I'll let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching weeds guys and I'll see you soon peace mission accomplished I think and a slight redemption for cushy punch I am ready to go to bed quite sleepy at this point looking forward to hitting that pillow and I feel pleasantly buzzed for one hundred and milligram edible this cost me eight dollars at my dispensary all-in with all the discounts so you know pretty affordable 400 milligram edible and I do feel about about a six maybe five and a half or so so you know I'm not super super high by any means but you know definitely high noticeably high and ready to hit the sack so I'm ready to give cushy punch another chance try another one there edibles because they earned their Redemption with this one I just there 200 milligram did not see you know any stronger than this for sure maybe it's just as people have told me their potency seems to fluctuate up and down so maybe this was just a stronger batch but we'll review some more could you punch in a few to see if my opinion changes but for now this was a pleasant surprise and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat skies and we will check you out on a future review peace", "ztvQhTfAVgY": "hello everyone welcome to wheat's the marijuana review show where we help you wonderful fine folks make sense of that crazy maybe now remote place you call your dispensary uh we're out here in beautiful sunny long beach today trying to stay as healthy as we can out here in the pandemic world don't worry i've got my mask on me um but we're gonna do even with this pandemic raging one of our favorite patented wheats reviews and today we are taking a look at a company that's quite big uh one that i don't think i have reviewed anything uh from yet but one that i'm very excited very much looking forward to giving a try and that is one of the many weed companies with the name canna that's right this is canna cannabis infused gummies k-a-n-h-a not the c or k-a-n-e-h of canaco or c-a-c-a-n-n-a of many other cannabrands all these are their 100 milligram gummies pretty standard issue um they are 10 10 milligram gummies so instead of the uh 20 doses you get the 10 in here which i normally prefer indica mango flavored and uh from my experiences with canna their gummies are usually pretty tasty too uh their gummies are quite affordable they're usually a little bit cheaper than uh like the plus gummies or steezy they come in usually a couple dollars cheaper i think i picked these up for 13 at a dispensary in long beach about two dollars cheaper than most gummies that i see in this area um and that indica mango gummy taste sounds really exciting so i'm going to try to open this up with one hand here and we'll get this review started like all of our wheats reviews uh guys the way that they're going to work is i'm going to eat this whole product not necessarily all in front of you on the camera here but i will eat all 10 of these gummies this is gonna be a little bit uh rocking here excuse me you just look at me this way for a moment hello child proof packaging there we are oh wow i could smell them the second that bag opened not the weed smell no weed smell just that that is very very very mangoey uh smelling wow that is a crazy mango scent uh here are the gummies themselves these aren't cubes like a lot of the gummies are these are little pucks very very sugary pucks that's a lot of sugar on it uh so let's give it a taste no weed odor but a crazy amount of mango scent my dog's pretty tired here i'm playing some frisbee oh wow yeah a little bit of um weed taste there at the end but early uh in our taste experience it's nothing but overwhelmingly sweet candy mango flavor uh but i mean that in a good way these are pretty good they go right down uh they're just coated in that mango sugar um so yeah in terms of flavor um no problems with the cannaba cannabis cannabis canna cannabis infused indica mango gummies um real good especially for that 13 price point but the taste is the smallest most insignificant part of the uh edible review uh the most important the signature thing about all edible reviews is it is it gonna get you high and for that you're gonna have to wait just a bit me i'm gonna polish these off over the next i said about hours so and then uh about two hours after i have that last one i'll come right back here and let you guys know if these can of gummies are as good as we hope until then stay safe stay high stay [Music] healthy hello folks i am back it has been two hours since my last can of gummy and the question is can of these make you high uh and the answer is yes they definitely can um these are pretty good uh i think their quality is maybe just slightly under that of like a plus or a steezy or something in that range uh but they are a little bit cheaper and they um hit almost just as hard tastes pretty good um all in all the canna is pretty pretty good uh value so if you see the canna and they're a little bit cheaper than some of the other gummies give them a shot unless you have a really big preference for one of the other brands as long as these ones are a little bit cheaper uh i i think they're going to uh you know this slightly less uh [ __ ] i should just start over holy [ __ ] i'm sorry to me i guess and welcome back to weeds guys it has been about two hours since my last canna cannabis infused indica mango gummy uh and i am very happy to say that uh my joyful journey uh was [ __ ] hello everyone welcome back it has been about two hours since my last canna indica mango gummy uh and my journey was as joyful as advertised uh these are pretty dang good um they are i would say just beneath the top sort of tier uh edible gummies out there uh they are cheaper i've seen these as i said at the beginning of the review routinely uh two or three bucks cheaper than their competitors um i would say they are not quite as good as again those like plus or steezy kind of gummies but they're so close and that price is is is a you know a nice enough discount that the trade-off may certainly be worth it for you um so uh yeah very happy with the can uh canna cannabis and views indica mango gummies uh really like that lion guy he's pretty cool looking um i also uh just now noticed that they are the winner of the most accurate accurately formulated edible by the sas the prestigious sas wow man uh i wish i had known that they were the most accurately formulated editable uh as awarded by the sas beforehand um because i would have you know done nothing different with that information uh speaking of doing nothing additional with any information let me share with you a little cherry on top little something extra that you can enjoy with or without your weed uh both of these though i would say uh probably gonna be a little bit enhanced with weed it's a two for one today uh i'm gonna uh give you the cherry on top of a two for one video game both from the same uh studio which is i believe annapurna the movie studio but they also make video games they had two that came out last year that are both great i think they are both available on ios and switch i played them on switch uh they are called donut county which is sort of like the inverse of a katamari dimashi where you uh met you start as a whole and you make stuff fall into a hole and then the hole gets bigger and then you can have bigger stuff fall into the hole which makes the hole even bigger so that even bigger things can fall into it it's amazing donut county the other one is called sayonara wild hearts very dumb name uh i mean it's kind of a cool name but it's also kind of embarrassing to say sayonara wild hearts out loud uh but it is uh sort of it embraces the cheesiness of that name in the game itself it's kind of impossible to describe both of these games take about 90 minutes to play um and uh they're both available super cheap check them out donut county and um sayonara wild hearts and maybe while you're checking those out try some cannabis canna cannabis infused indica mango gummies it may make them even fun more fun funner more funner until then stay safe stay healthy stay high and we'll see you guys for the next review bye", "2VNYCOaQFSY": "[Music] hopefully 71 the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on this web view we are taking a look at the final product to review from a cushy punch their 100 milligram sativa variety flavor is strawberries the strawberry 100 milligram sativa variety of cushy punch we've looked at their 200 milligram TK o which I found to be kind of lacking and then we looked at their 100 milligram indica and in an experiment we also look at the 100 milligram hybrids and I found both of those to be not too bad so I hope that this is on the better end of the cushy punch I hope it's as good as the other two 100 milligrams I found those to be much better than the 200 milligram sort of surprisingly I would just go with 100 milligrams in terms of cost because I think it's about just about as potent as its 200 milligram brother so without further ado let's going to open this up and eat her down and what's gonna happen after that guys after I finish this I'm going to come back to you in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part about the edible review not necessarily how it tastes but more about how it actually makes you feel so here we go looks like a like a little jam packet or a little jelly packet or a little butter packet it's got four little blocks in there and after we get it plopped out you can see it with its four a little squares but we're going to ignore the little squares there just plug the whole thing in my mouth and one go mmm not bad definitely a little bit of what we taste so much better than the infused creations or the what's the other one I can't remember the name off the top my head but any of those ones that are just like the gummy bears with the basically just like THC oil sprinkled on the outside this is a lot better this is more like the flourish although I don't think it's quite as good as the flourish so now that I've slurped it down I'm gonna wait two hours to see how I'm gonna feel you guys however have to just wait a couple seconds I'll be back right after this break here and I'll let you know how I'm feeling see you then it's been two hours since I had the cushy punch that's the name of it the cushy punch should sieve a hundred milligram THC strawberry flavored gummy here and I gotta say this might be the least hi I've been from one of their hundred milligrams it seemed like the hybrid and the indica hit me more that might just be because I've heard this about um because she punched before that they're not the most consistent some are code and some aren't and that might just be the case with this sativa I'm not not high just more at like four four and a half somewhere in that range instead of the six five and a half six is the other ones so a little bit less than before but again that just might be this particular batch where it might be that sativa doesn't quite hit me as hard but it still is better than my original impressions of could she punch way back when when I had their TKO at the very very beginning I still don't think it would be the first thing I reached for at the dispensary but it won't be the last thing I go for like my opinion used to be so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching it as always and we will see you on the next review peace okay", "zoshAm3-szc": "good afternoon everyone as you know I have the best superintendent in the entire United States with me today Jacqui bird and we're here together once again to talk about the great response from the school board and what happened because 12-year olds did things that they shouldn't have done and here's what it amounts to yep this is marijuana it's gummies it comes in a block it's about a hundred milligram block and this hundred milligram block is supposed to be torn in two Tim individual doses of THC laced gummies now once again I'm not gonna elaborate on the fact that I warned all of this was coming these gummies are produced in California and they're sold online and Leviticus Jones who's 12 years old came into possession of this package of gummies which is about so big Leviticus has told us a couple of different stories about how he can't became involved with possessing this but be that as it may we're working with him his parents are totally cooperating and understand the gravity of the situation so Leviticus comes to school today claiming that he got these this gummy that he tore in two pieces from someone else on a school bus that's still to be determined during second period which is gym class he presented this to a total of six other children in seventh grade I'm told that there were two boys 12 years of age and four girls of the six of them that received a piece of this gummy five of them were transported to the hospital because of an overdose it's easy to figure out six kids a hundred milligram bar that should be into ten separate doses of legal use in California of THC is now distributed the ten dosage between six children we rush them to the hospital with EMS where that are being treated the last child was taken by her parents to the hospital Leviticus will be charged with one count of possession of THC our marijuana resin six counts of distribution of THC within a thousand foot of a school and possession of paraphernalia so it would be seven felony charges and a misdemeanor charge we're fortunate in that the children are all gonna make a great recovery you're going to be all right there's no long term injury or illness here as we understand but obviously we're concerned we're concerned as to one how did a 12 year old ever come to be in possession of this drug this illegal drug in the state of Florida and - why did he offer it to these six kids which quite frankly with the exception of one little corner have apparently devoured this bar they're in gym class so the investigation goes on at this time and we will report the results of that to you let me turn it over to our superintendent and she will give you details about what they did and I just want to brag on the school system their response was remarkable to this emergency whenever it manifested itself at about ten o'clock this morning superintendent Burton Thank You sheriff good afternoon everyone you know again I applaud the staff for what they did when they learned of something happening well students they responded immediately they went by classrooms to check on children they went by and they made sure that they got the children and make sure they make contact and contact it the EM has to come out and take those children to the hospital for you know to make sure they are safe and to make sure they're going to be okay they're all okay but you know the sad part of this is again we could have been here with a different outcome if someone did not respond so I applaud the staff for what they did they follow through with the procedures and the protocols that we have in place and making sure we keep our children safe what I want to say to our parents is that everyone at school today is still safe they'll be safe again tomorrow they're gonna be safe throughout because we do have procedures in place to keep children safe but parents I ask you please talk to your children please make sure we're looking at their online social media if they're buying and purchasing see what it is and then parents talk to your children say if someone is offering you something something that's going on at school that's not normal please let them talk to you and notify us immediately notify the sheriff's office immediately if there's something wrong we want to make sure that everyone is safe when they come to school each and every day so again I applaud not only just our school staff I applaud the Sheriff's Office for making sure that they follow through and making sure that they do what they need to do to protect our children the sheriff and I have a partnership and we have a commitment to keeping our campuses and our children safe at all times you know I can't I don't know the exact symptoms because when they heard about it they they actually went to got the children and they had them transported you know so I don't know the exact symptoms or what they're you know exhibiting at that time because they responded very quickly when they learned of it this is the first time that I'm aware of right now that they can consumed it yes it is legal in California for adults it is not legal it is not legal in the state of Florida in in any way so any possession of this is illegal in the state of Florida and as to their symptoms they had stomachaches they were nauseous dizzy one of them was all but passed out and took obviously way more than the recommended illegal dose by the way fine I'm surprised that I'm finding myself have to talk like that but the bottom line is it's all illegal in Florida and even in California it's illegal for a child habit but when you can go online you know Green Hornet's becomes something that'll sting you and it stung all those kids today I know that Leviticus has it I don't know that he bought it online he's told us at least two different stories of how he came to possess it and we are working through that now so excuse me his parents were totally cooperating with us but obviously they will be working with us on the investigation we're focused on Leviticus at this time we don't have any indication that his parents contributed to this if we determine that then obviously there would be other criminal charges but we don't see that at this time in the investigation his parents have been forthright totally cooperative they they are concerned not only that Leviticus did this but that he exposed these other children so they're concerned about the other children as well and according to Leviticus he didn't take any of this the other kids did but he said he didn't so it's uh it's frightening and fortunately for us it was not some other drug that was more dangerous in small doses than the was even though this was toxic to them in the amounts that they took the other kids have eaten the evidence so to speak so in the in the technical term you could draw blood and then there would be misdemeanor possession but no we're not going to charge the other children they will be dealt with appropriately by their parents and the school system under discipline conduct rules there Leviticus right now is the one we're focusing on but if someone else provided this to Leviticus we want to know because ultimately he's 12 years old so if a 20 year old gave it to Leviticus then our focus is the 20 year old but we've got to work through that during this investigation six six kids and Leviticus is seven okay one child went with her mother five went to the hospital we've not found the one child so we don't know whether or not that child consumed but we're told antidotal II that they did but we've not confirmed that yet Leviticus says he didn't take in at least five for sure maybe the sixth one who we've not talked to we know we know five consumed we suspect the six one consumed five went to the hospital by EMS one written with the parents for six and Leviticus says I provided it ask them if they wanted some and they all tore pieces of the bar off and consumed it and Leviticus is facing seven felony charges in a misdemeanor okay anything else", "db3sIVwDbUM": "- I feel like CBD is for people who do not have a weed plug, and can't afford a psychiatrist. (upbeat music) - I want to try CBD because a health food store near my apartment sells it for so much money, and I don't want to buy it. So I pitched a story on trying it for Jezebel. (laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually. (chill beat)", "hFAmvbrX07E": "well hello everybody welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy mixed up scary overwhelming place you call your dispensary today good old-fashioned classic ass episode of wheats which means it is an edible review my favorite kind of review if we're being honest love me some edibles and one today that i've got uh high expectations for no pun intended uh it comes at a premium price and it comes from a relatively um experienced well-known player in the field but one uh one of these players that is known for their cartridges not their edibles but they are branching out and so who is that that is heavy hitters that's right guys we are taking a look at the gummies uh now out from heavy hitters uh those are the fine folks that make really really nice um premium thc cartridges we've reviewed a couple of them here on wheats like them quite a bit uh and now they are making their own gummies that they say are ultra potent um there are some curiosities with this here first of all it says that they are five 20 milligram pieces which is a hundred milligrams what it's supposed to be uh it's just another sort of indication of how [ __ ] up the labeling is and how nothing really matters with labeling um because technically it's supposed to be everything is supposed to be uh at most or minimum 10 doses of 10 milligrams but this says five 20 milligram pieces well but then they get away with it by showing you actually on the back uh that even though it says they're five uh 20 milligram pieces oh sorry it's right on the front it does say two 10 milligram servings per piece so it's kind of very disingenuous to advertise it that way but whatever um we do have everything we want to see on our packaging here nutrition facts lab testing results showing our 100 milligrams of thc um and uh ingredients all that great stuff i'm not sure i've ever heard of a agar agar before it's one of the ingredients uh this is the strawberry flavored it's free of all the things you would hope it would be free of your glutens your dairies and your nuts um so you know if any of those things need to be free for you this claims that it is free uh and as i said this is at a premium this is an expensive edible uh at the dispensary i go to the gummies usually range in the about 15 16 range this comes in at a premium for 20 bucks uh so the heavy hitter's name uh given a little extra premium on the price let's hope it's going to be a little bit premium on the product so uh let's go ahead and open it here does have some opening instructions on the back i find those always to be those pictograms that show you how to open these child proof uh bags are very bad i think um usually they're not too bad it's usually about actually the trick is opening the bag beneath the zipper as opposed to above the zipper is the trick for most of these originally you know you rip the zipper anyways what does it matter um i just think the iconography of those things is terrible so here we go here are our uh 20 milligram pieces excuse me are two 10 milligram pieces i guess it is nominally scored as such does smell like strawberry and of course like all of our wheats reviews the way we do it i'm going to do the entire product i'm going to eat all 20 not 20. all 100 milligrams of heavy hitters strawberry gummies uh and then about two hours after i have that last one i'll come back to you guys and let you know exactly how we're feeling let's go ahead and try our first of five right here for you hmm wow that is a tasty gummy that is a very tasty gummy i like the gummy a lot almost zero weed taste i mean i'm really looking for it there on the aftertaste not not much i mean that is a gummy i would be very happy to eat uh just uh out of boredom and anxiety like all gummy candies should be consumed but yeah that's that's that's great um a shockingly shockingly uh devoid of cannabis taste which you know hopefully is gonna be a huge positive if these get me as high as their ultra potent label suggests we shall see look that sugar off my fingertips well we're two-fifths of the way there i've got three more of these to go i'm not gonna gorge myself right now i'll have these over the next i usually like to do this over about the next half hour to hour or so and then two hours after that last one actually that is not 100 true um what i'm gonna be doing is doing these next three on a live stream with you guys as soon as i wrap up this first half of this review i'm gonna save these three i'm gonna be doing a live stream hanging out with you folks saying hi getting high with you and at the end of that live stream i'll come back and give you my wrap-up thoughts but that's just a little pitch to you guys let you know we do the live streams now and i hope you will join us for those in the future regardless if you do or not we will be back to tell you if these heavy hitters strawberry cannabis infused gummy are worth the heavy hitters premium price until then stay healthy and stay high my friends see you real soon bye-bye welcome back to weights everybody looks like a dog might be joining us welcome back tweets guys it's been about three hours a little over three hours since our journey started with the heavy hitters strawberry cannabis infused gummy and the dog is still coming in hello dog uh and i am very happy to say and especially if any of you had watched the live stream i did while enjoying this review these are quite good uh these are a premium product at a premium price but i gotta say they do land in that top tier uh echelon of gummy edibles i am very high i'm very pleased with my high uh quite impressive with these and that's not to even mention as a taste which um these are among the best tasting gummy edibles i've had especially for as potent as they are um really happy with it the only downside is that price uh these are more affordable or excuse me more expensive rather than most of the gummy edibles out there uh but you know i i uh some of it may be just uh some psychology of uh wanting it to be more expensive more potent because it's more expensive but if you hear me rambling it seems like it may actually work i don't know might be more than just psychological tricks i really enjoyed it really enjoyed it heavy hitters strawberry hundred milligram gummies can i get a big old thumbs up from me if you can find it and if it's not that much more give them a shot for sure so speaking of premium products uh i want to share with you guys a little cherry on top a little something extra that you can enjoy that's not necessarily weed related that's like let's do something a little premium we're going premium edible let's go premium cherry on top what does that mean i don't know that's kind of a dumb thing but what i do mean is go premium on something and really what i mean by that is get rid of ads on something hulu spotify apple music whatever it is that you use that has an ad subsidized version pay to get rid of ads ads are terrible they're the worst i don't think you even realize how hey you're on youtube pay for youtube premium get rid of ads eat [ __ ] the music stuff who gives a [ __ ] who gives about anything else just get rid of ads live your life with as few ads as possible it's not until you start to consciously remove advertisements from your life that you realize how pernicious and awful they are so this cherry on top is a premium service of your choice and this review is a premium product heavy hitters strawberry that tree on top was really abstract but you know what i mean pay for something you'll be happy you did and that guy's is going to do for this chair on top that's going to do it for this review that's going to do for everything here on wheats i thank you so much for watching as always stay high stay healthy and we'll see you guys on the next video were", "uBlyb3dh02U": "good afternoon we're going to make some THC infused gummies first step is to make sure you have everything that you need out so our items are a three ounce package of unflavored jello or flavored gelatin not sugar-free I'm using two packets of unflavored as per the recipe that I posted and 2/3 cup cold water I've also got my lecithin to the side to put a little bit in because that is a nice fat protein that the THC bonds to there's a little machine that keeps it to a perfect time without having to go back and forth to the stove also has a link posted since we're doing super Lemon Haze on blue so let's again box tile I like to make sure it's very loosely powdery because it'll stick together I said it is a plant fat protein mini whisk mix all of these powders together enter water so we want to make sure that all of the gelatin is wet and separated and there are no clumps of gelatin that are still powdered the gelatin is mixed and 15 minutes has elapsed the gelatin has soaked up the water so enter the trusty little heater you turn that on I'm going to go ahead and break up the gelatin a little bit here and I'm going to wait probably about 10 minutes to come back and stir it again back quick search it's starting to look clearer for the record I'm doing blue for super-lon haze because true clear has a blue label just like I did read for indica and I did yellow for hybrid alright we're gonna let it sit another five minutes so it's been a little bit I'm gonna go with that is as clear as it needs to work because there's lecithin and it doesn't get that crystal clear like if you're doing candy but it is quite smooth quite runny I'm going to inject the super Lemon Haze truth here into it that has been so deep and warming in a cup of warm worth yeah it's tough [Music] and what i'm doing here is optional ma'am I usually pull that off but I'm going to pull some of the jello up in give it a shake and squirt that back in we all want to make the most of all of our product so I'm going to stir that in and once again I'm going to let it sit for five minutes to infuse before we put it into the molds all right we're gonna give it one more stir then because this is gelatin and not egg I'm not gonna whisk it super fast assuming it's going to stay in there [Music] smells like THC so the gummy bear molds that I put the link to hold about a milliliter you don't need to measure but they came with little droppers I'm going to hand this off to my partner because he has a much better non-payment you if you drip anything cuz it's silicone it's gonna that's basically gonna be one dose all of the little dots that end up on top of the silicone yeah kind of scrap all those at the end put them together it's almost like having an extra Bayer we use the opposite color or a different color than the jello you he's gonna go ahead and fill the rest of those up and we'll be back in a moment on to another bold [Music] we're gonna go ahead and stipple some cornstarch onto the back I put these in the freezer they've set and I've let them come back to temperature to make sure there's not a lot of moisture so this is my makeup brush there's a link to this this is the stipple the flat top that's what we're gonna stipple with so I've got cornstarch I just used the cornstarch lid they've got a little folded up foil and a paper towel in case I feel like it's getting too thick so I just went to stipple along the back of these and if you feel there's a bit much you can always go back and kind of wipe something away the nice thing about the brushes you can twist it and if you feel there's too much corn starch somewhere then you can use the edges of it so I like to know that my backs are good prior to pop them out I'm gonna pop this one out like so now gonna turn it over and show you the quick way I just stick my nail into it and pop them out and then lay them out afterwards welcome back to the final step we're going to say it's been 24 hours these will stay out overnight these have been out for 24 hours they're slightly smaller because they've now reduced down a little bit in size once they have dehydrated a bit as such I stipple them on the top with the cornstarch and I'm able to have them not to be sticky any further questions please feel free to send me a private message or post on the video however you'd like thanks", "UgDQ0zsfvVY": "what's up guys thank you guys so much for the feedback on that video it was number one trending for a little bit boys we literally Steve's wanted to do YouTube for a while so we helped them start a channel did check the stats four hundred and fifteen thousand subscribers three [ __ ] days bro that's insane I don't I don't know the record on that [ __ ] someone comment but yeah my first video what 1.9 million views that is [ __ ] crazy and this guy hit number one trending yeah on YouTube that's insane yeah so basically I said 100k I'm gonna do two a licker slam and I'm gonna do it but I just don't know about posting it on YouTube so we're thinking in one week I'm gonna do it on snapchat so if you add my snapchat now one week from today on Thursday's video I'll pop it right here that's like my real name and the reason for that is because snapchat we know will not delete it Steve's tired of doing these liquor slams and then they just get deleted right away yeah so snapchat we know [ __ ]

substances the contents of this video are created purely for education it's inevitable that there will be people who consume these substances therefore it is extremely important to educate people on the effects and how to properly use them so edible pot is a lot different than smoking it it's more potent it's processed in the body differently and the effects lasts longer the difference with edibles is that the active ingredient the chemical that gets you high THC is processed in the liver before the user experiences any effects the original THC from the edible is converted in the liver into a more potent metabolite 11 hydroxy THC it's estimated that this compound is about four to five times more psycho active than normal THC and because the edible has to go through a portion of the digestive process before effects can be felt it can take 30 minutes - as long as two hours before a user feels any effects because of this people who don't feel any effects after an hour so might want to reduce only to have the entire thing hit them like a train all at once an hour later so my advice just wait it out it may take a while but it will come on and unlike smoking cannabis in which the effects last about two hours and gradually drop off after a quick climax right after inhalation edible pot takes its time before it reaches its peak in effect and this peak lasts longer typically the effects of edibles lasts four to eight hours when it comes to the effects there are certainly similarities between smokeable and edible weed but there are some properties that appear to only occur strictly on edibles there are two main reasons someone would want to consume an edible the first is for medical benefits such as aiding symptom relief of stress or anxiety or to help one sleep and the second is simply just for recreational purposes just to have a high and have a time aside from these two reasons there are actually a few people in the psychedelic community who use edibles and very high doses in a similar way to what one would use LSD or magic mushrooms for but we'll touch on that aspect at the end of the video so now we are going to get into what you can expect to feel from the different doses of weed edibles but firstly it's important to know that tolerance is everything tolerance plays a huge role in your experience and if you're an everyday pot smoker you'll likely have to take a much larger dose of an edible that someone who has no tolerance to THC in order to feel the same effect so take the following effects of doses I give with a grain of salt as this is just generally what you can expect to feel when you take this particular dose so first off we have the micro dose and this ranges anywhere from one milligram to about 2.5 milligrams of THC it's unlikely you'll experience any active effects from this dose but it is possible for people who are hypersensitive to the effects of THC this dose is more just for purposes such as mild relief of pain stress anxiety etc people who Micro's THC edibles might also report increased creativity and focus the effects of this dose are pretty passive you likely won't feel any different fundamentally this can be somewhat compared to people who micro doze LSD and magic mushrooms who do so for similar purposes next we have the low dose which ranges from two point five milligrams to about 15 milligrams and the two ends of the spectrum can be very different especially for people with low tolerance to th see someone consuming the edible for medicinal purposes will experience stronger symptom relief and this dose can also be used for people who have trouble sleeping you may begin to feel a sense of euphoria and that classic high feeling where coordination is slightly impaired and overall perception is altered but if this dose the high is unlikely to be overwhelming and because of this this may be a good dose to try for a first-timer in my own experience there isn't a significant difference between this dose and edible in your average smoking weed high the medium dose ranges from 15 to 30 milligrams someone with a decent THC tolerance still may not be feeling heavy effects here but for many vistas can make them pretty high it's at those dose that people may start to feel negative effects such as anxiety and paranoia you might ask if people use weed for relief of anxiety stress then how could this dose bring on anxiety and stress well THC has biphasic effects which means the substance can have opposite effects in different doses anxiety can be reduced in lower doses but can actually be stronger in higher doses so if you're taking edibles for symptom relief it is important to be aware of these biphasic effects the drug in half coordination and perception will likely be altered at this dose that agree to which it is altered will likely depend on your tolerance some people might start to get the classic red eyes from being high maybe some people experience close eye visuals for me personally I tend to have a close eye visual on low to medium dose weed that looks kind of like this let me know if you have experienced the same type of visual in the comments the high dose ranges from 30 to 50 milligrams this dose will likely bring a significant high even to someone with tolerance and for someone with low tolerance this can bring an extreme high their coordination will definitely be impaired somewhat you might feel a strong euphoria maybe you'll feel very laughy some people's mouths get very dry and get cottonmouth this is due to THC mimicking a naturally occurring chemical called an and amide which binds to cannabinoid receptors in our saliva glands which causes saliva production to decrease you might also get the classic munchies and just want to absolutely binge eat it's important to remember that the effects of THC impacts everyone differently so no two people's high will be exactly the same and you likely will only experience some of the effects I listed not all the very high dose ranges from 50 to 100 milligrams I would say it's more likely than not that you will probably experience some negative effects at this dose but the high may become so intense you may feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed people often experience a rapid heart rate panic nausea in headaches at this dose so definitely don't venture into this realm if you don't know what you're doing for someone with an extremely high tolerance this dose might not be too heavy but for the average person this will likely be overwhelming there are still medicinal benefits at this dose but is only used for people who really need it as this dose is sometimes using cancer patients to boost appetite and is also used for people with certain inflammatory disorders personally any dose at this range or above just completely puts me on my ass the come-up is nice for me as I feel very laughy energetic and social but once the effects really start peaking I honestly begin to struggle to stay awake and wish to do nothing else but to find a cozy place to lie down and fall asleep this may have been due to the strain though as THC isn't the only psychoactive chemical we it's just the most prominent CBD is the chemical that aids with sleep and this chemical also plays a role in the overall effects of the weed and the amount of CBD in the strain will most definitely impact your experience and finally the extremely high dose is going to be anything above 100 milligrams I've heard of some edibles having 250 milligrams some having 500 and even some containing as much as a thousand milligrams obviously the effects will get significantly higher as those increases a 100 milligram edible might not be incredibly strong for someone with a very high tolerance but certainly 500 milligrams is going to put anybody on their ass be very careful of consuming edibles this powerful as there will certainly be negative effects due to the intensity it's in these very high doses that have experienced visuals reminiscent of a psychedelic trip on say LSD the visual might be something kind of like this and speaking of psychedelics there's many people who report having psychedelic like trips from high doses of weed edibles the world-famous Joe Rogan likes to discuss edible pot as along the same lines as psychedelics such as LSD psilocybin mushrooms and DMT saying that edible pot can take you down the rabbit hole there's a comment I found from someone on reddit that I thought described as similarity of the psychedelic feeling on high-dose edibles perfectly not long ago I did a hundred milligrams of THC edibles and had zero tolerance on my couch my eyes closed and no music it was awesome and the peak was over three hours I swam through the psychedelic mind a tunnel with many doors and behind each door was a memory of mine I went through them and had Total Recall I could recall past memories memories of being born my first laugh before thinking and the experience that my first thought as an infant the pure thrill of thinking now the effects of THC in the brain is nowhere close to resembling that of a psychedelic classical psychedelics interact directly with the 5-htt to a receptor in the brain and cannabis does not do this from doing research it seems to be that weed edibles tend to resemble psychedelics more often for people who have already had experiences with psychedelics in the past it's likely more often that this psychedelic feeling is also associated with strains with higher THC levels and lower CBD levels as CBDs antipsychotic effects will likely lessen the psychedelic effect but if you find yourself feeling like you're in the middle of an intense psychedelic trip I'll say what I've always said before let the experience consume you surrender to the substance let your mind flow freely and try not to attach yourself to these thoughts just simply observe don't make any attachments so that's about it for this video hopefully you have a better idea on what you can expect to feel by the different doses of weed edibles if you're new start low THC affects everyone slightly differently so see how you react to the substance stay safe consume responsibly and you'll be fine if you seek to support my work on a deeper level consider joining the patreon I run a book club on there where we read one book a month

product reviews Juanes our gummies are produced by Buckeye relief out of East Lake Ohio gummies are housed in a white plastic bottle with a pine green cap there are ten gummies per bottle each containing roughly eight milligrams of THC and CBD per coming one us our gummies are flavored like strawberry lemonade it is worth noting for diabetics that these gummies are not sugar-free containing sugar pectin and corn syrup the bottle itself is fairly easy to open and is 100% recyclable design for this Ohio medical marijuana edible is appealing with a colorful photo of fruit on the cover and a striking wanna logo inside patients are treated to ten swear gummies crafted into the shape of the THC warning logo the gummies are a deep shade of pink almost like grapefruit and are covered in tasty sugar crystals in terms of flavor the name says it all these gummies are juicy bursting with strawberry sweetness and a tart lemon flavor that's just right I wasn't wincing or pinching my lips while chewing on this gummy like I might with other sour candies if you're looking for that experience though I'd suggest mixing this gummy with some sour patch kids medicinally wanna sour gummies provide a one-to-one ratio of THC and CBD per gummy this translates to a medicinal experience that's both mildly euphoric and relaxing used a few hours before bed this gummy is excellent for distressing after a tough day it's also great for inflammation relief rest and sleep euphoria creeps up with this one building to a crescendo about an hour or two after eating the edible I could initially feel a slight headband effect that grew in intensity before peaking and slowly dissipating this was followed by immediate pain and stress relief overall I rather loved one a sour gummies they are great for the evening providing gentle euphoria inflammation relief and smooth relaxation before bed if you've been searching for a good gummy edible be sure not to miss this one final rating 4.9 out of 5 be sure

edibles you guys so this is gonna be a first impression one the other one that i tried was the pink lemonade indica uh gummies from them and i did not like the taste of it it was freaking gross i just felt like the lemon with like the wheat taste did not really it just it was really like bitter so i did not like it so hopefully these ones are better i'm hoping but i'm not gonna lie they still hit like these are definitely really potent i did 50 like in one setting so i took five of these they're each 10 milligrams uh per piece and then it's 100 milligrams thc in there um there are 23 calories per dummy and then they have 2.9 grams of sugar 0.4 grams of protein and 4 milligrams of sodium and then zero cholesterol zero fat no yeah total fat is zero and then saturated fat is zero so i guess that's good um basically the ingredients in here is just like the basic or whatever you know they're not vegan or anything they do have vegan gummies uh from this line uh they're like their nano line but um it's not the one i got i got these ones they were on sale i wanted to try them so yeah and they did smack so i'm gonna open these and we're gonna try them out together [Applause] you guys i'm having such a hard time i don't want to cut them because of the scissors so okay i think we got it i think so stop my dog is like what is this their bag is like hella child proof because i can never get these open like so this is like my thing i just kind of spread it and it always works so okay let's see they smell like mango they definitely smell more sweet it's like orange in the inside let me show you what they look like a piece they're kind of like small they're like small and like kind of like thick thick and they're kind of thick but like they're small and they're coated in sugar and everything this smells like lemon but i don't know how they're going to taste i'm kind of scared but let's try them so this is 10 we're gonna do five and then i will come back and show you guys how high i get in like it says 90 minutes i feel like for me it takes a little bit longer than 90 minutes i don't know why i feel like to hit me a little bit later than that and i'm like [ __ ] stuck so here it goes [Music] [Music] these ones are definitely less bitter than the pink lemonade ones those ones are way more bitter and this one still has a little bit of that aftertaste that you get with edibles so they do have that i feel like the ones other ones that i tried were the smoky ones and they didn't have that bad of like the taste after but it's not terrible but it is there a little bit i know with some you don't really taste them at all so it just really depends so yeah these are the indica ones and they're mango i was kind of excited for these but now that i kind of had them already they're like i wouldn't try this flavor i think i would try something else like a different flavor but [Applause] i just feel like they're not like the best i mean they're good they're potent definitely so i guess that spectrum of it does work out but as far as the taste goes i would give them like a probably like an eight or something like that seven like a seven and a half so i'm gonna have four of these i'm gonna eat one more on camera but i don't think you want to see me eat edibles i mean i guess but i'm just it feels like i'm chewing forever so i'm gonna eat these off camera and then i'll see you guys once i feel the effects and then i will let you guys know how i feel i'm gonna get pretty high i mean i already know this it's already gonna happen so but i will see you guys in a bit br b okay guys i feel like i was kind of bashing the taste with these they're not that bad um but i feel like i still like my smokies edibles a little bit better as far as that weed taste goes that aftertaste is kind of like i guess when you drink some water it'll go away but it's a little much so this is my number three i had the first one on camera i had the second one off camera and i'm gonna have this one with you guys because [Music] like that's the thing with edibles like i just do not like that aftertaste you know like i don't know i kind of feel like this is bad lighting but you guys it is i was gonna film in my car right and then i was gonna film in the living room but i kind of have company over so um i don't wanna do that and then i'm in my room now but and then outside it's so super windy and then in my car i don't really want to sit in my car because honestly i just i don't know i wanted to change it up so i was just like let me just go in my room let me just sit down it's warm because it's super windy outside right now so i just oh my god sorry i got interrupted so these so this is to be my third one and yeah i just decided to do it inside because it's super cold and everything and i just i don't want to be outside it's so windy today like i don't know why it's so windy but it's windy it's gonna be windy all day today so whatever so this is number three down the hatch once they're good in the beginning and the aftertaste comes they're like super gummy like they definitely don't like just disappear like you do have to chew them down i feel like some gummies they just kind of like gone so they're more of like a chewy gummy i like them i don't hate them so i guess i've already had all of them no yeah cause there's six four five six so this is number four because i was like wait i what but no i have one more to eat after this one so there's six left in here i've already done 40 milligrams and this is my last one i'm so happy i love to get to the last edible if i don't really enjoy it i feel like it wasn't that bad i would definitely rate these for the price point and everything um i got them for like i think 15 and then i got them like on like a special promotion deal on edibles so it was like 13 but with tax it was still like 15 16 so for the price the regular price i think for them is like 20. so for the price um would i get them again probably not i would probably get the other ones that i enjoy more but they're not bad they're definitely not like horrible or anything i just feel like that aftertaste is kind of strong it was really strong with the pink lemonade ones for sure but with these ones it wasn't as bad so i feel like i just gotta try maybe different flavors and i will enjoy it a little bit more so i don't hate the guys i really don't but i definitely feel like there's better out there but they're not horrible they're definitely i would give them like a nine no seven to eight eight and a half kind of thing so i was", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "vLm9VAXFl6I": "and so I'd still take my life in it a fruit roll-up what's up guys welcome back today I have yet another gummy video for you guys and I'm very excited about this one because I think it's going to make a lot of people's lives a lot easier and it is going to be delicious today we're going to be doing a little experiment making gummies out of two ingredients store-bought gummy bears tincture or coconut oil so I just bought some gummies from bulk barn any gummies are fine and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to melt these down and I'm gonna add to some of them tincture and to some of them coconut oil and we're gonna see how they're going to turn out I think the ones with tincture will turn out amazing the coconut oil ones I'm not so sure about so let's try it out and see how it goes PS these are like the best gummies ever they're the Albanese brand you can buy them at a lot of places and they're so good they have like the best flavors the green ones and the white ones are my favorite so I'm actually not going to use them for this recipe so I'm probably gonna eat them while I'm melting them first step is to sort your gummies you don't have to smoke them if you don't want to but I want all my colors to be separate all right let's do this so I separated my gummies into yellow and orange purple and then my favorite ones just to eat while I'm doing this and we're gonna melt them and then add in our ginger and coconut oil and see how it goes I have no idea how long it's going to take us to microwave them so I'm going to start with like 15 second intervals and just check on them and then we'll find out how long it takes to melt them without over putting them I don't know so start with these great ones here there's a total of 13 gummy bears in here and they're just regular sized right there I mean they're a little bit bigger than like kuriboh gummy bears um but they're pretty standard so I was going bears and you guys can even see that okay so I'm gonna check on them in about 15 seconds and see how warmed up and melted they are so that's 20 seconds and they're starting to melt but they still need a little bit more so I put it in there for another 10 seconds okay so this is a total of 30 seconds pretty much melted and good to go I'm gonna add my tincture into here for this amount of gummies I'm going to do 1/2 a teaspoon of tincture so it's just room temperature you don't want to have it like really cold or frozen because it will affect the heat from the gummy so we'll just put that half a teaspoon in so there it is and let's see how well this stirrer is in if it doesn't stir it hopefully you guys can see that can you oh you guys can't even see that there we go so hopefully that stirs in well and if it doesn't we are going to add some lesson and lecithin into this to help combine it but I think that there's enough things and the gummy bears to start with that we shouldn't have any issues getting this to emulsify or combine or whatever you want to call it so that looks pretty good and then we're just gonna put these into a mold the same way you would with homemade gummies and let them sit and we will move on to our next batch so this is quite a bit thicker then they're coming mixtures so it seems like it's kind of hard for the little syringe to pull it up so that's one a little bit of an issue here so let's see yeah see we can't really soak it up so our options would be to microwave it more so it gets more liquidy or to add more liquid but I do not want to add more liquid so I am going to put it in the microwave for another 10 seconds okay so that was another ten seconds for a total of 30 are sorry a total of 40 seconds and I think they should be good enough to be able to put into our molds so I have about half in the mold then it's being a little bit trickier to put in that I thought it was going to be I'm having some trouble like getting the the dropper to like suction it up and that's because it is really thick so again I'm going to put it into the microwave for another 10 seconds and warm it up some more now if you had a lot more going there zero melting I'm like I did it this won't be as much of an issue because the heat will contain itself because there's a larger amount because there's such a small amount that's getting cooled off quicker and thickening faster and also like my dropper is like has a limited stuff to suck up so that won't be if you're doing a larger amount but it's not hurting anything by putting it in the microwave for just like 10-15 second intervals you just have to make sure you work kind of fast so let's throw that back in okay so looks a little different now I guess it just melted a lot more it's a lot more liquidy and put these interim moles okay so I put the purple ones into a molds now let's try some more but with the coconut oil let's do the yellow ones one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen so we'll do thirteen of them just like we did last time and then we're gonna microwave this I'm going to start it with 40 seconds okay here's our 40 seconds melted they're nice and liquidy still might be a bit of an issue with the syringe dropper thing but if you have like one of those bottles you can dispense them with that'll be like way easier but let's add in the coconut oil so I hope you know what nut oil is what I expect to be the most difficult but I think that there's already less lecithin in the gummy bears so the oil should be able to emulsify pretty good but we'll find out so let's have it half a teaspoon of coconut oil okay we got our half teaspoon let's mix that in so so far it's actually mixing in really well that's all something I do for gummy bears with tincture instead of coconut oil because they I think they taste better but I know that most people you should just have coconut oil on hand the texture is a little bit different with the coconut oil I'm going to put that back in the microwave for another like 15 seconds alright so I did another 10 seconds I thought 15 might be too much all right now let's put these in their molds it looks like it's a lot harder using these so I'm gonna use one of my squeeze bottles which will be a lot you hear well I guess I should say hopefully it will be a lot easier you can see that like the coconut oil's making it like that doesn't like stick to the sides of the bottle that much I'm actually very surprised how well the cup oil mixed in oh my god that's so hot oh god it burns okay so don't touch hot melted candy because it is really hot and it hurts okay and this is cooled off a bit now that I've changed the bottle so hopefully it comes out okay if not I'll put it until I got a hot bowl of water or something look at all that gelatin or gummies sitting on the top there and I gotta get him down I'm just gonna leave this to sit upwards to get this to come down guys it's just it's it's too sticky this didn't really work that well either I'm gonna take the metal cap off and I'm gonna put it in the microwave just like this hopefully that works okay I did it ten seconds in the microwave it still doesn't look like it's gonna come out like this No okay this is not working either see another way that we can get this into the mold I mean like it's still gonna taste delicious I'm probably gonna have to eat a lot of this like just peel out of the bowl and stuff okay my plan was to cut a hole and squish this through but I don't think that's gonna happen well let's let's try see oh it's working okay I mean it's a little hardened now Oh No okay this is not working very well okay so the melting of the gummy bears and adding coconut oil didn't work very well I don't know why it seems like it almost got like harder like I now I'm just wondering if I like I microwaved it too many times like I don't know it just it won't come out really it's too thick to come out of anything so I'm gonna make another batch with the tincture just to test that out um again and see it's like it's definitely going to work or if it's user error and I mean it still I'd still take my get it a fruit roll-up it still tastes good if you wanted to you just melt them and then I mean this is really good little easy to get through oh look but you could just melt it and put it onto like parchment paper or silicone and peel it off after and just cut it into strips it's like the same thing it just won't be in the molds the actual gummy product mixed really well - coconut oil it tastes amazing of course you just they just happen to make sure it's pretty making the mold so still work very good I'll be snacking on this later okay let's do some more with the orange gummies and let's put some more tincture and then this time 1112 where do we do 13 or 12 I remember 30 I think and you don't have to do 13 so it's just the number I'm doing I don't know just - just what it is I'm doing and yeah you can just use whatever amount you want obviously you're really good okay let's microwave this you've got 30 seconds we're gonna do double the tincture so one teaspoon instead of half a teaspoon see this looks like it might have been too much tincture too much liquid and they might not set but you could always add more gelatin but I have a feeling these will set they'll just be a lot softer but if you want them to be able to firmer you could just add a sprinkle of gelatin a little more liquidy consistency as will definitely be easier to put into our moulds hopefully this one works a bit better I think it will we just got to act fast I mean using a dropper I probably would've been fine I don't know why decided to use this because it's such a small amount coming out already there we go oh yeah that's perfect oh and also just FYI if you buy these bottles which are really great for gummy making when you're making larger amounts not like this much died by making the tape it comes with like this I don't know if you can see that it's really really small and the gummy mixture is usually too thick to come out so I just put a different tip that's a little bit wider on there to make sure it can get through this was really difficult to use with such a small amount that I had so use a dropper if you have one this is usually my go-to option to squeeze things into molds but because there is such little amount when I squeeze it it's not really doing anything whereas if there was like this much gummy make sure when I squeeze it the pressure would push it out but because I made such a small amount obviously it's gonna be a little bit trickier I will just eat this out of the bottle later I'm just going to put the gummies that I need into the fridge probably for like 20 minutes alright guys I'm back but it hasn't been 20 minutes it's been two days so I took the gummies Oh after 20 minutes and they were not nearly hard enough I couldn't even really get them out of their molds so I put them in the freezer for a little bit like about half an hour and once they were hard enough I popped them all out of their molds and just left them on some parchment paper but they still were a little bit too squishy and too like corn syrupy so I left them out for a day and they were still a little bit too squishy Tomo for another day which is where we are now so it's been two days and they are perfect so if you guys make these just leave them out on a piece of parchment paper for a couple days depending on how humid it is wherever you live it might be a little bit different like it's not very humid where I live at all um so they dry up pretty quick but if you live somewhere very humid they might take a lot longer to dry or they might even not work for you in the first place so I'll show you what they look like so both the purple and the orange ones turned out very well you can see they're sticky obviously because they are sticking to my fingers so they are a little bit stickier than like a regular gummy but they're they don't really stick together in the bag because I've let them dry out for a few days so the purple ones had half a teaspoon of tincture in them and the orange ones had double that amount so they had one teaspoon of tincture and I thought they were gonna have a lot of issues but they're totally fine yeah they turned out very well and they taste just like the gummies did before I remoulded them last thing just to clarify um my gummies with the coconut oil didn't turn out only the ones with the tincture worked for me I don't know why the coconut oil ones didn't work if you guys know why please let me know because I'm very curious so yeah guys these turned out fantastic I'm super impressed with the results I definitely am gonna use this method many times in the future um going forward what I would do is for every 10 dummies I would do half a teaspoon of tincture so you can just multiply that by however many you want to make in total but based on what I've seen with these with half a teaspoon and the regular teaspoon they both turned out so you couldn't probably get away with using a little bit more but if you're looking for a starting point I would go with ten nine bears and half a teaspoon all right please let me know if you guys try this out I hope you enjoyed the video and let me know if there's any videos you would like to see I hope you guys enjoyed this video please comment like and subscribe thank you guys for watching have a wonderful day", "J5Nu589uIAw": "what's up everybody my name is Sarah feet and welcome to the channel the haze we're gonna be reviewing the very famous very well-known and very beloved got me edible cushy punch now this is a California brand this is the sativa formula and it is absolutely fantastic so there's a few different types of products such as you punch makes the gummies I believe are their main and their original I know now they have like vaporizers they have CTD products things like that but the cushy punch are very well known for their gummies now these guys come in a hundred milligrams they also have a 200 milligram call to TKO and these guys come in these awesome little packet they're easy to break apart and each of these little squares is ten milligrams so you can dose however much that you would need personally now they are pretty strong I don't know exactly how they're made so they are made with organic sugar and feature no artificial coloring is all made with natural coloring so if that's something that concerns you if you have allergy problems and you can do artificial coloring these guys are a great option so let's talk about flavor these guys are really nice they're sweet but you do get a strong kind of cannabis oil to smell to them so if you pull them out in public if someone partakes or it is kind of in the know-how of how cannabis smells a little recognize this then they will smell it now if you're trying to see what kind of high this is this is the sativa one and for me these guys will keep me well they don't make me drowsy you can be very creative on them yeah I built this Depot these guys are good I could go together in a pinch because you will find out my most places now if you're talking prices they kind of range up and down I've seen these guys as low as $10 and S&M as high as $20 I don't really know if there's just a lot of places that are able to up the prices because it is wanted so bad if you can find a good deal on them they're very much worth it if it's the people are signing for 20 bucks and if you have to get it but it's a bit bit overpriced for these guys all in all if you are someone who travels a lot these guys aren't perfect companions they're small to fit in your pocket if you go to the movies a lot these are great as well so that is my little small review for the fam the cushy punch well there you go guys thank you so much for taking the time and watching this review again my name is Sarah B welcome to the haze and I will see you next time oh also please follow us on Instagram the haze anyway guys thank you so much for watching I hope to see you next time and shout", "GopidLYktQA": "and in our Health Alert tonight nine students in Florida hospitalized after eating marijuana infused candy apparently a student inadvertently brought the THC candy to school mistaking the product for a popular sour candy our chief health editor dr. partha nany joins us now with more on what happened and how those kids are doing now doc thanks Alan well first of all the students injuries were not life-threatening the kids were between ages 10 and 12 and were sent to the ER because they were having stomach pains but this is still a warning for parents who have edible marijuana products in their home if the packaging and the candy or treat inside resembles any products that kids are familiar with then they're more likely to see it as normal food and be tempted to eat it unfortunately these types of accidental poisonings are on the rise so dr. nany why does food prompt more overdose incidents well Glenda edibles often have several times the recommended dose of THC now t-h-e is this psychoactive ingredient in marijuana yet the edibles take a longer time to kick it me that you won't feel the effects right away so oftentimes people end up eating even more of the drug as for kids they can experience severe effects like trouble breathing loss of coordination altered perceptions panic paranoia and heart problems all bad things all bad things for sure doc so when kids overdose what are the long-term effects super important question Alan and honestly I don't have a good answer for you because acute marijuana exposure on children has not been systematically studied so there's no research or science findings regarding the full effects so it's super important that anyone who has kids in their homes keep edibles and all types of marijuana products out of reach and out of sight they should also be kept in child resistant packaging that also contains the the way so that it seals it conceals the contents rather so it can't be seen and please don't consumes the edibles in in front of the kids because we need to keep them safe we do dr. Nandi that's great advice thank you for joining us and if you a question or health concern for the good doctor email him dr. Nandi at ask dr. Nandi dot-com or send it to us on Facebook or Twitter we'll get it right to him", "Aa2NwPvyInc": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan HOF key operating officer of honey stick as well as Gold Line CBD and in today's tutorial episode we are gonna be calling it CBD gummies for dummies why not because we're insulting anybody's intelligence but because we are gonna break down in a very simple fashion of exactly what the differences are between the different types of gummies available in the market one of the most common questions that we get to our Gold Line customer support is what I hear things like full-spectrum isolate coated infused gummies what's the difference what effect does that have on me and our CBD there's all these gummies out there and no real explanation on what the difference is they cost different they have milligrams so this episode is gonna break down the main categories and differences for gummies what does that mean for your CBD in a very simple to understand fashion and how does that affect your buying of your CBD your supplements whatever so basically we have a few major categories for CBD now a lot of the products you'll see out here if you're familiar Gold Line you will see from our website some of them are not offered on the website but they are prevalent in the market so I think it's important to have them out here so we can have a full discussion even outside of the things that our company is currently offering so you're properly educated on CBD so let's jump into it right away what are the major differences between gummies were the most common questions that I get is what is the difference between isolate gummies and full-spectrum gummies and it's really simple it's what type of CBD DEET is being used isolate gummies are generally made from biomass and it is synthesized off of different hemp products and the CBD is processed and extrapolated until it becomes basically a hundred percent pure a beedi and it's in almost a crystallized form and it's really easy to calculate it's very easy to make different solutions for your gummies it's a very good effective way to know how many milligrams you're gonna get and to make sure that there is absolutely zero THC within your gummies so for people who might necessarily get drug tested or not want to roll the dice on having even any traces of THC within their gummies or their CBD products that they're taking I select gummies are gonna be the way to go so when you're buying CBDs and you're asking your manufacturer like us questions then you would ask whether they have isolates or their full spectrum now what is full spectrum full spectrum is basically gonna have traces of THC however it's still gonna be below the legal limit which is 0.3% for hemp according to the US farm bill now that 0.3% is even below 1% so it is extremely small portion of THC however some people don't want any instead of being processed over the the full spectrum is actually taken from you know basically the live plants so generally when I select gummies are very high in CBD full spectrum and broad spectrum you know made based gummies that use that type of CBD they will have other things like CBN CBG CBC and different spectrums within the CBD category to give you a very complete form of all the different type of CBDs so let's say that you know full spectrum is more like a multivitamin if we're comparing the two different types of CBDs so our CBD is just specific you are getting your CBD and that's that so some people prefer the full and the broad spectrum for that reason and other people prefer the isolates because they don't want to roll the dice they just want to know exactly what they're getting and you are still getting the good effects the supplemental effects of CBD we won't go into what the different effects are people using gummies for different conditions or whatnot or CBD that's on you guys to research I'm not dr. Gupta I can give you medical advice or supplemental health advice but the differences are is full spectrum and isolate based the next large difference is is where the gummies are infused or whether they are coated some people use these terms not properly because they think that if it's infused with CBD that it is just CBD is on there so there's two ways of getting CBD within the gummies you can either coat them or you can actually infuse them to where it's like I like to compare to donut so I mean who doesn't love donuts coated gummy is like a glazed doughnut sort of flavoring and stuff it's put on the top and that's how those gummies are made is that they're made and they are basically sprayed or soaked with the CBD solutions and they get absorbed into the gummy and they're on the outside to infuse gummies they're more like a jelly doughnut to where the solution is on the inside the oil is on the inside and they've been either injected or it's been formulated into the actual compound of manufacturing the gelatin or the building block of the gummies so that is another key difference and between that people say were some of pluses and minuses pluses and minuses are as generally the ones that are coded on the outside those are generally less expensive so they're more budget-friendly however the ones are injected are usually a little bit more consistent so if you're buying a jar of 1500 milligram coated gummies some gummies might be a little bit stronger than the other depending on how they record or if they're touching the edges of the jar and some of the CBD mighta came off and beyond the jar so you might have to take one two more of the coded gummies - whereas some of them might be a little bit stronger so they kind of average out but if you're looking for super consistency then you want the infused got me the jelly donut because that is basically an exact amount that they put into the gummy so now with these examples let's go into you know what different types of gummies there are so outside of the full spectrum and isolate gummies and the coated and infused gummies now you have gummies in the categories of even flavoring so here we have our CBD Gold Line let's take a look at this half of the product line right here so here is basically our offering of CBD Gold Line now these are actually all isolate based gummies so these will have absolutely no traces of THC they have they have basically a total amount of milligrams that you will get per jar and we recommend that you take two to three gummies per serving so we have different textures for gummies our first one here is going to be our sour gummy which is going to be like I said these ones are an isolate based so they're gonna be the zero TAC you're gonna go ahead and open it here so these are gonna be like sour flavored gummies and they are coated with our Goldline CBD solution very clean job of openness let's get close-ups here you get several different colors and these are gonna be more sour and taste you're also gonna have a little outside sugar coating for a little bit of a little bit of extra flavor let's go ahead and take one out and get a real nice close-up if you're into the sour taste not just kind of a plain fruity taste this will definitely be up your Avenue and also sometimes the sour taste can offset any taste within to come with the CBD oils so even when you're dealing with full spectrum gummies and things like that if you have a sour bass gummy it can offset any type of you say I don't like the taste of natural CBD oil there's CBD solutions then a sour gummy might be or a sugar-coated gummy might be a good alternative for you to offset some of that taste so you get a more pleasant experience of Wired having your CBD then you have your natural gummy which is basically plain fruity flavor a lot of companies just in making gummies that aren't CBD infused make very similar gummies that your the taste will be familiar from any of the Albanese gummies and things that you can get from the supermarket except they have the added CBD and these have been coated not infused and they use isolates they have zero THC every once a while different isolate gummies have different solutions every once in a while you might get some type of you might think it's sugar it's crystal but actually the CBD isolates come in the form of CBD crystals so every once awhile it might not be uncommon to see crystals on the gummies it might not have gotten fully absorbed into the gummy or that might be on the outside when the CBDs are a hundred percent pure that they're like isolates it's not uncommon to see some crystals I don't see any on this gummy so everything was good but these are generally big fruity flavored gummies so they're there Jim a little bit more fluffy they have the fruity taste these aren't gonna be the sour gummies so let's go ahead and put this back and move along so on Goldline CBD we generally sell the gummies in two sizes we have a 12 ounce and an 8 ounce and also some smaller assortments generally it's you know more value driven to buy more but we have all the way down to I think 10 or 20 pack that you can buy or even a 5 pack that you can purchase on the website just a sample the gummy to see if you like it and then once you're a go we do all kinds of bundles and you can go up to 12 ounce which contains I think about a hundred and twenty gummies so here we did a limited run for the holiday season these are of our holiday gummies on top of being the large fluffier gummies and being you know of holiday colors which is a red white and green over here these are actually uh flavored also so they're gonna have the different a little bit more added fruity flavor into them so it is a little bit more of a premium gummy than your standard base gummy bears that uh that are used so it's gonna be a little bit of an upgrade but you're not gonna get any of the sour taste so you know what a lot of people and a lot of companies even outside of ours will do is they'll use different types of flavored gummies as their base so you can kind of know what gummy bears from going to the supermarket that you like or what type of tools you like when you're selecting your ideal CBD gummy and I hope it's a gold line but in the event that it's not look for that too when you're on the hunt for buying your gummies let's go a little close-up of these guys so you can see we have the red green and white give me a thumbs up that you got a good focus and other gummies so there you see we have the nicest Ortman they're a little bit fluffier in texture and they also have the added flavor infusion so you're gonna have a very flavorful experience with these holiday gummies and they're still available on our website I think for the whole month of January we continued producing them and once that goes away we'll probably still offer these gummies but they're not going to be holiday oriented maybe some Valentine's Day gummies so now moving right along to our full spectrum gummies these use a high quality of full spectrum oil and on top of that they are actually infused so they are injected into the gummy so each time you get a gummy these that we have here available in four flavors you're gonna get a very consistent 10 milligrams of CBD in each gummy now we used to offer a 25 milligram full spectrum going but a lot of people especially when it comes to full spectrum you can actually taste the CBD oil so taste a little bit more like a medical gummy so there's different things that you have to do to the gummy to offset the taste some people are really into it like the Colorado and California style gummies and that's kind of what it tastes like and some people would rather just have you know a flavorful experience as well so what we did was we realized is that instead of offering a 25 milligram gummy let's kick it down to a 10 so some of the oil taste is not as prevalent and we also have poor flavor so we flavor and fuse the gummies on top of it so let's go ahead and get a close-up of what's available here so we have cherry flavor fruit punch and also strawberry and an orange citrus I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to lay each one of these out here on the table so you can see they're actually fruit shaped and the different flavor is actually indicated by the different color these are really nice gummy very high qualities of very high quality full spectrum oil and they are also quality infused so you have very consistent flavoring taste and CBD oil quantity in between each one of these gummies and again like I said you can get them available in the four different flavors yeah so like we said these will actually be below the point three legal limit for according to the the hemp farm bill passed in 2018 so these are in accordance with that however they might have little traces of THC within the legal hemp limits but they're there is that there is that so people who don't want to roll the dice to get you know drug tested and things like that then generally you want to stick with the isolate based product because there is zero THC in there whatsoever those could be within the legal limits see would be fine and it's still very very small almost non-traceable but we do have to put that out there for you guys then there's also gummies that we're developing that are almost like gushers to where there are very soft and heavily infused with flavor so it's kind of like they melt in your mouth and then they have the the the flavor follows up afterwards and rolls them so it's different from kind of a chewable gummy this is this is an extremely soft chew if we could even classify that but I would say it to a gusher and we have them infused I just want to go ahead and show these because some companies I've seen are doing it we're gonna start offering it but we have not yet so these are in the shape of bear but they're extremely soft very fluffy and almost melts I even feel bad putting them putting them out here but they are and they are actually they're full-spectrum and they're infused we have some of these samples are 25 milligrams all the way down to 10 but you can see that these are more than fusion style soft to customized gummies tour these these gummy bases are actually custom made to really melt so these ones are gonna be more like a gusher and generally you can tell from how fluffy and how soft they look and if you get a real good close-up there you can you can see the difference between that and even a fluffy standard gummy you know so again those would be full-spectrum and infused and then for those people who are looking for positive hemp benefits possibly a multivitamin I've also seen we don't currently offer them but hemp will extract gummy chews that you can see here these actually have hemp oil they're CBD content isn't really confirmed but it does have 20 milligrams of a hemp extract and it's also infused with like a multivitamin tour it has like your vaults a mitten or a vitamin b-complex and also your vitamin C's and different vitamin E so if you're just looking for like a nutritional supplement and don't necessarily want CBD we don't offer it but these are starting to get really popular within the hemp community and something you probably will come across most of these because they also have the multivitamin they're not going to be coated they're gonna be infused so they are gonna be very consistent to take on a daily basis you won't each one is gonna be very consistent to the other and again sometimes with the coated stuff some of them might be a little bit strong and others but generally averaged out pretty good so in summary I hope that today's

you're a regular subscriber thank you so much and welcome back so today I'm going to be doing a sugar-free can of butter gummy candy recipe that's mouthful uh and so for all those people who diabetic or don't like sugar or on a healthier on a healthier version this is a healthier version of a gummy bear for you so I don't really have much more to say all the instructions and everything or coming forward so what about further ado we'll just get started okay so what we're going to need for our sugar-free cannabutter gummy candies is three tablespoons or three envelopes of unflavored gelatin one box of sugar-free jell-o for our liquids you can either just use real lemon juice you could use these flavored waters that have no sugar or any juice that has no sugar at it and you can just use water and for additional sweetness we can add in some honey or you're gonna need a half a teaspoon of gorga a half a teaspoon of citric acid a quarter to a third of a cup of canned butter melted can of butter and if you want additional colors or flavors you can add those in as well you can use the the oil base or the gel based flavors the equipment that you're going to need obviously your mold whatever molds you want to use a double boiler if you don't have a double boiler any pot small pot and metal bowl that fits you know you don't want it to touch the bottom so you want it to have enough room and that you can do a makeshift double boiler you're gonna need a bowl for blooming your gelatin something to disperse your syrup so you can knead these bottles are great because they've got these tips these piping tips on them which makes it really nice for dispersing however any squeeze bottle or dropper will work measuring spoon a lips a hand blender if you don't have a hand blender a whisk and a very strong forearm and that's about everything obviously spatula and I think that's everything that we need to get started so we'll put all the ingredients together and go over the measurements so the first things that we need to do is we're going to turn our heat on to the lowest we just want to get the water hot once it's hot you can turn it off and next we are going to bloom our gelatin so you're going to need 1/2 a cup of your liquid and three tablespoons of your gelatin you want to evenly sprinkle it over the top and then you want to make sure to stir it in then stir it up so that there's no lumps and then you're going to set that aside for five minutes to let it bloom next you're going to take a quarter cup of your liquid and you're going to microwave it for a minute or minute and 20 seconds until boiling your going to add your sugar free jello to your double boiler and you're going to add that quarter cup of boiled liquid in and you're going to stir it up until your gelatin or - your jello is dissolved and while that's melting if you want to this is when you can you would add in two tablespoons of honey if you want to add some additional sweetness to it now if you don't like the taste of honey I'm gonna say don't do it because you are gonna have that bitter taste of honey pour it in it and you also want to add in a half a teaspoon of citric acid try not to get it on your spoon like I just did you actually want it in the pot and you'll just continue to stir that gently until everything is dissolved now that everything is dissolved we can add in our unflavored gelatin so what I like to do is time to split it up in the bowl like this so it's all in pieces and it it'll dissolve quicker and you're just going to stir that in until that is completely melted now this should be warm enough to melt the gelatin but if you find that it isn't melting you can put it back on the heat for a few minutes so I had to add mine back on the heat there because it wasn't melt melting it was actually starting to solidify so I'm just got that back on the heat so that it's melting now if you've got a bunch of jell-o and gelatin stuff stuck around the sides and you can't get it off but you can just use is hot hot water and a brush then you can just easily then wash it off wash it down into the pot now that everything is melted and all dissolved now we can add in our canna butter and our Garg um so just dump in your butter your can of butter actually add in 1/2 a teaspoon of Garga now if you have one of these little strainers it's great because you can use it makes it eat nice to just evenly distribute across the top if not just try and make sure you kind of sprinkle evenly across the top of it and once all that's on you're gonna let it sit for a minute and then we're gonna get our trusty little hand blender or our whisk and now we'll get our trusty hand blender and start blending [Applause] [Music] once you're fully mixed you just want to let stir it gently so we can start to work out some of those air bubbles and we're just gonna let it sit for a couple of minutes now at this point once everything's done and incorporated if you want to add in any additional flavor or color this is when you can do it so I'm just gonna add in a little bit more red to up that red a bit and I get this no taste red because I hate the test a taste of red food coloring and Wilton's makes this no taste red which is great the only problem is is it doesn't really give you the same intensity red as the regular red does but I'd rather forsake a little bit of the color for the taste because I really don't like that kind of bitter taste that red has and next I you can use ready to pour into your bottle or you can just use your eyedropper to distribute it into your molds and we're just gonna do that next and now you just distribute into the molds and the things you don't want to fill up the mold all the way you want to just leave it a little bit of the a little bit of the edge there otherwise it creates a sharp edge on your candies so and and it tends to dry out so it's not very it doesn't make it very nice so you want to keep it just below the below the top and once you fill up your molds you're gonna put it into the fridge for 20 to 40 minutes or until they're set another thing you want to try to pour right into the center of the mold and let it distribute it I know some of them you can't they have to be little feet or legs or tails but if you can otherwise the reason is again it's not it causes it won't stick to the sides and cause that edge and if you've made these before and have done it to the top you have that kind of sharp rigid edge that always dries out and it just doesn't make your candy very pleasant that's the reason all right so I'm gonna put these into the fridge to set by the feel of it it feels pretty like it's already starting to set so probably 20 minutes is all they're gonna need now if you want your candies to have a go back to the clear more clear looking what you can do is just put it on to the heat on low heat for a few minutes and the air bubbles and that will work out and it'll go back to that clear that clear look all right so they've been studying for 20 minutes they're ready to come out now so what you want to do is lay some parchment paper down on a wire rack what I like to do is I like to poke holes into my parchment paper so that way I can get air coming up through the bottom as well just hit this with driving don't have to is just something that I do and you're just gonna stand your little gummies up if you can some will stand some won't that's it you're gonna just leave them out to dry for anywhere from 24 to 48 hours there's your gummies your sugar-free gummies see there's one that we let's that I let sit on the heat for a little while let the air bubbles come out of it and that's it there you go sugarfree gummy bears cannabutter sugarfree gummy bears gotta make that clear all right let's get one of these little bad boys a try so just like a regular gummy bear or gummy candy no difference there okay all right tastes really good so it's really going to be dependent your taste be a big factor on the liquid that you use so you definitely want to use something that does have a lot of flavor or definitely your favorite juice no sugar added juice probably those nectars are good again if you're diabetic I'm not sure about that sugar contact I know there's not extra sugar added but I don't know how much regular sugar like natural sugars are in there if that's good or not but that may be an option as well if you do though use a nectar or any kind of real fruit juice I would recommend using mold inhibitor lorraine's makes a mold inhibitor that you can order online you may be able to get it in your specialty store and if you're using any type of real juice or real fruits in your gummies all right so that's about all as well I

father-in-law gave me this to try because I suffer from arthritis I have promised with my SI joints the arthritis is in my back and also my shoulder in my neck I have a bulged disc between c4 and c5 the amount of pills that they have tried me on is ridiculous I'm on currently on naproxen 500 I'm on a muscle relaxant you name it I I'm just tired of the pill so I'm gonna try this for the first time and see if this helps at all okay so get off okay so I opened it it is that's here let's see okay like chocolate actually tastes really good so I guess it takes up from 30 minutes to two hours I'll let you know I'll come back and let you know if I feel anything or do I have to take another one let's hope this works okay so um it's been like an hour and I feel something in there my legs a little bit jiggly right now but other than that the pain in my back I will say it's going away like it it's probably still there is just going away like I can't it's not a thumping feeling anymore [Music] so it's like 1 1 square which is 25 milligrams and for me it's working good like downstairs I was thinking I should shut off my phone and restart it but I guess I did and when I went to record this I didn't understand why the phone was turning on and so I just had to I just had to hit the button on the side and wait for it to start up and so that happened at home and my arms really sore from holding this but it's like nice to be pain-free and okay well this is all for now else to tell you that you feel really happy like thinks that you think it sounds like [ __ ] up in your head like you're gonna say it sentence and like I don't know did you say it so um my eyes feel real tingly and my heart I can't feel no gum it's just a little bit scary okay this time that's it only thirsty oh yeah I'm thirsty I feel like I should get into a comfy like a comfy space or a comfy place like the chair or something and don't you sit down there and then I don't know see what happens okay um so one thing I'm noticing too is my eyes are like glossy and I don't like that and there's people in the house all they're probably know something so I'm gonna wait until they come upstairs and when I hear them come upstairs go downstairs and buy it's getting dark out so they'll be see my look okay um so like you get good laughs and stuff like right now I'm trying hitting like a little paranoid I don't know what's up with that but I really think that like I should just say what you know like I'm feeling and then probably I don't know just like sit somewhere like works in darkroom or something or just come upstairs like it bad cuz the heart is like hmm and I feel I should talk like kind of quiet because seems like the thing to do um and you're really like your body seems like it's a really sensitive to everything my back ache it's it's still like I said I don't feel it at all seems like you had a long hey you come home good a squirt of that cuz you feel better from [Music] and it seems like a good thing to I get do cuz you can hide it like you know like some people say Oh going home to have a beer and if you didn't want people to know that you like drink beer you can not say it or um somebody that did this well yeah like somebody calls you oh I'm just having a piece of a chocolate bar see they wouldn't even know which seems pretty smart thing to do my fingers there but oh well because that arm hurts like that's I said some sort of things are sensitive I still haven't had gotten the drink from before some really like I'm and this and then I'll get a drink and sit there with my blanket on and oh yeah like when you walk things too early like like you're walking I'm not saying you're not just like it's not it doesn't feel normal feels like it feels like a little better like they had a key bones in your legs you probably wouldn't feel the achiness okay so it's like now I'm going for real like you know what I probably do this again good thing I only ate one no Jumanji - oh okay may need to call night when one or something cuz you probably get really scared at one point wait I'm scared but I'm like oh like you know if the cops came I would just [ __ ] hide but like if you talk to you you wouldn't you'd be so scared you would even move where you are and then they you know no way you're in there and the house okay so why can't say into next time because what if there is no next time or like Oh smoking chocolate bar number two and Oh like have episodes smoking charcoal smoking another chocolate bar now I don't remember why I say mad cuz it's totally good [Music] I was talking about Chuck burn so like this should probably be a good night adios and I can tell you the area didn't you know country I'm in so nobody knows okay so I'm gonna go now and wonder if this

making gummies 101 today I'm going to explain an easy and simple way of making homemade gummies if you dig this video please punch that like button and don't forget to subscribe for future and easy 101 cannabis videos today i'm gonna be using cannabis infused vegetable glycerin and we'll be doing this without using additional sugar however I will be using jello and that's basically pure sugar I do use my own homegrown and I will be making a separate video on how to make the glycerin so materials I'm gonna be using today are gonna be a pan a whisk a spatula some gummy molds and a syringe the ingredients I'm gonna be using is one cup of cannabis infused vegetable glycerin 12 ounces of flavored gelatin of your choice so I'm using the cause of the blue raspberry jello yeah the blue raspberry jello one cup of fruit juice of your choice I use real apple juice I really like the taste of it and it makes it can really bring out the other flavors easy it's kind of a neutral flavor I don't recommend using citrus juices pineapple juice or orange juice nope two and a half ounces of unflavored gelatin I recommend knocks it's very sturdy keeps everything together it's it's pretty hardcore as far as gelatin scum a quarter cup of honey or agave syrup I use agave I recommend natural honey it can be a little difficult to mix but you know it's a lot healthier so either way is good and one tablespoon of tart and sour or citric acid powder in this case I use citric acid powder so I've started off by separating all my ingredients by my citric acid powder my Knox and my jello I'm gonna start by combining all of my gelatin together once they're in the same bowl I can give them a proper stirring okay that's looking good next we're going to be moving on to the agave syrup and the apple juice I've already added the agave syrup to the apple juice I'm just mixing them together now once they are mixed I'm going to add them to the bowl of gelatin powder now I want to whisk this gently I have to make sure it's mixed properly so I don't have clumps of sugar stuck together and you know in the end ruining some of my gummies once it's finished put it to one side and let it bloom while this is happening I'm gonna heat up my vegetable glycerin it'll take about an hour and a half and in that time the gel will starting to thicken so right here I have one cup of cannabis infused vegetable glycerin it's been on low for about an hour and a half it does take some time to heat up and start to smoke so just be patient don't let it smoke too much though or it will burn keep it low keep an eye on it and keep stirring it circularly every now and again with my molds lined up I'm ready to pour my jello into my vegetable glycerin since my jello has been sitting there for an hour and a half it's giving it time to solidify a little bit from here I can scrape it out of the bowl directly into the pan it's good to use a spatula for this part just to ensure you're not wasting anything and you get it all over the bowl at this point I'm going to use my whisk just to give it a nice gentle stirring it's okay if you want to turn the heat up a little bit at this point just to help melt the jello as long as you keep stirring it and afterwards you turn it back down again it's too high for too long you will burn you're just doing this to melt the jello once it looks thoroughly mixed in it's a good color and consistency to you grab your syringe as you can see I have assistance but it's okay if you're by yourself and you have to stop stirring to fill up your molds as long as in between filling your syringe you just give it a little stir give it a little stir so right here I'm basically just showing how I fill them up I'll edit this speed up the process but I try not to keep the syringe too high above because then it can create bubbles and your gummies and just visually it's not very pleasing that's all [Music] my personal favorites are the snowmen the very big you know I can use one syringe or I can use four syringes for me it's nice because it's a great way to control the dosage so I'm just gonna finish up these last little few right here make sure I finished with everything in the pan and then I'm just gonna pop them in the fridge give them a chance to cool down and get them all ready now for the final process I'm gonna keep them in the fridge for 8 to 16 hours usually the longer the better so they stay solid now that a few hours begun by I'm ready to take them out these those are my bears thanks to the Knox gelatin this should pop out righties look at that hey mister bear you look pretty solid I can actually identify what you are cool beans once that's done we can bag them and tag them so here's all my gummies in total not you shabby we got our festive snowflakes good our presence went mine done ripen one of those Halloween on Christmas we got our spiders we got our bats oh yeah and up here we have our snowmen well actually two sets of snowmen the badness to Frosty's you can see how thick those are my personal favorite and then there are smaller counterparts right there alright everyone so that's it thank you very much for coming by and checking out this video I hope you liked making gummies 101 don't forget to Like and subscribe for future videos and any comments or anything as well please feel free to drop them I'd be growing happy smoking happy eating", "CYUcoFmFx-Q": "hi welcome to 'angels anything show and we're back on another great butt hole of a February day but there is one shining light on this February day and that is this video and what we're about to do that is we are making weed gummies whoa that's right we've made brownies we made cookies we made chocolates we made maple syrup which that was questionable I think that worked but we have not made the quintessential lead food which is weed gummies now I'm a little nervous for this video because when you're  around with candy there's a lot less room for error and there's you know big risks on the table here this is quite a bit of weed so we're here I have the setup of what we need but really we're going to be going back there for the majority of this video to the oven I'm assuming you have a whisk I'm assuming you have a little pot I'm assuming you have water that's it those are the things you probably already have now hopefully you also have weed and hopefully you know how to make it into cannabutter because I'm not about to go over that with you I have my fancy towel here that my sister got me for Christmas it says the food has wheat in it and in this house that's probably true you're gonna need sunflower lecithin I think that's how it said this one is like a heavy all national cold press Papa bah a link to this specific one in the description box in fact all of this info will be in the description box below because I'm not a reliable source now on to the slightly grosser ingredients gelatin this is basically like horse hooves sorry and then jello which is more horse Hope's exciting but this will give us the you know candy flavor the recipe I'm using is from this place called the canna school and then their recipe they say use a half cup of water but then in the comments people were like it actually works better or tastes better if you use a half a cup of fruit juice just has a little bit of a flavor so let me show you what I got so fruit juice is definitely not my area of expertise so first I got power eat fruit punch in this tastes like medicine so I don't want it and I'm gonna have to like throw it out this isn't nobody's gonna drink it and so then I went and I got v8 splash berry blend I just want something that's like a nice sugary drink that's not like gross you know but it's actually really hard to find let's see that's exactly what I'm going part  Dan we were at the store yesterday and I was like trying so hard to pick out a juice that was good and I'm not well-versed in juices like I said and he was like that's gonna crop sex to me gross no Michael what about this he's like what are you grandpa like it's not the tomato based ones they're her bunch okay so oh and the final thing that you need is obviously mold no you don't actually have to use gummy bears you can use whatever you want but I want to use gummy bears because if I'm traveling with this I want to go to disguise them as I get a candy this recipe makes about a hundred gummies small ones weak ones I want big strong ones so I got the cutest gummy mold it's like the medium size so this is by the modern gummy and they had a small size of medium size and then a larger size and there are like 36 of these in here or 38 so really all that's left now is to go over to the stove and mix all this together and the reason it's a little scary is because oh and I have to heat this up too but the reason it's scary is because we're cooking sugar and candy and if you I have to do whisking it as I mean as I'm squirting it into this so time is of the essence you know so let me get us all situated over there and we'll begin alright guys I have everything all set up my station is ready because once we start this process you really got to keep it moving I have to whisk this liquid for like 15 minutes non-stop as we go so I'm gonna do my best to kind of like show you guys but this might get intense I don't know and I don't know I'm trying to make this video funny but it's probably not gonna be funny because I don't want to joke around and then up my edibles that ain't gonna happen so we're gonna stick to the script today okay I'm attaching you guys to this which is actually um for the car but it works on the oven so we're getting creative here and you're gonna see a little aerial view of what's going down my dog is like you when you're gonna take me for a walk well we need to medicate first little Jimmy we need to medicate hey it's a girl Angie KB I'm gonna tell you what I'm doing step by step so first you turn this stove on to medium low add in the cannabis butter add in your soy lecithin powder and start stirring rigorously and then once that's combined you add in the fruit punch as you're choosing and then you add in the gelatin and you've got a like whisk a lot as you're doing this or else it'll get all clumpy kind of like cornstarch you know and you know just whisking away whisking away oh then you add in your jello powder you can see in the background my dog licking his dick so that's nice it's getting a little clumpy okay so then you just whisk for like 10-15 minutes and then I started filling up these molds which took a while I ended up switching to a spoon which is easier but yeah that's basically it [Music] all right guys the deed is done I don't know how I feel about the fact that I got some of this on me and you literally can play with it like special effects makeup and it's not coming off but tasty sense so mmm horse hooves that was pretty easy it did get a little tricky with the hardening but they acted online as if like oh my god it's gonna harden in like two seconds so I know I think that I did all right I lost the dropper like halfway through it just got too thick and it like clogged and it didn't work and then I just ended up using a spoon from my cabinet which made it a little messier but I think ultimately a lot faster so now these are just gonna set it says to put them in the freezer but then I saw people saying that they were better left out so I think I'm gonna do what you would do with normal jello and just put them in the fridge I don't know I'll let them set for a few hours and then I guess we'll taste test one right I guess so all right guys it's hours later and these things are set they're dumb this is how these came out they look pretty legit and then I had a little bit of excess left so I just pour it in here you know I haven't popped any of these out but let's see I'm impressed with myself these came out really good like normally I do a really bad job with this stuff but let's do the taste test so I'm just gonna eat this big one because yeah mmm mmm all right little gelatin II I mean it doesn't taste awesome cuz I can taste a lot of the coconut oil but I mean you know I'm not eating this cuz I  want candy you know I mean this cousin trying to get my rocks off so if you're trying to get your rocks off try this recipe you try one of the you saw I mean yeah boo tastes awesome cuz it's like very coconut oil II it's not bad it's just like you kind of want to get it over with is it a fail I don't think so I mean I guess we'll find out if it gets me high it's not a fail you know it's edible thank God we use that fruit punch stuff because I don't know how it tasted without back umm-hmm right no all right guys but that's it what do you think it was actually really easy hopefully very effective we'll see I'll let you know remember the recipe link will be below I'll also link where I got the soy lecithin powder stuff and follow me on Instagram if you want Angie Kb thank you for watching this episode of 'angels anything show and I'll see you next time good bye [Music] alright I'm here to report that the gummies worked thus laylee to gelatinous gummies did indeed work I am hi and also I have a pimple between my eyes which I've had for this whole video so you guys already know that anyway it was a success so definitely make them alright also Dan just up a Hello fresh alright guys more time has passed and they feel they need to tell you that I'm even more up now as you can probably tell because my eyelid is even more closed and my pimple is even more red so I'm not sure what's happening - then no okay don't do try these at home do you tres know Dan's rolling a great bodysuit [Music]", "_qLXHN_lvhA": "quick video on how to make sour candy gummies you'll need one box of jell-o three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin which is about four bags 1/4 cup of corn syrup half a cup of melted infused coconut oil 1/2 a teaspoon of gore gum 1/4 cup of kool-aid any flavor and half a teaspoon of citric acid you also need a strainer that things spatulas molds and also a fan spray get a bowl of ice-cold water you need 1 cup of sugar 1/2 a cup of corn syrup and 1/2 a cup of water and this will be for later to make the gelatin you'll just need 1/2 a cup of water you will add in the 4 packets of gelatin so the full box [Music] make sure to stir everything thoroughly and then we'll just set it to the side until we need it later now you're gonna put your quarter cup of kool-aid or you can use water in the microwave for one minute [Music] now I'm going to get my jello and my kool-aid that I got out of microwave and pour it into a double boiler you're gonna stir until the jello dissolves on medium heat once it's all melted together then you're going to add your 1/4 cup of corn syrup again you're just gonna stir until it all mixes together you're then going to add in your half a teaspoon of citric acid and then mix that together until that dissolves [Music] now once the gelatin is squishy and firm you're going to add that into the mix [Music] you want to break it up into little pieces just so that way it dissolves a bit quicker stir until everything is melted and make sure the water from the double boiler is not boiling you do not want to burn the jello once everything is melted you're gonna put your half cup of infused coconut oil you want to mix that thoroughly now you're going to get your Gore gum and a strainer if your mix looks like this it's because everything is not mixed thoroughly so you'll want to get a whisk and now help everything just mix faster and more evenly now you're going to add in the gore gum and what the gore gum does is an emulsifier that allows the coconut oil and the water to mix evenly so you want to add that onto the top and then mix it until it all dissolves once that's done you're just gonna put the heat on low and then put it to the side while we work on the candy syrup side you'll need another pot you want to get a ziplock bag and a pan spray let's pray the Pam inside the bag and this is so that way the gummies the mixture does not get stuck inside the bag you also want to get your molds ready and also put some Pam spray on that as well turn on the stove to medium heat you're then going to add your one cup of sugar half a cup of corn syrup and your half a cup of water you're gonna want to mix this thoroughly until you see that the sugar has all dissolved [Music] now once you've seen that the sugar has dissolved you're gonna turn the medium up to medium-high then you're just gonna continue stirring until it starts boiling Wow that's boiling you want to make sure you stir your jell-o gelatin side periodically so it doesn't thicken as you can see it's starting to boil and you want to make sure again that you just scrape the sides of it so the sugar does not get stuck once the candy syrup starts boiling you want to make sure it reaches a temperature of 260 degrees now that has reached 260 degrees you're gonna take your pot turn off your stove and just immerse it into the cold water until it reaches 240 degrees once it's reached 240 degrees you want to place it onto a cold surface not onto the place that we were boiling on so that way you can cool down a bit and then you're gonna add in your jello mix into the candy syrup [Music] mix everything thoroughly until it's all one color and you see no bubbles let's sit for about five to 10 minutes until cool so that way you can pour them into the mold then grab your ziploc bag cut a hole in the bottom corner also grab a bowl and this will be so it's easier for you to pour in your jello mixture pour the jello mix inside the bag and then grab a spatula to get everything out I [Music] personally like this method better just because it's easier and less messy then you know refund refilling those syringe or squeeze bottles as you can see there's a little white in my jello mix that just means that I do not mix it long enough so it can be mixed evenly so again you want to make sure it's all one color no bubbles and you don't see any white in your jello mix just so that way you can get the best results these are still gonna taste good but just so that way you know you can get the best results for these gummies mix everything thoroughly a hundred percent [Music] now that I have everything in the molds we're gonna put this in the fridge for about an hour and a half after an hour and a half you will then be placing them in the freezer for about an hour an hour and a half again now for the sugar sour mix it's one cup of sugar and half a teaspoon of citric acid pour your sugar in the bowl then if you want them a little bit more sour then put a little bit more than the half teaspoon of citric acid and then you're just gonna mix it up until you have a nice even sugar sour mix once you try out the mix if it's not sour enough just add a little bit of citric acid at a time just so that way you don't get an overpowering sour taste get some parchment paper so we can place the gummies on now you want to get one tray of the modes at a time when you take them out the freezer so that way it can be an easier faster process taking them out and then sugarcoating them you can either do one at a time or you can do multiple I do multiple just because it's faster just make sure you place them separate from each other so that way they don't stick together and then all you do is shake it up and then you have a evenly coated gummy and then you'll just want to continue this with all of your gummies [Music] these molds I actually got from Amazon I searched up weed molds and as you can see they have these nice emojis on them the other ones have these weed leaf plants on them so they look pretty cool if you want to check them out I can link them down below in the description just so that way you can find them easier and you actually get a pack of six with a little syringe as well so it's a really really great deal so my phone actually died after this part is like cut I coated them I cut them up and as you can see there's nice little squares and I actually ran out of molds and I use an ice tray so I use these heart-shaped ice trays so if you don't have any candy molds you can use some ice trays just make sure you coat them with Pam's so that way they don't get stuck and it's easier to push out [Music] so now that I'm done coding everything this is the last part the hearts this is how they look up close they look delicious and they taste delicious too now I'm just going to be placing my gummies into my bags so with the emoji ones I put six in in a bag these square ones I put seven to eight in a bag and the heart one since they're bigger I put four in a bag and this is how they look so I'm gonna continue doing them with all the other ones and I'm just gonna fast forward [Music] now that I'm all done this is how they all look like in their banks and then I just store them in the freezer until they're ready to eat so I hope you guys enjoy this video if so give it a thumbs up

attention after ingesting a THC infused edible sports media can't confirm exactly what he took how much or even if it caused his attack dry mouth rapid heart rate palpitations I think I'm feeling like I'm gonna die no you hear me fine this ER doctor says he often sees patients suffering from anxiety after taking too many edibles often what happens with people ingest one they don't feel any response they ingest another and another and then a couple of hours later it feels weird and more weird than you would expect in people's reaction as a panic attack the other problem he says is that the THC may not be equally distributed you get the side of the brownie tray that's got more of the THC and the other person gets some that's less you know it depends on the concentrations how many milligrams you want Travis Peterson prepares cannabis infused food he says it comes down to proper technique a lot of these stories we hear these brownies and that were made in people's kitchens where they don't really know what they're doing they're just putting the cannabis in there you know they're not properly emulsifying that butter into the batter of that the higher the better he says not everyone knows

these are some delta eight gummies that we just brought out um they're assorted fruit flavors right now you can get a in a thousand milligrams so 20 in a pack or if you've never tried um delta 8 and you want to try it but you don't want to buy a whole bunch this is a nice little 250 milligram sample pack you get five gummies in there um so far all of our feedback on the gummies has been pretty positive uh flavor-wise they taste almost like candy um and just to give you an idea i went here into our little company stash so you can kind of see the size of them and they're uh definitely got some sugar on them and uh they're they're really fairly tasty for a delta eight gummy you'll find a lot of them are a little bit bitter um these don't tend to be they're made from a really high grade delta 8 distillate that's infused into them if you're new to gummies be careful because edibles tend to be a little bit uh different than smoking so if you take a gummy it can take a good 30 minutes on the low side to 90 minutes on the high side until you get the full effects uh just so be aware of that so you don't overload and take too much so and the other thing with your uh delta eight products is if you're experienced with edibles from a marijuana perspective basically uh the the delta eight is like half the potency so you know if you're used to taking a 10 milligram uh thc9 gummy then you need a 20 of these and so on so you know you're used to taking 20 milligrams and you need 40 milligrams so we came up with these 50s they're they're potent they're they're strong um but you can easily just cut one in half and uh and get half the dosage all right if you have any questions um any comments um we're always here to help as well as listen to your feedback uh get in touch with us at the website and we'll talk to you soon you", "Tjqix5Vmy8s": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to the dude gross today I'm gonna be showing you what I've been doing a lot lately and that's making gummies with the magical butter machine there's pretty much two steps making the oil and then making the gummies so yeah hang out take a look to get started we need an infused oil coconut oil is whatever researched it would be the best for gummies so you basically need coconut oil cannabis soy lasts 10 or sunflower less 10 and that's all you need to get your your infused oil started there's a couple different ways to infuse your oil I went with this magical butter machine which I will link in the description and that's pretty much just set it and forget it kind of set up the diet on the first thing that we need to do is D carve our cannabis I'm going to use about an ounce of trim and D carb that going into the oven in 250 degrees for about 30 to 40 minutes what that does is actually breaks down the THC a and converts it to THC a psychoactive drug in cannabis it's an extremely important step to do if you don't do that before making your oil you're probably gonna have a much weaker soil too in future comes with the recipe for the magical butter machine is 2 cups of oil per 1 tablespoon of Weston so the sunflower lustin I had 2 tablespoons of soy Allah southern flower less attendant with 2 cups of coconut oil and then all the 1 ounce of d carb cannabis coconut oil has a melting point of 76 degrees so if it's cooler than that where your kitchen is it's gonna be hard so you basically just gotta put it over a saucepan or put it in some hot water and then it will melt right up so you can actually use the oil and the magical and that's it oils easy just take it out strain it and then you have your infused oil let's get to making the actual gummies for the recipe I'm going to show you here we're gonna use 1/2 cup of infused oil 1 6 ounce box of jell-o whatever flavor you like a half cup of water and three packs of this Knox gelatin I also put in about a half of a teaspoon or tablespoon of the sunflower less than two but it acts as a multiplier and makes it a the gummy bears a lot more firm and not oily after that would just mix together everything as the e kicks up and I like to go out a medium high heat until it gets to like a little rolling boil and once it hits that point I just continue miss mixing it and then take the heat back down to low pretty much with one or two on your dial and you are pretty much good to go after that point you don't want to pour into your molds too quickly if you do it when it's still really hot you get a lot of spillover so having it harden up just a little bit really helps out there's two ways of getting into your molds these little droppers that come with all these silicone molds I'll link that in the description as well or you can just put it into a like horror cup thing and just pour it directly into the molds - depending on how big the molds are sometimes that's an easier way [Music] once we have oliver molds filled we just put the silicone molds into the freezer for about 20 to 30 minutes might take an hour in the fridge but either way works then take them out the freezer and pop them right out some people say use some cooking spray on the silicone molds I did that once but they kind of came out oily so the first ones I used I didn't like that they were kind of coated in oil I kind of fixed that by putting them into some sugar and then into a jar just kind of sugar coated I'm shook it up and let them breathe for a little while in a few days they were okay generally I would say after that I did not use any kind of cooking spray on the molds and they still came out pretty easy so I don't think who can spray isn't nearly as important as some other people might and that's it we have gummies I like to let them breathe a little bit where because they do kind of have a bit of an oily texture to them they still are firm they're fine outside of the fridge but I like to just let them out on some wax paper in the fridge for a few days and they just kind of dry up and are a lot better texture after a couple days of curing I just put in some baggies I leave them in the fridge but you don't really have to they're good a room temperature yeah we're good to go after that pretty easy stuff you can get really creative too like don't just follow this recipe or whatever are the recipes you want I mean instead of water use orange juice in a pineapple flavored gelatin mix up your oil use the stronger the oil the better if you can use the less of it that's great you're just basically adding that cannabis infused oil into an already like a gummy recipe so the more coconut oil you add to it the worse the taste is I would say but yeah get creative with it have fun with it and yeah get weird that's it for today let me know if you have any questions or comments or anything I love talking to you guys here and what you guys do what I might be doing dumb or what you guys got that's uh it's cool that I don't even know about so yeah till the next time take care", "kyI71vYf-ok":

what's up yo back with another review today Oh edible gummies Mira Mira specifically Rob hots sour flavors I believe this is a relative new relatively new flavor for them I'm not a million percent sure even close to sure if it's on the REC side if it's not now I would imagine it will be soon so diving in the flavors we got inside here blue raspberry grape and green apple I don't know I had to look at it I actually know the flavors of jelly me anyway that's pretty much my favorite flavors enjoy ranchers and other candies so that was a super big plus for me I'm not really a huge tower fan so I'm really hoping they're not especially a sour yeah I was gonna enter a picture probably already did or I am now so we're gonna dive into what one thing to keep in mind is the brain all right we go is that the milligrams posted on the bottle or on the container are not necessarily the exact amount that are in your specific bottle your specific bottle will have a separate location where it is located exactly how many milligrams are in there I will insert a picture of it but it's I just keep smearing it you cannot see it at all anymore but I know that this bottle says 500 milligrams and it has 467 point 6 4 milligrams in it meaning each piece is not 50 milligrams but 46.7 6 milligrams per gummy it will always tell you the specific amount of THC that is in and milligrams that is in your container but it's not always exactly what's on the bottle sometimes it's more though I had another bottle of greens but I ate before I could review sometimes it's more the greens were 500 and something milligrams so each milligram or 5/10 I think or anyway doesn't matter because it was 51 milligrams per gummy i remember that specifically so sometimes you're getting more sometimes getting less if you're really a budget conscious person and you want to really maximize your bang for buck check out the different flavors and see what milligram is the highest of the actual bottle that you'll be purchasing we're gonna move on to the scent also it doesn't say whether it's a hybrid or indica or sativa so that means it's a hybrid most edibles are pretty much hybrids anyway I'm to get a edible specific video posted so keep an eye out for that because I'm gonna give like tips tricks all kinds of different information about edibles specifically that you can apply across pretty much all edibles sauer sorry I'm getting a little bit of the grape but I'm gonna be completely honest with you guys these two are the two that I'm gonna be eating and one of them is great the reason these are the two that I'm gonna be eating is because I licked the [ __ ] out of them getting the sub nail photo and specifically the purple one is the one that I started with so it got the most saliva on it so I'm not sure if that has affected the scent that I'm picking up the most in here I'm like rotating something like the blue raspberries up on top I still kind of get great more than anything else behind this hour cuz this hour is the first thing that I smelled so that's a little bit concerning for me but when I was licking them I didn't taste a lot of sour however in the photo you can see there's a lot of like more there's a lot of rocky material that's only on one side from what I can tell because the green one too it didn't have any on the bottom I'm thinking that's the sour so I would imagine that you could dust that off and they wouldn't be sour but tact tactically they are I'm gonna grab one that I haven't wet because that they're more sticky Wow they're mean Wow I'm having before but they are they're very soft and compression they're definitely gummies cuz they're a little bit sticky but let's see yeah they're a little bit sticky my fingers are a little sticky after that but I could be because I was also handling the ones that I licked so we're gonna let see my fingers do not feel sticky at all or the like least amount like to smile if anything so now we're gonna squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze it is sticky yeah it's sticky and that's one that was not licked but it's not super bad cuz now after I've done it a few times it's pretty much not sticky anymore so a little sticky but you'll be able to like dust it off and no big deal as long as you don't like continuously looking and grab it and grab it and grab it that makes it sticky alright let's ride let's ride so I'm gonna be doing actually 150 because I'm gonna try all three well I was Jenni myself so harshly I'm like oh you're not getting quick enough that I couldn't actually think about adding up the numbers so it actually may be more like 135 levi's I am going to put the sour directly on my tongue with this one and then the other way on this one and whichever way I like the most I'm gonna do for the blue raspberry because that's my favorite and the apple looks like it's not got a lot of stuff on it so [Music] okay I push the gummy off to the side to just deal with the sour but it's really not bad like you can see my face with like a little bit but when it's really sour it's my faces all kinds of you know I am definitely getting a great flavor I would say that there is a mild earthy flavor to it I mean hash has a very very attached distillate has a very mild cannabis flavor to it but I'm picking that up so it's not but I I mean any edible honestly any edible is gonna have the slightest flavoring whether it be hashey or earthy which this is a little bit both I'm getting it's interesting you know I'm getting the earthiness of the you know cannabis component but which is in distillate but I'm also at the end getting a little bit of the tang or the dryness maybe that's it of the hash flavor if you have smoked hash or gotten it on it and like licked it and stuff you kind of know what I mean you the smell like honest if you know what the smell is you kind of know what the taste is so they're green apple oh and as far as I continue to talk the flavor I'm left with is a very mild grape kind of a again there's it's not really necessarily earthy at this point it's an off great like it's great but just like a little okay solid metal that straight-up tastes like Ukraine Apple the end part I got a little bit of sour and as I was coming out of it it tasted like a sour green apple so that was really nice not quite as much earthy flavor in that one I just think maybe the green apple complements or goes with the cannabis ever slightly so more than the grape so more I'm not really tasting the green apple anymore it was strong when I was eating it but it doesn't really have a leftover flavor and blue raspberry [Music] whoo Smiley's an idol I ate a boy okay that was delicious it honestly reminds me of a blue Slurpee but I I honestly don't think I've ever tried a Slurpee ever but it's what I imagine a blue raspberry a Slurpee tastes like blue raspberry otter pop that's the closest that I can relate it to cuz it's not quite blue raspberry Jolly Rancher but it's blue rounder blue blue raspberry otter pop so it's a little duller than a Jolly Rancher but still nicely blue raspberry we're popsicle I swallowed unexpectedly during that so some sour got in my throat so it's not the best feeling and I did just eat on three so I'm imagining the flavors gonna be a little ol kooky but I kind of maybe I just want it I feel like I have a remanence of blue raspberry in my mouth but I might just be wanting it so much that its existing you know for the placebo effect so flavors oh dude I didn't get any hash from that no earthy no hash maybe because I like that flavor so much or it goes better with it I don't know but it tasted delicious so that you know as far as overall experience I appreciate that the sour is not super sour I almost think there's gonna be people who are disappointed but it's not super super sour but I thought it was a nice mild level of sour what yeah I still get the grape more than anything in that particular whip waft I wonder if it's because I was also thinking it was gonna be so much more sour that I smelled this no I smell sour but it's not as strong it has before that's so funny anyway I love Rob hot gummies I've had them pretty consistently there's definitely other companies that make really good gummies but Rob hots from what I've experienced so far seems to be the best thing for the [ __ ] and having good quality like great quality gummies however I did want to mention gelatin and glucose syrup is in here I don't know how that relates to either vegetarianism or veganism all right so the milligrams are definitely affecting me at this point I'd say I'm Spacey relaxed [Music] I'm frontier I was more minute early and now I'm more relaxed and I think when I get to doing the video editing it'll be easier to focus than trying to pull thoughts out of this brain it's more just do versus think which is wonderful my hands are so dry my knuckles oh my gosh I need to get more lotion I have to go okay I just needed a quick thing yeah yes I would recommend rabbits gummies I would say pretty much overall at this point different flavors you you're gonna like and not like so that's gonna be a personal thing but overall I think that Rob Potts does a good job with their gummies and the sours were delicious and not super sour and I really like that I hope you guys have a wonderful rest of your day",

first time you're joining my name is Liz and all-you-can regular guys welcome back thank you so much for your support I just popped that 10,000 market oh my god think you could not have done any of that without your support guys I really really appreciate it it just means the world to me you like me you really really like me sorry just being an ass having some fun alright so today what I'm gonna do now that I showed you how to do canna candy sugar & Canas syrup we can now make our gummies without using butter and the Gerber is an emulsifier however if you want to make them super super strong absolutely go ahead and stuff the butter back in there but this gives you far more control over how strong or weak that you would like to make them now you guys are always asking me how much milligrams etc something is and I don't generally tend to answer that very often because it is all dependent upon what you make how you make it once you're starting THC is etc so what I've done is in the description there I've included a link for the calculator that I use it's a free signup it's a little course you're more than welcome to have a look take a look at it listen to her she's really interesting and lots of information but the calculator you can use for free and that's what I use so then you can go ahead and you can make your calculations and figure out how strong etc that you want to make your candies and with this it gives you a lots of versatility so you can go all can of sugar and syrup or half-and-half which is what I'm gonna do in the recipe so I will stop babbling on now and I'm gonna get into the ingredients of course and of course what we need and then we'll put all that stuff together and make some awesome gummies there we go alright guys all right so for our new gelatin for our new gummy version here you're gonna use one box of your paper flavored jello I three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin a half a cup of water for blooming your gelatin or what I use are these kool-aid waters so they're just flavored water so I now use these in place of water they're great because they add more flavour to it or you can kind of combine some flavors which is really cool to do so I use those things are nice they're lighter and sugar and said just adding more flavor now another thing you can do for adding flavor is juice crystals now I get these at the bulk bar and you can only get them during the summer time but I get these in all different flavors and I've got two tablespoons of those again enhancing the flavor that way if you don't want to use or have these flavors artificial flavors you can go use those which work great the other thing you're going to need is a quarter cup of your can of syrup and a quarter cup of water for our jello and then for our candy side our candy version so it's going to be like the other one where we do the cook you're going to need a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar or again you can use a full can of sorry a full cup of your can of sugar same thing with your syrup I'm using a quarter cup of canned syrup and a quarter cup of light corn syrup again you can go and use as much or as little of either of those as you like I like to do the half-and-half mainly for taste and not to kill people so that's my kind of my you I don't want anybody rendered completely useless and then we are going to need 1/2 a cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and then as well if you want to add additional colors or flavors you can add those optionally as well and as I said if you want to add your butter as well it really makes them super duper you can do that you're just going to follow exactly the same thing except the previous steps from the previous version with regards to adding the butter and the Goregaon to emulsify it now something else I wanted to say and the same thing now in this version I'm not using the clear gel however you can use the clear gel exactly the same way as you do in the previous recipe of the regular and sour gummy recipe that's a good one to follow it's the most up-to-date and gives you both those versions that you can use and that's all we need for our ingredients and now we'll get into our equipment and then we will get the best part go and we'll get all this stuff put together alright so the equipment that you're going to need just like the other recipes a double boiler I just do a makeshift I get a bowl that will make sure that your water does not touch the bottom of your bowl you will need a smaller saucepan for our candy syrup two spatulas you will need your candy thermometer and you will need a larger pot that your bought is that your saucepan small saucepan will fit into ice water water with ice in it but a little tongue-tied today and obviously your candy molds now a lot of you ask me how many candy is gum you will get out of a batch now it's all depending obviously on the size molds that you use if you use about this large size I got these from Michaels you will get about sixty if you use of this size gummy which is kind of a little bit larger than those big ones you're going to get it probably about 75 to 100 and if you use the little teeny tiny ones then you're going to get about 150 to 200 of them so that's approximately what that recipe will break down to you for you and now d'leh before we get started there is something very important that I found out from my other recipe when I started this is and I don't do this in the other recipes but when we're working with the can of sugar and the can of syrups it is a must that we oil down the sides and the insides of our pot for the candy syrup reason being when it heats up and starts boiling the oil THC oil starts to separate and it sticks to the smiths of the metal of the pot you might have noticed that if you did that with a can of syrup which is why I redid the video for that specific reason so we're going to do things a little bit differently than we do for the regular candy recipe but I'll show you all those details once we get into it but the very first thing and don't really don't want to forget is we're going to lightly grease our saucepan and hold on just couldn't dribble a little bit of oil into it and then make sure to work it all the way around make sure to get it right into the corners because anywhere that this oil is not where there's no oil your THC will sit the only thing that dissolves THC oil is oil because it is oil soluble by doing this we're going to be able to scrape anything that sticks to the sides off much much easier then seeing all your products that they're going oh what happened so you said you want to lightly grease that you don't want to have any excess oil so make sure to do that up as well as your spatulas you want to lightly oil your spatulas for the same reason when we scrape it off the sides if these are not oiled it sticks to it and it doesn't come off so you want to make sure anything that is going to be touching the THC the syrup you want to make sure that you all and that's it I'm gonna get into putting our ingredients together and get this started oh one other thing I wanted to cover is with your moles I don't spray my moles beforehand but I have found sometimes that they do stick but so what I do is I care them so I will spray them or oil them down lightly let it sit for 20 minutes in the mold and then wash them out so it still leaves that oily feel but it's not gonna leave your Piquet knees all greasy and makes it far easier for them to come as well as you only have to cure them once every few once every five or six batches or so so it lasts a long time by doing it that way all right so now I promise we'll get into the ingredients in our candy all righty so the very first thing that we are going to do is we are going to microwave our quarter cup of liquid for about 50 seconds till it's boiling and we're going to bloom our unflavored gelatin all right so you're going to evenly sprinkle your gelatin over the top of your liquid whether you use water or the kool-aid water and then you are going to stir it in now a lot of punches I explained in about whether that your gummies did not are not that they're too sticky but they're not gelatin enough that can depend a lot of power on your gelatin I just bought a batch of gelatin because I buy a bulb that didn't it wasn't blooming at the strength of it or something was not working well I did two batches and I had almost double the gelatin so a lot of it is dependent upon your gelatin now one test that I do is when I put in the three tablespoons and mix it in it should start very quickly to get the texture of apple sausage and clicking up pretty quickly now this is not so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add in another half a tablespoon of gelatin yes I've just sprinkled on another half a tablespoon and I'm gonna stir that in and now I'm getting that texture of applesauce can you kind of see what I mean that's how you know you're probably are at the great strength for your gelatin starting off if your gelatin is not right from the beginning if it's mushy I'll show you when we go to put this in but that's the texture it should be once you once we've got it mixed in now we're gonna set that aside for five minutes or so to let that bloom now meanwhile we will add our box of jell-o I'm giving the blueberries well berry blue and we are going to add in our boiling water and stir that around and get it dissolving see was it and then just keep scraping because the jello will cause the sides of the bowl are cool it's good to just kind of stick to it so just keep scraping the sides down as you go and turn your heat on to low so again we only want to melt our gelatin over a hot water bath we don't want it hot at boiling at all that's what breaks our gelatin a lot of the time is you don't even think that you've got it too hot but really past hot water probably by 150 degrees it is that's about all you need so that's that's a big mistake that a lot of people make myself included so I'm just going to continue to stir that gently until the gelatin is dissolved and then we will add in our corn syrup and our other stuff and once your gelatin and that has started to melt the sugar takes longer because the sugar melts at a higher at a bit of a higher heat so it just takes a little bit longer but once your gelatin and that is melted you can add in your corn syrup and your flavor crystals if you're wanting to add so you saw your canister your quarter cup of Kanna syrup and then your flavored juice crystals if you want to add those in as additional flavoring and again just stir that until it all starts gets incorporated and now for you guys asking for those clear gummies how do I get my gummies clear this well you can now you could have perfectly clear gummies so I'm gonna kick it continue to stir this and just gently mix it together until everything is melted and combined I'd you notice I got my nails done so for all of you those wishing that I get them done they're done and to those of you commented there you go I know I looked at the videos and thought make and those are ratty looking hands so I do apologize hopefully it'll be better from now on in the future I hope you like these a little bit better do you got a look at them for quite a long time so why not make them a little bit more attractive and also just remember to continually scrape down the sides of your bowl so that the gelatin is not sticking to the sides and just to show you this is just how hot your water should be there shouldn't be any boiling just a little bit of steam coming off of that that's as how that's as hard as you want to get it otherwise any hotter than that it's gonna break your gelatin alright so now that everything's pretty much dissolved I'm going to add in our gelatin now here's another thing if your gelatin is after 5 minutes or so blooming is mushy when you touch it then your gelatin is not strong enough so whether it's old and it's weakened or there are different gelatin with different strengths if it is nice and firm to the touch and no mushy you're good to go so I just split this up into pieces slap her in and you're just gonna let that you're just gonna gently again stir that until it completely melts and again if you start to see any kind of foaming may take it off your heat immediately it's getting too hot so I'm just gonna let them set them going to continue to stir that until my gelatin is fully melted well once your gelatin is melted and everything looks good and it is nice and translucent just set it off to the side and now we're going to start our candy syrup alright for our candy syrup in goes our half a cup of white sugar our half a cup of Candace Canon sugar our Candace syrup quarter cup a can of syrup like I said before you're more than welcome to play around with your different measurements on that as long as it equals 1/2 a cup either way it doesn't matter and our quarter cup of light corn syrup our half a cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to gently stir that till ever - your syrup till your sugar and water and everything's just combined and then once you're combined here turn your heat on to medium Cline to start and then we're going to drop it down to medium once it begins to boil and you're just going to continue stirring this make sure to get all around the edges because the sugar likes to sit there and so we're going to continue to stir this until it starts to boil now all of my and all the other candy recipes I say as soon as we start boiling we're gonna stop stirring and use our brush not in this recipe and I'll show you once it starts boiling as I said the oils yeah I got a little syrup on the burner there so the oils start to separate out with the heat and until it gets all to the same kind of temperature it will they will stick to the side so we're going to have to continually work the sides of the pot but you're going to want to be very very gentle because we don't want to spit dirt into the syrup so as I said I'll show that all to you once it gets there now you'll start to notice as as it's starting to heat up if you scrape the sides of your pot see all that that's your oil and that's what we want to make sure it gets back into our syrup so I usually have to use the two you want as I said you have to grease both spatulas here and work it off get it back into the syrup and we're gonna have to do this continuously through the whole cooking process so at anytime that you see any darkness starting to form on the side make sure to scrape it down and as your syrup gets hotter you can just put your spatula in it'll just melt it off and also make sure when you are scraping the sides of your pot hold on to the handle firmly I've done it before I wasn't paying attention and whoops and the last thing you want is molten lava being poured anywhere other keeping it in the pot so when your syrup begins to bubble starts boiling you're gonna touch your candy thermometer and remember this is normally where I say we stop stirring not this time so we're not actually going to stir it what we're gonna do is just to continually scrape around the sides of the pot but don't go deep into the syrup we just want to stay around the bubble area and you just want to keep pulling this in so this is the alcohol of the excess alcohol and stuff burning off and any impurities that are in it so see how it's gathering up on the sides that's what we want to make sure get them back into our syrup whatever is supposed to cook off will cook off whatever is good will stay in so again just gently don't go into the stirs syrup just gently keep going around the sides and you'll do behind the candy thermometer towards the end and we are going to cook our syrup - if you want a soft candy you're gonna cook it to 260 if you want a firm candy you can go as high as 280 280 is soft crack I'm gonna go to just before that I'm going to take this to 275 but you see what I mean about the oils how they just continue they'll keep going to the sides of the pot as it heats up and gets up to temperature it will it will the oils will get incorporated and once your syrup is boiling in that you want to just turn your heat down to medium just medium a little above medium I said then don't forget to get behind in behind the thermometer because it will hide in behind there I love the smell of this syrup cooking it's oh it smells so awesome oh and just as a tip for safety always have a fan either an overhead fan I've got one going or the if you've got an overhead on your stove regardless when you're ever working with tinctures even though you've working them in a dehydrated yeah most of it's cooked off some of them may not be and you just want on the safety side always have a fan going and leave don't be sparking anything up in the in the general area so you've had your gelatin sitting over on the side and you have a look and you've noticed that there's all this white inky foam stuff and you're sure positive that you didn't do it high on high heat the heat didn't get too hot that'll happen so nice if the gelatin is old and it's starting to break down so if you do see that in order to compensate for that bloom another tablespoon of unflavored gelatin and we're going to add it into the candy mixture at the end that's gonna help us compensate for the gelatin that's broken in our mixture here so that will help it so anytime that your candies come out super sticky and you can't get them out of the mold the reason is is because the gelatin is not gelling properly so there's a really handy tip there for you guys now in order to get that out because I don't want that in to go my syrup I'm gonna run this through a strainer before we put it into our syrup so now I might actually my syrup while I was babbling away there is getting close to temperature I've got my ice water ready to go and as soon as it hits temperature I'm gonna drop the bottom into the pot and once the temperature starts coming down and the cooking process is stopped I'm gonna set it to the side until the temperature comes down to 240 before we add our gelatin in just watch your thermometer till until the temperature starts coming down and your bubbles start stop bubbling and then just set it to the side and said until your temperature comes down to 240 all right so now my syrup is cooled and then it's say because I don't want that white foamy stuff into my syrup I'm going to use a strainer to pour it through that way it'll catch all the chunks of jell-o gelatin and being bad and I'm going to mix that in now I also what I did was I bloomed another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid and we're going to add that in a little bit in a little bit so right now you're going to stir your jello and your candy syrup until it is all combined and if you find that your syrup is a little too sticky and it's solidified you can put your heat on to minimum you just want to heat the bottom to get the syrup off the bottom now you can make sure that you do so that you scrape the sides and if you said if you find that it's too hard coming off turn your heat on and it'll eventually start to melt so you just want to want to keep doing that until everything is completely melted in all the same temperature all right so now that everything is all melted together and nicely mixed now this is a test that I do to determine whether my syrup is did a job correctly if I pull it up and you see how it just goes in a nice smooth syrup it doesn't really seem to start gelling or anything it stays in a fine line so that's kind of telling me that this is gonna turn out way too sticky it's gonna come out what's it like you can't get it out of the mold it's more candy than the gelatin that's what I said about my gelatin breaking there that I knew that was gonna happen so I've added it I'm gonna add in the additional gelatin that I bloomed and I'm just gonna stir that until it's completely dissolved so now if you want your syrup just translucent that nice clear there you go you've got it you can go ahead and put it into your bottles your squirt bottles or use the little eye droppers for dispensing into your molds but however I never like to keep things plain so I'm gonna do half-and-half or I've got translucent and solid and also just to give you a look to see how to go about doing that all right so now when after adding the additional gelatin in now when I do my test you'll see it's thicker and it'll start to split up and almost solidify in midair so that's how you know it's likely going to set correctly I still had to not do things correctly that's occasionally but that is a very good indication that you're safe and good to go so if you wanted translucent go ahead and put it into your bottles at this point or use your eye dropper dispensers or whatever it is that you get it into your moles however I of course need to always get fancy so I'm gonna split this into two colors so I've got half of it translucent and half of it of the solid blue whoops all right so I'm just gonna eyeball this here if you want to be exact you can pour it into a measuring cup and split it exactly however I've been doing this from this pot for quite a while so I'm pretty good at it sometimes so because I mix the blue with the green because obviously the green from our can of syrup and our sugar so it's turned out a little bit greenish and I actually want this to be blue so I'm going to add in a little bit of blue color and then on 1/2 I'm going to add in white so this one I'm mixing in a few drops of blue you can use any kind of food coloring the gel base oil-based water base for this for this particular candy recipe does not matter so we're just gonna get that stirred in oh that's a pretty color you see it on the white that's nice that's a nice kind of teal color then in my other half I'm gonna pour in some of the blue the same kind of teal but this is gonna give me the solid background as the white now if you guys have white on hand make sure that you shake it really really well if it's hot it sitting for a while it does separate and you will find that if you pour it in you're gonna get a little tiny white it doesn't go well you get little white lumps or something like that it just doesn't blend really nicely so make sure to shake it really really well you can almost hear it come back together it's like you can almost hear the water at the top and then all kind of comes together and sounds a little bit thicker so I'm gonna pour a little bit of that in isn't that pretty so again you're just gonna thoroughly mix that in until it is one complete uniform color and once I've got that i'll get it into my bottles and we'll get this into the mold there's a little trick i learned the other day find it by Occident that's on most things happen so I'm if you want to have a half and half candy where you've got the clear on the bottom and the solid on the top what you can do to easily make that happen is use your hand blender on this we whip a bunch of air into it and once you put them together the air is all I'm automatically gonna bring the solid color up to the top or if you want to do that with the if you want it the other way around then air Rach you're clear but you're gonna have to wait a while for the bubbles to come out because that's gonna make it not so clear so I recommend just putting the solid on the back you can do that it's just a quick way of doing it otherwise you have to pour one layer let it set a little bit and then pour your second layer well aren't I just a cesspool of useless information today I'm just gonna pour this into my squirt bottle this should make a full almost a full bottle or a little bit more see bang almost right on now if you guys have to haven't seen these before these are the best squirt bottles ever they just make putting it into the mould so much easier especially if you want to blend colors absolutely highly recommend these I've got there's a link for them in the description there for you to make it easy if you'd like to order them and I'm just gonna do my clear and we'll get this going all right so I said I always do two colors I always like doing that so I did combination I'll either just whoosh or if you want to happen half you can do it that way you can go this way freestyle whatever you like and that's it get them all into your mold and you're gonna put them in the fridge for a minimum of two to four hours sometimes they've got to go overnight now if you let them go overnight and they're still sticking you can't get them out of the mold put them into the freezer for a few hours let them freeze up take one mold out of it I'd add out at a time and pop them out as quickly as possible if they still if there's still stop the first you'll come out if it starts to stick throw it back in the freezer work on another mold put them into a double boiler melt them down on low heat and add another tablespoon of gelatin melt it and recast them and that will fix that problem for you and that's it enough I'll come back low will pop these out so you can have a look at them and I'll show you how to sugarcoat them not that sugarcoating is that difficult but you can coat them with the can of sugar and just show you an easy way of doing it and that'll be it will say goodbye candies upset and you can do this in a bowl or I found that doing them in a large plastic bag worked a lot easier so in this I put a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar and I put a quarter part about a quarter cup of the flavored drink crystals that I used in my recipe again the drink crystals are totally optional for you just adds that little bit extra flavor and then I added about a half a teaspoon of citric acid because I wanted these to be a little bit more on this our side if you just want to have just a little bit of a tick bite but not really sour at all I add a quarter teaspoon so I'll do those two my sweet ones and then to the sour I use a 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid I don't recommend using much more than that one it's not going to the sour flavor isn't that great and it can also melt your candies because citric acid acid is water soluble so simple enough you can actually see it oh and I also have sorry a wire a wire rack with parts line o parchment paper line line on top of it for them to dry so I just pop them out these guys are popping out nicely and I get and what I do is I do one mold at a time so I leave the rest of them in the fridge because otherwise they start to warm up and they can makes it difficult sometimes for them to come out of the mall so I just think about one at a time and once I get them on the bag I go a little bit there and I just fish them out and shake off the excess sugar and we just lay them out to dry here just like all our other candies this is just a slightly smaller mold that I use same thing now see sometimes you'll do that and you'll see you think oh no they're not gonna come out they're stuck just pull the edges away and then they just they'll just come right out now if you do that and it doesn't come out that's when you would put them into the freezer so again you see that just around the edges to pull it away and they're good to go and that's about it I'm just gonna go through and sugarcoat the rest of these guys and then I'll be back to say goodbye well guys that's my little demo there on your cannon Candace Eric and sugar gummy bears I hope you enjoyed the demo as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to ask and thank you guys so much again for your support and let's get to the 50,000 whoo all right so you have an awesome rest of your day and thanks again for watching [Music]", "LMD5aAC9wAk": "hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is liz if this is the first time you're joining you're a regular subscriber welcome back thank you so much i really do appreciate your support i really do mean that i love you guys so today i'm going to show you how to do the sour version of a gummy uh gummy candy so this has got includes the gelatin and a cooked syrup candy syrup you combine them and we then apply the sugar sweet and sour sugar right afterwards so we don't have to wait for it uh to dry uh or to figure out when we need to add it we add it right afterwards and um all right so i'll just get right started we'll get into the ingredients the equipment that you're gonna need and then how to put everything together all right well thank you so much for joining and i hope you enjoy the video okay so this recipe is done in two stages well technically three because we cook in two different stages and then we combine everything so for the first gelatin for the jello half you're going to need three tablespoons or three envelopes of unflavored gelatin one box of your favorite jello flavor a quarter cup of light corn syrup a half a teaspoon of citric acid a half teaspoon of gour gum and a quarter of a cup to a third of a cup of your can of butter and for the liquid you're going to need um a quarter cup that we're going to heat up to boiling and then a half cup that we're going to be using to bloom our gelatin and you can use any liquids that you like i like to use these um kool-aid or the kool-aid jammers these ones are good because they're a water-based and they're clear so you don't have to contend with color and they're also half the sugar so again you're not going to it helps cut back on the sugar since we got a whole ton of it in it that totally up to you though you want to definitely stick to a clear type liquid those powerades if you like those type of things those vitamin waters if you like them i don't like them they do not add the greatest of taste but if you do add juices like with it have real fruit juice in it then you're going to want to use a mold inhibitor because mold will develop very quickly and if you want to add additional colors or flavors uh we can do that i'm going to be adding 2d fruity and so i'm going to kind of make it pink and purpley i don't know tutti frutti colors and if you want to have a nice solid uh background you're going to need white food coloring so that's for the gelatin part the jello side gelatin side for the cooked candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar a half a cup of light corn syrup and a half a cup of water so for the equipment that you're going to need you're going to need a double boiler so you can use any pot and metal bowl i like to try and use a thicker thicker metal so that it doesn't get too hot you're going to want something to disperse your candy i love using these bottles they work great and they've got the piping tip which makes it really nice or you can use an eyedropper now this recipe is a little bit thicker so i'm not sure how well an eyedropper is going to work with it you're also going to need an oops timber you're also going to need a smaller pot for your sugar syrup and a candy thermometer two spatulas you're also going to need a hand blender and if you're going to be splitting your syrup either by doing different colors or flavors you're going to need a measuring cup to split that out if you're just doing all one you don't need that or in in lieu of a hand blender you can use whisk in a very strong forearm so the first thing that we want to do is we are going to bloom our gelatin and we are going to heat up that other quarter cup um you may need a little bit more liquid if you do you can just add it in later on if needed so we're going to heat this up in the microwave for about a minute and 20 seconds and we're going to sprinkle three tablespoons of gelatin unflavored gelatin onto our half a cup of liquid you want to kind of evenly spread it and then you're going to mix it in so that it is thoroughly mixed and that there are no lumps so you want it to kind of look like light up you want to look like applesauce and then you're going to just set that aside for five minutes and we're gonna add our boiling liquid to our jello mix and you're gonna stir that oh and you're gonna start you're gonna put your heat on to the lowest setting we just want our water to get hot we don't want it boiling gelatin melts at just hot water so we just want a hot water bath and we're going to stir that in and we're going to add in our corn syrup that's our quarter cup of corn syrup and we're just going to stir oh sorry and we're going to add in our half teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to stir that i said until it's dissolved it takes about five five six minutes or so for all of that to melt and in order to get this stuck gelatin off the side you can use some very hot water and a brush and it'll just you can wash that off otherwise if you don't it won't it doesn't melt and then it you'll get bits and stuff in your jello then you also want to make sure when you're stirring is to rub your spatula across the bottom because the sugar and the gelatin can stick to it and you don't want that so you want to make sure you'll feel it you can feel it smooth on the bottom if there's stuff stuck you'll feel it kind of rough you just kind of want to work it off scrape it off then once your gelatin or sorry your jello is fully melted we're gonna add in the gelatin and what i do is i just kind of cut it up into smaller pieces just like this and just in she goes and you're just gonna gently stir that until it's melted and if your water is hot now if the um your pots nice and hot you can turn off the heat you don't gelatin required doesn't require much heat at all to melt and if it gets too hot the gelatin will break which means it's not going to have that it's not going to your candies aren't going to set that well and the sign that you'll know that it's too hot is if you start to see white foaming stuff white foamy stuff happening on the top of your mixture here on your syrup now that everything is melted we are going to add in the can of butter and our gour gum and the reason that we have to use gour gum is it is an emulsifier and it is going to allow your oil and your your water to come together as one as one liquid versus being oil and water you know don't mix together an emulsifier allows them to come together as one solid solidified unit in short it basically mushes the oil and the water together to live happily we're going to pour in the our can of butter and i've used a third of a cup so as you can see adding you're adding the can of butter or oil to our gelatin you can mix and mix and mix until the cows come home no matter what those two are never going to blend together now you might get the appearance if you kind of whisk really really quickly you have the appearance that it's combined right that kind of looks like that's all combined however if you go and you set that and if you want to set that up now all of the butter would raise to the top of the mold now if you've got one of these little strainers or a strainer it's great for doing the guru so we're going to use a half a teaspoon of gargum and you're going to gently sprinkle evenly sprinkle it over the top if you don't have a strainer you just want to make sure to try and get it evenly over the top there this will adhere to the oil and allow it to mix in with our with the jello and i'm going to let that sit for a minute and now we're going to get our trusty hand blender [Music] and you'll continue to mix that until it is completely all one color all one unified color you don't see any kind of streaking or any kind of any difference whatsoever that's when you know it it is fully blended and emulsified and you're gonna be how about that texture and once that's done we're just going to let that set to set aside and leave it on the hot water but turn off the heat and then we're going to do our candy syrup all right so for our candy syrup we're going so for the candy syrup you want one cup of sugar a half a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water you're gonna mix that together until it is blend till it's all mixed up and your sugar starting to dissolve and we're going to turn the heat on to medium-high and you're going to stir the syrup until it begins to boil so as soon as it starts to boil then you are going to stop stirring that's when we add the candy thermometer and we don't stir it again and then you're also going to want to grab a jar of hot water about whatever something of hot water and a brush so you can wash down the sugar crystals off of the side and that'll prevent your syrup from crystallizing once it begins to boil there we're going to add our candy thermometer i'm going to try to add the candy thermometer now if you ever wonder why i kind of have this weird looking thing the one that i have said it setting on it that thermometer doesn't always work for me it occasionally will fail um this i like the digital but the digital um doesn't have any way of holding on to it it's more meant for just kind of sticking it into checking a temperature and then i have to use the tin foil to protect the digital from the heat so that's why i kind of have this weird makeshift candy thermometer and we're going to cook this syrup to 208 280 degrees soft crack now you can go a little bit if you want your candies a little less chewy you can go a few degrees less you can go to about 275. if you want them a lot chewier then you can go to 300. i seem to find the 280 is perfect for it well for what my liking anyway so we're going to continue to cook that syrup until 280 degrees just remember to wash down any crystal any sugar crystals that may form on the sides just to let you know you're doing this at the medium high it will go fairly quickly so don't leave the kitchen normally you do the sugars at a lower temperature so you have a little bit of time this doing it at the higher temperature it will go very quickly so i'm traveling you don't leave your kitchen and then you also want to get a pot of just cold water or a bowl of cold cold water stand by uh we're gonna put the bottom of the pot in that to stop the syrup the cooking process so we're at 276 270 see how quickly it starts to go 278 279 280 leave the candy thermometer on because we want to bring this temperature down to 240. you can turn your heat off leave it in the water until the temperature starts coming down and then we're just going to set it on the side here until that temperature comes down to 240. so once your temperature comes down you can remove the candy thermometer and we're going to add in ow be careful the syrup is still very very hot you're going to get your gelatin mixture and you're going to have a look and you're going to make sure that you don't see any green or anybody butter separation now you might see a little bit of cut like see how that color there difference that suggests your jello that the air is coming out of so don't worry about that what you care is if you see any kind of green or oily looking so that's good we're going to pour this into this candy syrup and be very careful when you're stirring this now your gelatin is going to be a lot more liquidier than the liquid liquid ear i know i come up with my own words uh then the candy syrup is going to be thicker it's also going to start to solidify as you can see on the spoon that's why you're going to gently stir it and we're going to turn the heat on to bury it to the lowest temperature and you want to make sure to take your spatula and go all the way around the edges the syrup will has a tendency to stick along those edges see so i like to use the hand blender whoops to make sure that everything is fully uh mixed together and blended and emulsified [Music] and then you're just going to gently stir to make sure that it's all nicely mixed so now at this point is when we're going to add in our flavor and additional colors if you like or as i said if you want if you're not doing that you can just go ahead and put this into your bottles right now and get ready to distribute into the molds so i'm going to be adding one of my newest favorite flavors tutti frutti love this flavor i usually use about a cup and a half and again you just want to gently get that all mixed in now if you are going to be splitting uh if you want to do two different colors this is this point you're going to put it to the transferred over to your measuring cup and split it in half or if you wanted to do two different flavors then do that before split it in half add your different flavors but i'm just doing one flavor base two colors okay so i have got now whenever you look at a um a measuring cup always look at it straight on get down at the level and look at it straight on if you look at it from a down level you see you don't get an accurate reading that looks like two and a quarter cups however it's more like two and a third cups so for this one i'm going to do i'm gonna add some more red and i like to use the no taste red i hate the taste of red dye i can always taste it and everything so i like the no taste red the one thing about it however is it doesn't have quite the intensity of red that the regular does but i'd rather forsake a little bit of the intensity on the color versus the intensity on the flavor there we go that's a nice red and the other side i'm going to do purple i'm going to add in some pink i want a more pinky purple versus a dark purple and a couple drops of blue now mix that up see what we get now right now because we did i didn't add the white into it and it looks like it's a solid color it's actually it'll come out kind of still a little bit translucent so if you want to get a solid background and that it's not going to lighten up or get that kind of clear or translucent look you want that solid opaque then you need to add in the white so i'm going to add a couple drops into white on both sides so we have here when we add in the white it's going to dull down our color a little bit so that i'm just going to add in a little bit more of the red and add a little bit more to the purple purple i think i'm gonna leave i like that color but the red i wanna looks kind of orangey and see how much nicer that color is now it's a lot richer and gives you more that solid background makes it opaque versus having that translucent look to it and now i'm just going to get ready to pour it in the bottles and distribute it into the molds all right so now we're ready to distribute into the molds and you can go do half and halves now don't fill up your mold all the way to the top if you do it ends up leaving a sharp edge on your candy that dries out and it doesn't make your candies very pleasant so don't fill them all the way up to the top and it's also when you're trying to pour try and keep it to the middle and just let it distribute it out once you have your mold set up while all filled up you put it into the fridge for uh two hours sometimes it may take a little bit longer basically two hours or until they're set all right so it's been a couple of hours and our candies are ready to come out of the molds and we're gonna make up our sugar sour mix so you're going to add one cup of sugar and to that you're going to add a half a teaspoon of citric acid cut it and you want to make sure to thoroughly mix that in so you're going to get even citric acid on everything not just get like a big hunk of it on one candy that's kind of gross so you want to make sure to thoroughly mix it in now the nice thing with this recipe is as soon as we take them out of the molds we're going to put them right into the sugar this sugar mix you don't have to worry about waiting for them to dry or partially dry before we can add it and the reason for that is citric acid is water soluble so when you do the other gummy recipe when you just take them out they're still wet and gummy bears are essentially water and gelatin so as soon as there's any moisture on them the citric acid will begin will automatically begin to melt it doesn't do it on this because you have the sugar coating or the sugar candy syrup in there that helps protect the gelatin and that's why they don't melt as soon as you put it on and that's why this recipe is way better for doing sour or sugar coated candies now these guys are going to be a lot stickier than your regular gummy recipe so you just kind of pull it and they'll start to peel out and then you just work them out and then just pop them right into your sugar sour mix and as they warm up a bit uh they will start to get a little more tacky so no worries as long as you can pull them out of the molds they're good and they do stick to your fingers they do just kind of put it down into the sugar you can just kind of rub it in and it'll get them off that's nice once the your sugar or your sugar sour mix is on they no longer stick together see look at that and then you just put them on the rack to dry as per usual now what i like to do is i like to put holes in my parchment paper so that way you're getting air from both sides it helps with drying the other nice thing with this recipe is it doesn't take anywhere near as long for these to dry as the regular gummy recipes they're pretty much dry in a few hours to overnight now if they do start to get a little too warm and too hard to get out of the mold just put them back in the fridge for a little while if you actually keep a little bit of sugar on your fingers once they get a little bit sticky it'll help with them not sticking to your fingers a little aid with them coming off see if they stick they will fuse just pull them apart now if you're taking these out and they're just not coming out they're way too sticky um they're too gooey you can put them back in the fridge for a couple of hours or um and if you take them out and they're still not going to come out what you can do is uh put them in the freezer for about an hour take them out put them back in the double boiler on low re-melt them and add a half a tablespoon to one tablespoon of bloomed unflavored gelatin and that should add enough a little more gelatin there that'll fix that right up and if you find that they are too gummy oh sorry not if they're too gummy if they're too chewy they're like rubber bands again same thing just put them back on the double boiler on low remelt them and add a couple of tablespoons of um liquid to it and mix it all in until it's all melted recast them and that should take care of that problem if you've taken them out and there's um your butter is all risen to the back same thing just put them into the double boiler re-melt them add a little bit more gargum and re-emulsify make sure to use the hand blender or your whisk really really well like i showed you earlier so again if they're stuck like that uh check first to see just gently work around if they come away then you're good you can pull it out of the mold but if they're doing that they're not coming it's not coming away at all then they need to either go into the longer go into the fridge longer or to add some more gelatin to them they are a little bit more work but they are definitely worth it in texture and flavor in everything i've pretty much abandoned the other gummy bear recipe personally i just use this recipe now i'll just do either sugar coated or the sweet or the sugar and sour mix option is if um they are being really sticky um they are kind of coming out they're set but they're just really sticky um that can happen because it gets it picks up a little bit too much moisture in the refrigerator you can just let them sit in the molds for a couple of hours on the counter before taking them out that'll assist in drying that out a little bit now if you can stand your candies up it's a good idea some of them won't stand up though too small to whatever decides so if you can stand them up great if not you just want to flip them over every couple of hours until they're dry and as i said before this recipe and the drying time is it's a lot less time and that's it for them so just leave them out and enjoy some awesome sweet and sour gummy candies so that's my tutorial on sweet and sour gummy candies these are the little bad boys they haven't dried yet but you can see they're really nice they're little that little squishy now because they're still wet tastes awesome so i hope you give this recipe a try whether you want to do just sugar coated or the sugar sour it's a great recipe i'm sure that you'll love it if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to put them in the comments i'll always get back to you and i think that's everything i've got for you today well thank you so much for joining time diamond delight edibles wish i could get that straight um thank you for joining diamond delight edibles it's been a pleasure have a wonderful day [Music] you", "z-Psy_1_vkk": "[Music] [Music] foreign [Music] what's up guys we got rj eats once again you know saying what's up um but uh if you couldn't tell from the title it is another delta 8 thc video this time we have some gummies and i also have a cartridge so we're going to be using both in here and he's never tried delta 8 before so if you don't know what delta 8 is what we usually smoke is delta 9 thc so this is a new thing that they have it's delta 8 which is another cannabinoid that people have been you know it's been picking up a lot of steam now you know kind of like when cbd came out you know people are just like well you can get this legally anywhere in the united states it's just like cbd but i won't provide any links anywhere like on the uh description because i've been deleted over cbd before so just trying to be careful but it is 300 milligrams of gummies uh our thc eight in this in these gummies and we're gonna go half on it and we're gonna see how it hits and then we're gonna be hidden on some of this gorilla glue hybrid which is ninety percent delta eight thc with 10 terps i do like to mention is that i did try the other disposable one and delta 8 does not taste like delta 9 in any way it tastes a little bit different um but mostly i just tasted the terpenes but there is a bitterness towards the end like toward like a medicine taste but you know that delta a delta yeah it just came out didn't just come out but it's been around but people haven't really been talking about it as it is now can you um just hold these for a thumbnail or something oh over here so i could i don't have to see your knee all right now open the gummies so like i said ladies and gentlemen oh yeah they even have nutritional facts on this [ __ ] i'm like damn brother you know qr code as well and you know no no you know yeah so open it and that's uh let's see what pour some in your hand actually for uh for like a thumbnail and just a few and then put the the thing so i could read the the thing you know all right yeah okay got it yeah all right so back on this camera we are gonna eat uh so there's 10 gummies each i think um so you already have two in your hand no don't drop the sugar what is this [ __ ] thc eight okay so he has five they actually have uh nine in here uh i would say maybe yeah because i i've already tried this my tolerance is a bit higher so you still have 1200 i mean you want to split on this one no that's knocking this is perfect okay all right i need to be able to function later still you guys well we don't uh so i've been told that thc 8 or delta 8 thc is a bit more mild not as intense and psychoactive as cannabis but then again we're eating it and eating thc is different than smoking or vaping so different feeling so yeah cheers it's got some chew on it that's not saying not bad this is good candy okay candy wise that's pretty far there's a car just like hello you know what i did i did think that maybe they would have had more flavors just because the the packaging was all rainbow two players or so yeah these two i wonder if there's thc in the circle sugar crystals oh it smells like a berry yeah whoa i think i ate one you just look all the salt or so what we're going to do guys because i know our tolerance or edibles don't seem to hit till like 20 20 minutes or so later not not too long i mean it doesn't hit too quick we're going to be hitting on this and then we're going to stop the video and then we're going to um i guess turn that back the camera on and tell us or tell you how we feel you know i'm saying if we do even feel anything resume the video as soon as this is done but yeah it came with the same package this came with the same uh oh yeah same person oh okay all right open up handcrafted boys [Music] there is a bit like a slight bit minimal bitterness towards the end with that candy but un barely noticeable i didn't really notice it too much that's why i said barely he said too much and barely noticed it too much see all right maybe you do i guess i'm just kidding all right um yeah we're ripping this way go ahead we're going in wow oh by the way we're outside randy's house so don't trip we're just oh [ __ ] very thin pinkish heel looking oil this would look like if it's vape oil yeah i see maple like this all right so uh i did mention in my first delta eight video that interesting uh i did mention that when i first heard of pink oil i was like what the [ __ ] but you know apparently it's uh delta eight when it's uh it shows or it's delta a that makes it pink or sometimes so i don't know i'm not a scientist in any way so they're not are they all different you think pretty sure right what do you mean like as far as the color i don't know i think they're the same throughout the day so we're going to be using the shiv you guys know the shiv right off the bat i this is it seems like a pretty nice cartridge itself probably going to lower it to let's do a 2.6 and as usual we're gonna let now he said in case it's poison i'll do it first i guess that's right so that way i get poison next that makes total sense you should let me go down see that i get poison and then you'll be like oh okay i'm not going to hit it now all right or it doesn't even hit oh yeah delta eight sorry buddy you want to try again check atomizer damn thing's pretty smart it tells you like what possibly could be wrong with it yeah that's pretty cool all right so apparently this is not compatible with this um i don't have another battery in here but i'll probably do an individual video on this but we still did take the thc so uh we're going to wait and see what's going on um do you have a battery i think i do unless you can get do you have a battery in here let me go check that's all i was thinking or now i think i do have one it just might not be good [ __ ] it it's probably better one that doesn't work right that's true i'll be right back throw this away we'll be back see he's we're really outside his house put this inside i'm feeling the delta oh the friendly farm that don't work yeah i think yeah i think it's that one that's gonna work all right let's see you guys it's just auto hit oh it's dead [ __ ] i have a charge in my car maybe we can [Applause] oh you got in the mail yeah my brother orders it i think you can't hit it like that i think i tried it before hey what's up oh [ __ ] that was your brother oh no it's all good so it has like a weird blinker time you have to like keep hitting it until like it actually turns on let me see try it it's probably because it's like oh yeah it's still blinking red still because it's gonna look kind of dead actually we're gonna get some time to charge guys yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] all right boys we back um he ended up being able to sneak a hit off this so let's just get another hit off of it um it's probably been about 10-15 minutes since we did take the the thc eight gummies so uh give it a few more minutes and we'll see but i planned on you know hitting this cartridge and uh hopefully boosting uh the [ __ ] feeling of the thca heat but yeah [Music] and so this is gorilla glue thc uh okay so it doesn't taste like medicine though don't taste bad you'll feel it and when you feel it just don't stop hitting it until it blinks but uh the similar bitterness towards the end but not bad like not much pretty much like a sprite like a lemon when you're trying it honestly it tastes like [ __ ] those medicine gummies that you eat the vitamin the vitamin ones yeah it tastes like that the flintstones don't taste bad yeah you know they're they're bearable at the end of the day this is people consider you know you know uh marijuana medicine you know what i'm saying so what's to say if it tastes like medicine a little bit you know it might be more willing to try it maybe the taste of delta 8 thc is that medicine taste because i've never tasted this coming from a distillate and you're gonna be like like thc nice little taste of like lemony yeah yeah like uh like a sprite like a sprite yeah that's a good one very similar to the other jack carrera one i do like to mention that uh gorilla glue is a sativa hybrid and jeff herrera is also a sativa so that's probably why they have similar terpenes or at least like a piney lemony you know so does this hit the same like amount of thc as the other one or delta nine or something i don't even know there's different deltas you could have like delta one through nine and [ __ ] now so uh i've heard from people i don't know if this is true or not i've read it i've seen people tell me that you know uh people use delta eight to lower their tolerance on delta nine because the tolerance of delta eight does not uh is not the tolerance with delta nine but i've heard that it isn't i've heard that uh delta eight is more of a like a more mild high it's not really too much as thc you know thc or delta nine thc [ __ ] getting confused but yeah um i'm a little confused on that too but i can see like so delta a is just basically it's a new cannabinoid that's not new but it's barely getting studied right now and it's barely picking up steam just like cbd did like two years ago um people are like a lot of uh street carts or fake cartridges that are uh probably pink or this pinkish hue it's probably delta eight you know since it's legal you can buy it and then probably street dealers are probably putting it in their cartridges i don't know um but me using this one is not bad you know i believe it's 25 for a gram out the door and for people that are in illegal states that don't have access to you know uh legal cannabis products you know this is a better uh not better alternative this is an alternative wait so they uh you can buy this legally and like in the clubs right now oh i have actually seen delta a products in authentic oh sure okay yeah but you can buy this online on websites there's a lot of companies three chai shout out to naruto i believe there's another one i forgot another one he mentioned but you know uh i'm in a place where i'm fortunate enough to have companies uh message me i don't really message too many companies anymore but uh when they do message me and then they uh i check out their website and it's cool seems legit you know i will consider it you know what i'm saying yeah it doesn't taste bad at all it doesn't it's funny it does taste like sprite hey [ __ ] a lot of people like sprite you know what i'm saying dude sprite's like one of the only few sodas that i want yeah because it doesn't dye your teeth sprites [ __ ] the [ __ ] sprite so after taking a few hits off this and the gummies do you feel some some type of i feel that change i feel mellow yeah i was honestly gonna say that too like i'm not like like i'm not stupid faded you know like you would get from dabs and stuff and like real delta and 98c but i feel like just like in the first video i felt something it was definitely different than a normal high yeah like i don't feel like um i feel relaxed i feel relaxed mellowed out i don't feel like let's say if i was to like smoke a dab i'd take too much of a big dab sometimes i get paranoid i don't feel like i'm gonna get paranoid or not my mind and everything is like i'm relaxed i feel it this is refreshing because it is like a sprite you know what i'm saying and uh like off that first do a blinker do a finger and see what's up but lightweight low key i kind of feel like the edibles are starting to hit but then again it could just be you know i'm feeling this but i'm feeling because when you obviously like i mentioned earlier when you eat something it's much different than smoking or when you're eating cannabis it's much different than smoking it we're vaping it but i definitely feel it in my eyes oh yeah look at you see my new merch got the the wax right here oh [ __ ] evolution you took that photo yeah no i got it off a website that's royalty free picks so you know what i'm saying once you put it on there anyone could use it unsplash.com i think it's dead again i think we got enough hits out of it i would say uh but like i said man i am definitely feeling something different than a normal high that you would get off delta nine thc ugh oh i did just eat habit and maybe you know smoking after you're eating you don't feel it i don't [ __ ] know i'm trying to [ __ ] say something uh how are you feeling and i definitely feel high though no joke just just not like a normal high it's not a weird battery yeah it's not the best battery but it happens we made it happen yeah my eyes it matters so you know your opinion i give it i'll give it a go give it a good grade you know like i would i don't know like if i didn't i mean i didn't know about it now that i know about it and i see it around oh yeah yeah i might be like more interested on this channel too no i will say that now that i know about it from like you exposing it to me i might like if i go to the street i mean to the clubs and see it i might be more interested in buying it now because now i had an experience with it and i know it was good so i might be more interested and when i see it in the store to go and pick it up so i do say it was good yeah i like it are you would you say you're pretty i would say i'm pretty highly look at me you gotta talk and prove it oh yeah no for reals i usually usually stump i usually be stuttering looking [ __ ] like a number you're hitting pretty good and i'm proud of that y'all know me i'll be stuttering yeah so uh like i said uh earlier there's a lot of delta eight thc like companies out there so please just do your research uh this one's pretty good and i i would vouch for some other ones based on naruto's opinion because he's tried them uh but yeah just do your research and you know uh they this website that they have actually tells you like you know delta thc uh delta athc 101 has blogs articles on there so if you want to check that out and learn more on this website specifically i believe uh i'll post it in the comments post go and check it out yeah but uh let us know what you think in the comment section oh yeah and by the way subscribe to the homie you know i'm saying kind of ended with that but hopefully you did enjoy the video you got anything else to say to the lovely people of the internet i just want to say i hope you guys enjoy the video as well and we'll see you guys on the next one man hey peace out [Music] oh", "7_b5GPjPQiM": "[Music] hello hello hello everyone and welcome to another wonderful splendid review here on wheats i'm surrounded by hungry agitated dogs that are pissed off that i haven't fed them yet but you know i gotta get to my own eats before they get to theirs this one seems to be pretty calm but there are other ones around here who are not so happy with me um anyways uh what did i say yes we're we're talking eats today here on wheats at the back half of our name um nothing too substantial with our eats we are talking uh wild gummies now the thing is uh when i picked this up the sticker uh happens to be over the label of the product that shows the brand and i'm terrified if i take off this sticker i'm gonna ruin it so we're just gonna do it live here together so we can reveal this oh i've already [ __ ] it up um look in the corner or no this corner there's what the logo for wild will look like there it is look at it it's a great logo wild gummies man they're wild they're so wild they have a y instead of an eye why i don't know that was great um so what are we talking we're talking they're wild i have no idea what a marian berry is m-a-r-i-o-n berry they have it as one word but i'm gonna eat it uh this is their cannabis infused and marion berry gummies with the customary 100 milligrams of thc a pretty cool little packaging here probably a [ __ ] though to actually store with this trapezoidal top but it looks pretty neat um paper it's got some cool design on it some i guess those are marion berries they look like blackberries to me um but you know all the good stuff is on here we've got lab tested results right there on the side with our 100 milligrams of thc when it was manufactured when it's best buy all the stuff you want and on the bottom your nutritional information uh this is uh 20 servings but only 10 gummies as serving as half a gummy who's really gonna eat just a half maybe you are if so good for you uh and looks like five calories per serving so a hundred calories or so in this marion berry uh setup um so let's go ahead and open it and destroy this wonderful packaging oh no it's origami-esque look there's just like a little fold there you unfold that then you unfold this then you unfold that then you curse the [ __ ] put the sticker on there then you rip the sticker then you continue to unfold and like a beautiful japanese lotus flower in the spring of something that blooms only once uh every generation here it is it's another little plastic thing inside of it uh with your child proofing stuff um squeeze both sides there and a little bit more extra information again hey look it's got 100 milligrams be careful a little seal here let's crack that open uh what i do really like to see is the top of this container uh is made by cooljars.com jars with a z so uh guys go out there this is a free plug for cooljars.com c-o-l-c-o-o-l-j-a-r-z.com cooljars.com they make stuff that'll get you [ __ ] up or they'll make stuff that'll you can put things in that will get you [ __ ] up cooljars.com okay so uh pretty standard pinchy open thing there and here are our marionberry gummies how premium are these very purple um very oh i do see it's kind of scored in the center uh to indicate what the half serving is i don't know why they didn't just bother to chop it directly into but you know that's fine with me i'm not going to complain and why am i not going to complain well because i'm going to end up eating all 10 of these i'll eat the two or three here on camera then i'll have the next few five or six or seven over a couple of hours or so and then after i have my last one uh about 90 minutes to two hours after that or so i'll come back to you guys and say wild gummies this this [ __ ] is dog or wild gummies uh these are pretty tame man i i already have such great headlines and i haven't even tried these yet so uh without any further blabbering let's give it a shot oh wow yeah i definitely taste the marionberry they got the um that really distinct marion berry flavor just right just like grandma's orchards i used to just gorge on marion berries as a kid i would pick baskets and baskets and baskets of them marionberry pies marionberry other things like jams i guess marionberry uh weed edibles um god damn it my producer just let me know that a marionberry is a type of blackberry a cultivar how cool is that thank you producer and of course i knew that about marion berries because i picked them with my grandmother is that what i said it's a child basket to them marionberry pies it's a cultivar how did you not know that but i gotta say um actually if these are indicative of what a marion berry tastes like not bad dog these are pretty good gummies um in terms of taste these are real high on the list actually um nice sweet a kind of um more neutral berry like a black berry not super tart or super sweet uh but delicious uh great gummy uh and very very little weed taste uh almost none at the beginning and even uh not too bad there at the end these are great well wow your marionberry flavoring uh while it might not be accurate it is delicious uh so they've got that going for them uh i think i had three was that right i've got another seven of these to go over the next however long or so uh and then once i finish them off i'll come back to you guys a little bit after that and let you know what what were my um reviews oh the first one was terrible these gummies are wild that's just repeating the name that's why i said to be ironically terrible but the other one is great are these wild gummies uh un chained until i don't know or are they these wild gummies tame i shut up shut up see you guys in a bit bye [Music] shut up i didn't accidentally fall asleep for a couple of hours you did and welcome back tweets guys it has been oh more like four hours since i last checked in with you um in our journey of the wild gummies and boy guys these wild gummies are really feral i use the thesaurus uh also fey that's another synonym they're also really good i like these a whole shrek of a lot um i would even say a whole shrek 2 of a lot because that's the best shrek i think there's i've only seen the first in the second one really like to see puss in boots one day not really but you know i thought i'd say that i i i thought i'd be the first person to ever say boy i can't wait to see puss in boots one day i i want to be the first person to ever utter that sentence um uh so speaking of being the sentences never uttered before uh marion berry gummies are a real thing um yeah i still don't know what a marion berry is other than whatever my producer said something about blackberry and then there was some fancy word that followed these taste great and they are very strong let's just get down to brass tacks here guys um i still can't show you the logo because i'm still this the sticker situation is still rather perilous but look again oh jesus christ there's a logo wild just like this dog um and uh they're good they taste good they have good flavors they have good the strength is very popeye-esque um yeah i full-hearted and throated both my heart and throat are full of endorsement for wild marionberry gummies what a deal at i believe 15 bucks uh this is seriously seriously though uh uh a top tier gummy edible love it uh speaking of things i love let's do a little cherry on top oh this one kind of actually looks like something you'd place on top of something so we'll we'll do that a little cherry on top there but on top of the dog um and what are we gonna talk about well this cherry on top let's do a little video game uh let's do a co-op game something that you can play online with your buddies while everybody is stuck indoors uh well maybe maybe you're not who knows what you're doing right now in the middle of this pandemic uh be safe whatever you're doing but also play killer queen uh available on the switch pc who knows maybe the consoles probably it's a great game local multiplayer online multiplayer however you choose to play it it is an eight player multiplayer experience two teams of four and it is a very simple simple 2d game each team is comprised of three workers and one queen uh and then each team has three possible paths to victory uh best three out of five um games rounds wins the game and then the paths to victory are boy i'm explaining this too much um i'm not even gonna explain the path to victory why would i i'm gonna do a poor job of it i'm very high even though i've not been asleep for a little while um but it's great look it up you've got youtube you're on youtube right now don't be lazy just look up like a killer queen review you can you can actually just stop watching this right now search killer queen and that would be fine with me and now that i've already told you to stop watching me maybe i should say goodbye guys it's been really nice again we've been talking about wild berry no marionberry [ __ ] marionberry gummies from wild and also our little cherry on top was killer queen available on pretty much everything check it out especially if you like multiplayer games and with that that's gonna do it for everything shut up dog go back to sleep nobody wants go go back just like no don't don't good night guys", "MS90wDWpCj0": "[Music] the main difference is like when you smoke flower you get high from your lungs that's you generally the way it works when you smoke versus inedible when you consume an edible your liver digests it breaks it up and it ends up traveling throughout your entire body so it usually ends up being a completely different high some people don't like it because of the wait time which is normal say it's on my neighborhood of 45 hour and 15 depending on your tolerance the other thing I do like about edibles and medicated drinks is the fact that because your liver is digesting it it also means that in the event that there's some impurities in the flower itself that it was used for that particular product your livers designed to process that out versus if you're smoking a flower or substance that did contain some contain some impurities our lungs are not designed to filter out that type of stuff probably the unknown of what's coming down the pipeline for 2018 rat goes online what the differences are going to be in terms of that we do know what the doses are going to be California standards are going to be 10 milligram doses up to 100 milligrams which i think is good what we're more looking forward to though is the fact that there gonna be some regulatory compliance metrics based upon not so much the potency of the flower but in terms of like the quality of the flower to remove all the most of the impurities as possible and I like have some type of set metrics and again some regulatory measures in terms of what will be allowed in that particular flower that's what we are most looking forward to and I do think that it is something that we do need overall in general [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the most critical aspects going to be knowledge right so without consumer knowledge I could sit here on a podium and talk about the benefits of THC CBD so on and so forth but unless we get that public awareness out to the masses not much is gonna change it's still just gonna be a small niche and I think that's the challenge all of us in this phase is to get better product knowledge better awareness out there to John Q public the biggest stereotype is still the same we're all stoners were all you know up to no good we're not fit to work or be employed that's the mindset that we kind of want to get away from it's quite a different landscape now than it was even a year ago you have a lot of financier coming into the space you have a lot of finance guys coming into the space Wall Street big farm big tobacco so on and so forth so the landscape is rapidly changing I think it's a good thing this right here in the display case is our gummy lion we refer to back in the warehouse as our candy this year is a sativa and indica and hybrid they're all hundred milligram doses basically the same things if you walk into any dispensary and you wanted to buy flour you got your choices in sativa indica and hybrid up top we have just our CBD pure CBD gummy in the back we have our TKO just as the name suggests it is technical knockout over on the Left we have the recover recover is very popular with athletes very popular with MMA fighters very popular with even people that just go to the gym really what gets us going in the morning are the emails that we get the correspondence that we received that say your product how a family member a significant other kick an opiate addiction we have people that have epileptic seizures that have turned to cannabis products not just ours cannabis products in general in order to combat the amount of medication that they would have to take for their ailments we've got people to have sleeping disorders that will take our products to system instead of having to take sleeping pills so those are the kind of things that do get us go", "icuI3WpxQxk": "hi I'm Cass and this is honey and we're here with Matt Natalie and beautiful green sea to retreat into phyno and we are about to do the coolest thing we are making on our gummies so not Natalie they're the experts and they are going to show us so what's step one oh well first of all you want to get yourself some cannabis so this is purple blue so have a look at that and maybe you can pick a decent size and I'll go to that that we can chip apart a little bit maybe they're all done man that number to which you could have a look at a little darker so you both can go ahead and pick some cannabis out of that bag just how much can we pick maybe something close to 2 3 grams whatever feels right you can either choose a big mug or even just a few small notes we're gonna switch this down I'm not to a compressed pop okay so that's gonna be one of the first steps once we've picked out the cannabis so we are making these gummies from rosin so it's a solvent list product so it's a great canvas extract you don't need to use like any weird chemicals or solvents or anything like that so it's a super exciting way to D carb and income means a hundred percent it sounds like yeah pretty much all using is sweet and a bit of pressure to squeeze out the trichomes off of those buds so we're gonna have an extraction process to remove what we want off of the buds and you can play around with the different heats and pressures so the idea is to maybe find the ultimate way to get a great yield of different strains might be different pressures different temperatures so there's a bit of a science to it and a bit of a logging process to see if you can dial this in and get as much out of it as possible what are you doing here so we are going to pre press the flower so basically you're gonna weigh out how much cannabis you're using and we are friends at rose and unity have created this amazing database program it's online so you go to rosin unity our OS I am you and I - I gotta come and you can love all your information so you're going to want to weigh your flour and then you can track it so there's gonna be a little spa there it says how much weight and I'm gonna say 2.5 grams of cannabis and now we're going to put it into this crazy little 3d printer puck press that resin you'll be babe that's good and you're just gonna press it that's the muscle in this room right now I'm gonna let him and we status it is there a way that you could do this that you couldn't press it that hard is there like a machine that you could buy that we're doing are well in some in some presses you put them in a little baggy a little screen it'll lose through but in this case it's just parchment paper so you do need the puck in a sense to make this approach go down mm-hmm so there's a company called Kanna clamp and that's who we're gonna press our Roselyn today which reminds me we should fire them up yeah and they the Kanna clamps come with a little press a little box press so it's like that but instead of a circular puck it is a rectangle and so if you buy a set it kind of clips you will get one of those presses with it right in a sense but the kind of line look at that no there we are we've got ourselves a bit fragile actually you're a nice step president as impressed as possible so now we're gonna weigh that puck again just to double-check so at 2.3 to you or a 2.5 we're also gonna wear our parchment paper before we get anywhere further with this process so on the data base it's going to say paperweight in so this is just your paper parchment paper as it is culinary parchment from paper chef is the best rosin parchment paper to use paper chef's you should probably just make Brussels paper we're gonna basically fold it twice and make a little pocket this is mechanically they're made in the States so it's basically a hair straightener on steroids yeah amazing it's really easy to use one button to turn it on side button turns it up so you can try two different temperatures again you get to log them on your AWS and unity to see what temperature you squish that and see what your yield is like the one thing about the can of clamps it's important is first of all they get hot so do send them down on a silicon mat to protect your comb and the second thing is that you want to make sure you line up your bud in the middle of the clamp so you want to make sure that you're squishing the whole bud and the whole pot in otherwise you'll miss some of the squish so preferably the puck is centered so none of it is gonna okay those guys venture sure cos okay now I don't have much pressure on this yet but we're gonna want to start a timer as soon as I do apply some heavy pressure and from there we'll just see what happens all right I'm not quite there yet once I'm feeling I would say there's some pressure there now and you're at 225 so there we go let's do this so I'm gonna clamp this in as aggressively as I can't we're gonna get this nice and tight the handle is plastic so I'm not gonna go crazy and we're just gonna wait this is pretty accessible though like this isn't totally large of an appliance to have yeah and as the heat compresses this puck I'm able to actually squish down even further so over the minute now we're just over a minute I've actually squeezed it in even further what is the last thing we let it go to two minutes all of this information so the big thing is people are excited about what they've switched with turning this unit you're done is the main safety feature because these are hot so that is the one disclaimer to be careful is turning this off between squishes okay so this is your rosin here it is all this liquid here so you always get like a little clam better pop and don't throw these away because these are still good you can like melt these in with butter you make popcorn topping so they can't recycle then tomorrow can you maybe tilt that towards the camera so they can see what we got out of that now how its strong would you say that is well we'll find out we're gonna win see actually what kind of return on the switch we got we'll see exactly how much we have here and from there we can get a better idea how much rosin we have all right so everybody can huddle in and have a close look at this because any basic dab tool we'll just go ahead and clean all this stuff it'll all stick together so once you've got a clump going you can just literally almost like vacuuming the parchment it all just comes together and actually that may be why you're right it's really yeah it really is this was actually a nice consistency array of squish and just like that we've squished that bud and we've collected all the rosin so that was a an extraction just like that Wow yes it really is and this will be what we D carb activate and use for our edibles so we're gonna take the rose and look at addy carbon in the oven at 275 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes so we have preheated the oven to 275 and you're just gonna put it in a mason jar and cause a lid on it that's going to be carbon because Robin you don't get enough heat from squishing it to be carpet so you're just gonna get a little bit more for your cannabis if you and your awesome if you put it in the oven first so what does D carbon mean then her so deep carbonate is basically activating the cannabis so that once you put it into an ethylene it and your stomach acids will break it down so if you didn't decarbonise aim effect at all that's right yeah okay there we go two minutes all right blue represent movies well the stuff comes the long way to get old lady should now remaking rosin as well and rosin you know what your yield is so on that purple blue we've got a 13 percent yield no not bad 20 percent yield is like pretty fantastic they're not all beggars look at that yeah cool so that will make the bulk of our edibles all right from 30 minutes 30 minutes start your timer so you know so you want to use a quarter cup of water with your bus with yellow whatever flavor you desire no super classy weird jello gummies Angelica mystic so we only had a third cup measuring so you want to stir it yeah red her Brides putting a half gram of rosin if we had a larger ER with more rosin it would swirl more efficiently no we're scraping there yeah we got it nice a second in goes the jelly into the bowl to later go into the molds all right everyone get to see ours Easter Island bolt can't fire grotto like that show to the campfire Stern had to give him something and probably see him on the weekend at the event let me get out of your way Oh gonna put him in that fridge Emily and this guy says the fridge for 20 minutes so look at them how long were these in the fridge for these goes-- were like 22 minutes in the fridge we're just testing out this ice cube tray and it's silicone we did line it with an oil I would recommend using like a coconut oil we use pen a lot well because that's when we had access to it just helps it slide out [Applause] yeah Roz I love these I caught these perfect they make these in like 40 minutes a lot like mr. Z Z is making a cheesecake and so we use half gram of rosin so it's 250 milligrams and we broke it up over 500 their food was I don't know 15 milligrams per piece 40 so I would like start slow you know well it depends where you'll feel like this day don't give that to your grandma you taught us that such a clear easy awesome way and now I have these delicious affordable when I make gifts thank you thank you and huge other two rows in unity for hooking us up they showed us Ryan at rosa unity you go follow them at Rose music on Instagram they're killing it they go to super cool Rosen database and he showed us how to make these two days ago and now we're spreading the love and you guys I see it and we have been looking for and specific resin edibles and now we can make them thank you so much Matt and Ali and you have an amazing story and you're gonna hear about it on our show regular Canadians enjoying weed so with Cass and honey now check them out this time thanks green sea to retreat for having us here gasps gunfire we're hooking up today yeah it's been a [ __ ] wicked day all your eggs edibles this day has been absolutely perfect and kind of interesting so this is just

thank you guys bye", "1iIENII-lVo": "everyone is talking about CBD and THC which are two important chemicals found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system so click here to watch it and let us know what you think as we continue to evolve this new idea", "i-JX7qnWkR0": "[Music] kitty up so the ingredients that we're going to need for our gummies are pretty much the same as the original you're gonna want two packages of the um jello this is the three ounce the small box or 85 grams whatever flavor you'd like two tablespoons or two packages of unflavored gelatin so two packages of those nox unflavored gelatin a half a cup of water room temperature and a half a cup of water ice cold you have to have ice cold water to bloom gelatin we're going to want a quarter cup of light corn syrup for those of you who don't like like do not like corn syrup you can use invert sugar glucose honey or a gob you just need a syrup in there and what it does is it creates a barrier between your sugar crystals so that they don't come back together that's why it's needed some type of syrup we are going to need a quarter cup of can of butter a quarter teaspoon of citric acid a half a teaspoon of gour gum and gorgum is an emulsifier which allows us to bring oil and water together because as everybody knows they are mortal enemies so in order for them to be able to become friends you use an emulsifier and what an emulsifier will do is it takes each molecule a water molecule and an oil they go in together in a bubble and it creates a bubble around uh those two molecules so it creates its own um kind of uh it creates an emulsion that's what it does and that's what emulsion is bringing oil and water together to be a uniform liquid you cannot use xanthan gum it is not an emulsifier it is a thickener and it is a stabilizer it is not an emulsifier gum is an emulsifier a stabilizer and a thickener as well as it has a natural gummy uh texture to it which helps with your gummies and for those of you who don't use it or can't get it uh you can use soy it would be one teaspoon of soy or sunflower lecithin the other reason why i like the gourd gum is it has no flavor whereas lecithin does and i don't like the flavor less of them in substitute of water if you want to add a little bit more flavor boost you can use these kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters or basically any juice that doesn't contain real fruit if you do use a juice that has real fruit you have to use a mold inhibitor like this little the lorraine's mold inhibitor and that is a must otherwise they will go moldy in a couple of weeks then this is optional this and alcohol or um everclear the 94 alcohol or grain alcohol a really cool trick alert with this uh which you'll have to wait till the end to see it um but yeah this is an option um or if you make tincture you can use your tincture provided it is made with the high percentage alcohol it has to be the 94 ish around there for flavorings you can use the lorraine flavor oils i'm today i'm going to be making uh lemon raspberry so i'm going to start with a lemon base split it up split out half raspberry and make the other half of them and make them look all pretty gel food coloring now if you want to create a solid background white food coloring a thing with this you can only use one or two drops if you use too much your gummies will not set no matter what you can freeze them you doesn't matter what you do they will not set if you use too much very important one or two drops only and i think i've got all the ingredients here covered let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made all right so the equipment that we are going to need is basically the same as the old recipe there is one major difference we are going to throw away the immersion stick or the hand blender that apparently is a very bad thing for our gelatin so on top of creating a mountain of air bubbles so that your gummies don't turn out nice and clear it also breaks the gelatin so for any of you have this white goopy stuff on the top of your candies the silicone spatula or silicone whisk is going to resolve that issue so we're not going to use the hand blender silicone only metal will damage uh the gelatin who knew it was such a delicate little flower so silicone spatula very important silicone or a wooden spoon a little strainer or a bigger one if you've got one doesn't have a small one a small um saucepan heavy bottom is preferable and on heat transfer which means when you look at the bottom of your pot there is no discoloring um it's always one even if it is discolored in spots it means that your pot gets hotter in those particular areas and it can damage your uh your product so heavy bottom not heat transfer is the best thing to go for you of course your gummy molds these bottles are one of the best for dispersing your um dispensing your syrup into the into the molds they're by a sweet sugar bell and two reasons i like is because it uses the decorating tips which makes it nice as well as they have a very deep um lip to them whatever you call this a lip screw thing if you use the dollar store ones or ones that um have the really short short neck on them and then uh you're more likely it's the lids gonna pop off because the syrup is warm there's not a lot well the pressure on it it just pops them off so fair warning either that or um one of these candy funnels uh works great as well or the little odd dropper things that those some of those molds come with you're going to need some parchment paper and a drying rack i think i have most of the equipment covered you know me i always forget something um so let's jump right into those ingredients and let's get this made so on to making our candies so the very first thing we want to do is to bloom our gelatin so i've got my two tablespoons of gelatin here and you want to um sprinkle it onto your ice cold water and as i said for gelatin to bloom correctly water has to be i size very very very cold so we just want to sprinkle it across the top so this way it doesn't clump and then you're going to stir it into the water make sure it's well mixed in and that there's no lumps now one tip for you when you're doing this with your unflavored gelatin while you're mixing it it should start to um form into the texture of um of applesauce if it doesn't then you need to add a little bit more gelatin either your gelatin is not as strong or used a little too much water over whatever it is it's probably not going to be um quite enough so like this is just a little too soupy so i'm going to add in just a sprinkle there we go so that's more the texture that you want see like applesauce and then i usually toss mine into the fridge until i need it so i've added my um two boxes of jello to my pot already and then in goes our light corn syrup or whatever syrup you choose to use and yes you can use can of syrup and our other half a cup of water now this is one thing i learned the citric acid does not go in until the end so you never had your citric acid while you're preparing once everything's done and heated that's when you add in your citric acid the acid works like acid it melts things so it interferes with the cooking or the setting process if you add it in too early same thing if you use the cooked version make sure to only add it once you're done so once you've got your water and your corn syrup and your jello in the pot you just want to get her mixed and turn your heat onto low so we don't need to use a double board a double boiler as long as you keep it on lower minimum you're good if you start to see any white streaking take it off the heat immediately so you're just going to continue to stir this until the sugar and everything is dissolved okay so i've been stirring on low heat here for about 10 minutes we're pretty much done so you look at the bottom there and you can see it's it's nice and clear and when you stream it it looks clear so now that portion is done we are going to get our unflavored gelatin now that our jello and our corn syrup and that is done we are now turned off our heat this is when we're going to add in our citric acid uh so a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and again citric acid is what prevents your sugar from crystallizing right essentially it's an acid and it continues to melt things there is such a science and chemistry with sugar and water and acids and stuff it's like wow mind blowing so quarter teaspoon of citric acid in there give her a little gentle stir so next goes in our unflavored gelatin what i like to do is to cut it up into little squares makes it easier to melt and so we're just going to let them sit there for just a minute or so and then you just want to gently stir until your until the unflavored gelatin is all completely melted then once your gelatin is all melted and everything is a uniform color and texture that's how you know everything is melted and night skins come together everybody's being friends in the pot now we're going to add our can of butter and our gourgum so in goes our butter half a teaspoon of our gum and i use the strainer um so that it'll evenly distribute it over the uh butter um otherwise it can clump up and as well you want to make sure to sprinkle it onto the butter part and not the candy syrup because again if it hits the syrup part it'll clump the oil or the butter will make it melt it's a pretty wild uh ingredient i have to admit we're just gonna get that evenly sprinkled over our butter and we're gonna let that sit for one minute all right after it's been sitting there for about a minute we're going to start to whisk this now you don't want to go crazy whisking because as i said too hard breaks our gelatin it is going to break it a little bit but we don't want to go too gentle because we actually have to create be able to break that oil down small enough so that it can create an emulsion so it's finding that happy medium so i just kind of get it started here so we're trying to whisk with minimal air bubbles and then we have a look and take a look at the top and see if you see any kind of oil slick if you do continue to whisk it a little bit longer and then check it again if you still see some oil um coming up to the top you see some oil slicks happening we can add in a little bit more gour gum but this time you're not going to add it directly into the pot just get your bowl that your butter was in there's enough oil in there to deal with it and we're just gonna take a little bit like about an eighth of a teaspoon and you stir it into the oil into the butter it dissolves the gore gum as otherwise as i said if you just dump that in now it'll just lump up once it's dissolved into there just add it in like soup and whisk it again again have a look so here i've got some air bubbles we have a little bit of other gelatin broken a little bit but nowhere near like when we use the um the uh pan blender much nicer so now that we have this as our base here now is when we can add our flavors and our color so this said i wanted to do lemon raspberry so i'm going to split this off to half about right so for this side i'm going to add just a little bit more lemon and to this side i'm going to add in our raspberry it's probably a little too much raspberry and we're going to add in our colors so i'm going to keep the yellow which one do i want to keep clear i think i'll keep the yellow clear and i'm going to make the red solid so as i said if you've got the white um food coloring you have to shake it up really really well if it sits on the sits in your cover it has a tendency to separate so you really want to mix it well otherwise it leaves little white dots so that might be a little too much it's always let's do a couple drops a little heavy handed and i'm going to whisk this one together oh these red food coloring that's a pretty color now because i'm pretty sure i've added too much white like i said i only got to add in one or two drops because i kind of went a little heavy-handed likely this red isn't going to set but what i'm going to do is i'm going to quick test it i'm going to put a little bit into a i'm just going to put a little bit into a into a dish i'm going to throw this into the fridge for a couple of minutes to see if it sets up if it doesn't i'm going to add some additional gelatin to that side all right so my little test here it it's setting up that was just a couple minutes in the fridge we're setting no problem now if you'd done that and it was still sticky sticking to your finger then you would want to add about a half a tablespoon of additional unflavored bloom gelatin so you would bloom a half a tablespoon to three tablespoons of cold cold water and add it to that to the solid side but we're good and i went ahead and i added my yellow to my yellow side here and now what i'm going to just do is i'm going to let them sit for just a couple of minutes and allow the air bubbles to come up to the top and that white icky stiff stuff to come and we can pull that out before we pour it into our bottles so our syrup now has been sit and set for a little bit and it's cooled off and you can see kind of that layer on top here take your strainer and just very gently scoop that out so this is the kind of the air bubble a little bit of the broken gelatin but we can get a lot of that out before we put it in the bottle and then with your strainer and you just want to hold it over the bottle and pour your syrup into the bottle dead on on that one not bad and now we're ready to cast our candies so a tip for you put your molds into your freezer before you start that way they're nice and cold and your gelatin your syrup will start to solidify right away especially if you're doing two colors that way they won't all bleed together another tip for you before you pour turn your bottles upside down put your fingers over the tips and just tap them what this will do is bring all the air bubbles to the top or to the bottom of the bottles so again helps make it much nicer candy okay then and then just fill up your molds now one thing important with your molds is don't fill them all the way to the top you want to go just just below it go all the way to the top it creates a ridge that gets icky it gets hard these are guys you're gonna look so cool yellow on yellow is tough it's hard to see it especially when it's clear so this recipe will make about um about a hundred or so of this size mold that i'm using probably about 300 of the teeny tiny and probably about 60 50 60 of the larger size all right so my gummies have set get your cooling rack your drying wrap parchment paper design your rock [Applause] and just pop out your gummies now if you can stand them up if they'll stand up better but if not just lay them down and then after about 12 hours flip them and let them fully dry out i usually flip them a couple times a day i walk by and do my flip and these guys will take about 24 to 48 hours to fully dry out and you want to make sure that you have a dry place humidity will not help your candies dry out at all drying and humid do not work together so if you do have a human place um if you can get a dehumidifier that will greatly help you out so i'm just going to finish uncasting these little guys and i'm going to go into the next step and show you the little trick with the alcohol and what that does and then how to successfully uh sugar sour coats your candies so be sure to stay tuned so this is the size of the candies when you take them out of the mold and that's the size of the candies once they dry so they shrink there a little bit there all right so here's a trick that i learned a tip that i learned and um it's gonna make your lives a whole lot easier especially for those of you guys who ship and we're having troubles with your candy sticking together what you're going to do is you're going to take your everclear or your um everclear or alcohol depending on where you're from anywhere you're 94 or up percentage alcohol put it into a small spray bottle remember the equipment that i always forget to tell you small spray bottle was one of them so put your alcohol into a small spray bottle so we want to give our candies a bit of a generous spray here and then just mix them up let the alcohol get into all candy all over and again if you can do this with tincture if you've got your tincture provided you did it with the uh the high grade alcohol and once you do that just put them out rip them up and let the alcohol evaporate it takes about 20 minutes or so and that's it it creates um kind of creates a bit of a barrier it keeps your candies um chewier for a longer period of time so i've had these guys out for about four days and see they're still perfectly squishy and gummy and not dried out looking or anything and that's what the alcohol helps to do and it also prevents them from sticking together all right so the next part is how to successfully sugar coat your gummies all right so this is the really other cool thing that i learned how to successfully coat our candies so for the most part you take them out you coated them they melt it it gets ugly we're not happy because that's because we're doing it wrong well the reason is and citric acid as i said is an acid if there is any moisture it is going to cause it to uh to melt so that's what's happening is you take your candies out of the fridge it's warmer outside of your fridge you know room temperature it automatically creates moisture from cold to warm or if you just automatically put your candies in or there's any moisture it the strict acid will melt so in order to successfully coat them so they don't what you want to do is once your candies have fully dried after a couple of days and if you do the step with the alcohol coating and they're done take your candies take a drying rack and just spread them out onto the drying rack then you're going to get your pot of boiling water here and we're going to just hold the rack over the steam just move it around so our candy's getting cut getting steamed up here and we don't burn our hands so what we're doing here is we're creating them we're giving them a little bit of a heat steam melt to create a bit of tackiness and then our candies stick and they don't melt so once they feel kind of gooey a little bit gooey there it doesn't take very long just dump them into your sugar your sugar mix now for the most part you do about a cup of sugar to a quarter teaspoon or so of the citric acid and then taste that these guys didn't get steamed and give that a taste and see how you like it then just add a little bit at a time until you get the desired sourness that you would like or you can just sugar coat them you don't have to do the sour so once they're done you put them in the bowl mix them all up get your wrap parchment paper i don't have enough room ah i so need a bigger table then just shake off your excess and if there's any ones that didn't get coated just hold them over the steam and that's it onto the rack they're pretty much ready to go they take about 20 minutes to dry fully dry out and that's it you will have your sugar coating that will not melt and there you have them nicely coated sugar sour coated uh gummies that aren't going to melt on you all right guys so that's everything i have for you today i hope you enjoyed that video even though it was a do-over but good so is you did get to learn a couple of new things and that should greatly improve your candies all right so and once again thank you so much for joining me today and i hope you have an awesome rest of your day bye", "mPp_w0V0hOk": "welcome to 420 RX cannabis cooking and confectionaries here's Jamie Keil let's review it's in your micro dosing at home with edibles gummy KITT the first item we have here is our dry ingredients now there's going to be a clear seal around the top we're going to want to find the perforation and break that and go ahead and remove that seal and set back to the side next in we have our corn syrup once again we have a seal going around the ring of the top go ahead and pull the serrated portion off and remove that circular seal setting again to the side you'll see two packets of unflavored gelatin and one gel cap [Music] and now we'll unwrap our mold and our dropper our dropper will have a bulb at the top that needs to be pulled back so that the plastic tip of the dropper is fully exposed if it comes apart no worries you can always put it right back together the remaining items in the video will come from your kitchen a small plastic cereal bowl nothing special you'll also need a spoon any spoon will do I like to use just a plastic spoon that I can toss I'm gonna place 1/4 cup of cool water into my plastic bowl moving on to opening my unflavored gelatin packets I'm going to sprinkle those over the water while I stir it with my spoon I'm gonna go at a relative decent speed not super slow this is done in real time you don't need to go slower than this you just want to make sure that everything touches the water and that you don't have any large clumps it may look like baby food applesauce or mashed potatoes [Music] once you feel the unflavored gelatin is mixed in well we'll set that bowl to the side to allow the gelatin to bloom and soften you will need a 2 quart saucepan I'm going to pour 1/2 cup of cool water into my saucepan I've not turned my heat on yet at this time you will also want to have a tool whether it be a whisk or a silicone spatula to work with I will be adding my corn syrup to my 1/2 cup of cool water that is in the 2 quart saucepan I'll gently mix that with the water to dissolve it part way [Music] I'll then take my gel cap and use a small pair of scissors to snip the end and squeeze the contents into my saucepan [Music] on to our dry ingredients if you've not removed the top go ahead and do so and pour all ingredients into the saucepan I'll gently mix mine in and turn my heat on medium [Music] I'll bring this pot up to a slow boil over medium heat stirring occasionally [Music] once you reach a fast simmer slow boil you're going to take your heat down to low and allow that to simmer for approximately five minutes once again stirring on occasion you will see some foam on the top of your mixture as the water simmers out I'm now going to add my distillate concentrate I have a 1 gram syringe at 85% my heat is still on low I'm going to stir this in until I feel it is incorporated well and then turn my heat off I like to use my spatula to separate my gelatin from the bowl and kind of like a puck and I use the spatula to lower that gelatin puck gently into my candy syrup as it is quite warm I'll gently stir the gelatin and this can take up to two minutes to fully dissolve you can use the edges of your pot for heat if you need to push a clump of gelatin up against the edge to get it to dissolve I am going to increase the video speed on this portion but I will not cut the video this will be from the time I've put the puck in until it is dissolved [Music] I'll now transfer my gelatin mix into my measuring cup [Music] using my dropper I will swirl my liquid around and begin filling the cavities in my mold each cavity holds two milliliters so you are going to fill that to the top you'll get about two and a half cavities from each dropper full it is important that you take your time here you don't want to squirt a lot of your gelatin mixture across the counter you will have time to fill your mold before your gelatin cools once I have all cavities full I'm going to allow my gelatin to set at room temperature for two hours once I have confirmed they are set I'm going to put the entire mold into the freezer for 30 minutes before I pop them out Wow would you look at that color ooh squishy - once my gummies are fully set I will remove them and place them on parchment paper for 24 hours to cure it is purely preference as to whether you sugar or don't sugar if you are planning to sugar coat one in sugar and leave set for one hour to ensure that they are cured enough to sugar without sweating if your sugar gummy does sweat after an hour leave them for an additional 12 to 24 hours and give it another go I'll be sugaring about half of my batch once I do have the sugared gummies done I'll leave them for 24 to 36 hours to crystallize [Music] congratulations sugared or unsure GERD you've just made a microdose edible batch enjoy be sure to subscribe to this

get on the plane and you just fly right high into the sky this time i ate the gummies went into the airport met guy ritchie and stayed them for the first time and then was very quickly told we had a three hour maybe four hour delay and i had to break the news to them mommy ate some gummies you being mommy yeah so you told them mommy ate some gummies and then you tripped out didn't you i mean you

let me let me go ahead and show you guys real quick so right here we got thousand milligram mixed fruit gummies by a company that I've obviously been working with if you guys haven't seen them already they are called standard I'm gonna go ahead and put all their info down in the description below so you guys can go ahead and check them out and I think I don't know listen man I don't know if I should I don't think I'm gonna consume all three boxes because I do want to do a table prank on one of my friends or what I'm like you know and just do have them take because I got hooked up with these right here and these are not edible so what I'm thinking about doing is doing a prank on someone with one of these boxes but today I'm thinking about maybe taking two what do you guys think man I'm thinking we should do too good I'm gonna show you guys when you guys get this got a box if you everyday man I'm not really too sure I haven't actually opened them so I'm gonna go ahead and check out what flavors I got from myself right so there is ten pieces in here as you can see on the box right there and I'm guessing so you got an orange right here two oranges another orange but they're kind of different shades so maybe they're different types of like orange flavoring then right here you got two green you got a blue raspberry I'm assuming got a fruit punch what else you got another fruit punch blue raspberry and another orange man I think the orange one is their best one so I'm gonna go ahead and dump both of these boxes out on a plate and then I'm just gonna get to munch a man because these are a lot of gummies man these are gonna be 20 whole 10 milligrams per piece gummy so I don't even know if I'm ready for this boys hi guys so I ended up only just pouring out the tent the first thousand milligrams because I felt like 20 gummies is just way too much to eat in one sitting so I'm gonna do just a thousand milligrams this video but if you guys want us to get two thousand and three thousand milligrams at it we'll go ahead and run up the likes on this video and let the LED standard themselves know on Instagram that you guys want to see that challenge happen alright that way they could provide me with more goods so before anything though I want to show you guys this sick a shirt that they provided for me also it says standard the ultimate standard and it has it also on the sleeves I think I might have a coupon code for this so if you guys want to cop it I'm gonna go ahead and put it down in description below and yeah man let's get to eat here goes the first one I'm not too sure which flavor is which I must just assuming that the green one is sour apple because I have had the sour apple once before so I'm gonna go ahead and munch down on all of these men and I'm gonna give you guys the taste of every single one of them which I'm gonna tell you guys if they are if they taste like THC or anything like that some of Cheers [Music] now was this our Apple home for sure super fine like I remembered it and he doesn't it doesn't taste like like TC at all like I'm telling you it only has that little edible aftertaste that I feel like all edibles have so this one right here I'm assuming is the blue raspberry choose fire alright go ahead and I'm the watermelon I'm assuming you don't wanna do I'm a genius I I'm assuming this one orange is orange red up I can't tell can't tell if it's peach or orange one of those two so right here we go from the last one I might I'm thinking this one's pineapple definitely pineapple I'm assuming so those were five right chuni it doubled up on the all the flavors and we got here we got the last five so I'm gonna just go ahead and much down boys Cheers [Music] so all our chewing boys sorry if you guys to

some snacks just in case I'm not able to drive later because a thousand milligrams is a dangerous amount all right so my eyes they are starting to get a little bit red I am starting to feel a little bit stomach pain I'm not gonna lie am i because I've only eaten one thing this morning it was just a little pancake so and it's already a 1:00 1:30 yeah so um I'm gonna go ahead and go in grab my [ __ ] drive back home and I'm hoping praying that it doesn't hit while I'm in the store because if it does I'm in a big I'm in some big trouble man I'm in some big trouble I'm not gonna be able to drive

meth problem right I've never done that I've also never skied before which you know is a bit of Carlos in in Colorado you know it's like they say a Colorado family that's happy not skiing is like a Catholic family that's happy [Applause] I can but in erskine I've never done meth before I thought about it never done it and here's why like I said Colorado used a huge meth problem but that is until the Colorado antiemetic project okay which was a seriously psays commercial was billboards which drove many shoots down in Colorado like 90% this is true with the tried and true method of scaring the [ __ ] out of teens mostly right and there were there were a lot of like versions of it but my favorite was there was a billboard right next to my high school which was a picture of just like the gross grungy sink splat covered in blood okay and it said at the top you never think you try to peel off your own skin [Music] meth will change that first of all very effective right like I will never do that as a result of that I'm hoping that you will ever do that as a result of that and maybe some use it's too late I'm saying you look like you can hide but I'm saying you look like you could be possibly the biggest myself too though you know I mean to wear skinny popular but you never see me try to feel our own skin meth will change that what I would love to see would be like a similar style of PSA but for like way less dangerous drugs you know like you never think you try to peel break with your teeth and then use the peel grape sort of like lick bomb on your lips because it looks stupid

at youth who tried to get my parents to put me on adderall to like tell me picture what I was like as I could like picture like Sid from Toy Story meets Chicken Little like do but in a hurry and I have those glasses right but not just the glasses I had glasses with like that strength action strapped right back here right because I was lived a very active lifestyle okay I was doing this a lot apparently with my head and there also they were flexible glasses rent like literally the wires in the classes would bend right because my parents didn't trust me and so there was and there was another girl in my class in the first grade her name was Rachel Wilson and she also had glasses and one day I was just playing with my glasses just bending them as one doesn't want to do and she was I kind of like how do you do that I was like I'm just do it she was like oh snap I went to the principal's office I'm kidding I'm kidding she's rich it was yeah I don't know my heaven on man I am done much cocaine and I've like weed though I've never gotten like crazy with it when an exception which is that when I was back home in Denver over this last Christmas I was hanging on my friend sacks basement he told me Oh Sam by the way that is 50 milligrams for those of you who don't regularly eat marijuana gummies think about like this like in terms of alcohol like eating a 50 milligram gummy is like if instead of doing like a couple shots of alcohol to like kick off your night if instead you just like slam your head in a minivan doing are doing around like it's inscrutable passage maybe the gummy puts on the movie 24 days later and passes out 20 dessert that's life if a zombie movie was written by someone who had just taken a 50 milligrams gummy okay so I'm losing my mind zombies are getting hacked up with machetes that one skinny dudes hooking people's eyes down zombies are eating people's necks and then the climax of the movie this dude who's like chained to a military base and it's grimy zombies it's like it's just people killing people and I look over at my past our friend Zach and I'm like he's of people right settle down when it comes to peace for this girlfriend I'm standing there [Music] because we make eye contact right she like pushes some water thank you and we make contact and I'm like I know that I'm flying other higher than I've ever been but I like I feel like I get closer to earth and we just like we don't we don't say anything but we just like and I'm like I'm so conflicted cuz I'm like I'm in love but I don't know how to tell my friend my friend Zach doesn't have a girlfriend he does have a two-and-a-half-year-old a border collie named Daisy whom I spooned for anywhere from 15 minutes to seven and a half hours [Music] run away so that you can escape society and the shackles of expectations put upon you we will change that [Applause]", "3YOpDXVcqlg": "i-i-i i'm wavy and focus s like they dream that money grows and I wave G that here it goes in the deja I know these waves like like crazy I'm crazy too obsessed like for the assessment here it goes like waving money be like daydream like money dream that way be safe guys it stops at me but today come on you just finished one review for you CBD my apologies here sorry to her apology which don't know what video is going to come out for us so we're just gonna say on both videos but make sure you check out both of the videos they should both be coming out today so depending on which one is which it's not the next day but today what we are reviewing is some edible candies so these ones are amazing the red one they look red but they're not now cola hard squares so they're color squares and these ones they're a bit big record but basically these ones are more like caramel hard crunchy sweet basically they look like coffees but it's not more like a hard caramel crunches sweets so we've got eat what we didn't have a 10 in each that's our fault basically oh yeah okay nice long as there is 200 million pounds in 10 above so every time there's 200 milligrams so what we're going to do today is five of these ones and four of them ones I'm going to just let you know what if you like or you might have six of these and put them to do that so we'll just get into it anyway and then don't think there's no smell these knowledge smell that sweet candies but on appearance and literally these look Oh Papa's millions of Jews go to speak shop and you should get pregnancy but that was to stuck together day if you wonder why I'm saving them basically we've got event coming up kind of this event so obviously when we get hired on their or received in nine of them to get high down there and we've got ten here folks so we've got five offs with caramel candies and got five of the colas so that's gonna we're just gonna munch these so we're gonna taste each one and let you guys know the flavor on appearance it definite gets a tank on the parents definitely nice shape they are all even all the same size so you know you get an even amount on each one so you know someone's not hugging you or something but yeah really nice so it gets a 10 on the parents so we're going to try the color one nice definiteiy stir causes hauntings here while all say we've certain a divorce depending on how people make them if they made them with oils that their tastes very sour that's when the whole is activated or EB closing on his own is very sour so he's a sweet with that sour plant matter taste but it's not got part muttering it's just a resin so it's more of a resin taste but the only way I can explain it to people it's like a black mark oils resident wax it all comes from cloud is the inside of our captive so for them people that don't know same it's like vegetable oil and things like that this is really nice it's really taste the Cola and then the oils you can really they're strong very strong in tulip more probably get into it more stronger it gets so the coal of one just labor very nice flavor not too sweet you can taste the Toto a little bit not too much and not overpowering there's a little bit hidden because the resins a little overpowering overthinking to do a little bit more flavor but it's still on fire with normal speakers it's just that is that obviously he didn't know of certain tolerances so this definitely on the cooler side of them gets a pen so you might get a 10 out of the whole lot in a minute so we'll just drive Patera mile 1/2 car last week in the heart literally just like this week's the news I just wheat your shot when you're a kid your hard caramel sweets and on top this needs work bit like the bah humbugs but they were like top it tastes exactly the same just with that hidden surprise with the resin these are more buttery got a nice buttery flavor these are less presently tasting and because the is like a creamy sweet time off buttery taste that's taken over the resin with the other one that's because there are more sweet tasting sweet instead of being a caramely but every nice taste this one so one's more overpowering in the airport he's in yes I could eat these all day and not even noticed I'm eating but edible you could chuck one of these to something for them someone I thought I've been smoked cool I've never happened before and like nougat Chuck wants someone and they won't even notice anything cause of it so the caramel ones are the better ones they both get a tenth of favor awesome you taste that resin and you can taste flavors of the sweet and it lasts like parboil sweet in your mouth exactly the same they don't crumble like some powerful sweet I've had off some people as little temperatures wrong and stuff fall back um really nice so what we're gonna do now we must stop the video Pierre complete and then

earthlings i am the duke of dabs here just to bring you some more cannabis related content in regards to my channel this channel is dedicated to medical patients and people 21 years old to recreationally smoke thank you for joining me today today we're just going to be doing a little bit of a review session a I know it's Monday but I've been kind of throwing around a couple of ideas maybe but for right now I'm just gonna do a impromptu kind of review on this now as you can see here I the true infusion brand here these guys are gonna be gummies tinctures you name it they come in both indica sativa they have some hybrids they have one two ones which means it has a little bit of THC and CBD in it this one is purely THC there are ten milligrams per gummy the nice thing about these the gluten free they're also gonna be very low on all of your daily stuff it's like sixteen calories per so the entire bag is about a hundred calories yada yada the people who are concerned with that kind of thing dosage on those is very very steady I would say I've eaten eight whole bags of these and even at just like 50 milligrams you're feeling like you're you feeling some of the effects definitely coming on in regards to having a gummy gummies digest a little bit differently then I'd say like chocolate or a soda in that regards gummies kind of have a little bit of a longer digest time to them but once they start taking effect it's pretty golden this particular batch that I had here on both of them they're gonna be banana cream flavored and blueberry flavored but the strain that goes into it is going to be purple Bubba so it's a definite high THC indica that will definitely bring about more of a body pain relief kind of feel to it versus a more cerebral uplift that a sativa would give this would be more for pain management rest you name it that kind of deal just relaxing true fusion has been one of my favorite brands so far they're one of my definite go twos when it comes to Arizona medical they are an Arizona company they originally started out doing mostly the CBD infusions and then they kind of started dabbling with the THC and yeah they really come a long ways in regards to the products they've always had pretty good products but now they've just surpassed pretty much what they were doing originally so without further ado I'm gonna go ahead and get one of these guys opened up here just to kind of give us a nice clear view upon opening the bag you have a very strong banana flavored it's not gonna be very big here for comparison sizes I'll show ya the that's a quarter golden quarter it's about a little larger than a quarter so the thickness on it it's like a Lego in brick the smell of it instantly you can tell it's banana flavored first taste of it tastes like banana runs nimma jaw a little tingly there that one was the banana now I've tried the banana before I've always liked blueberries a brand new flavor this is the first time for both of us here oh yeah it's got a very blueberry hint to it these have a nice resealable bag to them so you can keep your products fresh blueberry same size same shape consistency same fruit smell okay it almost tastes like a blue otter pop so the taste on these guys there is a little bit of a weedy taste to it which it's not too bad it's not gonna be like other edibles that I've eaten before that chocolate bar that I had in the previous videos more weedy than this is but these guys are nice little 10 milligram doses here so two of these bags 200 milligrams at our location they're only $12 a bag for a hundred milligrams I mean it's a pretty good deal it's need a couple more cuz I'm gonna have a aftermath do what these guys do go ahead and take another blueberry we're sitting at about 30 milligrams now 40 50 six day we're going to go for about 80 seventy very gives you dry Josh they're like I'm very gelatinous consistency they're not gonna be like a super hard gummy but they're not like super stretchy either you can see it final 180 let's go bigger girl let's just add 20 more milligrams on buy big or go home I mean 100 milligrams it's not too terribly large or the dose but still large enough to make your average edible use your 100 milligram Cheers all right so we got those edibles down pretty pretty fast I'd say I see that we're only about nine minutes into this video here and we've eaten about a hundred milligrams so I'm gonna give it probably another 40 minutes or so I'll snap back over here to this video section once again I'm do cubed ABS just medical patient video channel thing if you're new here please mash that subscribe button we want to be a fellow earthling not a peasant to poop soup so yeah I'll be coming back to make a follow-up video after math video to this one I've really got to go to the bathroom right now and trying to kind of contain myself so that I can make a nice outro here but once again guys if you are in the Arizona area and you're a medical patient please try out some true infusion gunman's if you've never tried them try out their tinctures I personally give it the Duke seal of approval so I mean I've been in the industry for nearly three years now and I can tell you I like to sample out my products and you know what I'm telling my patients so that I'm not giving them you know false hopes or anything along that lines once again I'm not and when I say patients I don't mean I'm a doctor or anything I I never claim that I'm a doctor I'm just basically your friendly neighborhood naturopathic pharmacist essentially that's all I do is I dispense it out to the public who have medical cards so it's about it anyways we'll be coming back in about an hour or so with a follow-up to these bad boys and the 100 milligrams and how we're feeling in the effects and I'll catch you then peace", "NvLcVeAwem4": "[Music] the cannabis market is the wild [ __ ] West and there isn't a grizzled Sheriff and his loyal deputies around to keep you safe from all the bandits welcome to wheats everyone the marijuana reviews show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I get a lot of questions about people asking for tips for determining if an edible is potent as advertised so today guys I'm gonna share with you five common sense tips on how to avoid getting scammed when it comes to buying edibles getting scammed at the dispensary is pretty easy it's a nascent market with little to no regulations and zero accountability there's also lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of money to be made so lots of money and no accountability equals sleazy scores for scammers and fraudsters and it's bad enough when dispensaries and growers mislead their customers on what strain or how potent the flower they are buying is but at least the customers can see the product they can verify its weight they can smell it or whatever other rituals they have to test their weed sure they may not be getting the premium product that they are supposedly paying for but if they're buying an amount they will generally get that amount edibles however are much easier to scan customers with a customer can't verify that 200 milligrams or whatever listed on the package is really 200 milligrams they don't see the edibles getting made they can't see it being packaged if you want to buy a product you've got to take the company at its word that their product is potent is advertised store that your dispensary isn't gonna sell you a shitty product and good luck with that so I don't want to scare anyone away from edibles because they're [ __ ] awesome there are tons of great and reliable edible companies out there and more certain to come soon and experimenting and trying new products is half the fun but before you go and buy something expensive you've never seen before try utilizing these five tips to save yourself some money and some heartache so tip number one don't trust weed maps or your bud tender for their recommendation both these places especially weed maps is swamped with a bunch of bots and fake reviews that amp up a lot of really shady companies like lol edibles or infused creations all those have been pumped up by their respective companies and they mislead you and also speaking of people that mislead you your bud tender may very well mislead you they may have some kind of sales contract or sales target for some specific edible or they may have some kind of relationship with an edible manufacturer and they may be just be trying to sell you something that is not very good I've certainly seen it happen many times I've seen a lot of bud tenders Hocking lol edibles saying it's you know the second coming do not be fooled by them do your own research ahead of time don't trust weed Maps don't trust your bud tender know what you're looking for add of time so tip number two is in this case you want to judge a book by its cover or you want to stick to those reputable brands and what I mean by judge a book by its cover is looked at like the packaging is the packaging nice is the packaging fancy does it really show off the edible and all its glory I'm just talking about canna Co I'm talking about Korova here these guys have great packaging vibrant packaging that really shows off and sells their product and generally speaking the fancier the packaging the nice of the packaging the nicer the product maybe because they have the money already from being a bigger brand to invest in their packaging you know I'm sure it's the dog wagging some tail here a little bit as to what comes first but really take a look at the packaging do not buy anything that's just in like a plastic ziplock bag with a sticker over it it's usually going to be a bad product you want to take a look and make sure it has respectable packaging faziz that's usually a pretty good indicator that it's going to be a decent product so again judge a book by its cover and stick to those reputable brands stick to the big-name guys out there the big-name guys are big names for a reason again that's gonna be your Korova that's gonna be your Kiva that's gonna be your Kanaka that's gonna be your flourish the big guys are big again for a reason and they all have nice packaging so again look for the fancy packaging stay away from crappy packaging it's usually a pretty good indicator that what's inside is just as what's it's just as crappy as what's on the outside so tip number three is baked goods are good and chocolate is the best so I'm gonna go ahead and combine this with don't be a dummy stay away from gummies that is mostly true almost all gummies are bad with a few very notable exceptions like flourish do not get infused creations do not get at up here you're gonna see a ton of prepackaged edible or gummy edibles out there and they are almost always terrible with again a very few exceptions when it comes to gummies if you see flourish go and pick them up but outside of that stay away from the gummies there are usually a little bit cheaper than other things usually sometimes even substantially more so but that's for a reason because they are not as potent as advertised so stick away from the gummies State stay close to the baked goods your cookies and your brownies not even the Krispies like the rice krispies treats the fruity Krispies i'd stay away from those as well I don't find those to be as potent your brownies and your cookies are your best bets but for the absolute best bet go with the chocolate bars that is the best way I have found on all of my reviews for getting THC and the most potent gram for gram has always been chocolate bars kiva bang for twenty two phones say all those great ones there's so many out there and it's usually if you can find a chocolate bar it's gonna be a fun fun ride so again tip number three baked goods are good chocolate is the best stay away from gummies alright so that brings us to tip number four and that is to look for independent lab testing results this is a big one if you can find on you package or somewhere actual lab testing results that is he and don't just look for them to say lab tested look for the actual results you'll see tons of edibles out there lying about being lab tested and then this that and the other but if they don't have that actual result printed on the package it's no good plenty of people will lie about being lab tested or they'll get one product lab tested and say their entire line is lab tested if you don't see the actual results it's wasn't lab tested just go with that so look for that lab tested results look for independent verified results printed on the package or if not printed on the package printed it on a sheep close by something that will let you know that is as potent as advertised so again if you can find those lab tested results and it comes up as potent as advertised go and pick up that product it's gonna be good to go and then finally our fifth tip here is the most important one and the one that I cannot stress enough and that is you get what you pay for when it comes to edibles if there is a deal that seems too good to be true if you see a 500 milligram rice krispies treat for ten dollars don't go running for your wallet to pick it up and buy up the entire stock because they're lying to you it's not gonna be 500 milligrams it's probably not even gonna be twenty milligrams it's probably just gonna be an operation to fleece you out of your money if something seems very expensive there's usually a reason for that if it seems out of line it's probably because it is high quality stuff made with quality cannabis and quality ingredients and it's gonna stand apart the best edibles out there do cost a little bit more but they are absolutely worth it and almost invariably true if a product seems to be too good to be true in terms of price it absolutely will be so stay away from anything that seems to be too good to be true in terms of pricing and make sure that you know edibles are expensive guys so don't be surprised when you have to pay 22 bucks for a hundred and eighty milligram chocalate bar that's just gonna be the way it is out here but again you get what you pay for so if you pay that premium for that chocolate bar that fancier looking brand you're almost certainly going to be rewarded in terms of potency or taste or whatever the case may be so you absolutely get what you pay for and guys those are our five tips there just to run through them one more time don't trust weed maps or your bud tender for your recommendation do judge a book by its cover stick to those reputable brands number three baked goods are goods chocolate is the best stay away from gummies number four look for those independent lab testing results and then number five you get what you pay for when it comes to edibles what you pay for is what you get so if the deal seems too good to be true it very likely is and guys that's gonna do it just follow those five tips and you should be ready to enjoy some high-quality edibles and if you guys have any other tips or pointers that you want to share just leave a comment below and we'll be sure to include it maybe in a future video or pin it up there at the top we'll add it up or if you just disagree with me if you think my my tips here are total hogwash please leave a comment below

welcome to dive into light edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and to the regular subscribers thank you so much and welcome back new subscribers thank you again for joining I'm so excited this channel is kind of weirdly taking on a life of its own it's it's really really exciting but a little overwhelming I'm not gonna lie it's kind of cool when there's like you know a couple thousand people seen it but now we're getting into some not large numbers for me um that I never expected and it's like what oh but it's super cool and thank you guys so much I couldn't do this obviously without you so today I know I've got another company recipes up there and I'm always working to refine and make things better so in this recipe this is good for regular gummy bears or regular gummy candies or the sweet and sour there's really only one difference in the change for that recipe whether you want to make regular or the sugar sugar-coated and so I wanted to go for that as well as a little bit a little bit of change in the method but any one of those recipes will work so kind of how I'm gonna how I would list it is the regular gummy bears that I put is more like a condensed jello realistically it's jell-o and gelatin and you harden it up that's condensed jello and then the other candy this the sour one with the the sugar-coated sour ones they're more like a real candy so I know also how the gummy that's more like a real candy versus just condensed gelatin and I will stop babbling on now and also I've got a recipe at the end there if you want to stay tuned on how to make inverted sugar which is a replacement for corn syrup so if Kourt lake corn syrup is difficult for you to get expensive just not available in your local grocery stores you can actually make your own at a fraction of the price and it's super easy to make however it is very very finicky but I go over all of that at the end there about the inverted sugar so I hope you stay tuned for that and and check that out and I think that's all I've got for us right now I'm gonna get in as I usually do get into my ingredients the utensils you're gonna need we'll put everything together and we'll get some candies made we're getting started what you want to do is to get a pot of either ice water or set up a pot of cold water and put it in your fridge or freezer about an hour before you want to start this very important you need the really cold water to start to stop the cooking process for the syrup so just get that set up ahead of time and now we'll get into your ingredients and the tools that you're going to need all right so I'm just gonna go over the ingredients now the ingredients for the gelatin side are exactly the same whether you want to do be regular or whether you want to do the sugar coated it's exactly the same the only difference is whether you're doing the sugar coated or the regular is in the candy syrup and the difference there is if you're doing sugar coated you're gonna use one cup of sugar actually I'll go over that when I get into the sugar part you never mind about that right now we'll start with the gelatin side so you're going to need a one box of jell-o three envelopes of gelatin or three tablespoons you are going to need a quarter cup of corn syrup or you can use what's called inverted syrup which is a substitution for corn syrup I have a video at the end of this to show you how to make your own inverted sugar which I use quite often which I'm actually using today I'm just showing you the bottle for what you've got what you need in the light corn syrup you will need a quarter cup of melted can of butter 1/2 teaspoon of gore gum a quarter cup of liquid now I tend to use the kool-aid jammers or the or the kool-aid waters they're great or the Hawaiian punches are great to use as well or you can just use water you're gonna want a half a cup of liquid again you can use your juice or your gelatin I'm sorry your juice or your water for the gelatin and for this you need it needs to be cold so for your gelatin it has to be very cold and for our jello portion we're actually going to boil that and the only other thing is if you want to add some additional color and additional flavor we can do that as well and I think Oh sorry and we also need a quarter tea store sorry a half a teaspoon of citric acid I apologize almost missed that our half teaspoon of citric acid that's everything that we're going to need for our gelatin side and now I'm just gonna when we start the syrup I'm going to go into the ingredients in that for the syrup side and then if previously I talked a little bit about clear gel for the regular gelatin gummies you can actually use this now for either one and again we're gonna do all the work on our gelatin side and add this in so with regards to the clear gel if you want to use it what you need to do beforehand is you take a cup of the clear gel and you mix it with a quarter cup of sugar and you keep that to a side mix it thoroughly so that the sugar and the starch are thoroughly mixed the reason for that the starch will clump if you do it on its own or doesn't have the sugar properly mixed these starts will clump up in your mixture so that is why we add the sugar then you are going to use two tablespoons for your gelatin for your gelatin mix now this is an option now what this does is it takes your candy to that next level that more professional candy like you get in the candy store so it's not as gelatin like it's more it's a little bit softer it's more of that gummy candy versus just like concentrated gelatin and I've been using this ever since I first since I tried it I used it in all my candy now it's I love it it's not that expensive you get a large container of it and it lasts quite a long time so if you do make candies more on a larger scale or on a professional level you might want to give that a try it's excellent it's a little pretty pain to work with but I'll go over all that adding that in so for the candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar okay laureate let me back up here if you are making the sugar-coated gummies you are gonna use one cup of sugar and a half a cup of corn syrup if you want to make regular gummies that are not sugar-coated you're going to switch that you're going to use one cup of corn syrup to a half a cup of sugar but it's to a half a cup of sugar so the recipe is exactly the same this is the only part that'll change regular gummies one cup of syrup to half a cup of sugar sugar-coated gummies one cup of sugar to half a cup of corn sort syrup and the water remains the same half a cup either way you go that's all you need for the candy syrup side temperature cooks to the exact same we're gonna cook it to 260 all right so the equipment that we are going to need is a double boiler you don't have one no problem just what I do use a metal bowl that fits into a pot you want to add water into the bottom to the pot you just don't want it to touch the bottom of the bowl you're gonna need a second pot for your syrup you would let you want to use a heavy bottom pot it works it's better for even the heat distribution for your syrup that way your syrup cooks evenly you don't have any hotter spots you're going to need a candy thermometer a hand blender a whisk a couple of spatulas and a strainer if you've got one handy and I think that's everything that we need for our equipment I usually end up finding something that Wow's that we need but this is generally the majority of the equipment that you're gonna need so next I'll get into the ingredients for putting our gelatin portion together and then we'll then we do the candy syrup and then we combine both of them alright so give me a moment to get everything together here and we'll get started all right so let's get started with our recipe so our very first step what we're gonna do is our quarter cup of liquid we're gonna heat up in the microwave for one minute we want that boiling then with our half a cup of cold liquid we're gonna bloom our gelatin so add that to a bowl and your gelatin you want to evenly spread it over your liquid and again water or the juice I'm actually using kool-aid jam or yes or sorry I'm using the kool-aid waters you know if you do use real juice with real fruit all you need to do is to add a mold inhibitor laureen's makes a makes one and that's what you need to use if you if you use anything with real fruit in it otherwise they will mold very quickly but if you use fruit jammers Hawaiian Punch they don't have anything real in the sugar content they don't go mouldy I literally have gummies that last for months I've never seen mold on them so with regards to your gelatin you want to sprinkle it evenly and then mix it up to make sure that there are no lumps and then you're gonna set it aside for five minutes to allow it to bloom and meanwhile I'm going to microwave this for one minute so you're gonna add your box of jell-o to the double boiler you're gonna set your temperature to low and we're just gonna wait for I'm just waiting for my liquid to boil all right so we're going to add our boiled liquid yeah it got very hot I'm gonna add that in and we're gonna stir that around let our gelatin let our jello get dissolved you might need to add a little bit more liquid to it if you find that it's not fully dissolving but it takes a few minutes anyway and you want to continue to scrape all the gelatin off the sides otherwise it will harden up and we're just gonna stir that and let our water get warm now it's really important with jell-o and gelatin is the heat jello and more gelatin sorry I apologize the our unflavored gelatin melts at just hot a hot water bath if it is too hot it breaks the gelatin and what will happen is your you'll notice it'll start to get very foamy if it starts foaming immediately remove your bowl from the heat and let it cool down you also may need to add about 1/2 a tbsp more of unflavored gelatin because you've kind of broken the the you broken the gelatin a bit so it may not be as sticky or it may not be sorry gel as well so you may I need to add in an additional half a tablespoon to compensate for that so I'm just gonna continue to stir this on the low heat until it is till it's pretty much fully melted until the sugars all fully melted so now that my gelatin is pretty much melted we're gonna add in our quarter cup of corn syrup and get that thoroughly stirred in and we're also gonna add in our half a teaspoon of citric acid we're gonna let that all mix in and melt together again try and keep the sides of your bowl as clean as possible so now that our jello is all melted we're going to add in our gelatin and your gelatin is bloomed when it is nice and spongy if it is squishy at all then either your gelatin is it's not strong enough because gelatinous do have different strengths or it's old and the gelatin is just broken so you want it to be nice and firm and just break it up into pieces and scoop it in and then we're just gonna stir that until that's melted and again remember you just want to warm hot water by at this point you don't want the water underneath boiling at all otherwise your jello your gelatin will break and again if you see it starting to foam up at all take it off immediately now once your gelatin is all melted and everything looks nice like so we're gonna add in our can of butter so you know it in a quarter to a third of a cup of can of butter I'm doing a quarter cup they have dogs and cats behind me [Music] cats trying to trip me up here and then I'd in the Gerber gun this is when you want to use the strainer throw it on there and you want to evenly sprinkle it all over the top and now we're going to get our handy dandy hand blender and so you're going to blend this until it is completely all one color one unit alt one texture and that you're not seeing any kind of oil separation [Music] all right so we've got that all what we called emulsifies so what Gord got gorg um is an emulsifier what an emulsifier does is it allows oil and water to come together essentially it creates a little bubble so when we use the blender it breaks the oil particles up into tiny little part into little pieces and the emulsifier acts as a bubble and holds the water and the oil together in little bubbles that's how it all comes together and your water and oil live happily together otherwise your butter is going to separate and come to the top if you don't use that now a lot of people have asked me if you can use zanza zantac xanthan gum no you cannot it is not an emulsifier it is only a thickening agent so geurim is an emulsifier it is also a thickening agent and a stabilizer that is the other you can use lecithin I prefer Gore gum because lecithin gives it a flavor that I really don't like and I find that the Gore gum works awesome with you don't need the lesser than now at this point if you want you can add in your some additional flavoring I add in about a cup and a half full and if you want to add in some additional color I do it on this side as well I use the no taste red if I'm doing red color so I'm doing raspberries so I use the no taste red reason for that a red die has red food coloring I mean has a tends to have a bitter flavor to it so I like the no taste rent the only downfall about it is you don't get quite as an intense red as the regular ones but I would for rather give up a little bit of the color for than the flavor so I'm gonna mix that in and I'm gonna use the hand blender again just to get it full all mixed together the color comes out much nicer when you use the hand blender [Music] and when you're riding a clear gel you're gonna want to have your whisk ready and coupes and we're going to add in a tablespoon at a time and you want to evenly spread it over the top like so and then use this too and then you're gonna have to whisk it for about a minute or minute or two you're gonna notice it start to thicken up it's just kinda like cornstarch you know when you're making gravy you have to keep mixing it a little while for it to up for it to thicken up and do its thing we're gonna do and you can see how it's starting to thicken up and now we're gonna add in the second tablespoon same thing evenly over the top whisk and you're gonna repeat the same thing we're going to whisk it for about a minute or two until it's all to look pick it up so you can see how it's thickening up here I said you want to continue whisking for about two minutes and it should look nice and smooth and again all one uniform texture and color alright that side is ready is finished now we're gonna do the candy syrup side alright so for our candy syrup side because I am doing sugar or sour coated ones I am going to be using one cup of sugar half a cup of corn syrup and a cup of water now remember if you want to make regular gummies our only difference is you're gonna use a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of regular sugar that is the only difference there you're gonna mix that together until it's up until it comes up together and your sugar begins to dissolve make sure to go all around the edges because the sugar likes to hide on the edges all right so and once your gonna have that all mixed up you're gonna turn your heat on to medium medium-high and you're going to continue to stir this until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you're not going to stir it all right the other one of the things I forgot is you want a pastry brush or a paintbrush clean paint brush so that you can clean off the sides of the pot to use a cup of hot hot water and that'll melt any sugar crystals that you've got and you want to get those off the side because any sugar crystals can cause your syrup to crystallize later on and just continue to stir it until it begins to boil Oh once your syrup begins to boil stop stirring and you're going to add in your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook this until 260 now if you want a firmer candy you can cook it to about 280 so anywhere between 260 280 you can experiment on your firmness if you want a softer candy cook it to 250 but I found 260 seemed to be a really good temperature for it and we're just gonna let that go until we hit the proper temperature now you also want to get your pot of cold water handy and the only thing that you'll do drink the cooking process is if you do see any sugar crystals form just wash them down and now while your candy while the candy syrup is cooking you just want to consider this because stir your jello side because the top part of its gonna start to solidify and the bottom is gonna be liquid because it's closer to the heat so you want to continue sure to mix that up and it all stays nice and smooth and keep it on keep it on low temperature so you have the low hot water bath keeping it melted all right so I've hit 260 take your pot and submerse it in cold ice water turn off your heat and you want to wait until the temperature begins to come down on your thermometer then you're going to place it on the counter until the temperature hits 240 well once your temperature reaches 240 you can remove your candy thermometer and we are now going to add in our gelatin or our jello and our gelatin mixture right so now we're gonna get our jello we're going to get that added in and then you're gonna very carefully stir this until it is fully mixed together your sugar the sugar syrup and the gelatin come together but be very careful because this is very hot you're going to pull it from the bottom and again make sure to get the edges and then it's this is up to you it's an optional step I do I like to use the hand blender on it and the reason I like to use the hand blender is just to make sure that everything is all mixed and blended thoroughly together [Music] [Applause] well see you like that be careful I'm gonna clean up my little mess here and then we're gonna get lit gonna let this sit let some of the air bubbles come out of it we you can work them out by just gently stirring it let it sit and then just look gently stir it again we need this to cool down a bit so you can do that and I'm just gonna clean up a little all right so my mixture is cooled down a bit and I'm going to pour it into my to my bottles my squeeze bottles that was one of the things I forgot in the utensils or tools you need is your squeeze bottles or eyedroppers and I use these squeeze bottles they're by sugar sweet sugar bowel and they've got their nice because they've got the piping tips for them which makes it really nice and easy as well as they have a wide bottle and a wider thread if you use bottles that have too thin of a thread if your syrup is hot or really thick it'll pop the top right off if after you filled your bottles if you still have syrup left just keep it on the lowest temperature just so that we can that you it'll stay so melted there otherwise it will solidify all right so now we're gonna get ready to put this into our moulds all right and then when you're filling up your mold you just want to fill them up just a little over halfway you don't want to go all the way to the top because that way it makes a rough edge on them and it makes your candies not very nice so you just want to try to make them as clean it's also you want to try not to get any jello on the edges there and you're just gonna fill up all of your molds and then once you've got them all filled you're gonna put them into the refrigerator for a minimum of four to six hours I found its best overnight so if after four hours or so II go to try to take about there knock coming out just leave them for overnight usually that usually works if they're still not going to come out of the mold you can put them in the freezer it means that you've got too much syrup the gelatin isn't working too well what you can do is put them into the freezer get them out of the molds remount them at about a tablespoon of gelatin and recast them and then if you find that you take out your candies and they're far too gummy too sticky you can remount them and add a little bit of liquid to it means that it has more too much gelatin you can add up I probably say about two or three tablespoons of liquid to it remelt it and just recast them and this recipe makes about sixty candies if you use smaller molds and if you use those little tiny bear molds you're gonna get about at least a hundred to 150 all right so these candies I had in the fridge overnight and I made lemon yesterday so you can see now I did I have found that they do stay there are better if you leave them overnight then just leaving them for a few hours and they'll come out and you pop them right into your sugar sour mix now your sugar sour mix should be one cup of sugar to a half a teaspoon of citric acid don't use any more make sure to thoroughly mix it in and that'll make a nice sugar sour mix if you just want sugar just use sugar what I usually do is for the sweet ones I will use a cup of sugar to about a quarter teaspoon of citric acid just a little bit because it brings out the fruit flavors so you just mix them into your sugar shake off the excess and lay them on a a rack with parchment paper to dry overnight now these guys also dry a lot quicker and then the other recipe and just pop them out now if you find that they're getting too sticky like this you can put them back into the fridge sometimes they do the when you leave them out they get too warm so as they get a little bit too sticky so what I usually do is take out one mold at a time and do them and that's it you'll continue doing that until they're all are all coated and just lay them out on the rack to dry overnight and those are your sugar or your sugar sour coated candies your sugar soda yeah cannabutter gummy and I just want to go for also a couple of things with regards to molds when you get brand news if you get brand-new silicone molds what I recommend to do is to cut to season them so I use a spray the spray cooking spray I spray it on let them sit for 20 minutes and then rinse them in hot water I don't use soap on them again but I want to rinse off all the excess cooking spray and then that kick that that cures them which is nice I found that red silicone mold do not work well for some reason they're thicker and I can never get anything out of them so I tend to stay away from red silicone molds I found the blues Browns and that work great but red mm-hmm does not work Oh to make inverted sugar replacement for corn syrup you need two cups of white sugar one cup of water and a quarter cup or sorry a quarter teaspoon of citric acid you're gonna need a pastry brush or a clean paintbrush brand new one will be better in a glass of hot hot water we're going to need a pot you want your pot to be super clean there cannot be even a speck of dust or dirt in your pot because it will cause your syrup to crystallize now you want a spatula and your candy thermometer that's pretty much all you need so to get started we're gonna get started in just one moment all right so we are gonna combine we're gonna put in our sugar or 1 cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're gonna stir that till the biggest sugar begins to dissolve and any sugar crystals that are on the side you want to make sure to wash down we'll do that in a minute and if I change you see anything in your sugar at all any dust or any little particles whatsoever make sure that they come out because I said anything at all in your sugar will cause it to crystallize and sometimes things happen you get little little dust or little pieces of stuff I said then wash down any sugar crystals off of the side and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high you want to make sure that your pot is always in the center of the burner so that you're getting proper even heat distribution not where your sugar is cooks prop evenly and so we're gonna continue to stir this until our syrup starts to boil the moment it begins to boil you're gonna stop stirring it stirring once it starts boiling will actually cause your syrup to crystallize and we need to avoid that at all costs so just continue stirring until it begins to boil and wash down and in between keep the washing down the sides of your pot for any sugar crystals whatsoever like literally one crystal will cause your your syrup to crystallize so although it's really easy to make it is very finicky when you're stirring it's also very important to take your spatula and go right around the edge of the pot the sugar likes to settle in on the edges so you want to make sure that nothing's sitting because otherwise if it sits to the bottom it will will stick and cause you problems so the reason why inverted sugar is so finicky and while any crib one single crystal or dust will cause it to crystallize because what we're making is a what's called a supersaturated solution so I don't know if you remember science class see that science stuff does come back to you if you you made saturated solutions and supersaturated solutions where you add a saturated solution is where you have water in salt you have us salt to its maximum saturation point in its water once you go one crystal beyond that it becomes what's called a supersaturated solution and that is what we're making here because we start out first of all with a saturated solution the two cups - 1 cup of water tea cups of sugar - 1 cup of water creates a super create a saturated solution by cooking off the water we are now gonna have more sugar content than your water which then creates your supersaturated solution there you go science for the day you've learned your something new you're done oh sorry one thing I did forget is you're going to need the lid for your pot mine as you can see this one is too big for it if you don't have the right lid no big deal just use them flipped over they work just as good so you definitely need the lid to your pot because once we stop cooking this we're gonna put the lid on it immediately now as soon as it starts to boiling you're gonna stop stirring it you're not going to stir it anymore from this point on you're going to add your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook the syrup to 230 for between 234 and 237 if you want a little bit of a looser syrup then 234 if you want it a little bit thicker than 237 but you're not gonna go beyond that and the only thing now that we're gonna do through the cooking process is wash down the sides of any sugar crystals form that it's the only thing you want to make sure that's equal that's it that we're going to do through the process so keep an eye on the thermometer goes fairly quickly don't walk away don't go be hitting the bong or anything silly like that and as I said as soon as it hits 234 you're gonna wash down any crystals that may be on the sides and then we remove it immediately from the heat place the lid on it and put it on your counter or a stone block and you're not going to touch it again until it's room temperature it is very important that it doesn't get agitated or moved in its cooling process because any agitation again can cause it to crystallize now if your sugar does start to crystallize at any point not a big not a huge deal put it on low heat re melted and it should be fine so as it's boiling while it's boiling into all the sugar melts the crystals can splash up onto the side so said just keep a very close eye and if you've got which imma call it screws here normally there's little bolts here on your pot where the handle make sure to clean around there because the sugar likes to hide in on those and the sugar also will gather behind the thermometer but I only tend to move that one time near the end of the cooking process because as I said you don't want to be agitating your sugar at all so when my syrup gets close to to 29 to 30 is when I will gently move the candy thermometer and wash the crystals off in and behind mat and then gently move it back all right so my temperatures now at 234 I like to actually let mine go to about 237 I like it a little bit thicker so at about 236 I'm gonna pull it because your sugar does still tend to and continue to increase once you pull it off the heat so we're at 235 236 I'm going to remove the candy thermometer turn off my burner remit place it over on my back burner here cuz it's nice and cool wash off any crystals that may be there for the last time be very careful and then you're gonna place your lid on it and you're not going to touch the syrup again until it reaches room temperature as soon as it reaches room temperature you can use it you can either store it on your counter or you can put it in the fridge for up to six months and the one thing is you can transfer it to another container however any time I've ever done that I have it ended up crystallizing I guess the agitation of moving it from one container to another so I just tend to leave it in the pot that I cook it in so I always recommend if you're gonna do that use a pot that it's not your favorite so that if your it's off to the side for a couple of months you're not gonna miss it so I basically designate one pot for my syrup so I'm not gonna miss that pot if I'm if I need it for in the next couple of months and that's it for inverted sugar making your own corn syrup so this said this is I use it quite often in place of my corn syrup it's great if you do not have access to a corn syrup easily or like places in the UK that you really don't have corn syrup you've got I think it's called a golden syrup I'm not sure but now you can easily make your own well I hope you enjoyed that little tutorial there on how to do your own inverted sugar thank you very much for watching you have a great so that's my little tutorial there on a regular gummies and sugar sour coated gummies I hope you enjoyed that as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments I'll get back to you as soon as they can I do apologize I do sometimes have a bit of a delay there I don't mean to but some life takes over sometimes but I do try to get back to everybody as I can and then here's our little of my little lemon and I did lemonade and or sorry kind of turned out like lemonade so there lemon and raspberry and these are there were little little puppies aren't they cute well good luck with your candy making and I'd love to hear how your how yours turned out and if you have any questions about the inverted sugar let me know and I hope you have an awesome rest of your day thank you so much for watching and if you're new here and you like the video I really do hope you subscribe take care have a wonderful awesome day [Music]", "uVrVyKUO5_c": "[Music] what's up friends welcome back today we have a little bit different video than you guys are used to so instead of giving you guys a exact follow the steps instructions this is gonna be more like you guys come along with me when i experiment so i like to try out different ways um that we can make different treats and a lot of times it turns out sometimes it doesn't um but i kind of just go with the flow and see what will happen i feel like no matter what you can always salvage your treats into something it may not be what you intended it to be but it'll always be delicious so for an example my intentions with this video was to create infused jolly ranchers and for them to be hard candy now that did not work out they ended up being a soft candy so i just kind of went with it and i thought it might be cool for you guys if you want to see my thought process and how i kind of decide to go with things when they go wrong so please let me know if you guys enjoyed this type of video or if you'd rather it be um here is like the guaranteed results from this step-by-step process [Music] all right let's get started here's what you're going to need some jolly ranchers or any hard candy that you enjoy some coconut oil or tincture citric acid and some infused sugar or regular sugar unwrap your jolly ranchers and then separate them into colors that you think would mix well once melted together i'm doing blue and green and the purple and reds now i'm setting up my double boiler and adding in my pink and red jolly ranchers they're mostly pink and i am using a total of 20 jolly ranchers now i'm adding in some lecithin and i'm just using my spatula because it is really hard to get off a spoon and then putting that back in and mixing it up now because i'm just doing a little experiment i decided that chamoy would taste really good with this jolly rancher mix since it's mostly all watermelon so i'm adding in two tablespoons of chamoy and then two tablespoons of infused sugar of course you could use regular sugar or you don't have to use chamoy i mean this is totally very flexible you can kind of flavor this to how you want you can put whatever creation you can come up with in there pretty much now i'm just waiting for this to melt over the double boiler it does take a long time i probably took about a half an hour to get to this point now that it's mostly melted i'm going to add in my coconut oil so i decided to add in three tablespoons there wasn't an exact reason for why i chose this amount it's just kind of like i said an experiment to see how it goes so we're going to mix that in and the oil is pretty tricky to combine with the mixture so i am going to use a whisk and just whisk that up really good just do it for a few minutes and it will come together very nicely and there is no problems getting this to emulsify just be persistent with stirring it until everything is nice and smooth like this so at this point it's pretty much ready to be refrigerated and like i said you guys can add whatever you like so if you want them to be very sour add some citric acid if you want them to have any sort of other flavor you know add it in anything is probably going to be just fine so then i now that this is all mixed together i'm going to pour it into a little dish because this is a smaller amount i'm just using a smaller dish so that i can get them to be thicker instead of very thin if they were spread out along a larger container this container had some grooves so i just filled it with some tinfoil so i could get the bottom to be flat and then place some wax paper inside of there um i had some issues with the wax paper if i was to do this again i would use parchment paper i just didn't have any on hand so then i'm going to pour this mixture into my little lined container and then i'm going to put it in the fridge to set i also just popped the little bubbles with a toothpick and then kind of just dropped it a bit to release any air bubbles um in the end because this turned out to be more like a starburst i didn't need to do that because i could have just squished it or molded it down with my finger okay so here it is after being in the fridge for probably about a half an hour and i was ready to score it because i was wanting these to be hard candy and you need to score these earlier on in the process so i'm just measuring it out and attempting to score it but it doesn't really hold my shape so i put it back in the fridge for another half an hour or so and then took it back out to score again and then i also sprayed my knife with some cooking spray so that it wouldn't stick now it's very malleable like i can reshape it really well and cutting it was fine but this was when i realized that this probably was no longer going to be a hard candy and it was going to be a soft candy so i cut all these shapes and then put them back in the fridge but they were kind of like they kept on molding back together so point being is that it needs to stay in the fridge a lot longer so i put them back in and then worked on making a coating for them so for these i thought they'd be absolutely delicious with a tahini coating so i started with one tablespoon of icing sugar one tablespoon of infused sugar and one tablespoon of tahini and then i tasted that and i felt like it needed more sugar so i added in some more sugar as well as some citric acid to make it more sour and then i tasted it again and it still felt like i wanted it to be quite a bit sweeter so i just added in the rest of my sugar and you guys there's no like exact measurements you just do this to what you think tastes good more sugar less sugar whatever you like and then i'm also going to grind this down in a food processor just to make it a little bit finer to coat my candies and then i poured it back into my container now these have been in the fridge for over an hour and while they were in there i'd go in with my knife and kind of just cut them so you can see they're still very squishy and like a soft candy nothing like a hard candy so that's a texture we're working with here now i'm just peeling them all off of this wax paper and you can see that it's stuck to the back of them quite a bit it was easy for me to get off but if i had used parchment paper there wouldn't have been that issue anyway so if you were to do this use parchment paper and not wax paper and then i separated them all and then put them into my tahin sour sugar coating and shook them all up then i put them back into the container as i was taking them out i could tell that they were very soft so i knew that these weren't going to be the type of gummies that were going to hold or not gummies the soft candies that were going to hold their shape outside of the fridge now that i've made these i've realized that in order to keep them out of the fridge we're going to need to add gelatin so let me know if you guys would like to see me do a recipe like that um but they look so good and of course i had to try one and they were so tasty like the watermelon jolly rancher chewiness with the sour sugary tahin coating and then the chamoy and the watermelon like i don't even know how i can explain how delicious that was but like so good now we're gonna do our batch of blue and greens using our tincture um these take forever to melt oh my goodness so yeah i left them on here for probably like a half an hour and then they finally were melting and make sure you guys are checking on the water in your double boiler i found that my water was going down fast and i constantly had to re-add it so just make sure you have enough water in there all the time okay so now after this has melted quite a bit i'm going to add in my tincture so we're doing one two three tablespoons and then to compensate for the extra liquid we're adding in three tablespoons of sugar i'm just using regular sugar because i don't know why i think i ran out of infused sugar anyways we're mixing that in and now we're going to add in some lecithin and i'm going to use my whisk to get that since we need to whisk this all together to get everything to emulsify so just stir that all up and get it to mix together and then i want these to be really sour because sour blue raspberry green apple like that's a good combination am i right okay so citric acid mix that in i had the candy thermometer in here because i was trying to make hard candy so we had to bring it to a certain temperature to allow that to happen um but in the end i realized it was not going to reach that temperature so i decided these are also going to be soft juice um which means i'm going to also add in some coconut oil so i'm just doing one tablespoon of this i could probably have added more but i just wanted to try using a little bit less since the three in the last recipe was a little bit soft now i'm adding in even more citric acid because i want these to be super sour like i've said before these recipes are extremely flexible if you're just making these for yourself it's not going to hurt if it's not exactly perfect every time if you're making these for other people then that's a different story but it's always fun to experiment um this is my favorite part of making all these treats okay now that we have the coconut oil in there we're mixing that all together and it's coming together very very nicely we just have to keep whisking it to make sure it's all mixed together you can see it looks nice and smooth and now we're pouring it into the same type of system the little container with the wax paper again because i don't have any parchment paper and then i'm putting it in the fridge i had intended to come back for this an hour or so later but it ended up sitting in the fridge for a couple of days because i got too busy to continue with them so now here we are with our refrigerated mixture slab i took it out of the fridge and then i let it sit for about 20 minutes to kind of soften it up so you can obviously tell the fact that it softens up at a warmer temperature means these need to stay in the fridge again it would u uh we would need to use gelatin to make them stay stable at um or to hold their shape at room temperature and if you guys are interested in me doing a video like that let me know this is just an experiment like i said a few times already so anyways so i just cut them up into these little shapes and then i put them in a container with some sugar and a little sprinkle of citric acid shook them up and then i put them back in the fridge so that was all we needed to make both of those and they were so good now let's talk about how they turned out taste wise okay so i'm just eating them while i'm talking so i can explain so first of all don't put them in the freezer because they'll get kind of wet on the outside just keep them in the fridge this green one it's sour green apple and blue raspberry the flavor is literally amazing they go so well together and the sourness is perfect [Music] that is really really good like i really like that it is very soft though it's not as chewy as like a starburst it's much much softer like very like your teeth just like go right into it so i mean maybe if you eat them in the fridge it'd be a little bit chewier but i let mine sit out um so i could see how well they would do i think it's about 24 degrees in my apartment so if the air conditioning was on i probably could get away with keeping them out of the fridge okay now we're going to try the watermelon cherry chun way one so it definitely is mostly watermelon only a little bit of cherry and we can really taste the watermelon chamois which one is really good i think the only thing i would change to the watermelon one is to do more of a sugar coating like i did for the green one um i just kind of want that like really like sour sugar to contrast the sweetness of the watermelon chamois um it is pretty oily but only on your fingers you can't really like taste the oiliness overall i rate the watermelon choi one seven out of ten and then the green one i would literally rate like a nine point five out of ten it was like so so so good i think it's gonna put some citric acid in it as well but both of them are good if i could do anything different aside from the sugar i would also add gelatin so they could be shelf stable but i don't mind keeping in the fridge anyways i hope you guys enjoyed this video please let me know if you did leave a comment below give us a thumbs up and subscribe thank you guys so much for watching i hope you have a wonderful day", "68grx1czDhY": "[Music] [Music] yes everyone dr sean miravichy here and welcome to a very special edition of dr shawn's cannabis product reviews i'm here on bass lake in beautiful muskoka here in northern ontario and what better setting to do a product review than this you know here on the dock on the lake and so let's uh let's get to it what i've done is i brought a few cannabis products that i haven't tried up with me to the cottage and so today i'm going to be trying the afirma peach gummy so a little bit of a back story about afroma they are a brand under the license producer uh i forgot the name title health solutions they're located in new brunswick this gummy is 10 milligrams of thc it retails for seven dollars 68 cents on the ontario cannabis store i actually picked mine up at my local dispensary miss jones where it was nine dollars so a little bit of a mark up there but i guess you are if you're just buying one or two items uh you save on the shipping costs uh rather than buying it on the ontario cannabis store you can go into a dispensary save on the shipping costs uh there will be a little bit of a markup but you know it all kind of balances out i you know my my thinking is if you're buying a whole bunch of items it makes more sense to purchase off the ontario cannabis store but if you're only buying one or two items uh probably more uh worth it to go into a local dispensary and buy them there okay back to the product so the extract in this edible is made from a hybrid strain and what's uh unique about this product and i guess afroma in general is they're using a full spectrum extract meaning that while you have thc in there you're going to have all the minor cannabinoids from the original plant you're going to have the terpenes and the flavonoids in there as well so i'm actually a big fan of full spectrum extracts because you have this entourage effect or the synergy happening between all the different cannabinoids and the terpenes and the flavonoids which in turn help the help prolong the effect of the thc and the cannabinoids as well as mitigating some of the side effects of the cannabinoids so it's it's always going to be the best result when you go with a full spectrum or even a broad spectrum extract tidal health solutions and afroma they also have a couple other flavors so this is the peach flavor but they have a grape a sour cherry a watermelon and i think i've got them all they also do topicals and they have some dried flour as well okay so let's get into it i haven't so this is going to be a different sort of format because i haven't even opened it i haven't tried it yet so what i'm going to do is i'm going to open the package i'm going to try it i'll tell you about the flavor right off the bat and then i'll wait until the effects set in and i'll take it from there so i'll give you some information about how long it took for the effects to set in and how long they're lasting can't really control for airplane noise so i apologize if you hear that in the background okay typical of most uh gummies and edibles that come in a package like this you'll have to peel off the top there'll be sort of a perforated area indicating where to peel from so we'll do that in there here's the duties paid sticker so now you know it's illegal uh all right now these are the tricky zip lock systems um so there's a child safety lock so a little bit harder to open than your typical zip lock so i'm going to do my best to get that open i sort of like to dig in and tack it as best as i can from the top there we go all right got that open so yeah with these things there's uh if you go for the top area of the ziploc that's the easiest place to get it open from all right so it's kind of uh of sad looking inside let me see if i can show you guys ah there's one lonely gummy in there i'll take it out there it is there's your peach gummy right there uh looks like there's some sugar crystals on the outside um it's very soft and it's quite flat okay let's try it out so good consistency it's not too chewy i've had edibles that basically break your jaw they're so chewy this is good the flavor is really full body so you do get that peach flavor but you definitely get a strong hit of a sort of cannabis like a bit of the bitterness the terpenes the oils really sort of hits you after the first couple chews so don't expect this to be a super sweet one-dimensional peach flavor you definitely get hit with the canvas flavor in there which you know i've commented on in other videos can be a good thing can be a bad thing those people who are new to cannabis and might throw them off a little bit they're not used to that flavor but those that are quite familiar with canvas might like it because you know it definitely brings that cannabis flavor forward and you get to experience all the different subtle notes of the terpenes in there okay so that is that and we'll see how long this takes to have effect right now it is 11 25 a.m and i'll be back and let you know how long this took to have its effect just lost the package all right i'll see you soon [Music] oh hey guys i'm back so it's been about five hours since i took the edible the onset came on pretty quickly like within about 30 minutes i started really feeling the effects and i would say it peaked for me at around an hour and a half after taking the gummy and the effects lasted until very recently so i would say a good like four to five hour stretch the effects were also pretty hard-hitting like this one was pretty powerful one of the most hard-hitting uh edibles that i've tried and maybe that's due in part to the entourage effect of that full spectrum extract i don't know but um so i'm going to have to rate this let's see so it all in all really good product i would say that you know for nine dollars like at a dispensary it was around seven dollars from the ocs i would say it's a touch pricey but either than that really good effect uh really hard hitting good length of time the taste was you know it's going to be such an individual thing like i didn't mind it but it's gonna throw off some people for sure so i'm gonna take one off um for taste and one off for price so i'm gonna give this one a solid eight out of ten so that's it for now dr sean signing off i'll be back with another product review for you shortly please as always if you like these reviews if you find them helpful if you want to see more reviews better reviews please subscribe to my channel really motivates me to get working for you guys so i'll see you soon", "LMTzxpmUDlA": "hi everyone you all are having a big day today okay retake hi everyone I just kind of wanted to make this

never ever tried this before so that's kind of why I decided to make a video on this because since I haven't tried them before I 150 percent honest opinion on them as far as flavor goes as far as experience and all these things I really personally I have a pretty high tolerance for someone my size and weight normally I consume around like 20 to 30 milligrams depending on the edible I know some people take like 1,500 I'm not rich for myself I'm just trying to enjoy myself I just want to live up to my eyebrows how is that not something that everyone so I got these per recommendation of my pleasure I was like I need medical it taste it and that's going to be infected a hundred milligrams of THC and the entire thing each piece is 10 milligrams there's 10 pieces so [Applause] okay we're just gonna pour some my hand and see how that goes okay Oh baby we're gonna go for four is a good number I'll try to pull myself we're gonna messed up a little bit by getting pineapple I don't know why it's available in our shower they're pretty sweet they taste good don't get me wrong but I just don't think I that was it for me [Music] - now they don't taste like wheat okay don't get it twisted it tastes really really good just makes me when structures eat one two three dummies okay guys so I'm going to tie myself 45 minute they not 45 minutes I'm going to be doing my foundation I'm going to do contouring pretty much going to be doing everything besides my eyebrows a little buster [Music] so I went to the and they found I found cotton candy this is honestly the best thing that could happen I started getting hired like 2025 minutes and it has only been significantly up from there I'm supposed to be doing the eyebrow that's right I decided to sit down for this because when I was getting super high I was just like enough this sucks why not set make things easier for myself so I have this product it [Music] my bread my powder Brett brow powder duo who's just so hard to say I've used this quite a few times ladies this little end it's like a as you can contrast I forgot it has an angled edge chicken the spoolie side so [Music] okay there see where the angle is handy now [Music] I'm so into this eyebrow right now it just goes to show how good the eyes I mean so just happy and like just having a good time I hate pizza right before the comic and and oh my god it only took me like 10 minutes to my favorite so evident the good thing about like doing your eyebrows is you can just like go back in there as long as you have please blend it out later so don't be afraid to say this is so sad immediately is dark the very bargain it's okay hope you find one we'll see what happens with this one okay let's get it [Music] - like I'm Kris [Music] maybe the tail is essential Oh [Music] okay so now this is also a very crucial step you have to outline your eyebrows with like get this [ __ ] together I promise that's a huge issue me out there she's gonna have faith in the process okay [Music] my [Music] so we're going in on the top crusty dusty trusty PT blender this is honestly a really important step because it just changes everything it makes it look so much more [Music] [Music] it really is just like life-changing just like it's a whole different I really like this really wise [Music] [Music] so the answer was bullet that's all see the continued struggle so I want [Music] it has work point to me and I see supposedly they're made with all-natural ingredients they definitely tastes like pineapple there since me and they were so light but I expected them to a little bit more sour just because for some reason I know I thought there were sour gummy is a sentiments so they're made with agar locust bean gelatin glucose cane sugar closed strings citric acid capsule and not just it contains you know food allergies whatsoever however are not vegan they don't stay organic they're definitely not kosher but they need all the requirements like their lot tested free of metals [Music] Oh two hours later everywhere yeah I think this is better than I know that there's CVT in years [Music] one of the best combinations you can do and I can I [Music] really like they see this on the party [Music] [Music] [Music] wait huh is purple [Music] this is like a cute I hope you enjoy this video as much as if you know did I enjoy it though you know when you guys thought in the video under the honking time other brothers [Music]", "HUb6baa_ym4": "hey guys welcome back to my channel I hope you guys are having a good day you know what I mean like I'm so sorry for my wheel being in the way but um here's the thing I can't do anything about it because I don't have my tripod my tripod broke I try to get a tripod the other day and they didn't have any for some reason so I'm guessing I need to either order one online or just somewhere else I don't know what to really do about it but right now you're just gonna have to kind of deal with this I couldn't move it but then I'm gonna be like up here to video so I don't know what you guys would prefer see I'm saying like I just don't have any like flat oh that kind of worked okay okay we're gonna roll with it anyway so today I'm doing a quick little review on an edible eye balm I love edibles I mean I love him but at the same time they're deadly to me they're strong girl I took a edible for 4/20 it was the la familia hot chocolate one I took the whole thing and that thing smacked so today I didn't really want like a chocolate or like a brownie I wanted something like more candy like so I got the Smokies edible and these are in the sour blueberry fruit shoes basically so it's a hundred milligrams there's two milligrams of CBD per not per actually the whole bag is I guess that's what it is now per serving it's 10 milligrams of THC so per gummy and then 2 milligrams of CBD in one little gummy so I'm not gonna do the whole thing and by the way you guys this review is going to be really really [ __ ] forward really honest I'm gonna tell you guys about the taste I haven't opened these or anything yet so I want to record like my reaction of like the taste that I get instead of like trying them and then coming back and then you know my thoughts would be kind of you know what I mean so yeah anyways these are vegan this is a vegan uh thing not all of them are weakened from this brand so if you are vegan and you know you stay away from Dairy and stuff so I'll definitely ask them which one is the vegan one because I know not all of them are vegan but I know that their dairy they're gluten-free all of them are gluten-free but not all of them are vegan so I just got this because of the flavor you know what I mean so I'm not vegan so it doesn't matter to me but it's a good thing that it is vegan so I don't mind it and I don't really care so yes so the ingredients on here is just sugar corn syrup pectin I don't know what that is but it is citrus acid natural and artificial flavoring FD&C blue one which is probably like the color of the candy soy let union I don't know and then cannabis extract so the weed basically you know so yeah the sugars in this is four grams I'm thinking yeah per piece it's four grams so if I'm gonna have three of them for 12 grams of sugar when you do the math it's kind of a lot so these are sour they're Fruit Chews had crafted gluten free vegan and so I watched a review on these and people said that only 40 will do the trick I'm gonna try 30 just because I want to see how I feel and if I don't feel it as much I'm so sorry about the [ __ ] Sun oh my god but if you don't feel it as much then I guess well if I don't feel it as much because you're not going to taking them I am but if you don't feel it as much then I'll take then I'll take another one pretty pretty much but I know how adipose are they sneak up on me I keep eating them like I eat them and then I keep eating them and then boom you know so these were $21.99 okay before attacks at my dispensary so I think with tags and all the little bag they charge me for because I've got to break minds it was like $25 so basically it's really easy to open I just rip this up hopefully it's easy to open it cuz I haven't even opened it yet already strong it's kind of like this there's like a little this in here and I'm guessing you pull that apart and they open up they smell like blueberry literally like [ __ ] they smell like powder aid okay you guys the blue powder right that's what they smell like I totally spot on that's what I'm getting and they look really cute and like flat and big oh they're soft they're like super gooey look at all that little sugar let me just you know I'm saying basically they're just coated in sugar they're sour they're pretty big I would say they're like as big as a [ __ ] let me see some money up in here so this is a quarter and then they're a little bit bigger than a quarter even so okay you guys so I'm gonna try one and I'm gonna see you in like a week [Music] mm-hmm gather my thoughts okay so I'll say this they taste really good they have they're sweet they are sweet you know I'm saying like I'm not really like a candy person but I like gummies and like sour stuff so I can make an exception but they're really good I had one of these they don't taste like we do know what I'm talking about you know when you take some edibles and they have that weird like nasty aftertaste of the weed you know you can you feel on the back your throat and all that I don't get it with these ones so I'm gonna take another one this is gonna be my number two you know I'm gonna take the three in front of you guys so you guys know what's real and I'll check back in with like in an hour and two I got some laundry to do so I'm gonna be a little bit busy and then they're just gonna hit me like a truck and I'm gonna be gone you know what I mean I don't know I hope so I hope these are strong they were saying these were strong so they better be so this is gonna be twenty you know what I'm saying these are really good you guys like even if they didn't have ween in it I would probably eat them they're kind of like okay they're like a sour patch kit all most like they kind of remember that but they're not as sour they're like they're like up from sourness it's like a good five it's it's the perfect amount it's honestly good with this week and see what I mean so I'm gonna eat one more you know I'm saying well you know we get lead tea today [Music] he was a [ __ ] fly in here anyways these are really good I wish they had like a pack where they had like all the little flavors that would be really dope like you know they had blueberry rhinos berry that would be mom like a little mixed assorted pack but yeah so I've had if I'm gonna have three out of like seven left so that's 70 grams seven milligrams so basically I'm ready to eat another one this is gonna be thirty and I will check back with you guys and an hour or I think on the back it tells you yeah wait two hours so I'm gonna wait two hours and I think he's gonna give me pretty lip but I don't know because I'm not smoking at the time maybe I will smoke a bowl but I'm not gonna like smoke because I feel like when you smoke weed and you take edibles it's both of them combined and it's just too much so I'm really trying to see how strong these are going to be just with 30 milligrams and if you guys the real tea on this you know I'm going to eat the last one and then I'm gonna go and go do my little [ __ ] wash my drawers and then I'll be back and then I'll tell you guys how they are so yep sure yeah of course chuckles you guys but I told you guys I did a little bun you know what I mean it's like a tank guys so it's like eight o'clock now I took those three edibles at 6:00 it was kind of like noise in there but anyways there's six it's been like two hours I smoked a bowl I'm not really feeling it all that much so I'm gonna wait until like 20 more minutes see if it kicks in and then if not I'll take another alignment so then I'm gonna give it the complete fill out two hours so you know it's good at all so we'll see but if not I'm gonna take one more or maybe two more to see if it's gonna hit me later but yeah that was 30 milligrams and it's been like an hour and 40 minutes I don't really feel anything but I'm gonna wait 20 more minutes because you know how they are they hit out of nowhere so I'll be back with you guys I'm kind of talking fast I'm not trying to but it's just a quick update you don't even a brief summary so I'll be back and I'll see you in a bit hey y'all so it's an update it's been I think a day or so two days I don't know when I recorded that video but basically I'm here to give my initial and final final thoughts you guys about that edible the was it the sour blue raspberry by Smokies the gummies the Fruit Chews to be exact you guys they were [ __ ] smacking okay when I had the 40 milligram that night oh my god was I gone was like on I kept [ __ ] eating I didn't really felt them like hitting me like instantly instantly but I felt like they really creeped up little by little and I also feel like it took a little bit longer for 40 milligrams to hit me it took like I would say to and I have hours and then I was just like Munchie [ __ ] madness you know I was eating anything I was just eating chips food I ate even after my dinner like have some snacks if you're gonna eat some edibles because trust you're gonna need up and then what's getting pulled in here okay and then I took 50 milligrams that I think the day after okay I took 50 milligrams and that actually hit me a little bit sooner I would say that one they fit me I don't know why maybe like maybe because the timing that I took them at I feel like the first time I took the 40 milligram I took it at like 4 to 5 so it was like kind of late afternoon already so you know it girl was tired she was doing her SH and she was tired but the second time when I took it I took it earlier in the day I took it out like 2 o'clock because I wanted to be like awake and [ __ ] at least enjoy my high you know so I took the 15 milligrams and on this sweet so I took him I took him I'm chillin literally I would say two hours later two hours and ten minutes later it hit me I was at Walmart I was grabbing some things and that [ __ ] hit me like a brick like oh my god I was literally in one of the aisles and I was just [ __ ] dying you guys and I know you guys don't really care because don't everybody feels that way but I was legit like [ __ ] dying like over nothing and I was just like the [ __ ] but I realized that okay the edible so I know decided it's my cool I left Walmart and then even when I was home after that my boyfriend looked at me and he was like you're [ __ ] what did you do like I guess I was that [ __ ] high guys but I was like I just knew what it was you know to me that I didn't feel like I looked that [ __ ] high but I guess to somebody that you know from their point of view they would get it but um yeah to me I was really [ __ ] high but still productive so I would recommend taking them on like a very like good day that you're not gonna do [ __ ] you're gonna be eating a lot you're on your own time definitely don't do it if you're gonna go into work or something like that it's noticeable if you're high you know what I mean it is for me so my eyes got a little they got sleepy they got a little low they got red so you know but you guys the edibles smack I totally recommend them I'm going to try other flavors you guys I'm gonna do more reviews on this monkey's fan because I think it's probably one of the good ones okay really good really good so I've been totally gonna recommend to you'll I haven't tried other flavors but I definitely like the sour blue raspberry because I'm a sour person so you know I like sour candy so they were really my cup of tea so if you guys are into that I definitely recommend these edibles so that is my review you guys I don't want to keep going on and on and on but the same thing basically I rate him a 10 the taste is a 9 out of 10 the potency is a 10 out of 10 because I was gone with 40 so that's good because you can literally take 40 40 and then maybe the other two before work because it's like okay they're not gonna hit you as hard at vicious 20 milligrams you know what not as me as hard but like so like 42 like 60 it's like the perfect range for me yours might be a little different so I don't know so be careful but your dosage and all that dogs barking so I'm just gonna go and yeah you guys have a good day I'll see you on my next one bye bye", "eKQgJR39ofI": "hey everyone Robert here and today I will be explaining how to dose cannabis edibles for personal use this video is intended for those who are 18 and up and caution should be exercised when using animals as well as storing them this video is designed for personal use and it's not professional advice but moreso tips and tricks I have learned myself if at any point in time you're enjoying this video feel free to hit that like button and subscribe for more content like this so the first thing that we need to cover quickly is cannabinoids there are three main cannabinoids THC CBD and terpenes THC or tetrahydrocannabinol is the psychoactive part of cannabis and will cause the high most people associated with cannabis CBD or cannabidiol is the non psychoactive part of cannabis which carries well-known medical effects terpenes are responsible for the smell and flavor of cannabis and have their own effects but are non psychoactive for the most part optimally you want a combination of THC CBD and terpenes for the best experience whether for medical or recreational use otherwise known as the entourage effect in this episode I will be discussing THC for the most part but it also applies to see with the intervenes the exact same way for example if I mentioned 20% THC the same applies to 20% CBD or 20% terpenes making edibles in figuring out dosages can be challenging so I will be covering two examples of how to dose in edible the first example will be if you have lab tests in material and the second example will be if you have untested material if you live in a state like California or Colorado lab testing of cannabis products is required for retail sale this is a great way to control the safety of cannabis in regards to pesticides molds and other harmful issues but also serves as an education tool for patients and recreational users one of the issues of cannabis testing is that it is not standardized yet meaning that THC CBD and terpene tests that you're receiving may be higher or lower than the product truly contains some brands will market their total cannabinoids as the THC percentage which can throw off consumers so make sure that you read any tests you may have access to carefully to ensure that you have the right numbers so for this example I will be talking about Hades og Hades og has 20 1.07 percent THC and 0.04 percent CBD program once again this is a rough approximate not every cannabis flower has the same cannabinoids and some tests may not be accurate but we will use this as a solid approximation for our edible dosage to calculate your cannabis into milligrams of THC multiply the percentages that you have by 10 will move the decimal point one point to the right this Haidee srg for example would have approximately 210 point 7 milligrams of THC program and about 0.4 milligrams of CBD program if I were to infuse a gram with this Hades og with a cup of butter my cup of water would have approximately 211 milligrams of THC and a half a milligram of CBD if I were to infuse 10 grams of this ad 13 with a cup of butter that cup of butter would have approximately 2100 and 7 milligrams of THC and about 4 milligrams of CBD this applies to all cannabis products you have whether it is flour hash Keef wax or trim if you have a lab test a gram of shatter at 80 percent THC for example that is 800 milligrams of THC per gram in some cases you may not have access to lab testing where you may not trust the results that you were given in this case I refer to important TC percentages as follows flour is between 10 and 30 percent THC Keef is between 20 and 40 percent THC hash is between 30 and 50 percent THC and waxes between 50 and 90 percent THC on average flour is 20 percent THC Keef is 30 percent THC hash is 40 percent THC and wax is 70 percent THC these are rough approximations for each product and some products may be higher or lower than the range as I mentioned for the most part these are good starting guidelines for most medical and recreational users so for example if I had 10 grams of hash I would approximately 4000 milligrams of THC in the finished infusion 5 grams of flour would be about 1000 milligrams and 2 grams of wax would be about fourteen hundred milligrams first off I need to mention the edibles can take anywhere between twenty minutes to three hours to fully kick in and edibles definitely hit harder than your average joint or bong run if you have eaten anything else that day that will also have an effect when the adipose potency as well as a handful of other factors so it is best to start off with a low dose wait an hour then increase is necessary in the United States the suggested single dose for an adult over twenty one is between five and ten milligrams of THC this means if you make a 100 milligram edible that by a state's definition is between 10 and 20 doses of THC if you are introducing a cup of butter of THC and have a cookie recipe which calls for 1/4 cup of butter and makes 12 cookies they would aim to have 480 milligrams per cup or approximately 2.4 grams of cannabis flower that would end up producing 4 batches of 12 10 milligram cookies so you could have a few over a couple hours and being able to control the dosing safely but like most things those dosages don't apply to everyone while I certainly suggest starting off at 5 milligrams for 10 milligrams for an everyday user this would almost be micro dosing prior to legalization in California there are four main doses of edibles 100 milligrams 250 milligrams 500 milligrams and 1000 milligrams some companies offered 2.5 milligram micro dose edibles and some companies offered 10,000 milligram edibles that would leave in a weed coma for a week the reality is your dose may be anywhere between 5 milligrams and 1000 milligrams or even higher but you need to work your way up slowly 500 milligrams and 1000 milligram doses are typically considered medical doses and are great for pain and other similar ailments and were utilized quite heavily prior to recreational legalization 100 milligrams is my go to dose per cookie as I can eat more or less as I see fit just as a quick background I have been smoking every day for a few years I suggest new users start off at 5 or 10 milligrams than 550 milligrams 100 milligrams 200 milligrams between 50 milligrams 500 milligrams and then 1000 make sure to space the edibles out at least one hour in between and only bump the dosage if the last experience then give you the desired facts for example if you go and buy a 10 pack of 10 milligram edibles go home and eat one an hour later you do not feel the effects as desired so yeah another 10 milligram animal and they get it in another hour next time you should start off with a 50 milligram edible then see how you feel out for an hour before consuming a second one once again this video is a personal suggestion and should be used only as an approximate guideline for dosing edibles for personal use make sure to keep your edibles and infusions out of reach of children and exercise caution after consuming any edibles but that being said I hope everyone has a wonderful day and if you have any questions feel free to post them below", "y-UlV_CJ-NA": "i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little [Music] hey and i know you guys are like sick and tired of me disappearing for months on end i legit have been gone for a month even after i said i was going to start recording again i've just ultimately realized like at least for me and my life and my health i i just have to do things when i want to do them and i've learned that in my relationships my friendships like you got to let people go when you want to not when it's good for them and put out good things you know when you have the energy to do so so i am finally feeling like i have the energy to record again and i figured why not give you guys something fun obviously this video is going to be about me trying edibles for the very first time but backstory i have never smoked before i've never smoked i've never legit done any drug ever like nothing ever every time i mentioned to somebody that i haven't smoked before they're like why like i'm 26 years old never smoked before you know nugs not drugs kids nugs not drugs i've always been interested in trying edibles or um shrooms weird enough i actually just watched a documentary i think called psychedelic on netflix i'm not sure what the documentary is called but i have just always been interested and i guess an easier high where you can just eat something and experience it i genuinely think this is probably going to be the first and last time but i mean who knows like sorry mom i know you're probably watching this it's so funny because everybody including my mom including my dad literally everybody i know has smoked before everybody has done something before i literally have done nothing so i figured why not make my first experience memorable and share it with you guys so the big sour patch kids are the highest milligram that i got it's 150 milligrams i don't even know how milligrams work i don't even know like how much wheat is what i remember getting weed for a guy that i know a couple years ago and literally i got it wrong and he ended up like losing money i guess because i got the wrong amount and i was like i don't know how this works like i legit have never done drugs so yeah this is 150 milligrams whatever that means thing that i got was the red velvet chips ahoy honestly this i got just because i was like this sounds delicious like i've never tried red velvet chips ahoy and they're soft and i was like oh like it's gonna be good so i got that that's 175 milligrams last thing that i got were hot cheetos and these are 75 milligrams two um again i don't know how much milligram is what i just know that i was like i'm gonna get the things that i would actually eat this ain't going lowest the highest but he said cookies then cheetos then the gummies um and he said you're a virgin my [ __ ] is rockin um and then he said don't eat all of anything and then he said i'd love to come check on you he actually asked me about a boyfriend i spent 60 dollars um i can put the prices of each thing up on the screen like right here um but it wasn't crazy expensive been around wheat my whole life i just have chose not to um so i know what weed smells like wow okay yeah the gummies definitely have the highest amount [Music] okay i'm hoping somewhere between 30 minutes and an hour something happens i don't even know what high feels like so i don't know if i'm even gonna notice but we'll see so i'm doing this much one cookie oh i'm gonna do two cookies so i guess two cookies i mean i definitely i definitely think if these were on the counter i wouldn't notice that there was wheat in it i mean it's definitely like it tastes like a cookie i'm kind of like noticed doing this much of the other cookie all right i'm cozy guys i'm over here thinking i'm like my mom's probably gonna be more mad about me eating on her couch than she is about me doing drugs all right hot cheetos i really just want to taste these i'm really not gonna eat a lot of these i think that much don't feel like that's enough what if i end up like i didn't take enough and then like i don't even notice y'all i don't taste it at all but these are good like i honestly haven't had hot cheetos in a minute because i don't really eat chips like that like when i eventually do want chips i do end up getting hot cheetos but i really don't eat chips like that so these just taste good i don't think maybe because they're hot you taste it a lot less had you not told me not to eat all of these i probably would have eaten the entire bag of these hot cheetos okay [Music] i haven't had hot cheetos in a minute y'all these are good and lastly the big sour patch kids i think i'm gonna do three he said don't eat all of anything but he said i could have a few so i'm thinking three they're like this size you see that they're like this size this tastes good they don't have a wee taste at all honestly i don't feel like any of these really have wheat taste like i know it's in here so i'm looking for it but i legit feel like if you just said it on the counter you would not like pay attention to it guys this is going to be so good just for the simple fact that i don't eat things like this like i really don't eat candy like that i really don't eat chips like that i really like you know my weight gain my weight eating came from food honey i'm like one of those people that be like oh i want a midnight snack but i want some ribs it won't be no like simple snack all right last one yo this one looks like two in one this last sour patch so i did three sour patch about a little palm full of hot cheetos and two cookies so i'm gonna check back with you guys i'm also actually video chat my friend so hopefully it doesn't get again when i'm on my conversation but we're gonna see so wish me luck i'm gonna see you guys in a minute so it has been 30 minutes so right now it is 206 i took the edibles whatever at 1 35 so we're 30 minutes in and i don't feel anything the one thing though that my best friend i actually told my best friend i was doing this video right before nicki if you're watching this hello she just um messaged me on instagram and she was like girl don't take more like less is more so we're 30 minutes in i'm just going to check back in an hour i've literally just been on i was let's say facetime but i'm in i'm team android right now so um

but yeah so i'm just going to keep checking in with you guys every 30 minutes and see if i feel higher um i don't know if it's gonna work for me i just feel like when you haven't smoked before maybe like my body's like especially because i'm one of those like whatever i really don't care about being high and feeling this and escaping the world i'm like i love my life i love my job i love everything that's going on with me and my life the disrespect on video chat but whatever so anyway um yeah i just feel like when i'm a person that like doesn't i guess care about it or really believe in it or want it to work i'm like i wonder if it's just not gonna work for me because my body's just i mean i've legit just been watching tv and on video chat so again we'll check back in all right so [Music] i originally told you guys i was going to um check back in at 2 30 5 2 35 all right so it's 4 42 right now and i'm like i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like

because i was on um i was on video chat and um i was eating this mango and a fly was in the kitchen on the floor and it literally like jumped like a frog and it kind of threw me all off guard but um

that i'm not high so i can't okay no it's like i can't get anything out like what the heck okay it's weird because like i'm i'm here and i recognize like what's going on but i don't know why everything's like funny okay everything just got really funny and i'm freaked out because i have to legit drive to get my mom so my mom's at um i dropped her off this morning and i have to go get her and i'm like i don't know like i don't know it came on in a matter of like 15 minutes because when i definitely looked at the clock and i was like oh there's eight minutes until i have to tell them if i'm feeling high or not and um then everything got funny and i was like oh shoot like legit that hit me really fast i didn't even know if i was still recording or not okay the feeling of high i don't know like i legit walked upstairs to get my charger and then i couldn't focus and i felt my brain was like not focusing um but yeah the most thing that i noticed the most the thing that i noticed the most was just that my heart i've been able to feel my heart like like my heart um i can feel it like i can feel my heart through my body the main thing that i feel like i just i'm talking a lot more and i feel like my thought process is just like this all over the place i don't know i don't know why that's like a feeling people would want to get because like while i'm feeling this right now i feel like i'm right now i'm on an even mindset i'm understanding i'm recording youtube video and then i need to stop talking because i'm on video chat and this is supposed to be like a short explanation and i just can't stop talking but i recognize that this is what i'm doing right now like i'm i am doing this right now but um i'm just gonna check back in with you like but i just don't know if i like this feeling like i am acknowledging that i'm recording this i'm acknowledging that it's for a reason but my brain is just like going on everything but um yeah so i'm going to check back in in about 30 minutes we'll see i've been recording for five minutes i feel like that's a really long time it's a really long time um so my next check in i'm gonna make it try and try make it short and sweet and yeah talk to y'all in a little bit hey guys right now it is 3 51 and i definitely feel like i have experienced the high i guess i didn't think that it'd feel like this i don't know like genuinely i felt like the entire time all i've felt like is actually i'm gonna look at myself just because it's helping me focus a little bit more looking at something um but i feel like i didn't expect it to feel like this i i just felt like i kept saying things that were so honest and i was like oh like i should start you know being quiet and it just was not i would not stop talking so yeah everything um was cool it just i guess this is just not how i experienced or thought i was gonna be experiencing it it's just really weird i don't i actually don't like it and i don't know why people get high like i would not want this feeling again i don't know i guess i thought like high like when i see people they're like chill you know sit back and share whatever like they feel good or like i guess some people get high and get like hype but i just feel like i feel so outside my body and like uncomfortable and like i just felt like i kept on saying things that i didn't want to say for the past hour which had been eating talking on the phone and then i got off the phone everything was funny a minute ago like i did not i guess that's when i noticed that i was high as like my brain just doesn't feel like it's fully functioning how it should function right now um and then all of a sudden it got really sad like five minutes ago like i don't know it's just like a sad feeling but i don't know if i'm sad because i'm like i really wish i didn't do this like like that might be why like i'm kind of sad about that like i was having a conversation with somebody and not able to understand like what was going on i mean i get it like we were having a conversation but like some of the conversation i just felt like i don't know like i was definitely talking and saying things that were like overly truthful and my mouth was moving but i'm like shut up like stop talking right now um and that's not a good feeling like when you're when you're aware that you're not coherent enough for the conversation you're having i feel like that's i mean that's i don't understand why people would want to feel that maybe just feel outside your head i don't know if like your person who doesn't really think much then maybe getting high will make you think more but i feel like i think a lot and i'm very focused normally so to feel very not focused and scatterbrained and looking at everything that you know pops up um i don't know like that feeling i don't know i guess that's why i've never done anything like this or done anything like drug related it's because i feel like if there's no reason for you to be doing it then don't do it like if you're watching this video even though like i'm recording it to show an experience don't think it's cool or like this is fire like this is not i don't know i guess it was like a funny video idea but i also wish that i didn't even do it like i don't know i just feel really sad i feel like i feel like that sadness is just me like realizing that i just shouldn't have shouldn't have done this um but yeah so it is three three it's 3 56 so um i thought i was going to check in at 3 35 i think last time but um i think i'm going to check back in around 4 35 like 4 30 or 5-ish just see i mean how i'm feeling then ultimately like it's really weird because all i'm thinking is how long is this going to last like i don't know i just don't get why people do this like i mean i have definitely um i guess they say that you should do it with someone for somebody to babysit you i was on video chat i mean no one's in my house right now but um i was on video chat but i just felt like i don't know i don't i don't i don't know i felt like once i got off the phone it was when i noticed um i don't know more aware of things like the way things felt in my body and i don't know i just don't like this i don't like it i feel like looking at myself in the viewfinder is helping me focus but i feel like i don't know my brain is definitely just like why did i do this that's why you don't do drugs kids it's honestly not even the hype that people made it this isn't like a good feeling like being high it's like i like being calm and coherent and you know not feeling outside my body and i guess a lot of people do it to get outside like if they're not happy or they want to feel a boost of probably serotonin and serotonin that's um in your body that like releases you to be happy um i don't know like this doesn't feel like that it just feels like a little bit like i'm outside my body and i'm um not myself and i actually really enjoy being naughty in my my daily life so um i don't know i wondered like if edibles like the high that you get is like different from when you smoke i don't ever plan on smoking like i don't know if you've ever been to the bodies exhibit we have it in atlanta um but you can see what a lung looks like healthy and what it looks like when it's been um smoked through and i just don't want it in my lungs like i smoke before but i'm like i would i even stopped doing that because it made me feel light-headed um but yeah i don't get why somebody would want to be high i ended up taking off my lashes and stuff because it like legit felt like they were 200 pounds like they were irritating on the eye and then i like ate this mango and put water all over my face and then wiped to where the inside of my shirt i'm sure has like brown from my makeup and i was like oh shoot i have makeup on but yeah it's four o'clock i'm gonna check back in around five let's see if i'm still high hopefully this doesn't last too much longer because i don't like the feeling and i want it to be over with but um yeah we're gonna check back in an hour and see how i feel i might take a nap just so i can like maybe sleep it off i'm hoping maybe i can drink it through maybe the food just has to like get out of my body but i don't know guys i don't know but i just want it to wear off already i laid down for about an hour i did not um i didn't go to sleep but i laid down for about an hour i couldn't like my mind was still racing but i feel a lot better just laying down um i can feel it coming down really weird experience i feel like i'm like a little hot and i'm talking with lisp which is i don't know but yeah that was my first time doing any kind of thing it is now time for me to go pick up my mom i just feel tired now um but yeah weird experience don't do drugs kids i feel like now knowing the experience i would never do it again so i thought that my last snippet video i guess was going to be my last video but i'm actually feeling a lot better right now it is the 7 50. so just now at 7 50 i'm finally feeling better and like myself and like my brain is clear i went to go grab my mom and i was honestly like really hungry i mean while i was high on the edibles i ate two mangoes two apples um a baked potato um what else a coke um i feel like i have something else oh and this like um shrimp and broccoli like stir-fry or whatever with some ginger sauce like oh and a bowl of frosted flakes so i don't know like i thought that you only got hungry when you were high on like smoking i didn't know you actually got like high off edibles and still wanted to eat stuff i never knew that was a thing but yeah i ate a lot while i was um highly edible before i got to my mom i did go ahead and stop at taco bell and i did guys i was trying to go ahead and make that like a laxative because i figured if it's an edible it's something that's in your stomach and it needs to get out of your system so tmi got it handled and since that happened i now feel a lot better um when i went to go pick up my mom we've been sharing a car for the past like a week or so um until she gets her car next week but excuse me um i literally when i pulled up to her i hopped in the passenger seat like mom's like why didn't you get out the car to like get in the passenger seat like i just need to get in the passenger seat so pretty much i um let her drive and just kind of like drove away and um go ride over here i just went ahead and went to sleep so i feel a lot better i didn't really go to sleep but it was more like relaxing closing my eyes and like now that it's out of my system i feel like i feel a lot better um i did not like the feeling guys i don't know how people do it like i know people who do edibles all the time people smoke all the time like i don't know if that's the feeling you get but i did not enjoy it i don't like feeling outside of myself i like to be clear-headed um so to feel like i was drugged like that's what i mean it felt like that um it wasn't a good feeling i was like i don't want to experience this again i literally remember um on the way over here all i was thinking was yo i need to like get rid of these like i need to flush them on toilet give it to a friend something like they have to go not flush them down totally but you know get rid of them um likely i'm gonna give them to a friend rather than throw it away because it was sixty dollars but i am just not interested i'm not interested in getting any more trying different flavors like i just did not like the experience um i felt like my brain was really clouded and heavy and it was almost like i'm kind of atd so i feel like every time when i'm thinking my thoughts go everywhere anyway but i can still organize them like i'm used to it enough that it's like i can organize thoughts in my brain but when i was high on the edibles it was almost like i could not control my brain hopping on a trillion different things and i was on video chat and i felt like i was saying things that were like brutally honest and i'm like yo why is this happening right now like it was like my mouth was moving saying things like shut up shut up so yeah i didn't really like that feeling i don't like not feeling in control and i definitely did not feel in control while i was high on the edibles um they tasted good we're going off taste i'd say 10 out of 10 they were all really really good but i'm just really thinking about experience i don't know if it's how you're supposed to feel but i just remember feeling really disoriented and my thoughts were not coming up straight in my brain as well as the fact that um i was just really confused and would not stop saying things i'm just like be quiet and then directly after that i got really sad um and disappointed in myself that i did it how long does high last night like it peaks at two to three hours so i was like i think i'm peeking so i literally was with my eyes closed but i was paying attention to everything like the fan um how it felt up against my skin i felt like i was um breathing extra heavy i don't know i just was not it was not comfortable and i just was not happy but i am glad that i experienced it i'm glad i experienced it alone i don't know if that was good or bad thing but yeah we're never doing that again hopefully you guys enjoyed it and give this video a thumbs up for me and my experience and yeah that's gonna be it for today i just love you bye", "sOrhwc4yv14": "hello again everybody welcome back to Metro pop arts Channel best of series continuing on in 2018 with mine stock Colorado today we're in Colorado Springs and you know we've done everything to learn about sativas and because concentrates sauces Terps and whatnot but guess what there's not just one way to infuse THC into your system there's another way and it's called edibles we're really really excited to be with the number one gummy bear Authority in all of Colorado Zak Romi zackaroni the founder of robots were going to go into the kitchen and find out the match that a lot of people have talked a little bit about the steps that you've made to improve your product reshape the product for security reasons tell us a little bit about robots and the changes that have gone on with compliance and the structure of your product yeah so initially we started with the robot shaped gummy and we did infuse that with bhl and that's where we got the name robots we've mo pH onto the gummy so we put pho right into the name and since then we have had a new lot of changes mainly the state came down we had to change our logo because it was deemed too kid-friendly it was a cartoon robot so - kid-friendly there our gummy shape was a robot shape that was to get friendly with the new regulations so what we did there was just go as plain as we could but still kind of have some way to stand out so we just did a little rectangle gummy and then with that what we did was put the required THC logo on there as well so are gummy themselves are all compliant and then as far as packaging goes we have the THC symbol on the front that is required we have all the required dosing information now that we have to have in with every batch every batch you get since we're testing so you know where you're at has your cultivation ingredients the data was made date of expiration and then this is all your legal information the state requires you to have and then what we are also up to code now with is the regulations for July 1st where the interior package also has to have all the ingredients so now when you pull out the pop-top it's branded to match the box accident and then it also has all your ingredients badge info right there as well the testing info and then it has all your legal information there as well so you always know what you want to get but as far as our gummy in itself what we've really done to make a better product as we did a ton of R&D really got a really really good recipe where you're comfortable with dialed that in and now we brought an automation to make it consistent the same things I got me every time these gummies here a 50 mil 55 milligrams a piece for 550 in the pack these are peach mango gummies so the lighter orange is going to be peach the dark orange is gonna be mango since we rolled this one out about six months ago it's quickly become one of our top-selling gummies yep yep 50 milligrams these ones came out testing at 55 milligrams so they're a little bit above but as long as we're on the side of 15% variance so as long as they're not over fifty seven fifty seven and a half milligrams of gummy we can we could still market and so on and as you can see they have the required THC symbol on there a nice little sugar coat on them and being made with that machine I mean their exact same consistency and Sparta's shape and sizes all within a hundredth of a gram that's honest I've grasped or got me 450 grams in the pack all right that'll be great for our audience thanks very much alright Matthew so tell the audience a little bit about the difference between the distillate that you would find in a vape pen and the disc lists that are used inside these very colorful gummies so the distillate that you would find in a vape pen would be either cut with a propylene glycol or MCT oil the distances that we use in our gummies here is an whole whole new grunt uncut distillate so it's either gonna be indica or sativa just the pure THC you're gonna find in our gummies okay so here is a big batch we'll all these gummies in here are 50 milligrams of PS these are gonna be put into our 500 milligram packs of robots which have quickly become our top selling product here the 500 milligram multi pack what's good about these is it's a high dose and a small amount of candies so the people who are consuming these that need the high dose of medicine don't have to ingest a bunch of candy or a bunch of sugary products to get their medicine we infused with this load as well so also in these little pieces of candy you're not gonna have a big hash flavor or flavor you're not really desiring you're gonna get pretty much a straight flavor of the gummy in here that's great and what we do here is won't pair this with another flavor so some strawberry prepare this with banana and our pack for a strawberry banana peg ten pieces go into each pack 50 milligrams apiece for 500 milligrams total every batch is tested so you know exactly what you're getting the test results are right on the box we just moved in automation so now each gummy is within a hundredth of a gram at the same size so each one is super consistent super dialed in and everything is tested to you know exactly what you're eating now that's pretty remarkable is that an industry standard fought 50 milligrams per unit no that's not so we're actually pretty unique and doing then there are some other high dose options out there there's like one other gummy I think doing that and then there's been some chocolate bars that have done that but again back to kind of the volume okay meaning there's I mean chocolate bars that are as big as a king-sized Hershey with 500 milligrams so you have to eat a whole bunch of candy just to do I mean you're almost getting fooled just on candy whereas here you know it's a way smaller amount of candy but you're still delivering that high dose now I think that I've heard or did I see something that it was even a higher dose per unit is there a real like significantly higher dose for so your patient is a little sicker that requires so I mean honestly with edibles everybody is different and your digestive system is different with everybody so we we have some people who will take these gummies and split the 50 milligram gummy upto 10 piece or 5 pieces so they're 10 milligram pieces little just segments of a gummy then we have some people who need to adjust 500 milligrams in a day whether it's to help them alleviate pain help them sleep through the night PTSD whatever their case may be we do have some people that need the high dose at these delivery now what would you suggest to me in all your years that experience would be the percentage of people that enjoy your product that do it in a clinical medicinal capacity versus using it as their recreational mechanism of choice yeah so that's a great question um so we've been doing the medical gummies about a year and a half of this recipe and they've been doing really well and what we do see a lot I get a ton of emails either through the website direct messages on Instagram right in seeing people in stores where they tell us this product is the only thing that has given them relief or whatever they're dealing with um there was actually one store in Denver we just got into where the manager there was dealing with cancer and on chemo and our gummies she said was literally the only thing she could taste the only thing that would deliver relief from her current situation she was dealing with now as we've ruled out the wreck site at the end of January we're definitely that split of you know mainly met people it's kinda cutting into that's where we're getting a lot of wreck cells now but I mean I would still say at least 70 to 80% of our gummies are medical and I on the medical side and I would say of that at least 50% are people that actually haven't desired me for our product absolutely now is it did I infer correctly that the recreational products can be purchased as low as 10 milligrams so you go as low as you want on there but there is a cap on the limit so you can't go above 100 milligrams on the recreational side the medical side there's no limit but you do have to have everything tested it if you're over 100 milligrams every kind has to be tested you can't process validate the recreational side since its capped at 100 milligrams you could process validate you know if every batch tested you have to get like every three months you have to give your batch to us is that's a testament to make sure you're still on track dialed in and all that's the but yeah the recreational side the cap is 100 milligrams in the pack and the most you can put an individual piece is 10 milligrams so you got to stay with their toes oh I see so every piece is actually 10 milligram 50 yep so our recreational side all the pieces that are going to be 10 milligrams we put 10 in a pack for 100 milligram got it and now and that compares to the 50 of the mental side yep so back in the kitchen up robots we're here with Dylan and Dylan's gonna share with a little bit about some of the nuances and specific requirements of taking a jar of distillate and then getting it to the consumer in a safe capacity well if we're talking about safety safety first we want to make sure that we're putting the correct amount of distillate and the gummies and what people what a lot of people probably don't understand is this industry's full of regulation every batch that we cook we have to send off to get testing they don't pass testing it gets locked in the system you can't sell you can't do anything with it and another thing when you're when you're dosing people you want to make sure that you know the milligrams that you're giving them is what's on the boxes what's in the gummy sure so our focus is mainly on quality and potency and consistency and as far as just some of the difficult things that come with this industry it seems like every couple months there's a new regulation that comes out or you got to change something that's on the mold that you pour gummies in or you got to change the wording on the box or something like that I think that's probably what a lot of people don't understand about it you know making gummies is the easy part but keeping up with all the regulations that's that's the tough part of the business but other than that if you keep up the regulations and make sure that your gummies are consistent every time and hopefully people like well actually the recipe never changes whether we're cooking the 180s or the 500s now when when the oil comes in the company that we get it from puts the the testing percentage on it and we have we have a list and basically we can just look at it see what the percentage of the oil is so once we see the percentage we know what we're cooking if the percentage on that oil changes then the quantity of the amount that we're using in each batch of change with it all right straight from Colorado Springs Dylan thank you very much your time today no problem thank you", "VpMpblAm-Nc": "hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at another edible this time the wonka gummies instead of the wonka uh chocolate bars we looked at not last week i think the week before um anyway lab tested i don't know about that lab tested for quality inconsistency confused with solvent free cannabis distillate [Music] so these are like a black market edible pretty much they have a bunch of different flavors i guess or types of gummies these are peach rings i think um there's some a nice nice government warning for you don't mind my dog complaining um but i like to like i didn't even notice this before but the rainbow finish on it i don't know what exactly that is but it looks fire 500 milligrams no children's california wow if we take a look on the back there's an actual nutrition fact section um no serving size or anything just really all that's in here it's just really just sugar and a tiny bit of saturated fat um not a significant source of vitamin d calcium iron or potassium i was not planning on it ingredients cannabis oil sugar glucose fructose syrup wheat flour malic acid dextrose palm oil citric acid artificial flavor antioxidants sorbic acid dufferin artificial colors um and usually these are um hopefully if you ever get these they will be sealed but even if they are sealed you can kind of tell they've been like tampered with like heat sealed you know what i mean so it's always a risk when you get something like this um it could be very very good but also uh could be very bunk but these ones i got pretty lucky because these ones are actually pretty gas for what they are i saved one of them so we can take a look at it let me take this bad boy out and there we are your basic candy ring and says these are infused but uh you can really really taste it on like the outside so i'm assuming these are sprayed and not infused but if you're looking for a really cheap edible that you're willing to take a chance on i i would recommend these uh it comes with a good amount of them and i i ate a few and i was feeling very nice so they do work depending where you get them but wonkagumi's uh a classic company made into something very frowned upon but oh well i hope you guys enjoyed the video i got a ton of videos like this on my channel if you want to check it out and uh yeah later", "ly3f2zVdlDg": "[Music] when legal marijuana comes to Canada chances are you won't just be smoking it you'll be snacking on it drinking it maybe even serving it to your friends after dinner edible and drinkable cannabis products are the fastest growing segment of the emerging marijuana market and all of it soon be on a legal dispensary shelf near use you are like the queen of baking marijuana like give me a Stephen diva do you know I mean just how much have you done all of it everything I've done it all we're with Mary Jean Dunstan of Vancouver but most people know or by her nickname watermelon I've done everything from like nice cream cones to marijuana bacon marijuana jello shooters I have made we - meatballs my man welcome back to my kitchen these days she has an internet cooking show and we've come to her kitchen to learn about what happens when you eat marijuana if you're just it consume cannabis raw you would not get high so you're telling me if I just ate this you just pick that up and through your mouth right now Chris nothing would happen to you but you have to heat it heating marijuana or soaking it in booze releases the THC the active ingredient that makes you high and the dish for our demonstration wild BC chinook salmon if you taste me don't want a salmon you're gonna know that marijuana is supposed to go on salmon I'm just gonna dry rub it on my salmon then pop it in the oven and let the natural oil in the fish cook the marijuana it looks like pesto pesto with the punch Dunston says eating marijuana is more social and socially acceptable than smoking it a way more popular than smoking edibles will be way more popular to give you an indication of how popular these cookies are Chris I started baking in 1993 and I've easily personally made and sold seven hundred thousand two million cookies if I ate your rum ball what would I feel you would feel euphoria you feel a sense of bliss the problem is if you just go over that you get panic ease but with cannabis when you ingest it it can be really powerful and a little bit can go a long way so a little bit can have a big impact and that's the big challenge with ingesting marijuana it's hard to know how much you're getting and how high you'll get it's also often impossible to tell marijuana laced food from ordinary food all of which is a problem for regulating the sale of edibles in Canada for most among the worries are kids eating it in Colorado Oregon and Washington where marijuana is already legal there are stories of children like this eight-year-old who accidentally ate a marijuana infused cookie everything looked like it wasn't real the boy was rushed to emergency but was okay how can my friends legal marijuana opponents are pushing educational videos like this for parents and children well I think we need to look at what's done in other places see what the benefits and risk might be but many Canadian doctors want to avoid such missteps altogether I'd like to start with a very strong regulatory framework that does not allow the sale of edible products and a form these baked goods or other forms that directly appeal to children dr. Patricia Daley is Vancouver's chief medical health officer she supports legalizing and controlling marijuana but when the city started licensing medical marijuana dispensaries daily campaigned to keep most edible products out of them those poisonings can be very serious in young children and the average age reported to poison control centers is under the age of two for children about age that can result in coma it can depress respirations and up about 2,000 cases identified from 2000 to 2013 7% required critical care admission and it's not just young kids who get in trouble last year at Vancouver's big marijuana party known as 4/20 day 63 people ended up in hospital emergency for overdoing it 70% of those have been eating marijuana edibles gluten-free the Harper government's medical marijuana program banned marijuana edibles in part at a safety concerns Thank You supreme court Canada you made my day but the Supreme Court overturned the law to the delight of patients and in edibles industry eager to emerge from the shadows this material hasn't been dried or cured just south of Vancouver in Washington State legal marijuana has been on sale since 2014 and regulators have been struggling to make edible products safe so this is our bottling line we make our cannabis quencher here it comes in five flavors we've come to Marco Hoffman's edibles Factory in Seattle evergreen herbal where they make a mind-boggling selection of marijuana treats the issue with edibles and this is where everybody gets in trouble with edibles is the lag time so smoking a joint is immediate you feel it and take a hit you feel it right away so they eat it they eat an edible they don't feel it well they eat a little more they don't feel it they eat the whole thing oh my god they've had too much that's the trick with edibles is knowing where your body is Washington's solution to over consuming is in the packaging a marijuana chocolate bar for example is packaged in individual sections each with a dose of 10 milligrams of THC so the way they came up with the 10 milligram dose is they said what is equivalent to the same intoxicating effects of one glass of wine or a beer this is a way to control the doses as it were correct drinking an entire marijuana soda is supposed to be the equivalent of maybe three glasses of wine so this is a six ounce 6.3 ounce bottle this right here is a 2.1 ounce shot glass so this is the measuring device that comes with the bottle so that you can self-regulate ten milligrams at a time the bottle also requires an opener making it harder for kids to get at and every bit of candy or food is individually wrapped I think that through proper packaging through proper education through and not just education to the consumer but that consumer then educating their child Hoffman says his sales of edible products have doubled every year of legalization edible products are now the fastest-growing segment of the marijuana business possibly as much as 50% of the legal market in the u.s. safe products also hinge on reliable testing you how high you could potentially get and in Canada marijuana testing labs are becoming a key part of Canada's pot industry along with marijuana consultants such as Emily Kirkham she used to be a chemist but she now advises Canada's medical marijuana producers on how to ensure their products are tested and measured properly how tough is it to get all this right as far as edibles uh I think it is tough I mean it's as simple as if you bake a pan of brownies and the the pan is kind of tilted one side in the oven and half of it's thicker than the other you're gonna have varying levels of dosage in that in that brownie pan so there's a lot of there's a lot of complexity involved for sure that cannabis salmon we cooked up well rather than eat it we packed it up and took it to a lab to test it we wanted to know how much marijuana was actually in it Dunson told us it could be around 15 milligrams of cannabis but turns out she was off there is about four milligrams of THC and the active form of THC the salmon was actually only about a quarter of the strength expected but some of her baked goods we tested were a lot stronger especially the tiny ginger snap which packed roughly the same punch as four glasses of wine this cookie is probably the strongest of all those things that we had stronger than the salmon and the butter tart for sure absolutely and you know maybe it would be wise to start with a small bite of this cookie before advancing all of which suggests cooking and consuming marijuana in food is still far from a precise science and it may take some trial and error to get the kind of consistency that consumers and regulators demand but it's always easier to start with a strict regulatory approach and - then perhaps loosen that over time if we start by allowing the sale and marketing of these products we know the marijuana industry will jump on that and will quickly have a very robust business and it's very hard to put the genie back in the bottle once it's out in the u.s. legalization has made cannabis foods safer in Canada has a potential to do so too but we'll also introduce them to lots of new consumers many of whom have no idea what to expect Chris Brown CBC News banku", "K3jYmHtFVoQ": "today we read it we got a weird article yeah contacted me running

times to pee cuz I'm over 50 not last night [ __ ] I slept right to six like a soldier had to pee like a [ __ ] it was coming out of my ears", "RcVOWaIsDes": "today I'm gonna be doing something really fun for children and this is my version of jell-o gummy bears so let me set up with all the ingredients that we need and I'll be back in a second so now that I've set up I'm gonna show you exactly what we need I have a silicon gummy bear mold a measuring cup for our water we're gonna be starting off with cold water but I'm gonna get to that step in just a second you're gonna need one tablespoon of gelatin that is equal to 15 milliliters and if you buy your gelatin in little pockets this is what it looks like it's a standard package and this holds one tablespoon or 15 milliliters and also a regular sized box of jell-o and this here is 85 grams so for our first step I'm gonna get my water ready and I'm gonna come back in one second for my first step I have added 1/2 a cup of cold water from my kitchen sink that is very important you need the water to be cold I am now gonna take that 1 tablespoon of gelatin and I'm just gonna sprinkle it over the top of the cold water and I'm gonna let this sit here for about 5 minutes because I want this to completely dissolve in that cold water you can already see that it's dissolving quite quickly so I'm just gonna let that go for a few more minutes and then I'll come back so this is 5 minutes later and I've just taken a fork and just stir this around everything is nicely dissolved and now I'm gonna take my last little bit of water 1/4 cup and dump that right in so in here we have a total of 3 quarters of a cup of water I am now gonna take this put this into the microwave and just microwave it for about a minute until it's hot so that was 1 minute on high and you can see now that it's much clearer that's because heat has been introduced into the gelatin and water and now we are ready to add in our actual jello mixture so I've opened up our little box of jell-o and now I'm gonna get that right in there and because the liquid is hot all of the jello mixture is gonna really just dissolve that much easier in there well I smells good too and I am using a cherry today I'm just gonna mix this around so you don't have to worry about the exact temperature that you heat this to in your microwave just make sure that it's hot does not have to be boiling just hot and that will help all the you know the actual package contents mix up in there really well and that's good and now we are ready to fill our mold so I've just put my mold on a little cutting board because this is very very flexible and if it's very hard to lift up when it's full so we're ready to pour it just give that a little bit of a stir just to make sure that all the contents are completely mixed but nothing has settled to the bottom and then I'm gonna start filling our little mold and that looks good just like that okay I'm just cleaning this up and now we are ready to pop this into the fridge so you want to put this in the fridge not the freezer just into your fridge and just let this chill down for about four hours and you're gonna have a really really nice gummy bears so I'm gonna pop this into my fridge and I'll come back much later on and I'm gonna show you the final product and they are really fun and they are full of flavor a few hours later once your jello has completely set you can just peel out your little gummy bears that's what's so nice about the silicone is that you can get right in there and just peel them right out so I'll continue doing this so I'll be back in a second and our last one and there we have them let's get them around the right way look at that really nice let me zoom in so I've zoomed in just a little bit to show you how nice these are and there we have it our jello gummy bears and look at how really gummy these are really really nice you can see that extra gelatin will really set these up really well and these here are super super fresh hmm a burst of flavor right in your mouth super super fresh hmm YUM I just zoomed in a little bit more because I think I heard some of you say zoom in a little bit more I want to see a little bit more detail in those gummy bears and here we have them aren't those cute made with jell-o and gelatin a little bit of water there we have them really fun really really delicious that's it for this video I hope you enjoyed it if you did please give me a thumbs up subscribe if you wish I really do appreciate that and that's it for today I'll see you next time you", "hWcvldUBke0": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with tokentim420 this is a medical marijuana review for those over the age of 18 or medical marijuana patients all right guys like say hi to everybody out there hopefully having a great weekend or it's friday so hopefully you're having a good start to the weekend it's about three o'clock in the afternoon i'm done working already thankfully so we got a gummy review from true leave coming right after our unboxing so make sure you stick around for that i have tried them so it'll be a little mini review um so let me get back to where it was if you guys haven't subscribed make sure you hit that button sunday we're going to do our 420 giveaway our big giveaway so make sure you subscribe for that make sure you're on the video on sunday whatever else i put with it but it will be the giveaway uh leave me a thumbs up thumbs down let me know what you guys are smoking on i got lucky and picked up a little member berry today you guys know i love that [ __ ] all right i forgot to grab one thing give me one second all right it's in this box here so just give me a second all right so i was perusing on a line the other day um looking for some stuff on instagram let me toss that back in there i've been looking for uh marbles what they call them you guys know i got this terp slurper off a waist for like four bucks uh and they usually cap them with a little marble and then they stick a like it looks like a pill in here like called whatever they call it and then some smaller balls in there you can do that well like i said of that 60 bucks i spent five i'm not even sure if i like a tarp slurper yet so i've been trying to find a cheap one i run right across the uh stone back glass stone bat glass he's out of ohio um and he had some marbles on there let's get this open and see if i can find a knife and i dm and him and ask him you know what price he had on one um you know he sent back some questions and i said i just want something cheap i just got a turf slurper i want to try it and he gave me an incredible price on them could not pass it up so i was like what else do you got but like i said he's a medical i believe medical patient in ohio he does have two kids around two years old age so he's talking for a little bit um but he's got some nice glass i think there's something there shouldn't be that many oh yeah i think i got three marbles okay so i will put a link for him down in the description he does have an ecstasy store or este whatever you want to call it so this is going to be one of the little balls here and like so as soon as we get done with this we'll do the review of the other stuff um but these are the ones he had laying around that he didn't uh they didn't come out quite so good i think they look great oh it looked like there was a hole in it it's not it's just a spot now he said he he polishes them a little bit but they might be a little dusty um he uses like a wet polish but i mean look at that's a nice looking little marble there and that's not even the best looking one i don't know what that is and i guess all i thought there was only two marbles looks like two marbles and something extra there now this is the one that i just thought was beautiful like a swirling planet or something it's got some mainly blues in there but it's a little darker on that side so that's what like a little tint of yellow and orange in there in certain spots but just nice let's see which one of these fits are slurper haha see just like that so the smaller one fit the big one fits too but the smaller one fits a little better so i have to ask him what size that was so now we got a thing for our banger this looks like it's a pendant and i didn't order a pendant so he must have threw that in there as a bonus let's see what this is oh yeah check that out nice little pendy some glue back there it's like blue and green that's nice all right i think this one's my favorite one now he does have another one i won't tell you how much i paid for the balls because he asked me not to um but that was after i didn't tell him i was doing a video until afterwards after everything was said and done the payment was finalized and everything then i told him i was going to do a youtube review on the stuff and he said don't mention the price of those because it was a good price now this is gray it does have like a greenish tint to it but this was like 22 bucks guys he has another one that's more blue and it's more blue and purple up here and he said he's had it for a while too i've seen it on his instagram today he said he'd take us less for it also but look at that 22 bucks for a hand blown he blows us in his garage he's been he's been blown glass oh and it sits i wasn't sure it was going to sit up but it's got that little leg right here on the side little foot which lets it sit up now the carbs on the wrong side for me i preferred on that side but that one this wasn't a custom-made piece this was something he had laying around that's why i got him as cheap as i did now if you ask for something custom it's probably going to be a little bit higher but like i said i was like what else you have laying around that you can throw in the box tonight with that stuff and this is the stuff he had laying around but like i was saying he um i believe he's been blowing glass for a year now um he just started doing it on his own three months ago i'm not sure if he lost his job because of the covet or if it's just a move he decided to make oh nice now this thing he let go for eight dollars guys again we got some green glass a little swirl of orange here on the end and i couldn't believe that for eight bucks so i was super super stoked about this you know i like my dry pipes yeah nice the glass isn't real super thin and like i said this is blown by a guy right here in or not right not in florida but you know middleton ohio wherever it was ohio it's a little bit further up north i think in ohio but if you're looking for you want a hand blown piece of glass that's not everybody else is going to have reasonably priced like i said he's not doing big fancy stuff yet give him time i'm looking at this stuff i'm thinking he won't be far before he gets there um but if you want something reasonably priced that looks good it functions hit him up um i know on his ssc story has a lot of pendants but he does have pipes and other stuff like that you can hit him up in a dm on instagram or something like that ask him to send you pictures of what he's got or give him an idea what you want i love that little thing i've been wanting a little sherlock for a while i've got a few other ones i really just don't care for and like i said threw in a a free pendant when that stuff was already super super super cheap it was so cheap that i threw an extra five dollars in to help cover for shipping because i almost felt like i was robbing the dude um like i said these two alone that was 30 bucks by itself these two 22 and 8 30 bucks you cannot beat that right there so like i said i'll leave the links down there in the description for him you're not only supporting a small glass blower but you're helping a father support his kids so keep that in mind if there's something you've been looking for give him a holler or if you're just like me you just like to collect stuff give him a holler like i said he's got another blue one almost identical to this one except for his blue here and more purple with the multi colors up here as i'd say this is blue and orange or white orange probably probably the dominant colors in that the other one looked like it had more purple where the orange was that was more dominant color but still sexy looking when it was real close for me to pick between the two of them it's hard for me not to get both of them to be honest all right so like i said i will leave links the first ones that jump on and see it give me a minute to put the links up i'll put a link for the essence store and i'll try to put a link for his instagram on there too um so we got some gummies today from true leave we will talk about the ones we got from cure leaf we still have some of them we haven't messed with them too much now you see they're in a ziploc baggie i did that so these wouldn't dry out but i'll show you that didn't help much they'd dried out they're kind of crusty they're not that old yet you can see where it's turning real white that's where they're getting kind of hard and crusty um these like i said had a a real bad syrupy kind of taste to them the flavor wasn't bad but the aftertaste in the back of your throat was like you drunk had a bunch of pancakes with syrup but the flavor wasn't bad now let's move on to the ones you guys are looking for and that's the ones from true leave i was able to pick up two of these today or i got guava passion fruit that was the only flavor they had it's the one they come out with today now these are 100 milligram package but you're gonna get two packs with five gummies a piece i opened this you know it's a long car ride home it's like five minutes from truly um these are nice they're a lot softer another thing with cure leaves they was one of those gummies that was real hard to chew so these are only five milligrams true leaves are ten so i'm thinking i'm somewhere around 50 milligrams i would have to eat two of these i tried six one day and my jaw was sore from cueing so much these i would only have to eat five and i don't see my jaw hurting they're more of a softer gummy um to where these are more like eating a steak you know what i mean you have to chew on them for a second the flavor on true leaves there there's no aftertaste on these so one night i thought i had some you know like a fake sugar aftertaste like a sweet and low or something now i haven't experienced that with these but i've only ate three of them so far i ate two on the way home and i ate another one a little bit ago it's got more of like a pineapple like the tart lemon they're a little bit more sour strong flavor not so much on the smell like when you open these you can smell them and it had pretty much a mild flavor these you can't smell when you bite into them the flavor just kind of explodes in your mouth i really like these i even thought i felt something just from the two right off the bat almost which was kind of weird now you will adult i don't want to get too far into this you will need to get an edible recommendation from your doctor here in florida to get the edibles so don't forget that some doctors you can just call up and get it with nothing at it i heard a couple other people said their doctor charged them 20 bucks so it's just going to depend on your doctor you have to call them find out but i wouldn't wait too long i would try to get on there and get that done that way if something does come out that you would like to try it doesn't run out while you're waiting on your doctor to get your recommendation in there and then you have to wait another two or three months for it to come back out again so keep that in mind but i was impressed enough with these and like i said there was no they didn't say there was a limit they said i get as many as i want it so i got two of them uh i'm gonna go back right now and if they're not out i'm getting two more so i was pretty impressed with these i'm gonna do um a whole pack here after i get back so that'll be 50 milligrams which is nice they've got and i guess that's the universal sticker there was nothing actually on the gummy take that out and show you but see it's real soft it's still got some density too but when you bite into it it kind of you know it's one of them softer ones about the only way i can explain it it does have just a little bit of sugar coating on the outside i think or something but not much yeah i guess there is a little bitty you can't even hardly see it there's a little bitty stamp like a diamond i'm guessing that's going to be the same as that one so um now i know the website said it's select locations my location wasn't one of the select locations that was listed but i went and they had them because when that first popped up it said every location but the ones it excluded the ones that was on there the first time two days ago and then it popped back up saying only those locations but like i said mine had them so they're not showing up on the website you just have to bite the bullet go in there i waited 30 minutes got in and out i think i got there like 10 40 10 50 this morning i was out at 11 20. so we'll see when i go back if it's any longer i'll post on instagram if i had a long wait or anything so you catch me over there i'm going to upload this one finish smoking this and go back and see if i can get some more so like i said guys if you've been looking for some new pipes i definitely say check out the stone bat stone back glass um real reasonable price uh and nice looking stuff i can't i don't see anything to complain about you know like i said for a 22 sherlock i don't see nothing wrong the hole is not off center it's not gigantic um i see no chips no breaks in the glass no air bubbles i mean there's air bubbles in that of course but you know what i mean not a bunch of air bubbles in the glass no stress on the joints or anything like that where it's bent so yeah i like it same thing with this it's simple it's elegant it doesn't have a lot of crap coming off of it the hole is pretty much centered um that's pretty yeah i'd say that's pretty much [ __ ] perfectly centered um it's not super huge so he didn't screw up the holes or anything like that neither one of the sides not super huge there's no rough edges the mouthpiece is nice and big so i'm pretty impressed especially for the price like i said eight dollars man and you know who blew the glass so go check him out i'll leave the links down there hopefully you guys have an amazing weekend i'm going to try to do the g-pin connect tomorrow for a saturday and we're going to do the giveaway on sunday so if everything goes at plan check back tomorrow for g pin giveaway on sunday and then hard time what we'll do by monday so hopefully everybody's smoking on something good and as always keep on toking my friends till next time", "wgnev3aumWI": "[Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "XWaaVYuPs_M": "hi there how are you i hope everything is amazing because today we are going to try some moonwalker delta eight they came out with two brand new flavors and i've already tried them they're freaking delicious i put them back in their boxes just for show i'm gonna take them right back out moonwalker if you're not familiar it's a delta eight company they make um vape cartridges so i have a couple of those over here as well so they do vape cartridges and gummies and uh they just released these two new flavors of gummies and two new flavors of vape cart so they have four of each now and uh they're freaking delicious but i figured before we jumped into it um i would kind we should kind of maybe go over a couple things maybe we should take one real quick so this is the sour strawberry this one is phobos and it is 25 milligrams per gummy delta 8 is about 60 as psychoactive as delta 9. so if you were to kind of compare this to a delta 9 gummy you'd be looking at about a 15 milligram delta 9. the delta 9 is typically what you smoke that is what you are all aware of for the most part i feel like unless you're living under a rock then you've definitely heard of just weed weed delta 9 is federally illegal although some states have uh adopted it to be legal that was the weirdest way of saying that but to some states it's legal in i'm luckily in one of those states that it is fully legal you can grow you can buy it recreational medicinally yeah it's really cool i love it sorry to brag on there for a second but um delta h now this is different so to get all sciency about it delta nine has a double bond on the ninth carbon chain where you can see that delta eight would have a double bond on the eighth carbon chain that one minuscule difference does make an entire world of difference and how it interacts within your body so the way delta nine works is that it works really well with the cb1 receptors in your endocannabinoid system so we have that within our body the cb1 receptors are a bit more um geared for giving you a body and a brain high when combined with the delta nine so that's why you kind of feel like your body maybe you feel a little bit more floaty you feel like your head is a little bit foggy but you're getting that maybe we should talk about the negative side effects as well real quick so you're getting that high and and i love it and i love cannabis and um i will never give up my delta nine but you do get a bit of like a foggier high and if you're smoking sativa and you have a sativa strain um if you're not familiar is a really amazing daytime strain as it typically ramps you up or an indica strain is going to kind of let a really awesome nighttime strain ramp you down so a sativa strain also can exacerbate certain symptoms like anxiety depression just like overall nervousness and i find that it does do that for me so i don't typically smoke sativa during the day because i have that kind of a negative side effect with it whereas indica i do love to smoke indica it is my primary flower that i enjoy but uh it tends to relax you bring you down and can cause laziness couch locks sleepiness just overall on not being as productive as you may want to be and i don't necessarily want to smoke and then just become a potato i want to be able to um continue to enjoy my day so that is kind of where delta eight comes in delta eight being the double bond on the eighth carbon chain and it reacting to your cb two receptors within your body gives you a different feeling it is definitely a more clear headed high you don't get that anxiety uh that sativa does end up causing because it doesn't have that kind of receptor it doesn't have that kind of chemical makeup and how it interacts with your body now of course we are all different humans delta 9 thc will react differently for one person than it does to the next you know some people can smoke a whole lot while others can only smoke a little bit and they never have like an increase of need some people love sativa and they they smoke it and then they are like the most productive person throughout the entire day another person is having an internal panic attack while doing it so it is still a bit experimental and i do want to urge you guys to do research figure out what is best for you start small ask family or friends you know maybe even have somebody there with you if you do want to try it for the very first time delta 8 is just different so being that it reacts differently within your body combining with the cb2 receptors and having a different chemical makeup of course you're going to have an entirely different experience with it i think a lot of people are just expecting it to be the same as weed just lower and it's not it's just it's simply not because it's totally different it does give you that high but it gives you that it's just a clear-headed calm high you don't get that anxiety inducing like panic when it starts to creep up you just you kind of feel it creep up and then you just feel wusa so that's what we're going to do i'm going to eat a gummy and then continue on with my day and come back in an hour or a couple hours and we'll kind of talk about and see the effects and everything that i'm feeling while i'm feeling it so that um we have the most accurate representation of what this is so this one here is phobos i love this one this one is sour strawberry they had it limited edition and it sold out in like 48 hours so then they did a poll moonwalker did a poll on their instagram should we make it a permanent flavor and it was an overwhelming resounding yes so they did bring it back as a permanent flavor and then they came out with a second flavor which is actually my all-time favorite so this one is hyperion and it is a mango kush now with these there's there's no difference between the four different flavors that they have um they also have that blueberry one i think it's called blue dream euphoria and then they also have the watermelon skittles one and uh there's no difference between each of the battles they're all 625 milligrams total or 25 milligrams per gummy within the battles there's no difference as far as strains go delta 8 is still so new i don't even know necessarily if there needs to be any difference in strains ever because it gives you just like that very specific kind of high that's what it looks like it's just a little cube like a sugar coated cube and uh mango kush oh my god this one is so good yeah the only difference between the four is the flavor so you're gonna get the same effect so you just find the flavor that you love the most so before that kicks in let's talk about some pros and cons this is important that we talk about everything i don't want you guys to go into this blind i want you to have a very good understanding of what to expect so um most important or the i guess the number one question would be is it legal and the answer is yes it is federally legal here in the united states there are some states that have decided to outlaw it where you can't get it shipped to you and i apologize i'll put those dates down below in the description box hopefully they kind of get on board soon but from what i'm understanding is that um and this is the con part of it those states that have chosen not to legalize it may have done so because there's just not enough research yet uh to back it and not enough um checks and balances in place to make sure that every company on the market that is trying to come out with a delta 8 product so rapidly fast is doing it in a safe manner that is going to protect their citizens and i love that they did that but i also kind of hate that they did that because i feel bad that you can get your hands on this or be able to vet out your own good company so moonwalker i'm going to go out there and say that this is the number one delta eight company on the market they do have third party lab testing done and they do have those lab results on their website but they also have test results if you go ahead and scan this code that's on the back of all of their products so they have it on the back of their cartridges as well as on here there's no additives fillers there's no chemicals that are going to harm you and then it's also going to give you the breakdown of the delta 8 and the delta 9 and the percentages and all of that stuff so um yes it is legal a lot of it is a little bit still in this gray area of is it safe for you i would say to vet out the companies that you're going to be purchasing from as a consumer you are tasked yourself also to make responsible consuming decisions as well as on the company's behalf it is important for them to be honest about their product now like i said with moonwalker it is the leading brand of delta eight on the market i have been using them now for a few months three four months i've never had any negative side effect my husband absolutely loves them i've not had a single other person tell me that they've had any sort of a negative side effect with moonwalker and i have given it to a lot of people live i have shared with a lot of people another pro being that uh it's amazing for the daytime i do i can't really smoke too much during the day uh sativa like i said before kind of ramps up my anxiety whereas if i take one gummy during the day my anxiety does not ramp up i still remain productive but i feel elevated i feel happier which i know is something that a lot of people don't want to necessarily talk about that this actually makes you a happier or a better person but in my reality it does especially when i'm having hormonal mood swings when i'm having ups and downs due to seasonal weather and seasonal depression it lifts me out of that fog and it makes me a happier person let's see another con it's honestly it is hard for me to come up with cons for this con number two if you take too much it's gonna make you sleepy so i take one during the day the sativa it kind of has a sativa ish effect where i feel elevated but i'm still very clear-headed and productive but i don't have that anxiety trigger that sativa will oftentimes give me but i take two at night and i get even more elevated but to a point where i'm starting to get sleepy and i'm able to fall asleep easier it doesn't necessarily make me sleepy but it allows me to fall asleep a lot easier and it allows me to stay asleep longer so i've been loving it honestly loving it for that oh another frequently asked question is is it the same as or different from cbd it is totally different it does come from the same plant but cbd again is a different cannabinoid on that plant it's going to bond to your receptors within your endocannabinoid therapy system differently cbd is not going to get you a high at all but it is going to have a lot of those types of calming restorative effects oh okay so this next one could be a pro oricon it does increase your appetite so i do find myself a little bit more snacky when i have my delta eight as opposed to a traditional weed delta nine but if you're looking to increase your appetite reduce your nausea then this is definitely going to be it for you if you are on a weight loss journey you need to practice some self-control and you need to get those snacks out of your house because you will definitely eat them okay i am going to go away for a little bit and then i'll come back when uh it's taking effect and i'm gonna time it it's already 10 45 in the morning um let's see i took it about 15 minutes ago now so yeah we'll time that and i'll be back soon so the gummy hit while i was filming another video um probably good because i kind of got a little bit more oomph in me to keep going and i was actually quite afraid of this color that i'm putting in my hair right now and now i feel kind of excited and chill about it but it took about 50 minutes on the button for me to feel it and right now it is still rising a little bit by a little bit before it plateaus so i think that in about another 15 minutes i'm gonna feel totally golden and uh i have more stuff i got to get done today so okay hi just doing a little quick check-in it is now one o'clock i did two loads of laundry i filmed a whole other video dyed my hair purple and i'm about to go finish editing a video that i need to upload tomorrow and post it over on my patreon so so far it's been fairly productive but i think first i need lunch because the munchies hit and i'm freaking starving i don't know if you guys can tell it's this is a very cohesive calm i feel like i have a lot of energy and i feel like i'm talking really fast and maybe i am but i feel calm and i feel happy and i'm and excited and i just changed in front of my window and there's this dude trimming this tree out here from the power company or whatnot but he managed to not turn around while i was changing i think it's a female yeah i just i kind of feel like i can just go get done so i'm gonna do that and i have about another hour and a half before i gotta head out and i've kind of timed it i know that these last about four or four and a half hours for me and i kind of timed it so that it would be worn off before i need to head out because i do not condone driving under the influence of anything please it's not funny it's not fun and it's not safe that's me momming you guys for a second i'll see you soon okay now it is 1 37 and i feel like i'm starting to slowly come down from it right now i'm still very energetic and still in such a damn good mood and i don't feel like i got lethargic that i got unfocused or anything along those lines even yet if a police officer was to knock on my front door right now i feel like i would very well be able to handle that conversation yeah i just overall i feel really good so i thought there was a couple interesting things that i read on this as well so i just wanted to point out that each of the gummies is only 15 calories and 2 grams of total sugars they are completely vegan as well which i know is a huge deal when you're dealing with gummies there's a lot of vegetarians and vegans out there that are not going to touch gummies generally because they typically not vegan so i thought this was really really cool and then um i kind of wanted to do just a quick hit off of one of these or maybe both of these cartridges so they have two new carts that came out this one is telesto and it is a orange chem dog and it does have the 800 milligrams of delta eight thc natural terpenes and natural flavor in here they come in this container that you have to child proof lock it but they oh and it's glass by the way um but they come very clear and then you can see the bubble in there but when you tip it the bubble is it's not moving so it's a pretty thick consistency they don't clog like almost ever which i have a huge problem with carts clogging moonwalker also sells this which is a silk discreet um pen which is really really nice because it fits just in the palm of your hand really well so orange chem dog so i'm guessing i'm gonna have a little bit more of a citrus kind of terpene taste to it [Music] that's really good i didn't want to inhale too much because um i need this to wear off before i leave so i just kind of wanted to test it out i do have that kind of citrusy bit of flavor in that cart and then let me try the other one here real quick this one is called himalaya and it's a grape runs this other one that i have over here that i just took out is their um strawberry shoe i forget the name of it but it is such a pure delicious taste to it these don't taste much at all like weed um but i kind of have that feeling about a lot of carts i don't feel like it has you know too much of a taste so i wouldn't say necessarily that it's different it doesn't taste um i can't get into this one it does wow adult proof too it doesn't taste adulterated or like chemicals or anything like that at all here's this this one is the grape one and again if we flip it over we see that the bubbles just not moving at all [Music] [Music] this one tastes delicious this one and the strawberry ones might be my two favorite vape carts so um yeah i think that it's really cool you could practice your smoke tricks with it um they do actually make me cough pretty hard but i didn't really take very big of inhales just now so it just kind of tickled my throat but with the cards i do get my desired effect that i'm looking for but i would say that it hits you definitely a lot sooner than the gummy so you can start to feel the effects of this within a few minutes but they say give it about 20 minutes to fully feel what you're gonna feel and then if you feel like you need more go ahead and take another hit now with delta eight a couple things that i found to be incredibly interesting was that you can build up a tolerance to it a little bit faster than you can with traditional weed delta nine um however the reverse is also true in that you can basically detox and lower your tolerance at a much faster pace than with delta nine so um me personally i did feel like when i very first started with the gummies one was very strong for me so i always suggest to people to try just a half a gummy at first and kind of understand how that feels now that i've been taking at least one a day for about three to four months or like 90 to 100 days i can take the one and i'm like perfectly good in coasting um throughout the entire day obviously but i can take the two to achieve what i did get with one four months ago that's that that's where i got to be about the same level but then again if i take a week off from these entirely i can bring my tolerance right back down and be right back to it you know and then with the cards again i've also realized that they last a really really long time longer than the typical i feel like i don't hit it as much because i feel that desired effect i'm right away and i don't really struggle to try to keep it or maintain it like maybe you hit it a couple of times a day um every couple hours just take one hit and it really is pretty good just like that um but if you are looking to actually get that high elevated feeling then to just hit a couple hits i feel like you just don't need as much of it even though it's less psychoactive i feel like you get to that desired effect of what you're looking for a little bit sooner than trying to like really take it to here you know so that's it that's everything that i have for you guys today um i kind of want to do a little vote and see what their next flavor should be i think that this community could kind of sway them into perhaps making another flavor so i'd love for you guys to vote down below which fruity flavor you'd want to see next they already have blueberry watermelon sour strawberry and mango and i'm kind of on like team peach here because i love anything like peach rings anything peach flavored is freaking phenomenal so i'm gonna vote for peach but i mean think about it you guys go into your emojis and figure out which emoji you like there's banana grapes cherry peach pineapple oh my god maybe a peach pineapple that would be really good like a combo one oh my god that would be delicious okay so let me know which fruit flavor you would like them to feature next as far as the gummies and um that's it that's everything that i have for you guys today thank you all so damn much for being here i love you i love you i love you and i will see you next time bye", "XwDbtYweiVk": "you're watching B TV welcome back to B TV a year ago this next company was number 12 in its category today they're number one by a wide margin in the cannabis edibles market in California the largest legal cannabis market in the world plus products makes gummies so how do you create such a successful brand and become a revenue generating company so quickly to find out we spoke with the company's two co-founders Justin crunchy Quinn and Jake hi mark we started in edibles because we thought that was the place where there's a lot of things that can go wrong and if you get them right what you've done is actually create a great brand however on the way to making gummies jaqen crunchy made cannabis gum with a little help from Jake's parents the only space that we could afford was his parents free garage so who we've moved there and we built a makeshift cleanroom for the first six months of the company it was basically R&D facility office manufacturing facility packaging facility it was everything gum eventually led to gummies with his knowledge of cooking from his career as a chef and his experience in the cannabis industry Crunchie was well aware of what it would take to make a great gummy these look really good cooking especially at a high level is the blend of art and science it's the ability to give people the experience that they want the experience that they didn't even know they wanted a lot of the infusion process is extremely scientific and the flavors and how we do special additions and how people feel about the products that's the artistry what we've done is taken gummies which can be a category where it's tossed into different bags or boxes that can sort of not be an attractive format and we've made them really small which was hard to do to make them precisely dosed and then put them in a really convenient when you turn the top off of the tin what you have is all of the gummies right there and their beauty and their deliciousness it's a really important part of the customer experience that has made us products so successful in California looking good and tasting great our only part of the equation one of the hardest things to do really well in a manufactured cannabis product is to get the dosing exactly right every time if a product is too strong people wind up in the couch and you never want to try the product again if the products too weak you don't move it on and so getting that balance really between the two is the most essential thing to the customer and having the right selection of flavors has definitely helped win over customers we look at what people are enjoying in other parts of the market not just gummies just you know flavor trends things that people are really into now with the special editions we look at the short term trends and also things that we've never seen before that we know that we can actually execute so we do both seasonal and we do things based around holidays because you're selling an experience it's tapping into the desires of people around specific times and what about tapping into markets beyond California as more and more states legalize it's really important to think through what's going to make a successful national brand a plus we do one thing to make manufactured cannabis products and it puts us in a unique position to actually do that same thing in every state and in other countries in a way that is simple for customers it's simple for partners our ingredient suppliers understand it and the focus of the company is all line on one goal which is making really great products but with mainstream success comes responsibility I think there's an opportunity for the entire cannabis industry to actually bring us from where we are today to be a more mature responsible and adult this tree if you look at the alcohol industry they put a lot of time and effort to make sure that drunk driving wasn't something that people wanted to do at plus we hope to be a leader in those companies who are helping others to understand the benefits but also some of the potential downsides of cannabis we think all cannabis companies should do the same we work every day to make products that we like to say would make our grandmothers proud there's a lot of heart and soul that goes into every single product that comes about out of our factory and that's why in every package it says made with love in California plus products has recently launched mints and with the acquisition of good co-op will be selling baked goods also made with love [Music]", "0g1Gn7OQk20": "[Music] okay guys we are doing the flourish gummies in the cub watermelon 100 milligrams of THC already how one of these had to he's kind of funny they're not delicious in my hair supposed to be in a bun but it's not delicious and good like the Caminos I kind of real strong marijuana taste to it really strong they don't taste like delicious but we're gonna seem to get a sign sir we're going to see if it gets as high so I'll be back about an hour to let me show you guys real quick the ingredients my father seen hold on guys you kidding me let me do this right you guys good morning this morning here like that and just won't come back too long ago we talked about those flourish gummies okay first of all I'm gonna be completely honest with you guys I took them and as they went on I literally forgot that I even consumed the gummies that's out but I forgot that I consumed the gummies and during the whole day I didn't really obviously I didn't feel anything really because I forgot that I even took um basically I didn't feel really much of anything maybe it's because of what I ate maybe because my maybe I should have a after maybe I know I ate after a wild learned later on that day but my shirt but time on how long I waited to eat but I think probably I ate too soon and I didn't make the hi I'm gonna make me hi didn't I bring the high up all the way but um I don't know I like some down on me because maybe I ate or I don't know my tolerance is too high I'm not trying to say that these gummies will not work for anyone else they just didn't work for me my tolerance is really high from marijuana you know so I mean like the next person they probably will work for you but with these do not work for me didn't taste that great they weren't delicious you're trying to get us give us someone that doesn't want but just basically if he gives us someone they know they're consuming marijuana because it tastes like it like there's no there's no hiding the fact that it's not and that's I hope this video could help so it out peace out toodles and happy trust all my happy trailers and just another thing to just because it didn't work for me does not mean I have to say this again it doesn't this because I didn't work for me does not mean that it will not work for you okay think about your tolerance I haven't stigma to this I hate staring into the actual like lens because my eyes getting it cricket but this is because I didn't work for me does not mean no will not work for you I hope this would help someone out peace out toodles and Happy Trails don't have patrols out there", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what you solo today don't forget to check me out on instagram at the NJ chef don't forget to check me out on medical edibles calm every

guys welcome back thank you so much so somebody asked me a few weeks ago if I could do nerds ropes and to be perfectly honest had no idea what those work so I googled those little puppies and found out that they're a gummy candy covered in nerds who sew off my kitchen I went a little experimented little tickety-boo and look at what up I can make your it's ropes so I am going to bring this recipe to you so without any more in further babbling here let's jump right into those ingredients what we're going to need and then let's get these guys made alright so the ingredients that we're gonna need for our nerd candies so this recipe is basically my W candy recipe with the cooked syrup and the reason that we're using the Kochs syrup is is going to help with those candies to stick better than just using the gelatin one so with that set you're gonna need about three or four boxes of the large nerds or about seven or eight of those small ones that are the two flavored ones you're gonna want one to two boxes of cornstarch and don't worry you can reuse it we just sift it up and you can reuse it over and over and it doesn't go bad so not a problem plus it's not expensive you're going to want two boxes of the small gelatin the three amps or the 85 grams two of those want three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin or three or three packages of the Knox a quarter teaspoon of kaurav cannabutter and we're going to melt this 1/2 a cup of either kanna syrup corn syrup or you can use inverted syrup if you don't like invert sugar if you don't like corn syrup and we're going to split that quarter in our gelatin part quarter in our candy syrup we're going to need 1/2 a cup of we're going to need 1/2 a cup of liquid so I like to use the kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters ones because it gives it extra flavor than just using water and it's pretty much like using water so you don't have to worry about things going bad so these are great to use so I'm going to use use a half a cup of this to bloom our gelatin and a half a cup for our mixture then for additional flavoring I know I feel I know these could be a little bit difficult to get is I use two tablespoons of drink crystals so I get these at the bulk barn Jurek from spring onwards they have me during spring in the summer during the winter they don't carry them or other box stores the stores may carry them otherwise you can just use the Lorena's oils if you want to add some additional flavoring but it's not really required because of all the nerds on it so it's not that big of a deal and that's everything that we need for the gelatin part for our cooked syrup we need 1 K 1 cup of sugar and again if you've got candace sugar you can divide that up a quarter cup of can of sugar to three quarters of a cup of regular sugar as long as you equal one cup of sugar it doesn't matter a quarter cup of water and a quarter cup of our corn syrup and or kit canister that's it for our syrup oops sorry and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid goes into our cooked syrup as well then for the glue that they that they used to stick on top technically they're nerds the Nerds use confection confectioners glaze unfortunately being in Canada wasn't the easiest for me to get but an alternative for an edible glue and glaze is to use tylose tylose powder and water so I'm going to show you how to do that and this is what you're going to need to this stuff a day before but it's super easy it just happens that time to do whatever it needs to do but it works great if you can't get the confectioner's late and for and then to make our clear to make our edible glue we're also going to need one cup of water that is all the ingredients that we are going to need let's get into that equipment there so there's a little bit of equipment this time so let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made alright so the equipment that we're going to need is a double boiler if you don't have a quote double boiler you can always just use a metal bowl that will fit securely into the pot and has enough room on the bottom for water without touching you're gonna need another small or saucepan a small medium saucepan for our syrup point you need a candy thermometer digital or the one that you hang on doesn't matter a couple of spatulas gonna need you're gonna need a pastry brush and I'm gonna use a funnel for putting it into our molds you can get these candy funnels or if your pot has the little specks on it and that will work as well or you can always put it into a measuring cup or something with a spout anything to make it easier to pour cause we gotta pour into some skinny guys offset spatula is something to be able to smooth out our corn starch and you're going to want to get some dowels so I got these at the dollar store in the craft section they're 12-inch by just slightly under a half inch size dowel so you want about half inch sized dowel by about 12 inches as I said dollar store craft stores usually how these pre-cut like so otherwise you cannot just buy one of those read it on once and cut up your own so we need basically one if you can is many has many dowels as you want to make ropes now this recipe probably makes around 10 to 12 I'm only going to do part of that today and the rest of the stuff I'm just gonna make regular gummies and I'll explain why when we get to making them all so if you want a bunch of those dowels a cookie sheet or doing them on and you want to line it with parchment paper another pan that we can use to press down the cornstarch with or something flat that's that's kind of heavy a drying rack and then another pan or something that you can use and we're going to put Phillip put the skittles in to cover them up later on once we get the glue on them so it makes it easy if you've got some kind of pan like that so basically all our equipment you know me I always forget something but let's jump right in and let's get these made so if you go and I'm using the tylose powder as your glues your edible glue what you're going to want to do is to bring one cup of water to a boil once it's come to a boil turn the heat off and then we're going to add in three-quarters of a teaspoon into into our boil water you're gonna whisk that around and you're gonna see it's gonna lump up and it's not all gonna dissolve it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for it to fully dissolve all right so my water's come to a boil I'm going to turn off the heat gonna remove that oh remember that thing that I always tell you I forget yeah it was the whisk one whit so we're gonna add in three-quarters of a teaspoon these are quarter teaspoons you want to kind of story sprinkle it around like so and then you're gonna whisk it and it's gonna stay lumpy a little bluffing like that for a while and every couple every two three minutes you're gonna come back and whisk it around and you'll notice every time you come back more and more will be dissolved and as I said it takes about 15-20 minutes for it to fully dissolve once it has you're going to put it into the refrigerator sorry you're gonna let it cool first then put it into the refrigerator overnight and the next day you're good to go and it lasts for up to six months so you can use this over and over not as well as for your any other projects edible food products projects that you have that you need glue fork so I'm just gonna continue to do that to stir that I'll show you once it is clear and next we're gonna make up our starch molds alright so here's my tylose my edible glue all clear now and dissolved so just gonna pour it into a jar and once that's cool I'm gonna cover that up put it in the fridge overnight alright so now we're gonna make our starch folds and starch molds are what they use in candy manufacturing so there's not a whole bunch of people on the line pop and they've silicone molds they use these huge place with corn starch they stamp in the pattern fill up the molds once they set the plate opens all the candies fall in Iraq all the corn starch falls to the bottom and they reuse it so we're going to make our own makeshift version at home so as I said you need about one to two boxes depending how large betray your you see because you do want it almost look for sickness of your cookie sheet whatever lip on that so carefully pour it into your pan and you want to do it on parchment paper because it's going to make it a lot easier when you need to put this back into the box as well as to get it thin too sifting and again you want to be very careful otherwise it's going to look like Scarface's come through your kitchen this stuff it gets messy again you want to carefully move it an offset spatula works really well so that you can move it and spread it out around your pan evenly so I'm just moving it around here so that is all trying to get it relatively all even so that our moles will all be about the same size and you want to have enough room as I said to be able to make them a little bit deeper there and you don't want to be going all the way to the bottom so once you've got it relatively smooth out gonna Mimi and stuff everywhere so what we want to do is to take another little piece of parchment paper and you want it to be able to fit over top doesn't all stick to our pan place it down on top and then use your pan to press down don't press down too firmly but a little bit just to get that compressed and the parchment will stop of the cornstarch from sticking to the bottom of your pan in defeating the purpose of trying to make a flat surface carefully pick this up so we're good like that there so now you want to take your dowels and that's why I said you want to try and have as many as you as you were going to make because your we're gonna press it down so you take the one with a your dowel and you press one down and rock it back and forth so that it makes a little bit of a wider crevice here or so it makes a little wider it up a little bit wider of a trench and then just leave it and then use your next one just go over a little bit button in half an inch or an inch and again you're gonna do the same thing gently press and work it down so the reason you say you want to use multiple dowels is if I go and I take this out if I took it out and push the next one in it pushes some of the cornstarch into the one that we just made so the multiple dowels will help you from avoiding that problem so I'm just gonna pull the camera in over top here so you can actually see it up close all right so it's that you just go over a little bit here from the other one about an inch is good and just gently roll it into place now if you don't have as many inch you're going to like you can see like I'd oh I'm now gonna take my first one so grab it from end to end with your fingers like so so that you don't interrupt your Bowl and now I can move that one there without interrupting that one and then the same thing carefully take this one and here how're we gonna get one of our box the Nerds I've just put them into a bowl or something for you to make it easy we're gonna fill up our little trenches here with our nerd on here a bowl here no jar from a bowl today and just grab some with your fingers and gently drop them fill out the trench chair you just gonna drop them along the bottom don't fully fill it up we just want to line the bottom of it and then anywhere where there's naked spots that we miss don't worry cuz we're gonna glue glue bunch on afterwards so going along do that my trenches removing the dowels grab them use your fingertips in the end to gently pull them up then once you're done filling up your molds there with nerds you're going to carefully place the tray into your freezer so we're gonna make our mold nice and cold nice and cold so when we drop our candy syrup it's gonna start to solidify and grab onto those candies really quickly but you want to be very very gentle because it'll fall easily and yeah you don't want to do this all over again so first case scenario you make a mess him if you have to redo it just to sift out your cornstarch and your nerds and just redo the process so the first thing that we want to do is bloom our gelatin so I've got 1/2 cup of and this has got to be cold but liquid needs to be called 1/2 cup of our I use the kool-aid jammer and then you're gonna sprinkle evenly on your gelatin all over the top and this is to prevent clumping and then you want to mix it in until it's all dissolved and while you're mixing it'll start to bloom and it should call right automatically kind of go to the texture of applesauce if it doesn't your gelatin is not is not very good it's lost its Jo so you don't want to add a little more or get new stuff so we're just gonna set that off the side until we need it God needs about five at least five ten minutes to bloom so the next step is going to be our gelatin side that we're gonna do you're gonna turn your heat on to medium low you're gonna boil a half a cup of your liquid so I used a half a cup of the cooling water pour that in and you're gonna stir to dissolve your jello and then just note for your double boiler don't forget to put your water in and also you your water should never touch the bottom of your pot so I said you just gonna stir this up until that just starts to dissolve and if you're using flavor drink crystals I this is where all added in as well so it can dissolve at the same time I add about two tablespoons as I said if not you can use the Lorraine's oil and you add that more at the end so we just stir this until it's all dissolved until it until it starts to dissolve then I'm gonna add in our corn syrup and our citric acid now that my syrup is mostly the sugars not have mostly melted I'm gonna add in 1/4 cup of my can of syrup or as I said you can use corn syrup or inverted sugar and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and the citric acid and the syrup they are both for preventing crystallization well the can of syrups add a little extra but regularly corn syrup or the inverted sugar is to help prevent crystallization so again I'm gonna mix that stir that well until it's all combined and everything's melted together in the meantime make sure your can of butter is melted and you're going to get your hand blender ready to so we're gonna need that shortly and you're gorg um so now that our syrup our gelatin and that everything's dissolved now it's time to add in our can of butter and our corn gum so you're gonna take your melted can of butter throw her in mix that around just a little bit then we're going to use each ordered teaspoon of fargo and you're going to spread gently sprinkle it try and do sprinkle it evenly over the top please let it sit for just a moment get your hand blender and we're going to blender up [Music] so you're gonna let that blend that up for about probably about two minutes you want to make sure it's something it's a really wild ball supply then once you're done just let it sit for a couple of minutes for about a minute or two and see if any oil comes to the top raises to the surface and you'll be able to tell that the air the bubbles will start to dissipate and if there's any oil if it's not fully emulsified the oil will come up to the top and you will notice kind of little oil slicks if you do see any kind of little oil slicks just add a little bit more Gorica no more than about an eighth of a teaspoon and re blended with the hand blender until that's gone so you should have one uniform texture and then just turn off the heat on your gelatin mixture here there is enough warm water in in your pot here to keep your mixture liquefied now on to the candy side the candy syrup side so for our cooked syrup you're going to add in your one cup of sugar or I said or your mixture of sugar and can of sugar get add in a quarter cup of our can of syrup or corn syrup as I said use that inverted sugar and our quarter cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid mix those together and you can turn your heat on to high heat so you're just going to continue to mix stir this until it begins to boil once it starts to boil you're gonna stop stirring that and we're gonna cook it till two hundred and eighty degrees so now that it started boiling just do it's just start it just around the sides here I'm gonna stop stirring at this point and then I'm just gonna check my temperatures every once in a while till we hit two hundred and eighty degrees so I'm gonna need to check it right now because obviously we're not going to be there I'm gonna let it boil for a couple of minutes and then I'll check its temperature so I start my syrup has been boiling for a couple of minutes so I just want to see where it's sitting right now because we only use a quarter cup of water and we're cooking a high temperature it will get to the 280 very quickly so already at 270 almost there just after 2-3 minutes 280 once it hits your temperature pull it off and allow it to cool for until it hits about 240 so why I like to set it on a stone on natural stone like granite or any natural stone it helps to pull the heat out thicker or if you've got a trivet that helps as well so said just let that sit until it hits 240 all right so my temperature my syrup now is at the correct temperature it's down below just below 240 so now I'm going to and the reason you want to do that is if it's higher it's going to break your gelatin so we don't want to do that so now we are going to pour our gelatin syrup into our candy syrup if that well mixed well together and if you found that your candy syrup has solidified on the bottom or along the sides you can put it on to low heat just to melt that so you're just going to mix this for about a minute or two till they're both combined and make sure to get right on the sides it does like to harden up there see and once everything is all nice together and all melted well together we're going to treat our unflavored gelatin and I recommend kind of break it up into smaller pieces if you can plop her in there see this way again your syrup is not going to be too hot to break your gelatin and this way we get the gelatin all through everything kind of binds there both of those together so you're just going to gently stir that until the gelatin is completely melted so now here's a way that you can kind of give a kind of little pretest to know if your syrup is going to gel up well because on gummies were okay because we can always read about those but these a little harder having all the Nerds stuck to them so we want to get it right the first time just take your syrup take your spoon and allow it to drip off if it starts to solidify in midstream like it'll start to solidify and gel right up while it's dripping you're good to go if it continues to drip like mine is it's going to need more gelatin so what I'm going to do to make sure that that's going to work is I'm going to add another tablespoon of blooms gelatin so I'm just going to go bloom another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid let that bloom and then add that in and that will take care of that problem there all right so I added one tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of my cooling water and I bloom that for about five minutes and added it in and now you can see how much it's thicker and how it'll start to solidify find a mid stream and it'll it'll hold there that's how you should that's a kind of a quick test for you to be able to see if it's going to gel up correctly in your moles before you actually cast them so now we wait to pour it into my little funnel here well shoot and then just line up with your trench and you're just gonna fill up the trench I have to say this funnel makes it really really easy well I needs you then try to free pour it let's go just go along you fill up all your little trenches little cavities and then you take your Nerds actually found it's easier to pour and break from the box so don't bother putting them in a bowl it's just easier to pour them from the box just take off a little lip there so it doesn't get your way and just kind of squeeze it together so you have a little bit of control it'll all come flying out and then you just fill up the box alone and you just want to be gentle with it go easy because otherwise they'll come flying out and don't worry about all the excess that goes off into the cornstarch there we're gonna sift the cornstarch when we're done and we'll be able to retrieve all those I just give it a very very gentle pat you don't look like literally just feather touch it down there you go so we've got our ropes like that so you're gonna put them into the fridge for them to set up anywhere from about a half hour to two hours it can take for your gelatin to set now that our candies have set you're just gonna take them out of the starch mold here and just lay them on to a harsh line drying rack parchment paper drying rack and you're gonna set those out to dry overnight and I'm putting the start my topside is good with the amount of candies and stuff that are on it so I'm gonna I lay them with the starch side up and that's the main side that I'm gonna add any additional candies to that they need you the sec so I'm gonna let those set stay out overnight for them to dry before we apply our glaze all right so now why are candies for setting so you don't want to waste all that cornstarch and all those nerds that are stuck in there so you grab your um your corn starts with your parchment paper inches pull it up like so take a strainer take a strainer and pour it in a little neater than that and you're gonna slip your parchment paper paper back underneath and sift it back onto the parchment once you got all that all the cornstarch sifted through just drop your candies off into a hole here and then you can get your cornstarch box add your parchment again or back in the box and you're cute most of it and once your candies are dry take them off and just slip your parchment paper underneath it's just gonna catch the excess gonna catch the excess glaze so I've done this recipe a couple times using the tylose so I would recommend out of the two I would recommend going with the glaze and the reason is the tylose because we use water it makes them very well make sure candies very wet it does dry completely and that's not a problem but they are very wet they're very sly mean it makes them difficult to kind of work with and sticking the extra candies on so I think the glaze would be a lot better this you can definitely use if you can't get the glaze but I think they set the glaze would be better so a little bit so what you can do is you're going to grab your pastry brush dip her in and just kind of take off a bit of that access and you're going to go along and you're gonna dab it on your candies on your rope and you want to dab it you don't really want to brush because it will take the color off of the nerves their wallet water soluble so I think again using the glaze would help that with that issue once you get it get it blazed on you can fill in the little spots that are miss then just gently put them on and don't try and bustle it too much because I said it'll just kind of slip and slide off but just leave them like so and again we're just gonna dab that on and you don't get one they're wet you don't want to move them because if your ropes can fall apart they can break apart so but I said once they're dry they're really they're good so I know before I said okay we could use a pan to roll them in I found that method didn't work so well because I said after one or two it gets really wet and it makes it difficult to roll in so I found just pouring the freight from the box but is not the best method once you're happy with that that me and again you're gonna let those dry probably about 12 hours to overnight once they're dry they're good to go do not store your candies in ziplock baggies if it's especially for gummies it's not good you either want to store them in glass jars or in cell bags or the miler Ziploc bags those work really well so instead I'm gonna let those puppies dry overnight and I'll show you the finished product and here's our finished product so check them out look I hope they look just like the real things as I said we don't have live here so I don't hundred percent sure but looks like it from the pictures it looks like a lot of fun alright guys so I hope you enjoyed that recipe if you have any other questions or comments please don't hesitate to put them you know where and thank you so much for joining me today you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "sqViTVRUH3A": "what's up you guys thank you so much for tuning in to another episode of couch lock news i'm emma and i'm super excited to be talking to you guys today about the wanna gummies that just launched at move dispensaries here in florida i've tried wanna gummies before in the past when i've gone out to colorado and out of every edible that i tried out there that were gummies they were hands down my favorite so i was really excited that move announced that they were bringing wanna to florida so i could finally get my hands on some tasty edibles so a little bit about wanna brands they were one of the first edible companies to launch in colorado back in 2010 and the thing that makes them so unique is they're made with all natural ingredients they're vegan gluten free and they're pectin based gummies now pectin is a fruit derived alternative to gelatin and it's really great because it also helps the gummy maintain its consistency so you know if you leave your gummies in your car in the hot floor in the sun they're not going to melt they're going to maintain that shape and consistency so it's a really great alternative in my opinion another thing about these gummies is they are distillate infused and they contain terpenes to help determine whether the gummies are going to give you indica effects or sativa effects or hybrid effects or whatever you're looking for one thing that i find curious about that is i am pretty sure that the way terpenes digest through your body they don't pass through the liver and everything so you really don't get that terpene effect off of edibles especially because the thc gets converted into something else which gives you that more like relaxed body high so i'd like to know what you think if terpenes make a difference for you and edibles or not because personally i don't think so but they're advertised as having strange specific effects so i guess we're gonna find out so this is what the wanna package is going to look like you can tell that i have not opened these yet i picked up the blueberry indica ones because i've tried all of the flavors in the past and the blueberries are hands down my favorite that and the mango ones of course we're filming so these child resistant containers are able to open by pinching them on the sides and you kind of like have to pinch it really hard and you just pull off the top the gummies per florida state guidelines are wrapped up in this little baggie with a thc symbol so you know that these are thc gummies i kind of always have a i don't have a hard time opening these bags because i got it like before i could even finish my sentence now one thing that's different about these gummies in comparison to the ones that they produce in other states is florida does not allow artificial coloring in their edibles so these are basically like a light yellow or clear color and they have the thc symbol on those as well these are like kind of coated and like it's not sugar i don't really know what it would be because they're sugar free um but it's coated in like this like powder this crystal thing which helps it from sticking together and getting all nasty in the car or in the heat or whatever but these gummies are 10 milligrams each and you get 100 milligrams per bottle and that's only for 25 dollars which isn't really that bad especially if you get them with a discount or they're running a promotion you can really get a good deal and stock up on some edibles now for my first taste these taste like wanna gummies thankfully personally 10 milligrams isn't enough for me to get any kind of effect off an edible so in order to give you a true review i'm going to eat 30 milligrams because that's kind of like my sweet dose without getting too medicated but i'll definitely get like the effects and be calmed down hopefully so two more um i'm gonna get back to you guys in about an hour an hour and a half and let you know how i'm feeling two hours later it has been probably about two hours or a half two hours an hour and a half two hours um since i ate the 30 milligrams of the wanagamines and i'm gonna be honest like i was pretty high for a moment kind of like almost not uncomfortably but i was definitely feeling good i was relaxed i was kind of like in my mind a little bit i was like laughing at stuff but yeah they were nice they were really effective personally i think these are probably like the most effective gummies that i've had so far from a florida dispensary so i'm going to recommend that you check them out because i'm feeling really good right now and i don't have a lot of anxiety and you know they're just 10 milligrams each so if you're a beginner you can easily cut them in half and get five or just try a 10 but yeah i'm a big fan of the wanna gummies and y'all should check them out thank you guys so much for tuning in to this review of the wanna gummies remove if you like this video give it a thumbs up let me know in the comments below if you've tried the wanna gummies before yet what you think of terpenes being put into edibles and subscribe to couchlocknews if you're excited to see some more videos more importantly you guys stay conscious", "IZ5AS2mBK-w": "what's the hold on YouTube it's the Lauren aka Nubia 420 and today I will be making some storm and gummies into infused gummies with my own homemade tincture that I did here with a little Keith so if you've seen a green dragon video then you know how to make a tincture this specific one was made with Keef there is a video on that so if you're not sure how to do it check it out I will link it up here in in the cards and let's get started so we have gummies you can make any you can make this with any football company our Dollar Tree just happens to have these and we're gonna go ahead and cover them in some nerds so it's going to be the infamous nerd rope but not a rope shake because we're going to use these heart molds here so it'll be a little more adult then we're gonna have a good time so let's go ahead and get started we have our pot here with about an inch of water in it and then we have our mixing bowl and we're going to use this to double boil and then melt down work on these so that we can work with them so let's turn my stove on it turn to medium heat you don't want to heat it up medium-high heat and now we have a double boiler now I'm not the cook in this relationship so I don't make things from scratch so you will never see me making tactically scraps which is a video on our channel if you're interested I like cheap [Music] if you care about the colors of your dummy you should separate them and melt them down by color so just as these nope this isn't the easiest method it no honestly you can probably make some gummies from scratch it should be easier to work with the knees then whatever I had these I wanted to try it so here we are [Music] okay so we are this is what it looks like all melted down we're gonna go ahead and drop something tincture in and we're gonna mix that up so we calculated our texture at about three milligrams per drop and this is about 20 drops right here so we're just gonna throw that anything down this is a Everclear based texture it's not an oil-based tincture I don't know what this will work for William Hastings I'm sure there are recipes out there that use it you have to find one of those recipes this is alcohol you share it with us yes please no other if you know of a recipe that uses real oil-based future luckily in bully evaporate as this continues to heat it just a little bit more the treatises we added it which is good for porn is hormones [Music] Tomic shirts wet distribute it with it I do don't want one go meet us you know ten milligrams and then another tummy is 15 because another one is zero so I mix it up do this is you have to work fast so it's probably not a great idea to do a whole bunch at one time working in small batches it's probably better so don't we come over here I'm actually going to skip the measuring cup then just try to pull it straight into our moon from this bad boy right here so I'm always sprayed with cooking spray so try to help the release be a little bit easier I kept my double boil it is just home low just the case this heart is up to where I can't really work with it [Music] [Music] obviously if you're making these other people don't touch it fingers are you making it for yourself do whatever you want okay so we didn't get the entire tray filled we only have enough for two four six eight piece of seven and a half I want to call that one whole but now they're gonna go in the freezer for about two hours until you know they're nice and frozen never want to take them out and we'll cook them in the nerves and they will let them dry out so that's it into the freezer big deal okay so we grabbed our gummies out of the freezer I took them out after about an hour just because our freezers turned up so high and it's so tiny that it freezes super fast and um we're gonna pop them out and then what you want to do is take your nerve and spread them out on a tray or on a sheet so the phone and you see they're a little tacky but not totally you're just gonna sit them right in that sheet right there and then we're gonna go ahead and coat them for these delicious candies so it's not a rope but it's literally all the same ingredients as the rope but I feel like this is much more manageable a much more manageable tree and they just kind of so you want to let them fall out a little bit because they get tacky as they're falling but you see right now and it's not really sticking it does a little bit but you got to kind of work it and then what's your color these they're going to sit on the countertop now you can cover them with it's how and they'll sit on a countertop for I believe 24 hours 24 to 48 hours to dry out it's something that you want to do to you've got man so this part does take on a little bit of time to do making sure you get good and then we have our test one here that we've already covered as you can see but not too many it's not too bad you mean you just pop it in your mouth and eat it people seem to like them I'm not sure why but this needs on itself alright and here we have the final product our hearts covered in nerd ropes these are that when you sit out for probably a day or two just to dry out and go ahead and eat them be eights I'm already very different very sweet probably 10 years ago but I love these not too sure how I feel about them right now they definitely have a cake that tincture is kick in we will be making some gummies from scratch I won't that will be way up goodies and that will be coming very soon in the meantime it has been a pleasure hope you guys enjoy the recipe let me know if you have any questions my comment subscribe do all that good stuff so have a good one everybody stay safe hope you've enjoyed your quarantine here but you know Rona V out there coming for all of us alright have a good one peace [Music]", "P7aLZ7R5RSg": "you can scratch all ten of them down nothing hi guys welcome back to my channel hope you guys are having an amazing day I'm gonna little awkward position don't think that I'm driving I'm my vehicle my wife is driving though today I am going to be as you guys can see by the title eating a thousand milligrams of edibles from heavy hitters those by far definitely are my I filled in the record those definitely are my favorite edibles they're so gummy they don't they're not weedy at all not too sugary either they're like pretty good I also brought well I didn't bring you my wife brought it for me cuz she knew that I was gonna be thirsty so here we have this big underarm where uh like water it looks like a water tank but it's like cute and yeah water right here prepared we have something's to take care of so - already forgot what we have to do you have to go get our phones replace and then we're probably gonna grab something to eat really sorry yeah we're probably gonna go grab something hopefully that edibles kick in before I eat you know and then we're probably gonna get back home but I'll definitely keep you guys updated so yeah I'm like oh it's not even falling and I was like I did that ugliest face right now it could change 20 milligrams only five pieces a total of I mean 25 20 milligrams each piece and there's five pieces that total up 100 plus 400 milligrams and a pack in my hand focused on me by seven [Music] like I said I'm not driving around she's gonna help because she don't [ __ ] with edible she ready smokes and she's having experience with edible so that's just like I know for her I'm like you should just try like one piece to see how it makes you feel you know not start up with a hoe ass pack don't like start off with a little bit and then make if you need more to use your eye you but no and I'm like no and either strawberry flavor years and like eating candy that much like ever we're nothing here back I have finished all five now what we're seeing to finish you know extra eyes are better even though light it sometimes we'll go we'll be going on like all right it's like all right second bag ding-ding-ding so like usually you would go out like town a lot to a lei or whatever two more hours though and [Music] eating a thousand million the process thinking I don't remember we done the mama I do remember Susie where a couple sleepers in already like I had never seen a cartridge like feature that high because you never take that many acres you only like you coulda cured there you know yeah but like you hit it a lot I love finding like new things like that say I had weed that I didn't even know I had and I find it find it like a month later or like a card like I have a full ass [ __ ] full gram of a cartridge but I didn't even know about and I found it today I was looking through a bag MRT um slowly moving my thumb as well more like I have stitches though I should probably go back like Friday or so to get them removed just to make sure give me a little bit more days have you guys ever had stitches or anything like broken I've never broken a bone but I didn't have this incident this year at age of 21 where I had like black me I don't know what it felt somebody said it was black free-cos at me hello video on it and then my thumb got [ __ ] sliced the [ __ ] I sliced that [ __ ] and wait till what happens next week we'll find out next week no wonder sounds good my astrology said I'm going to find a new pet a straight anymore something's gonna come into my life and I'm gonna keep it but I can't keep it be sure to keep it because it's maybe it's a sign over here alright so actually change of plans so due to the cove it they're not allowing two people they're limiting limited e limiting people so my wife went in I'm gonna go ahead and finish the rest of the 300 milligrams I guess it's meant to be back to back and then I'm so knocked out that I can't hear that she's like trying to open the door and knock on the window and I'm just all [ __ ] blown and so into my sleep I don't you [ __ ] I definitely prefer chocolate Marlo but even there like eating so much chocolate after a while we just like oh you guys and it's all tired I just ate a little snack bully from the brew babe that's a car brand I don't know what it's called a classroom yes tomorrow [Music] the right forever edibles what they're gonna become look not so good anymore because for more one to three 400 600 700 800 then good day friend I have another one if I don't get that [ __ ] look it you can scratch all 10 of them down nothing ah nothing and it's only 1:30 so let's see how she goes for the rest of the day because a lot of times she had a thousand milligrams more than twenty minutes she was asleep but right now we have [ __ ] to do so I'll get our phones so we can't I can't go to sleep you know but wait till we get home what's up guys it's curtain 936 I'm gone we got home and I definitely knocked out sort of have food unlocked out till 8:00 I woke up and then I started eating while we started eating and yeah I just feel like super loved definitely feel it in my body and I can definitely go to super soon well yeah it's pretty chill and would I recommend eating it in the whole process yeah no you crazy yeah let me know down below if you how what's the most edibles you've paid in the Surfing until next time bye", "L2EvOegVsN8": "hey guys welcome back today I'll be showing you how to make peach ring gummies I am including a recipe in this video but you can use any recipe you like you could even buy orange and yellow pre-made store-bought gummies and just melt those down and that will work just as well and this video is going to include some troubleshooting because I had quite a bit of issues making these I had to remould them multiple times I'm gonna show you guys how they started which was like this but eventually I got to them to come out like this here's what you're going to need 1/3 of a cup of water three and a half tablespoons of gelatin 1/4 teaspoon potassium sorbate mixture which I will link how to make below 1 teaspoon citric acid 1/2 teaspoons of peach flavoring oil 1 tablespoon of Tincher 1/4 cup of sugar 1/4 cup corn syrup 1/2 a tablespoon lecithin white food coloring and yellow and orange food coloring the first step is to bloom your gelatin so just pour your gelatin over your dish of water as well as your citric acid your potassium sorbate mixture your flavoring oil and the lecithin no need to stir this just leave it to bloom for about 5 minutes now pour your sugar and your quan syrup into a saucepan and heat that up once that begin to melt you can add in half of your gelatin mixture and then stir that in you're going to add in a candy thermometer and you want to keep stirring and heating up this mixture until it reaches between 200 to 210 degrees once it's heated up to that temperature you can add in your remaining gelatin mixture and stir that in then turn off the heat now I'm just going to pour in my tincture and stir that in and then because I'm going to be doing three different colors I'm going to separate this into different dishes I'm going to be coloring one yellow one orange and this one here is white and yellow I filled up a pyrex dish with very hot water to keep my mixtures warm while I'm not using them and then I'm going to pour my first one into a plastic bag that I have sprayed with cooking spray so it doesn't stick and then I'm going to fill up the first half of my molds alright so you can clearly see I'm having a lot of issues pouring the mixture into the molds it's too sticky it's making a mess and not coming out smoothly so I try to warm it up again and that is not working so I am just going to have to figure out how to fix these and what I decided to do was to take them all out and remelt them with some more water and a little bit of gelatin so I added a couple tablespoons of water a few for the microwave for about 30 seconds and then now I'm going to add in half a teaspoon of gelatin and just mix that in I decided instead of a plastic bag I'm going to put it into a squeeze bottle so I'll have better control of how much is coming out and you can see how amazingly it's coming out it's absolutely perfect I was very happy I also added a little bit of water to each of my yellow and orange but not extra gelatin as there wasn't a large enough amount for it to matter I wanted to try and see if I could put the yellow and orange directly on top obviously I couldn't so that means I needed to leave it in a freezer to cool down for a bit and then after all of that work I realized something very unfortunate and that is that I did everything in the wrong order so the curved part of this mold is on the bottom meaning that I needed to have the orange and the yellow on the bottom and the yellowy white color so once again I am pulling them out and going to warm them up and remould them and then I just threw it in the microwave and poured it back into my little squeeze bottle and everything looks like it's gonna be perfect third time's the charm right let's hope so well after this was done I put them in the freezer for about half an hour and they were good to come oh they look beautiful well after all this hard work I am happy to say they came out very nice they have a beautiful texture they look wonderful hopefully if any of you guys try this out some of my mistakes will help you guys not make them and then I want something to have sugar on them so I'm just gonna throw the ones that have a little bit of imperfections into a container of sugar shake them up and then lay them out to dry and just a reminder that before you cover your gummies in sugar you need to make sure you have let them sit out for at least 24 hours so any excess moisture evaporates otherwise they will become watery thank you guys very much for watching this video if you enjoyed it please leave a comment give us a thumbs up

our second look at cushy edibles and we are looking at another one of their three hundred and twenty milligrams the first time we reviewed their 320 milligram watermelon rings this time it is the

package and I seem to be vindicated at the end when I wasn't as high as I expected to be I was a little high sure but not not three hundred and twenty milligrams worth so this time we're gonna come in even more skeptical and if they indeed fact if they in fact are are exaggerating their potency claims will will put the fire to them so uh one strike against them that we talked about last time was their price I think these were priced at like 15 bucks which is insanely good value for a 320 milligram gummy but I don't think they're 320 milligrams so like after my last review I decided to do a little bit uh to do my due diligence I guess and because they do claim to be lab tested there they do have the audacity to claim that I decided to search them out so I found their website and lo and behold they have a tab for lab results and I clicked that excitedly and thinking I was gonna have to forgive them but then it looks like it's actually oh they only have two lab results posted both for products tested on November 9th 2017 and neither one of those products are in edible flower that they also sell so they have gotten something lab tested but not these edibles which is really really deceptive of them so that one's for your deceptive practices but if these gummies get me outrageously high you know we'll forgive and forget so let's let's see here let's go ahead and open up this package also I found these gummies to be last time oh and these seem to be the same case there's definitely cannabis odor in there these are covered in this weird sugar that is it's like where the cannabis oil is infused it's not like any gummy I've ever had before or edible gummy it's when the infusion is in the sugar it's weirder it's not as bitter as like a net appear or infused creation but it's it's certainly not as bitter it's not as bad tasting but there's something off-putting about it anyways let's go ahead and give them a taste these are about the exact same again not disgusting and there are certainly worse edibles out there but whatever that coating is is just it's not pleasant and there's a lot of it so it's just a little disconcerting and it's very oily as you may or may not be able to see so that's something to look out for if you're really sensitive those kind of things and that guys is gonna do it for this first half of this review here I'm gonna finish off all these gummies unfortunately and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in about two hours to let you know how I'm actually feeling do you see if this product is worth its weight or not thanks so much for watching weeds guys I'll see you soon [Music] Oh guys I am back it has been two hours since I had 29 of the 32 cushy edibles gummy bears I could not stomach the last three I am sorry if you consider this review incomplete my apologies I got 90% of the way there literally it's just that the closer you got to the bottom the more drenched they were in that sugar oil combination and they just got disgusting I mean just disgusting again it wasn't a bitter taste it was just an oily waxy nasty gross gross gross gross gross and that's the least of its problems the most important part of its problems is it's not potent there's there's there's no way there's 320 milligrams in here as a matter of fact I mean I feel less high than I had with the watermelon rings granted I've eaten a little bit less but I feel a whole number point less high than I did before I feel like maybe a 3 right now somewhere in there this is just a bad product Cushie edibles shame on you for lying about

review here on weeds thank you so much for watching sorry I've been such a downer on this review I it bums me out when I have to bum anybody else out but you know I do what I can alright guys well whatever that means thank you so much for watching weeds and I'll see you guys soon peace", "H-KD67mwVC0": "so what does 500 milligrams of THC feel like well I can tell you that it doesn't feel good it kind of feels like this okay so it's a little over two weeks ago that I was given ten drops of cannabis oil and the dosage was played down to me and I wasn't sure exactly how many milligrams I was taking it was said that it was diluted and very weak and I was given ten drops and I have never ever taken anything cannabis related in my life so obviously it's gonna hit me harder I wasn't planning to take it I thought the worst that can happen is I'm gonna be extremely relaxed and calm and I haven't really done a lot of research into THC and cannabis oil and the effects on what it does to you so I took the ten drops under my tongue kept it there had a bit of a bitter taste didn't taste much else and then afterwards found out that there was 500 milligrams of THC in those 10 drops so I didn't know if 500 milligrams was a lot or not because I've never really put much research into the actual effects and what the dose is is law when I read online that 500 is extremely high and I was seeing a lot of people there are regular cannabis oil users or THC users I saw how it affected them I thought to myself well I'm either gonna feel weird and go through like a sleepy zombie State or I'm just gonna feel okay so an hour went by I felt okay and I decided to leave the house because I actually forgot that I taken it I carried on swimming and we were doing a whole bunch of things as I was leaving my skin was so hot like it suddenly felt like in that split second I was fine doesn't feel anything in the next second it just hit me and my skin felt so hot like there was a con air blowing on me and it honestly felt like heat a so I went up to it and I faltered and when I put my hand closed it felt like cold air but as I stood back that that air blowing on my skin for that I was on fire I literally felt like I couldn't handle the heat the next thing that happened is just almost like the wall closing in and like tunnel vision and it was just black everywhere except right in front of my eyes and it felt like like like falling or furutaka like you at the top and as you drop it's like that whoop kind of feeling like everything closing in your stomach jumping and I was horrible I felt like whoa something's not right and then I remembered I took ten drops of cannabis oil and I thought to myself okay maybe it's bringing on some anxiety because I've suffered with anxiety attacks and I managed to calm myself down over the years and control it it just got worse and worse and worse my heart rate shot up so high that it I could feel it jumping on my chest now thought okay it's definitely anxiety but my heart the way my heart was going and felt completely different to anxiety so on my very very bad anxiety attacks where I've got rushed to the ER I had a heart rate of 140 beats a minute now if you think about it to put it in perspective your resting heart rate is about 60 beats a minute it can range between 60 to 100 but usually your resting heart rate is about 67 so 140 is for me if I'm boxing or if I am on a treadmill and I'm running or on the elliptical machine or skipping doing those intense things your heart rate is about at 140 so now I imagine being at a resting heart rate and suddenly shoot up to 140 where it feels like you're running on a treadmill and you're out of breath like you you're running that fast but you're not so your breathing doesn't match your heart rate your brain doesn't match your body's activity and everything's just out of synch so that's classic anxiety symptoms I thought to myself I just gotta calm down so much my heart rate shot up to a hundred and seventy two beats a minute now that's the highest I've ever seen it even when I've exercised and when I used to do MMA training my heart rate ever used to go to 172 I think 165 was the max I've ever seen my heart rate I felt like my heart couldn't take it I had this burning sensation through my chest like almost like when the letter s it is building up in your body and you're training hard and you feel like your muscle cannot take the weight if you lifting a little bit too heavy feels like I'm also gonna take I had that same kind of burning feeling in my chest and my heart was racing so fast on top of that I had this funny feeling like it was it was just like my heart couldn't cope with a the beats per minute and I lay on the bed I got managed to get to the bed and I was struggling to speak because my heart was going so crazy that I couldn't get the words out like I was freaking out inside and I was told with it that's the weird thing I didn't feel the effects of the THC besides those physical responses like I was I was going through all of this but in my mind I'm like just relax it's anxiety and even though my heart was that fast I'm like you're just gonna freak yourself out more and I was talking to myself to calm myself down using my diaphragm to breathe and slow my heart rate slow my breathing control everything but it just got worse and worse and worse when I checked my heart rates again and weights up to 180 and it wasn't like a panic attack where it stays high for long and then oops it just stayed constantly a tip from 180 dip down to 172 to 165 and it didn't go below 165 it was between 165 and 172 for about seven hours so even though the HC is considered safe there are extreme cases where there are complications so if your heart rate stays too high for too long you can have a heart attack my blood pressure was extremely high eventually we call the paramedics because I didn't feel like I was gonna make it now I've seen lots of stories of people taking too much and especially if it's their first time they think that they're gonna die and they have anxiety and freaked out I've been through so much anxiety over the years and has so many anxiety attacks where I was rushed to hospital and this fall so different my mind was still there like I was still thinking everything and I honestly felt like I was I was blacking out and my heart was going way too fast and my heart couldn't take it they called the paramedics the paramedics came my heart rate was still extremely high my oxygen saturation was so low because I wasn't breathing properly I was trying to control my breathing so much that I eventually slowed my breathing down so much that I stopped breathing basically they had to stand over me and told me to take deep breaths because I basically lost respiration and I wasn't getting enough oxygen in my body so I made a conscious effort to suck in air but I struggled so much to breathe it's almost like a disconnected feeling and I have read that so that you could become disconnected but you don't know where you are I knew exactly what was happening around me I could feel every single thing I could feel muscles in my face I could feel the inside of my ears I could feel all my muscles I could feel everything it's scary because then you start feeling so lame almost like I couldn't really move much then I would try shake myself like just like the little jerks and jumps to like wake myself up because I could feel like I was slipping away - I don't know passing out or blacking out and the funny thing is in that clip where you see me laying on the bed there my blood pressure was so high it was 190 over a hundred ten I think somewhere there and I thought I had glasses on I'd fought like you know when you put glasses on they're a little bit too tight and you can feel the bands on behind your ears I could feel that and because my blood pressure was so high my veins were so tight there I didn't have two losses on it was just those veins and the whole time I thought I had glasses on because of that feeling my blood pressure was extremely high my heart rate was way too fast and that's lost him for seven hours it's the last longer but off those first seven hours those were the worst so having a heart rate go that fast for that long it can be dangerous and having a blood pressure that high and if it rose higher along with that heart rate is extremely dangerous you could have a stroke you can have a heart attack it's very easy so even though it is a natural compound and there are no reported deaths from cannabis the complications or ever stating and I've never felt that scary in my life through all the anxiety attacks that I had and everything that I've been through with thoracic outlet syndrome that feeling right there was the scariest feeling I've ever had when I had anxiety I used to think that I was gonna die and eventually you know you're not gonna die even though you feel like it with us I just I couldn't control it obviously I take it such a high dose that my mind was only focusing on negative things as much as I was trying to stay positive and talk myself through it and the paramedics actually brought the stretcher they wanted to take me to hospital if my blood patient didn't go down and they stayed with me for a quite a while because I saw such tunnel vision and my blood pressure was so high I think I just like to zoned in I honestly thought that they took so many hours to get there and it felt like it was nighttime reading where in the clip you can see I'm laying there as it's fall early evening I think there was 10 past 6 or so so I was really like out of it I doesn't feel good at all my whole family around me none of them had ever seen me look that bad I didn't see myself making it out of it my heart was feeling so strained it was about three days after that that I still felt like I couldn't do anything because just getting off the bed walking around the house I felt like my heart was pumping so hard like it like it was overused then drained from the day before so it was just like the next week I had no energy I had left so much energy I wasn't myself at all I doesn't feel good I had the worst headache and obviously such a high dosage was way too high for my body to handle and I had no tolerance to it and it wasn't something that I've ever wanted to try or thought to try so it was a stupid decision to even want to try it and that's why I just got to be careful with what you take sometimes doctors will prescribe you medicines and things and they just don't work with your body they react differently and your experiences can be totally different to somebody else so you everyone can be laughing and having a great time and then you are freaking out and having the worst time and just now you get a complication and like I honestly thought that I wasn't gonna make it and it was an exaggeration because when I look back at the footage that I have the way I look in the video freaked out and not looking good at all my heart rate I got felt that and I can still feel that I can think about it and feel that scared feeling that I felt and it wasn't just because I was having some weird experience from the THC it was just it was pure anxiety and pure fear and yeah it's not something that I enjoyed at all I know I should have researched first it was one of us things that happen so fast that you make a stupid decision and it can affect you it was one of those kind of things because I love to research everything down to a tee before I take it when I had my thoracic outlet syndrome when I was on tremor doll I took like three tremor dolls and I threw the Box away because of all the first of all the way it made me feel I fall I couldn't feel like myself didn't take my pain away and all the side effects so I threw it away and cured myself naturally and this was just one of those things where it wasn't planned at all and just happened like in that split second I was like okay let me just take ten drops I mean what 10 drops gonna be and ya had the scariest 7 hours of my life fortunately I came right I eventually managed to stand after seven hours I managed to get up stand I felt horrible and weird and zoned out but I felt a little bit more relieved that I felt like myself I felt like it just slowed down enough to a point where I felt I felt okay and I could I could go home so yeah that's my experience it's a horrible experience now I know there's I've really got so many messages from people all over saying it took too much and if you want the right those who just message me or if you want proper CBD oil with no THC I'm not interested in any of those things I'm not interested in any of those kind of questions telling me that I took way too much because I know it took way too much for myself but this was just something I thought I'd share because there are so many websites that you read and and obviously it's promoted as a safe thing to take and obviously if it's measured properly and in the right dosages then it can be safe and it can be useful for many things but if you're just taking it and you don't have any knowledge about it and you're taking too much like I did it can be scary and it can be dangerous and just now you're taking a higher dose and your body can't handle it and you end up having a heart attack or stroke or something that could have been avoided because you don't know enough so I hope my experience can just hope somebody make the right decision and not just take some research first I have been struggling to train I've been back to training maybe once or twice but because I've been so busy at work I haven't like got myself back into training and making videos on regular basis so I'll get back to making all my podcast series that I was trying to work on before all of this happened I hope this can help somebody and at least make them think before they try something I'll see you guys soon", "gvzv07w2RY0": "[Music] welcome to true buds TV it's your buddy jack reviewing the Camino gummies here the wild berry indica five milligrams a pop I've already enjoyed I think let's see how much I got left one two three four five six seven eight eight left it's 40 milligrams I have enjoyed 60 milligrams and I've taken those at night this is a nice indica helped me to sleep let's see I think the first time no each time I had six for my head seven either way I've taken 25 to 35 milligrams and I feel it's consistent it's good I do recommend the Camino I recommend all Cuba products they deliver potencies their flavor is phenomenal they do that they nail that however when I buy again personally we're good look at this that's a fair amount of gummies one two three four five six seven eight here a lot at eight oh yeah I think I did actually anyway that's a fair amount of gummies to eat but that being said everybody's tolerance is a little different you know my tolerance is less than some more than others I know people who can eat a lot more edibles than me I know people that if they had half to a quarter of this they would get late and probably fall asleep so with all these edible reviews this isn't me talking my experience is how much I take what works for me the most important thing you can do for yourself is experimentally but you know take a couple see if it works that's what I did at first now I know my sweet spot is like 20 to 30 ish depending what I'm doing if I just want a nice little kick nice little feel calm down I have to but right now I'm go for two for five that's thirty milligrams of delicious wildberry indica it reminds me of those Welsh's fruit snacks the wild berry ones I don't know if you've had those flavor is really good I really like their packaging too on this one especially got like a pink Scott pink outdoors got like water running trees it's supposed to transport you to what did I say California state of mind overall five stars because it's a legit product but personally I don't know if I'll buy again just because I have other edibles I like a little more nothing against them I'm definitely gonna get the sativa however I think it's like a pineapple habanero something like that maybe the mango habanero something with some spice in there which I'm excited to try because I love spice I love mixing sweet and spice but I'm going too long here I'm gonna come back to you in about an hour and a half talk to you when uh these indicus kicked in I will label Oh get ready for bed and I'll see you guys okay so I'm gonna be completely transparent here with you I didn't take six of these last night lay down with my girl watch black mirror if you haven't seen that show it's pretty badass anyway I've even finished the episode and I knocked out after six of these it was like a 15 hour work dad maybe that play part in it but like I said the previous two times I've had the you know 25 to 30 it did the trick it mellowed me out i chilled for a while the hay woke up ready to get it feeling great today got a couple truebloods meetings one for the true buds tank top I am excited about and then another one with a local cannabis company and I don't want to save their name because we haven't really committed to anything but should have some fun videos coming through that soon I'll catch you guys on the next one I do give this five stars I do highly recommend it and maybe pass out got Java that's what I want with an indica especially if I'm eating it late at night like Sam I get ready for bed I didn't think I was actually gonna fall asleep and go to bed but it happened it happens when I take it to you I'll stay up I'll make sure to stay up and give you a full review on that one yeah camino a wild berries and i like how for the effect it says chill I feel that the Camino truly encompasses that chill factor just like you it's actually turning in I'll see you on the next one coming at you yeah this is worse than Mary Jane I we ain't do this for my stoners and from my cannabis enthusiast talking edibles ain't bringing comedy let's get it time to pass it to the left and we can have a smoke session hey yeah true love for my troopers light it up and I'm on it this might take me way back sweet man I got five on it and the cutter sativa anything that you need break it down like the weed", "0gsvUuwBZVo": "hey everybody welcome back it's Master\nBlaster we're back at Johnny's green extractions and today we're in the\nkitchen we're gonna make gummy bears today and we're gonna infuse them with\nshatter we're gonna make 100 gummy bears here we're gonna use half a box of\njell-o two packs of gelatin maybe a tablespoon or two of our vegetable\nglycerin and we're gonna use our shatter here there's seven grams in here this\nshatter has to be decarboxylated which means it has to be heated to change the\nform of it from a THC a to THC so that you can get a medical effect from it and\nwith that being seven grams that will break down into point forty five\nmilligrams of shatter in each one of these gummy bears so they're going to be\nquite strong because they are for our own personal use and basically a medical\nused to help you sleep etc I just want to stress the point here that these are\ngummy bears and if you do happen to make something like this it is so important\nthat if there are children around whether it's grandkids your kids nieces\nnephews friends that have kids any kids that come over you can't just hide this\nstuff you actually have to lock this away because if a kid did get into it\nand they do seem to find things they will be hospitalized so everybody keep\nthat in mind and that's with all all edibles that you make that are THC\ninfused okay so our first step here is we're gonna decarboxylate this shatter\nwe're gonna put it in the oven at 200 and\n50 Fahrenheit for half an hour all right that's our first step here all right everybody we decarboxylated\nour shatter we melted our jell-o mixture it's warm remember everything's in low\nheat now we're just going to melt our shatter right into our liquid here slide\nit over to the heat pretty sticky   okay go we're gonna mix that in here now ok we got our hot liquid here we\nadded a teaspoon and a quarter of food glycerin just to disperse the shatter\nin here now this is a little tricky to do so we've got to move quick here here\nwe go and basically that is it okay everybody this is master-blaster\nsaying thanks for watching give us a thumbs up subscribe peace and we'll see\nin the next video bye guys", "FZD3SldXppQ": "[Music] hello friends welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of that crazy weird confusing and sometimes a little anxiety inducing place called your dispensary and if yours is anything like mine sometimes it is a little overwhelming even for a guy who tries to keep up with all of the different weed products and companies and different consumption methods uh it seems like new things are being cooked up every day in that regard which is exciting to see but can be overwhelming as a consumer today though we're not going to talk about something overwhelming nothing new nothing novel one of the oldest forms of weed edibles that there are is something singular plural um and that that is the good old-fashioned weed gummy yes we are going to be reviewing some weed gummies and one from a favorite brand in our past one uh who is more known for their chocolate bars but now is branching out to the gummy world and that is punch punch edibles a lot of people really like the punch reviews in the past we reviewed these guys years ago they've been around since the um good old uh gray market um more uh only medical days making 200 and i believe 25 milligram chocolate bars uh and they've been around um they continued to exist throughout our new 100 milligram cap era where they curiously uh continued making chocolate bars but they only ever come in 90 varieties there's uh they don't go to the 100 they do 90. why i'm not sure um and it looks like their gummies follow suit as this is a their excuse me tangerine lemon a pink grapefruit citrus flavor all those are citrus fruits assumedly um and it is only 90 milligrams of thc probably shows up a little bit more clearly on those lab testing results in the back or 90.5 milligrams of thc not sure why they don't do the full 100 um but if it's anything like their chocolate bars they you know hit above their weight glass i apologize for the terrible pun i'm sure i've even made it before god damn me um but you know it's uh who knows it's got me talking about it right so this is a 90 milligram edible uh and like their chocolate bars uh they are a more affordable edible uh on the cheaper end i picked this up from my uh beloved dispensary in long beach for 12 buckaroonies and may or may not focus there but yeah not uh not bad for a 90 milligram edible usually trending a couple dollars down from the average so again but you get 10 less thc supposedly uh so without further yammering about this citrus punch fruit snack let's go ahead and open it up see what we got now we got a little dosing guide here uh it shows you what we need we've got 10 or excuse me nine 10 milligram squares because you can divide a square up that way for you geometry fans harder to divide a square into ten very easy to divide it into nine um that's for you arithmetic fans so uh it's got a fancy little plastic contraption very uh uh unnecessary in terms of packaging but you know i've seen more ostentatious but that's a hell of a lot of plastic for no real reason and then we got the extra plastic wrapping this that all says 90 milligrams 90 milligrams everywhere on it oh okay so it is three different flavors of gummies not one giant citrus catch-all smorgasbord kind of handsome looking very starbursty looking and very starburst colored i wonder if pink will be the best here as well let's go ahead and try one of each so i'm going to go and uh like all of our weeds reviews say this every time i review the whole uh product i'm going to review all 90 milligrams that are here i'm not going to necessarily do all 90 right now in front of you but i'll do them over the next hour or so and then two hours after i have that very last one i'll come back to you guys and let you know exactly what we think of these very affordable punch edibles citrus flavored so this pink one is i'm gonna guess the tangerine no this orange one that i've got i'm gonna get my colors right that's tangerine hmm that is a gelatinous cube um quite a bit of weed taste um not as pristine uh a um gummy taste uh or a flavored gummy taste as like a plus or a steezy gummy it's not terrible but there is a definite weed aftertaste to these lemon yum and then for the star of the show the pink grapefruit i'm just going to pretend it's a pink starburst because my mind will make it taste better pink starburst [Music] tastes exactly like it wow okay yeah very strong very strong wheat taste um not overwhelming and you know uh they are more affordable and hopefully that means that they are just potent as af [ __ ] uh and for that we're just gonna have to wait and see i got six more of these guys to go as i said i'll do them over the next hour so how fun was that and once i'm done two hours after that see right back here until then stay high stay healthy i don't know why i tell you to do that you're just gonna see me in a couple seconds anyways i'll see you then [Music] hello guys i'm back it has been uh three ish hours maybe three and a half hours uh since my first piece of the cannabis infused punch fruit snacks um and i am very very happy to tell you nice and simply uh really like this stuff doesn't taste great but it does the trick um even with its 90 milligrams it still feels pretty strong to me um not a lot to have to get through just nine tiny little squares you're good to go or one if that's what your tolerance limit is um yeah and then of course the most impressive part of the entire package is gonna be that price uh usually you can get these substantially or you know somewhat cheaper than other edibles at the same or almost same dosage um and so if these are cheaper for you if these are a couple bucks cheaper than the next level up grab these these will do you um uh they're fruit snacks well i'm always gonna be a chocolate guy uh and i'm gonna always prefer punch bars chocolate bars the fruit snacks um holding their own for punch that's for sure um they're uh two for two on products as far as i'm concerned so that's a big old thumbs up from me uh and that means anytime we do those big old thumbs up we're gonna do a little cherry on top a little something extra that you know not necessarily weed related you can enjoy with or without weed it's up to you it's just a little cherry on top just a little something extra uh and this week uh i'm gonna make sure you guys keep those hbo max subscriptions um from lapsing you don't wanna cancel now you know you've only been a subscriber for however many months it's been around too i i feel like all these subscription services are sort of bundling together in my brain they're all launching at the same time it's all pretty wild anyways hbo max you got that one probably and if you do check out the righteous gemstones there's only one season it's another show from um i was gonna say wonderkind danny mcbride but that seems like um whatever the opposite of hellion kid whatever the opposite of wonder is is kind of danny mcbride um righteous gemstones is the uh story of a christian televangelist patriarch um played by jeff goodman and his three bumbling sons one of them played by danny mcbride who's also a show co-creator um and uh it tells the story of what a bunch of bumbling hypocritical [ __ ] the leaders of a massive um uh christian organization are and it's very funny and um judy one of the children of um jeff goodman the children of the patriarchy one of the main characters of the show the daughter uh one of the funniest performances i've seen in my entire life had me laughing constantly uh this cherry on top is for the righteous gemstones but there's an extra cherry on top of that cherry for i can't remember the actress's real name her name is judy gemstone in the show it's a great name judy gemstone try saying it yourself judy gemstone big thumbs up punch citrus tangerine lemon pink green food big thumbs

use by all that I'll have picks up a note let's try to open because they're a pain in the ass not just like these things really don't know so there's like the little lips sealed down in there you take

there's pretty much very slim chance you're gonna be allergic to anything that's in this there's no milk eggs fish felt shellfish tree nuts peanuts wheat soy were used during production of this product so pretty much almost hit just about everything but thank you [Music] about six or seven ingredients to actually make it [Music] we've got your little scan codes for your testing results scan

hook so I was like how I gotta try these grab some of the blue radish play some blue raspberry may definitely pop off tonight nice and strong which was resin so I'm gonna jump out of here maybe do a update and a dab let you know how I feel usually these I take to relax my body wind down I guess put the end of the night they're more of like a pain and the relaxer but I'm jumping out much love respect BAM later [Music]", "EHBqjp1NS7o": "what's up guys Sara here and today I want to show you guys how you can easily calculate dosage when making your own edibles so the first thing to understand is that the average dose is considered to be ten milligrams if you're new to using cannabis or you have a really low tolerance level you might need like half of that maybe even less if you have chronic pain or your chronic user you might need considerably more so it's just good to maybe aim for the 10 milligram mark and when you eat your edible eat like half of it wait the 60 to 90 minutes and see how you feel and then you know for next time maybe you need the whole thing maybe you need to maybe you need even less okay but when we're calculating the dosage when you're making your edibles at home it's kind of nice because you can gate you can make them basically cater to exactly what you need based on your personal requirements so what you want to start off with is some cannabis obviously and this is more than a gram but like just for simplicity sake let's say this as a gram of cannabis now when we're talking about dosage we deal in milligrams like I said the average dose is 10 milligrams so I'm gonna take this one gram and convert it to milligrams one gram of cannabis is a thousand milligrams okay and then if you know the strain then you will know what the dosage is of THC in that cannabis so some strains have 22% some have only 12% the average is 10% so if you don't know what it is go with the 10% mark but obviously it can vary quite a bit it's best if you know what the strain is that's that you're using so we've got a thousand milligrams in our one gram and for simplicity sake again we're gonna state we're gonna go with the average teach the content which is 10% so 10% of a thousand milligrams we go 10% times a thousand I got 100 milligrams so in that one gram of cannabis there's a hundred milligrams of THC now let's say I'm gonna make a batch of cannabis infused coconut oil so I'm gonna take a cup of coconut oil I'm going to infuse it with cannabis and then I'm gonna use it to make something gummies or cookies or whatever okay so I have my one cup of coconut oil I add my 1 gram of cannabis which is a thousand milligrams which contains a hundred milligrams of THC so I know now that in this one cup of coconut oil there's a hundred milligrams of THC now when I go to bake with this let's say again for simplicity reasons or sake I am going to use that whole cup of coconut oil and in a bake a batch of cookies and I got 25 cookies out of that batch so I've used the whole cup I've used the hundred milligrams of THC and I got 25 cookies so I go 100 milligrams you know that was in that recipe divided by the 25 cookies so I know that each one of those cookies has 4 milligrams of THC in it and like we said the average dose is 10 milligrams so this would be a really good like starter amount for somebody you can have one cookie which only has 4 milligrams of THC see how you feel next time maybe you need two cookies or next time you make a batch of cannabis infused coconut oil maybe you use two brands or three brands or whatever depending on what you need personally so that's a really easy way to we calculate dosage when making your own edibles so that you can better control your own medicine and how it best works

baking", "3y4TTMbD2tI": "okay so the last time I was sitting here face to face with you guys I was talking about Coco dogs do you guys remember what that stuff was that was a weird chocolate like candy that kind of looked like actual little green dogs in a glass jar if you guys don't know what I'm talking about I'll have the link right up here in the top right kind of give you up to speed but I need you more recently I actually got something else in the mail and I want to talk to you guys about that because other than the coconuts which are actual candy this stuff you're getting that camera guy this is just CBD stuff and I actually have another packaging tube that helps matter of fact the company of this the acronyms in the name so look at that so this stuff is actual CBD infused gummy candy and unlike the last stuff that I talked about that this stuffs are actually kind of real it's not it's not just like 100% candy chocolate that's made to look like you know a green ugh the stuff in this little plastic jars actually I mean if you want to want to get technical is somewhat of a psychoactive unlike um that that chocolate stuff that I talked about before so here's the funny and ironic part about all of this you know you look at these two things these two jars full of you know it looks like simple harmless can you buy it like the supermarket and you think about the last thing I talked about which was the coconut one looks like something that you could get arrested immediately for for just having a jar on your person whereas this this stuff right here looks like something that you could waltz into any preschool and you start handing them out to kids without anyone batting a single eyeball and that's the funny part about all of this like it's just the way look how innocent this stuff looks it's crazy it doesn't it doesn't make any sense because it will in the state of Florida you got to be 21 at least from from what I recall but actually by this stuff even though it's completely harmless so we got here is uh neon poppers and everyone's favorite sour gummy worms i realistically they both taste almost exactly alike it's just they're different shapes from the shapes and sizes you can I don't know if you're getting that camera move but there are a whole bunch of little smiley faces there don't worry it on ecstasy but before I begin guys I'd be remiss to not kind of show you some one of the basics that you need just in case you guys don't really understand is where it comes from well what it's actually all about so many of you probably know about the stuff but maybe this is your first time learning about stuff like what is it I've never heard of this before CBD is that like LSD is it gonna like make me see pink elephants and ceiling fans with built-in swimming pools so let me explain really quick just exactly kind of the gist about it is got my handy-dandy whiteboard here perfectly by the way before I begin I'm not a medical expert so don't take my advice as I'm some sort of doctor or something yeah I totally left that field I mean I know I have the Asian face and everything but don't be alarmed because I definitely left the medical field I left to pursue a YouTube career where I rake in around $13 a month honestly the age of 40 is right around the corner and I still have absolutely no idea what I want to do for the rest of my life so for all you outgoing recent high school graduates that are kind of freaking out about the whole real world thing and have absolutely no idea what they want to do yet don't worry cuz my book - way worse so I'd say a majority of you guys watching this video are probably more familiar with THC not too much can be said about CVD like I said earlier and there's still a common misconception about this kind of stuff especially the top of gram of certain psychoactive effects THC as everyone knows is the most active ingredient in the Disco salad this is the stuff that gets you intoxicated or is in simpler terms hi as I'm gonna do my best to try to avoid super confusing medical top of big science Awards because trust me there was a whole rabbit hole science terminology that this can all really boil down to alright so let's try to understand just exactly how THC you know gets you up there by the way before I begin try your best to not be offended by this little placemat behind here just in case you're one of those type of people basically everyone has in their bodies two types of cannabinoid receptors so let's just call these guys CB 1 and then CB 2 THC only binds to one type of cannabinoid receptor or CB so the cb1 receptors are usually found in the brain unlike the nervous system lungs liver and kidneys and the cb2 receptors are usually found somewhere in the union system there actually might be other CB receptors but that's totally not the topic here by now you probably can guess which of the two receptors THC binds to and that's actually this guy the cb1 receptor so THC see th see why not so THC is basically something that activates or stimulates that receptor and that causes like that cool rewarding effect or like that happy feeling that sometimes people get sometimes too much of it in some cases can get you was seeing like really weird like pink elephants magical dragons or like ceiling fans with built-in swimming pools and unfortunately for some people that cb1 receptor can be blocked and that euphoric feeling that many of groans so custom - just really doesn't work out for them but if you're one of the more majority lucky bunch then well Cheers now one like it's a brother ii cv receptor deals more with things like inflammation and pain management you know these can usually be found in like the gastrointestinal system and this is probably why CBD has a potential to help out people with like PTSD anxiety or other types of weird inflammation that goes on in the digestive tract or like around the body so okay let's break it down in a simpler example and this is lifted from green relief by the way they put it this way just imagine you consume cannabis and the THC and CBD are like a whole bunch of keys which are you know and searched for a lock to open those locks being the receptors these guys they click together with the proper key isn't different messages or scent you know all throughout your body so I'm like THC CBD doesn't exactly bind well with the cb1 receptor so really you kind of just almost don't really feel anything and if you really wanted to you have to take way more in the suggested limit but the worst thing that can honestly happen is like a slate rosiness or an insane state of calmness okay back to the talking Asian you really want to be careful with buying some of this stuff because a lot of the people that sell this kind of product aren't really will informing what exactly they're selling you so like last week before I actually got these things and you know the local vape store looking around for you know products that were similar the only reason I didn't is because the prices online are vastly different than what they are on stores they're actually kind of cheaper online to be honest and the stores are a little over there something like this and a store would probably cost you around 70 bucks online these things are like mid 50s or mid 60s so I walk into the store and I'm like you know I'm asking about him you know I'm asking about this type of stuff and I was asking like what's the whole thing about this almost immediately he just goes yeah bro stuff is totally worth the dude I'd like three or four of them and I was like totally gone in like five minutes dude I was I was I was surprised I was I didn't even know what to say you know before I even go in the store I kind of knew what the stuff was it wasn't well it's not exactly the most complicated thing to understand when he when he said he was gone he was like gone like with like 17 E's that's how gone there's this like his description was and I was you know I was taken aback I was no surprise you know so like three or four seconds after that there was like this like dead silence in the entire store and the only thing that I thought to myself was like dude I really hope this guy does not smoke weed because he's probably the first person that'll overdose on marijuana don't go into these stores thinking that you just found like an insane goldmine of like magical stuff because it's it's not it's not it's not that kind of stuff especially if you're in a state that still doesn't have fly solid recreationally illegal because it doesn't matter if you do that stuff and if CBD does get you like that I sure hope you don't take anything with THC unit so yeah this video is made way back in 2019 so I'm sure 10 years from now we can probably take a look at this kind of video and have a good laugh at it considering the fact like how strict the laws were on like you know this kind of stuff especially the ones regarding disco spinach because those right now even in states where it's legalized that's still federally illegal and it's classified as a schedule 1 drug okay so one of the part that probably wouldn't have you fast forwarded to the the actual product I was able consume a good amount of the bag well in the jar in the past 24 hours I didn't exactly read up on the recommended dose but I guess I should have since this was sort of a hefty sized jar at 300 milligram over 1000 1000 milligrams total so according to the little jar thing here it says that it's approximately 72 pieces you guys can read that there so thousand milligrams 72 pieces you do the math what's a thousand divided by 72 so you're looking about 14 milligrams per little candy thing well this guy this one's I think this I think there was a I think there's more gummy worms was there this had 142 pieces this is the smaller so if this stuff is still closed this has 72 gummy worms in here Oh this one had 148 smiley faces so 1000 divided by 148 okay so about 7 grams 7 milligrams of CBD and you show these little smiley face gummies usually the recommended daily doses I think it was between 15 to 25 milligrams for the stuff don't quote me on that I'm sure everyone's body chemistry is a lot different so in order to affect someone else it could vastly depend on like your size in your weight so my guess is the gummy worms here that have yet to be consumed will be a little bit stronger so I have to eat these in moderation because these guys on the other hand I kind of was just popping in like candy I forgot this was a CBD candy thing like I actually started eating them like as if there were something from like the candy aisle at Walgreens so you pop these in your mouth obviously consumer eager and they literally it's candy there's no hint of like you know when you have like the actual edible stuff from the other stuff you can get a taste of the good stuff this Kandee complete freaking candy so those a bit skeptical at first and how this helps with certain problems like anxiety and pain and you know while I didn't really have the laddering his idea was something that was pretty salient especially when driving around like the state of Florida some of you know me and the majority of my content in this channel is usually you know automotive related useless content right now while I've totally loved cars I absolutely despise driving on public roads that's that's a given fact I love cars but I hate driving and again I live in South Florida so this is kind of known as God's waiting room this is a place where older people move after they've realized that they're too old for other old people they hung out with but you know here's the thing it's not just the elderly which which are kind of terrible at driving a majority the people that drive here I feel like more than half of them have gotten their driver's license from a happy meal and because of this driving around in the state of Florida it kind of puts me on a weird edge the things I can definitely say that this stuff helps me out like like immensely I can't tell you how how much this stuff actually kind of works especially driving it gives me the nice reliable feeling that I'm not gonna get sideswiped by like a Corvette every 13 seconds anybody comes in a whole different types of forms you can get it as popcorn tinctures like something you can drop into say if you don't want any candy if you're someone that's trying to lose weight don't want to delve into the whole unhealthy candy eating process you got chips even got like CBD beef jerky and so they they put CBD and like act like a lot of things nowadays and I know this might be a totally unpopular opinion but I think edibles of anything is the most safest and best way to consume any type of whatever the help no matter what anyone says I think the whole inhalation of smoke and everything really messes with your whole body chemistry you know scarring of the tissue and the lungs and all that weird stuff so hopefully guys this was able to give you a sort of introduction of the whole alternative world of CBD let me know in the comments below it sure not only helped me but it helped anyone else that's trying to you know figure more stuff about figure out more stuff about this stuff other than that guys I got nothing else for you if you guys wanna help support my channel or visit my website it got merged stickers hats and other things literally out here calm and click everything yeah I don't I'm not a very good salesman I just had to say that at least the bare minimum I'll see you guys in the next video in the next vlog in the next whatever peace [Music]", "JUyIqfHWMjk": "honey hole [ __ ] whoa well it's the fifth of July and

okay so get your weed get comfy and let's get started so good so good usually on my channel i'll test out an edible about 25 milligrams which is typically my threshold and then if it's not up to snuff i'll take the rest of it but today we just have a little sampler pack well little taste here which i love i love sample packs they're always so cute and it's only 10 milligrams i haven't had any weed substances today yet so i feel like i'll be okay i feel like this might tickle my threshold if it's up to snow if it's up to snuff i got this from kushagram delivery and they were on sale it was only two dollars so you know a girl had to cop it i love it i love the little sampler pack i think it's so smart because sometimes you want to test out an edible without fully committing so i just it's so cute i'm excited the company that makes this is infused and fused makes a lot of thc and cbd infused gummies um they're also known for their inhalers but i'm not trying that today i will try that eventually i'm excited about that but today we're just trying the little sampler blueberry gummy all of their gummies are made with a thc distillate and that's how they get their edibleness okay ingredients glucose syrup sugar glucose powder food additive and then parentheses gelatin acid treated starch d sorbitol solution citric acid dl malic acid ditarteric acid blue want chc distillate artificial food flavor okay i don't know what a lot of those things are but i'm sure they're delicious okay now it's time to taste it oh in honor of the blueberry i even wore my blue sweatshirt shout out pop-up james for the sweatshirt he was also a dentist [Music] so this doesn't have like a tear open thing so i'm gonna go tear it open with some sizzles because if i use my teeth i know my pop-up's gonna be rolling over and it's great snip snap we got that i'm looking in it you see that it's got little sugar crystals on it it doesn't say oh i'm stupid it does say it says it's a sour gummy i was upset i hope it's not sweet with crystals yum i have a feeling i'm gonna like this but you know we'll see bam check that out check that out damn damn yes please and thank you ma'am okay we like that that's a beautiful blue green it looks like avatar it's like a nice squishy gummy it's a gummy that bounces back you know what i mean it's not too gelatinous oh my gosh oh my gosh i love the sour crystals on it but that's probably just citric acid right let's give this a taste okay [Music] i'm trying to keep it keep the flavor in my mouth mouth feel exquisite okay was it sour for blueberry maybe but not really maybe to a less mature palette but to me not really it was just kind of like blueberry with like the tiniest bit of tart ness was it good the texture of the gummy had the same yeah it had the same kind of texture as a trolley gummy that was good i don't usually like opt for blueberry gummies but if i would opt for one that would definitely be it you don't taste the weed i got like like like a millisecond a millisecond of weed after the fact and it wasn't like a bad weak taste and it was just like gone in a second it was a nice little sampler i kind of want another one but you know it's just a sample bag but now i'm going to i'm going to wait i'm going to shave my legs and yeah see if it kicks in once again always you know do some sort of physical activity don't take an edible and then lay out on the couch because then when you get up that edible's gonna fat hit you this said it's about a two hour activation time before you take another edible sometimes gummies take a little bit longer to kick in we're going to time it out see how long it takes to kick it if it kicks in at all we'll be right back after this length shaven break [Music] that was a cute little devil [Music] ignore the stain it's not a stain i got naira on my sweatshirt so i'm just waiting for it to wash off the legs the legs though good it's two hours after the fact i knew that i would have to think about whether i'm feeling it or not check back in with myself um after the fact because it is less than half of what i usually would take to know that an edible is true to milligram but two hours later only 10 milligrams i i can tell my body is more relaxed you know it's there it's not a dosage that is tailored for me but for somebody else at 10 milligrams is your threshold you don't feel this it did take my threshold so i will mark it as true to milligram for the gummies i thought it tasted really good blueberries not your flavor they've got an array of flavors okay you can find what's good for you i thought it was a really really good gummy i thought it was yummy if i were to pick a flavor i would probably not pick blueberry just because it's not for me okay but flavor-wise i thought it was like it was really good for a gummy it's like what you expect and it didn't have that kind of burnt weed taste that sometimes edibles do have you couldn't taste the weed at all to be honest this edible would be really good for people that don't want to taste weed i don't know how good it would be for somebody who wants to get smacked in the face by an edible because it's a very responsible dosage [Music] responsible so if you're looking for an edible with high milligram and like low amount of food this won't be for you but this is a very reasonable edible it tasted good i could see myself eating more if i needed to it wasn't too it wasn't too rich it was really good it was delicious i really i loved the packaging because it was like a little sample size you know just for people that want to try it they don't want to commit i just want to give it a little little taste it wasn't resealable but since it's a sample thing i'll let that slide i'm sure on their bigger things they're usually syllable flavor-wise i would give it one and a half out of two need leaves packaging i would give it one out of one absolutely and for trunus to mg i would definitely put two out of two so i'm reading this edible four and a half weed leaves out of five wheat leaves just because you know the flavor was there don't get me wrong the taste was great but was it like five stars you know not for me just not for me okay that's okay it would be great to get like multiple flavors as a gift it would be a great little stocking stuffer i don't know if you know how old your kids are but you know i would love to get that in my stocking mom if you're watching this but overall i give it four and a half out of five bead leaves thanks for watching my show my name is eda mckenzie and join me next time when i'll review a different edible i don't know what yet you know but it'll be something until then stay high so good so good so good even though it just very lightly tickled my threshold i probably shouldn't have done that why did i do that um", "4lLn0PhkakM": "[Music] [Music] hey guys mr. and mrs. Smith here and today we're going to be reviewing the heavy hitters cannabis infused gummies we have strawberry pineapple to try today we're actually very excited to try these uh if you don't know already heavy-hitters is possibly our favorite brand I would definitely say I would say it's also primarily smoke heavy hitters for our everyday cartridge and then when we want to like it up a little bit we'll grab some other stuff but heavy hitters is definitely always on a cartridge for us so we're also going to be trying the heavy hares GSC I say trying we've had it many times but we haven't been able to find it for a while not what you are it kind of it kind of went out of stock just weird it used to be available a lot in like 2018 but it kind of just fell out of favor except for certain places would still carry a guy in town by our main delivery service was no longer carrying it but they had it the other day so I had to pick it up cause it's been too long it seems like they almost haven't had it in stock since the name change so JSC used to be Girl Scout cookies I don't know if they changed it in others stances I'm pretty sure it was part of the laws that happened I'm pretty sure it's part of the laws that happened in 2018 for California that's they weren't allowed to call it they can't call it candy I believe they can't use the term candy and they can't use the term anything that could be marketed yes towards children can't market towards children right Paul any so that's why it says gummies or it'll always seem medical or cannabis like that they never never make yeah that would be appealing to a child exactly it can't be bears or anything like that so I mean it's a good law honestly I totally understand why there's some other laws that happened in 2018 which I will give you a refresher on right now now there was some weird stuff that happened when California passed a recreational marijuana back in 2018 I believe it was one of the things that happen is towards the middle of the year they actually switched it to where edibles could no longer contain more than a hundred milligrams per package now if you work in the medical marijuana industry or if you were a user or anything like that prior you know that there used to be packages up to a thousand milligrams in just one treat and what that used to be really good at is you could like just take a nibble off of a treat throughout the day and just kind of keep yourself dosed and medicated off one treat for a whole week basically but they changed it because there were way too many people who would come into a dispensary have no idea what they were doing by one of those really high potency edibles eat the whole thing and then they have a really bad time and end up going to the emergency room they got sick of dealing with that so they made a law saying you can't have more than a hundred milligrams per package there are certain things you can get around that such as cannabutter tinctures and pills those three items you can definitely get in higher doses than 100 milligrams but for edibles and then kind of cookie or anything like that max you're gonna get in a package is about a hundred so today we're reviewing B's from heavy hitters and the way they went about with these twenty milligrams per piece is you can actually rip the pieces in half so it's actually two servings per piece so it actually comes in two to ten milligram servings which I'm pretty sure is the law is that each piece inside a package can only be ten milligrams or something like that I know five to ten milligrams is a state recommended serving I'm not a hundred percent clear on the laws but it's just an unfortunate thing that happened with edibles in 2018 but I am absolutely dying to try these guns so let's go ahead and open up to the [ __ ] strawberry cuz I'm Joey it's been it's been a long time looking for out that let me grab the a7 r3 with the 70s [Music] [Music] yeah we just won't have us we won't help you all this video it's just not working at the moment six and a half hours Nathan I might open the pineapple real quick to maybe these do not open well I feel like we should show just how much of a struggle these were to open just like a montage of the [ __ ] difficulty this is bad this one opened much easier but that first package it just ripped in such a way that it was really hard to open but this is just like the other one has a really strong smell I figured it's it's really strong artificial pineapple mmm it's it's kind of a a bit herbal but not like too herbal it's not like overly pungent or anything like that like you're not gonna have you're not gonna get in trouble they're just keeping these in your drawer or anything like that like no one's gonna smell it yeah I don't know if this has any actual like pineapple juice or anything in it it doesn't have it listed on the ingredients mm-hmm so we're not sure if this is artificial flavoring or real bad no artificial actual coloring and flavor so is that natural flavors that display really use the natural coloring and flavor like or is it a flavor that's kind of that's kind of weird I don't know if I feel someone from heavy Harry's modified food yeah I don't mind it I mean that's just what I mean the people are heavy hitters you might want to put that it is natural flavoring as well like actually specified natural color and natural flavoring because natural color and flavoring just sounds a bit odd it's it leaves it up to the imagination as to is the flavoring also natural or just natural color you're always a nice flavoring this yeah always alright so let's try the pineapple yeah I'm gonna do a full 20 but I'm gonna show the camera how it splits so this is the gummies from heavy-hitters it's a square and if you look very carefully there's this little seam in the middle that if you pull whoops it starts to come apart yes it does if you start to pull it comes apart very nicely into two perfectly even ten milligram pieces so let's start well I'm actually just gonna eat the whole thing at once wait so where's our list of like criteria so I know what the hell I'm supposed to be doing bring it up go on top down your mouth and just roll around a little okay yeah my hands are all sticky now you know I gotta say I'm a little disappointed I'm a little underwhelmed actually I had I had much higher hopes it could just be the pineapple yeah because I mean the strawberry definitely smells better than the pineapple the pineapple is a little strong it's kind of it's very herbal forward which isn't a bad thing a lot of people enjoy that it's not a bad flavor necessarily but it is definitely herbal forward if you're looking for something that you could just totally mound shun and forget that there's weed in it not that we recommend it's not gonna be that yeah definitely don't recommend that but I mean like if you're if you're a fan of someone who like Eric or someone who likes really really flavorful very liked gummies that don't aren't bitter or plant alike at all this is not for you this is made to be strong and to be potent and it definitely tastes like it so keep that in mind and next up we have the strawberry so let's go ahead and pop these open and yeah will rate them in a second let's try the strawberry and I want to go ahead and split this one yeah because there'll be 30 milligrams each mmm much better much better mm-hmm all right strawberry is actually really good um I would say it's definitely pretty it is still has that herbal flavor but um let me bring up the criteria so we can actually start to break these down aftertaste yeah yeah really bad yeah I would say it's a bit odd I I'm almost feeling a little bit um disappointed I know me too it which it sucks because I'm such a fan of their oils but that's where comes in would we be as disappointed if we hadn't hyping it up so much yeah we did we we've also we've held on to these for about two weeks we've been waiting and waiting and waiting to try these specifically for the on camera experience and you know I think that also kind of built it up the fact that we've been we've been like dying sitting on me dying to try them the whole time and I mean they're they're good [ __ ] effects for sure by new user mm-hmm will probably like would probably really like it however its strong grams each heavy hitters recommends 10 milligrams as a dose the state of California recommends that california recommends that I personally have very low tolerance when it comes to most things so if you're like me I would definitely recommend starting with 5 milligrams when it comes to edibles but I mean you've been doing it you've been using medical using marijuana medically for two years yes so her tolerance is pretty high so we can handle the 30 we just say no problem but the big thing is though from let's let's go ahead and actually break this down but the main thing that I'm getting from these is but from trying both of them it is quite herbal forward the the flavor is there the strawberry is much sweeter and more flavorful I would say than the pineapple pineapple is a little more herbal forward as well but let's actually start talking about our rating categories here and give these are actually solid score each [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] we're also gonna open this GSC previously known as Girl Scout cookies for those of you have been in the game a little longer and actually know the OG strings we're gonna be trying that card out today so anyways hope to catch you

best one on the puff cut y'all hear the birds chirping yep and this is sick but it's like they're going to [ __ ] there's a fly back up north very thin it's going to get cold again somebody want to go

milligrams of delta athc so [Music] i was first to it they don't even know i don't even know [Music] that looks like [ __ ] [Music] backyard [Applause] so what about if you could grab that stick what about making like a bridge with the stick that would be a good idea i don't know how are we supposed to get that out there hand it to me jesus christ jacob how you feeling that'll definitely reach this is better than elon [Music] one dude i held on to that all right if everyone grabs a cane they can make it across i just don't want to get my feet yeah dude where are you at [Music] first man to walk on water actually third man easy all right i really want to put this in perspective for you guys so we are out here in the [ __ ] swamp these boys have made a bridge all the way across this [ __ ] swamp and have used stick canes to travel themselves to this island they are pioneers of a new [ __ ] country bro no cap yeah dude this is not hard at all right now it's like that's the plan all right that's a little tricky oh [ __ ] you guys it's fine boys jacob is now traveling through the wild west in this wilderness to go meet up with rick so i can go out to the cool island ah i stepped in [ __ ] ew come on jacob you're good just grab the other tree right here let go of your cane and grab the tree don't let go of your pain all right now [Music] good job jacob how you like the island [Music] you happy good to get outside get outside kids you know stay active especially when you're high it makes it go your way and yeah dude especially when you're high bursts at man it's good to get all high honestly i think it increases yeah a little bit [Music] move faster through your bloodstream quick update we just got back from the swamp and we're all [ __ ] gotcha right now dude i don't even know that's a word like i mean for real like explaining how you explained it to me how light it is and it's like delta a edibles man it's bad like especially with the amount that we're on right now it hits almost like a tab without the psychedelic effects so i mean i'm up wanting to do something you know what i mean like i i just [ __ ] did all that you see so i mean yeah i mean we're we're pretty geek right now i'm [ __ ] high wouldn't you say dude i am like i want a whole another level as soon as we stepped in the house and we were like dylan outside and i actually started paying attention to how i felt in the moment i realized the [ __ ] geek right now i stood in the house and it like immediately kicked into me like i am gone i feel fuzzy like one of tim's skill how [ __ ] up are you right now i'd say i'm starting to come down now probably eat some more but uh like in the woods i was probably like a solid like seven and a half eight like for me the best number yeah for me that's pretty good [Music] all right ladies and gents so it has been about four hours since we indulged into the edibles i'll say about an hour since i hit my 1 000 milligram peak and definitely coming down at the moment i all i got to say is these things got me high as [ __ ] and again we do not recommend you taking this many at home take recommended dosages like no more than like 100 milligrams at a time but overall flavor [ __ ] amazing it was like hands down some of the best like tasting edibles i've ever had and just the fact that they had some big flavors was great [ __ ] and i also i hit 1000 milligrams on that [ __ ] that was my total account for how much i took [Music] i was pretty high up on that that's like one of the highest i've ever gotten off edibles honestly and like they didn't taste bad at all like they taste like regular candy that's what's kind of dangerous about them but um yeah they're fire as [ __ ] dude i appreciate empire send this out to us um i got to about i think 900 or maybe 850 something like that but um i'll probably need some more later on i'm just trying to say something okay i got 2 000 [Music] i think i didn't take near as much as they did but i mean i really couldn't handle the flavor after so many of them they're really not they really shouldn't be taken in large amounts at all um but i've never really had a high off edibles like i have these ones so i'd definitely give it a good review i took uh 750 milligrams and i got really high i had a great time i was very energetic and euphoric um i i'm coming down right now yeah i mean i'm still pretty high it's been about three or four hours um but yeah all together i mean they were they're pretty fire it definitely left a bad taste in your mouth if you took a lot like we did but you know it is what it is i got high as [ __ ] i don't mind it so yeah shout out to the empire that was dick hope you guys enjoyed this [ __ ] video make sure you like and subscribe uh check out the [

today it's joe and if you're like me you have some kind of chronic pain that you deal with for me it's years of wrestling it's in the back of the neck kind of radiates to the side of the head and even throughout like my eye and my forehead region all on the right side and i have ongoing appointments with ents and eye doctors and my regular doctor and there's nothing that they see at the moment which kind of leaves us in the space of well it's it's probably nerves and just pain that you're having i i don't like pain and i'm pretty sure you don't like pain i mean there's some people out there that like pain there's like whole websites dedicated to that but that's that's something different we're talking about nagging everyday pain and i for one don't like taking anti-inflammatories or even tylenols every day i can't i can't breathe anything i can't do cigarettes i can't do the marijuana my lungs just aren't built for that and i've tried edibles before and that really [ __ ] me up so that's why i started looking into cbd oils there's some local vape shops around me that sell cbd oil but you never really know which ones are the best ones and that's why i guess you know i trust internet strangers on amazon.com to to give me good reviews on some of that stuff but amazon doesn't sell cbd oil oh no no no they have hemp oil i'm gonna let you i'm gonna let you in on a little secret sometimes there's actually cbd oil in there and it is called amp oil don't tell nobody so that's the chance i took when i ordered these three products obviously i'm not gonna be able to tell you how the products work today so i'm just going to show you the products i'm going to use the products and then i'll uh do a little editing magic and i'll talk to you guys tomorrow later in this video about what i think of these products first up are these american hemp gummies 1 million 10 times power body discomfort relief made in the usa i don't know what the the million means or the 10 times power but yeah it's supposed to be hemp hemp oil right serving size one gummy servants per container there's actually 60 gummies in here active ingredients hemp oil hemp extract vitamin e vitamin b omega 3 6 and nine how come it's not listed on the vitamins over here other ingredients corn syrup sugar water gelatin citric acid natural and artifice flavors carnival leaf wax yellow number five and six red number forty blue number one take one or two gummies during the day or at night too thoroughly before swallowing and and all these things on amazon they always if you leave a good review they'll always give you like an extra of the same thing all right so let's open this up and see how they actually taste oh got a little yellow gummy stuck to the lid here smells good maybe this will be the one that i take oh this is soft i like this this is soft it it's really stuck on there um yeah these are really like a lot of these in here are stuck together uh but they rip apart easily so not an issue with me wow that tastes good that's pineapple and i love me some pineapple stuff like this could be dangerous i don't mean dangerous in the sense like i think i'm gonna die but dangerous in the sense that you may take too many just because it tastes good and you want maybe have a second or third but maybe you could tolerate two or three definitely a plus for the flavor so what do you do when icy hot don't work or you just don't want to burn your shoulder and you don't want that hot sensation on your shoulder your arm or me on my forehead that's when you get some hemp cream instant hemp 10 times power instant result so we might not actually have to wait till tomorrow to see the results for this one two million milligram of what arnica turmeric aloe vera am i

it kind of looks like stuff i put in my hair for my my hair product it's soft it's like a lotion i mean i know it's lotion but sometimes you know it could be a little bit thicker it could be a gel substance or or whatnot it's it's like a lotion without the tube i put it right over a zit are you supposed to do that is that menthol yeah menthol is an ingredient i feel the menthol right away and that could be the instant action i don't think that it's instantly hemp oils seeping into your skin that might take uh might take a little bit and last but definitely not least is this sinus plummer spray that goes up your nose because i have huge sinus issues and that could be related to the whole you know sinus into the eye temple neck deal i don't know it could be a combination of everything but i do know i have sinus problems and hopefully that this can help out we have sinus plumber sea salt nasal spray with hemp oil extract full spectrum i i don't know where on the spectrum i am but you know if it's full spectrum it's for me does not contain thc this none of this stuff's going to get you high this is not to get you high this takes the oil from the plant that actually supposed to to help you without the effects of thc guaranteed sinus relief or your money no not with your money back i like this right here no known drug interactions i mean there might be drug interactions but we don't know about them i do like that it's clinically tested um i don't know how much i trust that but i do like that they you know at least test it first sea salt hemp oil extract scotch pine oil not tested on animals drug [ __ ] blah blah blah all right let's uh open this up and shove this up my nose it's a little brown on the side of the wrapper i don't know if i like that or not it could be a little spillage it could be a i don't know a little damage i don't know but i'm gonna use it anyway i would not recommend you do if it's spilling out all over the place but i'm going to do it for you know for science don't want to waste any smells um minty oh it's starting to burn starting to burn a little bit yeah whoo nothing crazy but i feel it is it menthol in this too green tea rosemary potassium sorbate no menthol it's got the hemp oil oh whoa yeah it doesn't smell bad i can definitely smell the rosemary oh it takes a second to hit you right away i can say that i like the hemp cream it's definitely soothing with that menthol there i don't know about the other effects of the hemp oil you know or the cbd or whatever it might have in there it says hemp oil could be cbd you know like i said sometimes they're disguised but the menthol definitely helps right away i'll let you know a little bit more about that in a moment the sinus plumber for your nasal sinuses this is this is pretty good if you have severe congestion and you're like me and you buy some of the the more expensive sprays in the store this is all natural 100 natural i'm trying to go natural i'm not trying to get any you know extra chemicals up my nose that i don't need up there and it's got that hemp oil i don't know if they have oil is going to do anything better like i said i'll know it a little bit but i can tell you right now uh it feels good i'm starting to feel i got to blow my nose start to feel a little drainage going on now so so i like this again i'll follow that uh follow up with this in just a moment and the gummy you're gonna have to wait for the gummy at the end of this video i'll let you know how i feel got a little hip pain get a little shoulder pain i'll let you know if it does anything for that or if it reduces any anxiety for me my initial thoughts after a day of use with these products let's start with the sinus plumber the sinus plumber is a good nasal spray uh it definitely cleared out my sinuses probably even a little bit better than the over-the-counter stuff in the store does even the strong stuff so i think i'm going to continue using this version of the sinus plumber i don't know about the the hemp oil if it did anything different but it definitely drained my sinuses a lot better than the other products that i've been using all right also my neighbor's gotta you gotta start mowing his lawn now all right now my neighbor's mowing the lawn and the ice cream man is around all right whatever let's let's get through this um hopefully this mic picks it up more than you hear the lawnmower in the background but yeah with the hemp cream i really enjoy the hemp cream it's got that cooling feeling i i use it again this morning right around the eye area i actually used it on my lower back last night right in that like sciatic area it helped me through the pain at night for that area so i like this i'm going to continue using this it's a little expensive so if you're using this i just i just wouldn't use so much of it i wouldn't be liberal with it just just rub your fingers over it just a little bit is all you need and then um yeah hopefully this is a better alternative than some of the the icy hot the icy hot kind of burns if i try to use it for pain and then you have some of the other stuff that's just cooling that maybe doesn't last as long i think this this lasts longer than the stuff i get over the counter these things right here definitely helped me get a better night's sleep i wasn't tossing and turning i actually slept throughout the whole night i think i went to bed early after taking these i don't mean too early i mean for early for me is anything past or like before midnight i'm an insomniac i'm i'm up till like two in the morning but these things help me sleep and not only do they help me sleep but actually i think it calmed my nerves down a bit so i was watching tv i was watching some youtube last night i fell asleep at an appropriate time i slept all night and i woke up at 9 00 am so i got plenty of sleep i woke up refreshed and then that's when i put on some of this hemp cream to

done it up let me go over that okay our products are exempt okay meaning CBD FX's products are exempt from the CSA and DEA s drug scheduling practices which classify whole half extracts as schedule one drugs because extracts from the stocks of European grown hemp are explicitly exempt from this scheduling practice and that is where the hemp is grown that these guys use to extract the CBD it is grown the biomass is over in Europe their product does meet the standards of the 2014 farm bills definition of compliant hemp which means it has to contain less than 0.3% of THC in the gamete or in the product period in the CBD oil period and again they only use CBD that is derived from a European biomass so that's how it's legal it is also non psychoactive and non psychoactive hemp was deemed legal by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2004 so there are your working facts now let me tell you a couple other things that are also some facts these things are freakin delicious alright the red they're my favorite color alright they taste like a fruit punch slash cherry I mean they're delicious so pop the cap you're gonna have a little safety seal I just normally yeah I just shut my thumb through here they gave me a couple bottles of these but I figured to show you your fresh bottle so pop it open and really they are little gummy bears I mean they look just like gummy bears and they basically tastes just like gummy bears except with a little pop so there you go it really is just a little gummy but I mean you know what I love these things so now that the FDA which you can and what you can't say let me roll that around so you get a nice glamour shot there since the FDA has determined what you can and can't say I'm just gonna tell you some personal experiences for me again I've been using CBD on and off three years what it does for me and in particular the CBD F FX products what they have done for me I used to be the guy that goes to bed let's say 10 o'clock at midnight I'm still up why cuz my brain won't stop okay it won't turn off I'm just going going going going going sit there flip through social media think about work think about this think about that couldn't shut my mind off I popped two of these half hour hour before bed I'm out and when I'm out I mean I am out don't wake up in the middle of the night no tossing no turning just everything just shuts down that's nice alright that's what I use it for also I work in a warehouse during the day yes that's right I am NOT the YouTube famous you know YouTube superstar I have a day job um and a work at a warehouse I do a lot of walking around you know up ladders down ladders all kinds crap I come home I am sore alright pop a couple of these takes the aches and pains away okay after a workout at the gym pop a couple of these takes the aches and pains away I mean it's not it's not a super drug but it takes the edge off for me okay other people you know say they use it for anxiety and stuff like that I don't really know if I have anxiety but I will say when I do take them it puts me in a just a nice mellow mood but it's not anything that you that you aren't functional you know I mean I could eat these in the morning before I go to work put in eight hours all day and still be totally fine doesn't make me drowsy even though it does help me fall asleep but the reason that helps me fall asleep like I says it just helps me turn my mind off so that being said I highly suggest you try something like I said if you're like me you don't like all the over-the-counter crap you think a lot of stuff that the doctors give is just you know blah blah mumbo-jumbo because they want you know Big Pharma wants to show some pills down your throat try these all right just try them what's the worst that's gonna happen it doesn't work for you okay sorry you know but I'm telling you most of the people that I talk to they've tried this it works for once you find out how many you actually need okay just because it says take two too might not work for you you might need four you might need six okay try it don't just write it off if it doesn't work the first time okay trust me just give me a favor and trust me on that it does work it really does I wouldn't I wouldn't I'm not the snake oil salesman all right so I'm just gonna be done trying to convince you hopefully you take my word for it and try some if you do want to try something check the description below you're gonna find a link directly to the big co website takes drinkler to the product buy it okay put it in your cart send it to your door try a couple gummy bears you know take the edge off guys just take the edge off all right so until next time it is your boy big J for VAP Co TV where you watch the side of a pan I am power

too well i'm guessing yourself but this is what they look like how many are in here so i got one two so i have one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14. there's 14 little um um 14 little [ __ ] wow heads or whatever the [ __ ] you want to call them um they don't look like the [ __ ] regular warheads um every other [ __ ] review that i've been trying like the [ __ ] sour patch ones the watermelon ones really look like the [ __ ] regular candy um this one doesn't look like the regular warheads but or what the [ __ ] do the regular warheads look like anyways actually doesn't matter but i'm just trying to give you guys as much detail as i [ __ ] can um it doesn't say how much [ __ ] thc is per little little um little gummy or whatever the [ __ ] you want to call it but it says the packet says it's 500 um 500 milligrams so we're just gonna [ __ ] take these shits and see what's up i mean all of them all fourteen is it fourteen i don't know i'm probably sleeping one two three four five six oh [ __ ] i [ __ ] again one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve three four yeah fourteen um but yeah they're regular as [ __ ] jelly beans or they taste like regular jelly beans i don't taste any weed i was just one of them they're not that sour i was over scared as well i think i was young i was gonna be on camera soured out and [ __ ] looking like my guy right here and [ __ ] um but damn [ __ ] jelly bean flavors are these either like the best jelly beans shits are fire i got me doing my happy dancing [ __ ] i get so i get so excited every time like i'm [ __ ] eating candy and [ __ ] or even when i'm [ __ ] eating too and i'm enjoying that [ __ ] i started dancing them like yesterday i was at ihop [ __ ] in my ass i'll just eating and [ __ ] all that happy um [Music] you know what they taste like or this one or basically all them they taste like those one [ __ ] long sour ropes with like different colors and [ __ ] like blue it's not like different ropes that are different colors but they're like a [ __ ] rainbow i don't know what the [ __ ] they're called but it tastes like that little sour ropes one two three four five six seven eight i just ate half of these [ __ ] it's still earliest oh no it's early we'll take a shower right now um hopefully you should snack we're gonna see if they make me feel different um or if they don't i'ma just be honest i have no [ __ ] hate against any company if it doesn't smack then it just didn't smack this it's not saying that they don't have any anything that [ __ ] smacks but i'm gonna just let you guys know if it just didn't hit me or or what's up i'm not gonna lie to you guys either all right we got two left that's all of them i enjoyed myself eating them for five the taste i gotta give it a 10 out of ten honestly i give some [ __ ] ratings on here i can say i'm not attending [ __ ] but my [ __ ] opinion doesn't [ __ ] matter speak from your own experiences and just try them honestly what i'm trying to do is like see if like if you guys seen these in a local dispensary if you guys are thinking of trying them but you guys wanted to see someone's review first that's all i'm trying to do you know um i'm not telling you to try them i'm not telling you to go out and buy them right now i just want to give you guys more insight on these [ __ ] or if you guys ever like haven't heard of them and then you see this video and then you guys [ __ ] find out about them or find them and you're like oh [ __ ] they actually [ __ ] smack i want to try um that's all i wanted to do or um get out of this video my [ __ ] ratings don't mean [ __ ] everyone has their own [ __ ] ratings um but it's currently uh like 10 10 40 now or 10 yeah i think it's 10 40 because when i started recording it was like 10 35 and it's been like eight minutes so it's like 10 40 um i'll pick up the camera like around 11 50 or some [ __ ] or an hour from now and just let you guys know how i [ __ ] feel so hour by hour i'm going to be updating you guys um i don't know if it doesn't smack within like usually i get smacked within like the first hour two hours um but who knows the [ __ ] sour patch edibles took like four hours before they actually [ __ ] hit me and [ __ ] um so we're just gonna go with the flow and see what's up see if these are actually 500 milligrams or what's up but all right guys i'll pick up the camera later alright guys i currently just got out of the shower um you guys can see um dude i got a comment one time someone said that my [ __ ] perm looks goofy um it's not a perm i have natural curly hair it's just that sometimes it should just be looking goofy as [ __ ] because i have some thick ass [ __ ] girls and my hair just gets dried out sometimes um but i know i don't know i just wanted to mention that [ __ ] someone said i got a permanent [ __ ] it's not perm natural [ __ ] curls um but anyways it's currently like [ __ ] 12 [ __ ] 12 30 i think um i didn't pick it up within the first hour um but i'm just here to [ __ ] let you guys know i i don't know if i [ __ ] feel something or not um i want to wait a little bit more longer give it another hour or so but as of right now i just feel relaxed and i don't know it's just [ __ ] weird i'm not gonna say i'm smack smack but i'm also gonna say like i don't feel a little something it's not drastic but i can't say that i don't feel relaxed and i feel like i'm just chilling you know like i'm just vibing and [ __ ] um like if i had to rate it it's probably like a six six point five right now where i'm at i don't know um i'm feeling something chilling [ __ ] vibing um but i'm just give it another hour or so and see what the [ __ ] happens cuz right now uh i'm not feeling [ __ ] but yeah man we're just gonna [ __ ] let it run and i'll pick up the camera within another hour or so and see what's up i still haven't ate anything so we'll see all right guys as you guys can see i just made um my tea i got a maca and ashwagandha tea mixed with some with two tablespoons of honey um just to get that vitality up and that energy up um but that's just gonna be pretty much it it's currently 115 um 120 or some [ __ ] or some one something um but i i'm gonna rate those edibles on my personal scale 6.5 doesn't mean you shouldn't [ __ ] try them um but honestly i'm not gonna say that i didn't feel anything because i do feel like some haziness in my eyes and usually that's [ __ ] an indicator one like one of the indicators for me that i'm [ __ ] like high and [ __ ] but like i feel hazy in my eyes my eyes feel like low-key kind of [ __ ] heavy but nothing major you know i'm [ __ ] chilling i'm rocking um i would suggest some more if you have a a lower tolerance um and then and if you have a lower tolerance and it may [ __ ] hit you a lot more harder um but it wasn't nothing crazy for me it was just i was just chilling um but it's cool trying out these different [ __ ] like candy um replicated edibles or whatever how however you would wear that um it's just cool to try out like [ __ ] like a wonka bar [ __ ] sour patch [ __ ] flavored ones warheads it's [ __ ] crazy uh mixed with weed that's crazy as [ __ ] that's just dope um but yeah just because i give it a 6.5 doesn't mean you shouldn't try it if you have a lower tolerance or an a [ __ ] tolerance then go for it give them a try they're [ __ ] the taste of them is fired um i'm pretty sure it will [ __ ] smack if i like gave it to my sisters or some [ __ ] um but yeah i'ma just go ahead and end the video here man um if

welcome to another episode of the two minute review on cannabis with your boy today i want to talk about wild huckleberry gummy edible wild is oregon's leading cannabis brand based in portland they use real fruit ingredients to enhance their taste coming in five different flavors each with their own effects and ratios now this one right here is the huckleberry it's a hybrid now the highest gear for your day-to-day adventures cheerfulness and overall well-being getting about 10 pieces in this bad boy 10 milligrams of thc per serving i don't know the terpenes are these bad boys but you know what we bout to eat these bad boys and see what everything all about [Music] it tastes good you're about to eat three of them no so the wild huckleberry the hybrid bad boy this bad boy actually is pretty good um the gummies tasted pretty good the effects actually is very uh chill but i will say it is adventurous for sure took a quick trip to target picking some groceries and it was just like okay well this is definitely one of those adventures today overall i give it about an eight out of ten yeah it's slapped enough guys definitely check them out well until next time you guys don't usual stay fresh put one of them down why because i'm not dealing with you at target like this tastes good", "3QMf4ZOpJKU": "my name is Willie Christie I'm a wellness consultant for the cannery west Henry West is a new dispensary in West Los Angeles today we're talking about edibles customers come in here with all sorts of different requests whether that be dietary requests or different methods of ingestion or uptake or effect whatever you're comfortable with chances are we've got it for our first edible I want to talk about gummies gummies are the most popular edible and we've got the kiva camino gummies today they're cannabis infused gummies but they also add terpenes which is unique that gives it more of a indica or sativa feel just really nice tasting Class E gummies these are wild berry it got a pineapple habanero flavor a blend I'm apricot and my personal favorite the sparkling pear Prosecco next we've got sublingual strips sublingual strips are a small tab that you put in your mouth and let dissolve on your tongue you may know cookies and brownies as your typical ingestion method but what's unique about these is that those other edibles take up to two hours to take effect whereas sublingual effects you can start feeling it in 15 to 40 minutes you don't run into that this isn't hitting it's been an hour and nothing's working I'm gonna slam some more and then two hours it all hits and you're done and finally we've got tea now cannabis and tea have been a match made in heaven since time immemorial I find that this slightly caffeinated green tea is a really nice chill but focused way of ingestion it's absorbed through the stomach so this is another faster method than digestion and what I find with tea is that as you sip it it comes on in sips as opposed to like a boom there are different types of tea this is a caffeinated green tea there's non-caffeinated herbal tea this has a little blend of CBD as well really nice for chilling out so those are some of my favorite edibles on the market right now feel free to come by the can we stop in and check them out yourself", "nfiMlLetL-4": "[Music] jump up [Music] now it says take two but um this is the same you know we reviewed the cubelet cubeler yeah it's just saying you know i looked at the different ones i mean i guess if you have a preference on i don't know i mean this is this is a sour okay the other one sour i can't remember but anyway this one is sour gummy worms for adults shout out to dry roots industries for making this review possible this is john gummies this is the wigglers and y'all know two ain't doing anything um each of these have 30 milligrams so this right here would be 60 milligrams of delta eight so we going for 9 90 because yeah yeah again the instructions on the back says two but you again if you never had delta eight take it easy not really sour it tastes good at the end you get a little bit of a solid not really oh i'm talking about let me show y'all [ __ ] stop closing alexa what time is it the time is 11 36 a.m what was that one not really sour knife no you don't really take the thc at all all right so that's 90 milligrams i'll be back when it kicks in that orange one tastes good um okay we're gonna take a little bit of tfc in that one not bad but let's get to it so far i mean i like the cuba the cute cumula because it's quicker just to just take too long it's just it's my preference i like the cuba compare the worms are long and thick [ __ ] i want to pop back in here real quick i have two more edibles from them um there's five in each packet so being that i you know same ratio you know um of delta eight and all of them kind of look sometimes like i'm gonna see if it changes and it's all same thing 150 milligrams in each so i'm just going to be doing three out eat three leave two so at the end of the last review i'm going to be giving away so be two four six so be six gummies but different variations to one person so y'all stay tuned because yeah after the last review i'm gonna be giving away the remainder okey dokey all right i'll be back alexa what time is it the time is 11 49 a.m yeah happy thursday um okay you heard the time so i'm feeling it here same thing it's just very real this is very relaxing not heavily sedative just very calming and i'm only feeling on one side but that's the same effect that i got from yeah um it's the same again it's the same amount of milligrams it's just a different version of um edible gummies so again it would go in your preference of taste as opposed to the first one i had was cuballer and now this one is wigglers and it's a sour gummy i can't remember the other one let me see it wasn't sour it wasn't sour so again it depends on your preference and um these are for adults yes they're gummy worms but they're for adults it says it on the packaging so they make that clear which is great also it says naturally and artificially flavored must be 21 21 and over for purchase it says that all on the front packaging consume no more than two pieces every six hours you saw i did three because i know that i need and as i'm sitting here talking to you i feel it coming on more and it's just very relaxing so for somebody for somebody who's heavy into delta nine i'll be honest though being i'm doing a giveaway i'm not gonna eat them all one package will i'll be where i want to be for me so if i was to eat if i had eaten these other yeah perfecto that's a and that's a 150 milligrams that's yeah that's yeah i'll be a okay right now i'm okay shout out to jar roots industries again check them out they have a lot of products and i'm sure whatever you choose you would not be disappointed at all at all make sure you check out that pin comment and that's all i got for you guys and on that note i am [Music] you", "J19-zx7HPB8": "i really gotta stop giving y'all such an easy like goal to stop damaging my body warning chili dilly is a trained professional do not

apple if you guys like green apple let me know man that's crazy because i do not drink some water all right man we are going to come back in an hour see how we feel um i'm a little nervous to be honest because i've never eaten this many edibles on delta a um but i do feel like my tolerance is high enough it's only 200 milligrams like the whole pack is only 200 milligrams so that's why i don't really think it's that big a video to be honest so yeah all right we will be back in an hour boys all right one hour later all right boys it's been about an hour and a half now maybe a little over off

with edibles i feel like when you know different vendors and stuff so what i like to do is what they teach you in medical school is to count your items and divide your milligrams by the number of items so let's count we have one two three four five six seven eight nine and i just beat the tenth piece 10 divided by 500 is 50 yes so i would assume if these were rightfully dosed that of every piece of these is 50 milligrams okay go from there so let me tell you what that tastes like the blue raspberry tastes delicious first off um i am tasting a little bit of thc [Music] [Music] [Music] so good blue raspberry delicious all right now next what we have for you is the sour medicated warheads now i think this is a prank i think they knew that i was gonna try this and so they were like let's

1/4 cup of organic almond butter 1/4 cup of coconut oil now I'm using a coconut oil that's been infused with a hundred and fifty milligrams of a distillate concentrate you can click above for a video to infuse coconut oil or add your product in at the end well now add quarter cup of confectioner's swerve as well as 1/4 cup of cocoa powder and 1/4 teaspoon of lecithin mix those well if you are not using infused coconut oil now is the time that you want to add your product [Music] into the molds it goes [Music] once I have this all into the molds we won't go into the freezer for an hour once everything is set we will pop it out of our molds and sprinkle with some sea salt if desired 15 10 milligram hearts enjoy be sure to subscribe to this channel for updates and notifications whenever we post a new video thanks for watching [Music]", "JG7ubixVrNQ": "hello everyone if you're like me then from time to time you enjoy some good old-fashioned weed gummies and man they're great but the problem with some of these containers is they're very hard to open and specifically these Kibo ones which are amazing are the worst open you can try and open them like this or like this but I promise you the only way to really open these and be effective is as simple as this boom and there you go Wow see how easy that was now you can open and enjoy these delicious weed gummies just like your grandma did thanks for watching have a great day", "JqhDejT6d5M": "I'm not really an edible person but I have to tell you whatever they put in this thing they've done a good job I [Music] bought a couple of quarters at a dispensary the other day and they offered you know a freebie and so I decided to go with the edible that they were offering and it happened to be a kirova Saturday morning cookie sample and took it home tried it out and I got to tell you I really really like this brand I really like this I mean I'm not familiar with edibles you might have a particular brand you like I came across these and whatever they're putting inside this thing I got to tell you it works really well for me I think these things are awesome you might have other brands that you particularly care for but I highly highly recommend you try the kirova I am not affiliated with them in any ways and just you know came across them at random and I really really like this cookie plus it's only 150 milligrams so I would maybe recommend to kind of start with these if you're just getting into edibles as far as dosing goes it's a good idea to start small now like I said this is 150 milligrams and you know other cookies and other things in other bars and other products they have you know 250 500 I've seen it even a thousand milligrams which is for me is it's too much you know I can't quite do that type of a thing but this packaging here says that it's got 15 servings per package so if you do the math it's like 10 milligrams per serving so if you're able to divide the cookie up as evenly as possible you can kind of figure out your dosage from there and I would probably you know I would say start with 20 milligrams these things can you know come across you anywhere from 10 minutes to you know 45 minutes to an hour depending on your metabolism and kind of like what's going on with your body and stuff like that so I always like to pass along the information which is kind of the thing with edibles because you know dosing is such a it's such a gray area definitely be careful with this don't eat a whole one for the first time if you're just starting out because you probably would have not such a great experience and you might not you know you might not come back to pick up some more this is about the size of a dose that I would do probably if you're just starting out I might do something around that size but since I've tried this a few times I'm adding this much more but I would try about that much in size even if you're a beginner start with twenty milligrams you know and see see where you go give yourself a little bit of time wait for about half an hour or so and see how you're feeling you know if you go on to maybe an hour hour and a half and you're still you know you're feeling good but maybe you want to feel a little bit better maybe try another ten twenty milligrams and then just call it good and see where you end up there some people will just you know eat something go I don't feel anything and eat some more I don't feel anything and all of a sudden they're just they're just blitzed it's the first time for them that would be that would be a shame because they wouldn't receive the benefits of the Saturday morning cookie so you know if you're just starting out that's what I would recommend for you to do dosing wise hopefully you found the information in this video useful if you did please comment like and subscribe I'm Enzo truffle with bud symbol calm and the kirova Saturday morning cookie thanks for watching [Music]", "H_vVwcXn3Q0": "oh what's up easy bakers so today i'm going to be showing you guys how to make your own diy infused nerd ropes so if you haven't already follow me on instagram at daverny freeman i will be doing some giveaways so you want to follow me on instagram that's where i announce all of my giveaways and if you want to be a young young young young guy go ahead and hit that subscribe button and the notification bell so let's jump into the video so this is everything you're going to need you're going to need some heavy duty aluminum foil it doesn't really have to be that heavy duty you can go get the 99 cent one whatever fits your grip baby so i'm gonna use some aluminum foil and with my aluminum foil i'm just gonna place them on a flat uh surface and you you will be putting this inside the refrigerator so boom pow now what i'm going to do is i like to create my own little mold i don't know if you guys want to go on amazon to see if they have these molds but i know a lot of people were saying they could not find any nerve rope mold so you really have to do them by hand so this is what i'm doing now i'm just making my own little molds which is just popping the aluminum foil up a little bit so it can have this barrier in between the two i'm doing that on each side so that's what i'll be doing right now [Music] and you guys do want to be careful when you're making your little liners because this is aluminum foil and it's easy to kind of tear through them [Music] so you guys i prefer to reuse these package this the packaging that comes with it so i ain't i'm not gonna buy normal packaging y'all don't play with me we're just gonna reuse these packaging what you do is you take where it's sealed all at either end of the rope and you kind of open it up like you will a bag of chips it's very easy to tear so you do want to take your time to open up the seal and once you open it up there should be a like a little cardboard against against the seal and you put your fingers in between the cardboard and the foil and you gently slide your fingers down in order to tear the packaging apart so that's what i do i do that then i set it aside and i take some nerds now this i do this all the time so i have additional nerve ropes and nerves in there and i like to take the nerves off of the rope which is very easy um so i don't have to buy a thousand boxes of nerve ropes yeah i mean i'm nerves when i could just use this now that you have separated your gummies from the nerves you're going to place them in a heat safe microwave safe bowl and place them in a small one i do recommend doing small batches at a time because if you do so many it's going to be kind of hard to control it so now you want to take your infused coconut oil i like to use liquid coconut oil instead of the coconut oil that goes back to solid and you want to use your tincture i'm using my eva clear tincture that i already infused with your cbd and they're going additional box of nurse just in case i need them but i don't feel like i will it's just whatever floats my boat and you also want to get yourself some type of piping bag or you can get a a condiment um container i think a ziploc bag is cheaper well not really cheaper but it's it works for me and i do reuse these so it's not like i throw them away because i know i hate plastic now i'm taking my coconut oil and i'm just coating this ziploc bag with the coconut oil if you do not want to use your infused coconut oil you can definitely use pam to coat this bat this ziploc bag but i'm saying if you're going to infuse something why not have everything be infused you get what i'm saying you're going to share but yeah so i'm going to do that and i'm also gonna do the same thing to my aluminum layers that i made my little molds because if you do not it will stick i don't care what anyone says in my i've been making these for forever in a day and they will stick if you put them in the freezer you put them in the refrigerator you will have pieces of aluminum stuck to your gummy now you looking at like a food like you're in third grade with goat with with aluminum foil in your mouth like it goes so yeah that's what you want to do just make sure everything is evenly coated then move on to the next step [Music] all right you guys so to my two rope gummies and six additional gummy bears i add half a tablespoon of infused coconut oil just to give you guys some type of starting point but this is definitely a trial and error type of situation so as you guys i have my tincture right here and i'm going to use five milliliters which is a teaspoon of t-shirt and i'm placing it to the side in a condiment disposable condiment container because i wanted to be you know on hand and you guys also saw that i had my liquid lecithin next to me just in case i'm going to need that as well so you want to take your rubber spatula or you can use anything that you're going to throw away i like to use this silicone rubber spatula because i could just wash it off and reuse it now i'm making sure that everything is evenly coated and i'm going to put this in a microwave for 10 seconds and it's going to look like this now i'm just stirring this around to make sure that my oil and gummies are combining together i microwave it again bring it back out stir it around and as you guys can see a little bit you see how they're the gummies in the oil is not coming together so what i'm doing is just trying to stir it a little faster and a little harder just putting a little bit of elbow grease into it to see if it's going to combine together and once it does as much as i would like for it to at this point i'm going to add my tincture to this i only add a half of the teaspoon into this at this time because you can always add more you really can't take it away so that's why it's super important to do this in small batches so you won't gotta worry about anything but as you guys can see the oil really did combine well with this so now i'm going to go ahead and add that t-shirt and do the same steps stir it around kind of be careful because it will splat it out okay y'all see what i'm saying i told y'all it'll splat out and that's nothing but my tincture splatting out honey that's why i'm like uh um let me let me try to put you back on in there girl then i'm stirring it around again just just to make sure that it is fully incorporated because if you do not do this you will have it will be set like oil and vinegar separate yeah this that's exactly what this will be baby your gummies will be to the right and your tincture will be to the left so you want to definitely make sure that it's fully incorporated microwave it again then you're going to place it in your ziploc bag or your piping bag remember this ziploc bag is already all uh down so i'm trying to give you guys a good angle but this is hot girl i'm like oh i'm about to stop the camera this is hot so you want to go ahead and pour that into there i use i try to use my rubber spatula to get the rest of it out but do what you can because it will kind of become you know it'll cool down a little fast so you will be working very quickly boo boo so once you get that together you're going to just whatever side you're going to cut it out you're going to cut it away from your workspace okay i cut it on the ground so you're going to cut it away from your workspace line a little bit of nerves just a little bit unless you want it real thick to the bottom of this pan and we're going to pipe on our gummies [Music] [Music] so you guys i am starting off with a thin layer i like to use at least when it when i like to make beans nerd robes i'm showing you guys how to make one and a half so with the measurements and things that i will put in the description box to my preference it makes one long nerd rope and kind of like um a quarter of one as well so what i'm doing now is i'm just going ahead and piping out my gummies and once i get done piping out the gummies i'm gonna take some additional nerd rope and sprinkle them on top of the gummies so they can have gummies on both sides i um really do this as a preference when it comes to how many nerds i'm actually putting on the rope so like i said this is really trial and error for some people you guys gonna have to figure out what what you like and what works best for you [Music] so all of those nerd roasts that you put on the side or if you're using a new box you're just going to go ahead and sprinkle as many nerves on this as you want to help you out you kind of want to make sure that all of the gummy is covered and go to your next step [Music] so [Music] all right so now you want to just go ahead and put your nerd roads in the refrigerator for several hours and once they harden up you're going to come back to them [Music] all right so now that it's been several hours i'm going to get my packaging my flat irons i don't use them on my head but i should use them for this okay and i get my nerd rose as you guys can see that it was covered up so you don't have to worry about anything getting on them [Music] now this is why it's super important to spray down that aluminum foil you guys see how easy they're coming out of here i'm definitely being gentle because i don't feel like anything cracking breaking or anything like that or in between boo-boos so you see how easy they're coming out but i'm just plopping them out ever so gently and now once i plop them out i'm going to put them on the cardboard that every nerd rope come with and i'm just going to place it on there and we're going to go ahead and package them so that's just what i like to do [Music] so now what we're going to do is i put them on my cardboard liners i'm going to flip them over so that the cardboard is facing up and i'm going to get the two ends of oh sorry you guys then we're going to get the two ends of the aluminum foil kind of put them together where where nestle had the glue already there so i'm just going to line them up as even as i can and we're going to heat seal them with our flat irons with my flat iron they go from like a one to a five and i believe i have them on a a two maybe a three i just want them to get hot enough so when my hand touch it my hand is not burning and i can kind of just like close it all together so heat sealing something together is really really easy you guys and that's just pretty much it you just heat seal them together and you will be all done with your diy infused nerve bros thank you guys so much for watching this video if you guys want to see any other type of infusion definitely put a comment down below and i really do appreciate you for watching this video i it means a so much so here go the little small ones that i did as well now this one i'm going to just do the same thing that i did with the longer one i'm just going to cut the nerd box so it fits this size you know what i'm saying so or you could just put them in your odorless airtight containers but you guys see how i have the little miniature one right there in front and that's pretty much all you do sorry for the noise you guys brandi and devin are outside playing tug of war with a stick yeah yeah yeah talk to you guys on my net video", "PeRdu23jN14": "hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at another edible um today we're taking a look at another wonka gummy i've reviewed one of these before but this time we're taking a look at some sour watermelons um now i woke up to a dm from from mr wonka himself um and said that any any wonka products with 500 milligrams are fake now um i was told that uh all of them are 300 milligrams and they're all within 10 percent of that i mean now if you look them up on instagram uh you'll see the 300 milligram products and you'll see the lab tests for those so i'm not really sure it's not like that company is 100 legit anyway but you know um if they're being lab tested you got to take the word for it they're posting it you know but that doesn't mean these are not edibles they're still edibles just um it's you can't really know who made them but if we take a look at there's a nice government warning there for anyone that likes to read i don't know government warnings now on the back or another warning um maybe delayed at the two hours yes dosing definitely different for each patient um for these since it's so hard to know exactly the dosage you never truly know now definitely start very slow maybe eat one and wait a while then eat two or three and then wait a while um just so you can really really be careful and you don't eat it too much by accident because uh by the time you know it will be too late um nutrition facts there if you're interested you can pause it right there um total whoa there's like nothing in here it's just sugar really um ingredients it doesn't seem like too much crazy [ __ ] but again you never really know um if we take a look at the candy itself has a has a green rind if you will um has a white the middle little gummy part and then the red now these are a lot bigger than you know a sour patch a sour patch sour watermelon it's a lot a lot longer and a lot thicker um the taste is not bad tastes pretty good and it tastes really just like a sour patch watermelon but uh the aftertaste is kinda uh grassy i guess uh i don't know it lingers definitely and it's definitely uh earthy i will say but if you don't really mind the you know the weed edible taste then these won't be anything different um but they're definitely not bad i think i definitely prefer these over the last uh edible gummy era wonka gummy i reviewed but um if you've tried these or if you've tried the bars let me know in the comments let me know if you're set of 500 milligrams or 300 milligrams because i'm kind of curious as to what other people are getting um my instagram will be in the description my gaming channel i've been i've been streaming a lot on twitch if you ever want to come chill go drop a follow there um i got a ton of videos just like this on my channel so if you enjoyed this one you might enjoy that one as well or you might enjoy the other ones but yeah hope everyone is staying safe if you get these make sure it's from someone you very much trust and um because you never truly know exactly what you're getting so be yeah just be very cautious eat one wait a while make sure you're good eat another one weight that's always going to be my recommendation but yep thank you guys for watching stay safe and yeah later", "p7h1qlhCdig": "what's up cbd lovers welcome to i love cbd today i'm doing a review on some cbd edibles this baby right here this is um cbd gummies it is by a company called smokies edibles um this flavor is the sour watermelon cbd gummies and this package right here contains 10 servings so each serving is pretty much like a gummy i'll show you what it looks like um here we go this is a a pretty little pinkish radish cube very tasty by the way it tastes really good um each one of these gummies contains 25 milligrams of cbd now this product is not full spectrum this is cbd isolate um cool thing about this product or the things that i like about it um first of all it says on the front it's high clarity hemp extract right here so it's high quality uh it's gluten free it's dairy free it's vegan it has no high fructose corn syrup which is good healthy you don't want to consume anything with high fructose corn syrup because that stuff is bad for you anyways um and for my concern you know i don't consume any gelatin products this does not contain indian gelatin which is rare for gummies and you know that kind of candy so that's something that's a huge plus for me because if i had gelatin i wouldn't have even tried it um ingredients uh it's got sugar corn syrup pectin dextrose citric acid sodium acetate natural artificial flavorings you know some colorings and hemp extract cbd isolate so um this is very good and you know if you're concerned about any allergies or anything this product is manufactured in a facility that uses tree nuts so i always review your ingredients if you have any allergies or if you're worried about this containing anything that you may be allergic to uh but definitely for people that are concerned about uh thc they don't want to test positive for thc or they wanna they don't wanna consume anything with thc in it uh this is what you wanna go with if you're using if you wanna use cbd and not consume any thc so this has no thc in it it says right here it's isolate and each one of those gummies has 25 milligrams now the recommended dosage or the serving size listed on the package is 25 milligrams so that's what i tried out the first time however i believe my tolerance has gone up uh because i've been using some 50 milligram capsules and uh the 25 milligrams gave me like a very mild effect so i wasn't really able to judge it so i decided to take two gummies which would be 50 milligrams today and i tried it out and i definitely felt it um i felt the effects were really good i was very mentally relaxed very physically relaxed i had a little bit of strain and back pain in my lower back my pain wasn't gone but it eased my pain a bit for sure uh helped me with a little bit more mobility and you know i wasn't in pain every time i moved or sat down or got up so i definitely felt the effects uh there was some mood enhancement as well uh kind of gave me a little bit of a lift i was not sleepy at all still still awake uh i took it i think uh probably about four hours ago so i'm not not sleepy but i do feel like if when i do go to sleep i'll probably sleep good tonight and um yeah i like the stuff it tasted good i think it's a clean product um i found it online for 22.99 i will leave you guys a link in the description i'll probably put a link up here on the video somewhere uh make it easy for you if you want to check it out or if you want to try it out you could go to this website which i found and they have some pretty good deals and they have a huge selection of cbd products so i'm gonna start uh referring them uh or referring you guys to them uh in case you wanna try the products or any review that you see a product on and you wanna check it out instead of having a search and look all over the internet for it you could just find an easy link so you could go and try it out if you want to all right uh this is all i got for this one um i think i would have to give this a five stars uh five five-star rating um i think it's a good product um i also like the bag the bag has like a ziploc thing so once you open it it you know one thing i noticed is the bag wasn't sealed like i was looking to see if there was a seal or somewhere you could tear and there's nothing i was just able to open it up but it has a zip lock on it so once you open it up you could you know zip it back up and it will keep the gummies fresh so they don't get stale or dry up inside and become really hard uh so yeah five stars for these smoky edible smokies edibles um i think it's a good product i would definitely try it out especially for people that are not looking for full spectrum or like looking for thc free cbd all right i want to keep this short as possible and that's all i got for this one um i hope you guys find this video helpful or useful and if you like it give it a like if you don't it's okay it's okay it's okay maybe the next one um and if you like cbd like we do subscribe and you will stay updated with all my reviews and you probably want to hit that notification button so whenever i release a video you'll get a notification and you can check it out all right you guys i'll

in we'll show you how we do it in order to make gummies as delicious as kana you need to start with a good foundation that's why we only use all-natural ingredients coloring and flavoring we precisely weigh all of our ingredients out to ensure consistency we then use an industrial mechanized mixer to guarantee it's thoroughly blended we use a sophisticated depositor to fill our molds precisely and make sure each gummy is the same size so the dosage is uniform next we cool the gummies overnight so they reach the ideal firmness not too chewy or mealy just a nice perfectly soft gummy we coat each gummy and sugar to give it a nice texture and punch of sweetness our customized packaging machine fills the bags with 10 gummies each adds a touch of dehumidified air so they remain soft and pillowy and then seals the bag to certify freshness we take care at every step of the process because we know that it's not only important that our gummies taste amazing but are also reliable consistent and safe taste the Bliss of Kanna gummies", "5DDBBSRQhyw": "hey guys what is going on today we're actually looking at some edibles if you like what you see today go check out my channel drop a sub but anyway these are weed heads chewy cubes I believe these are more of the black-market brand because if you see there SC labs I to do my research okay that Instagram doesn't go anywhere leads to nothing 500 milligrams of THC 2 point 2 milligrams of CBN 1.8 milligrams of CBD oh it doesn't have any really like serving sizes I guess it's just meant for one assumption but when you open up the initial lid plastic lid you'll be greeted by a like a tunic and type of thing I saved I saved one just so you know you can actually see what they look like let's take it out I'm just put it like it's you basic you know just sugary like like a sour patch cute or something with the coating on the outside the sour coating not very sour from what I've from the flavor I got from the flavors I got but still very delicious it does leave that slight like almost like sticky kind of coating on your teeth but not as bad as a lot of other edibles I've had like the Nerds ropes definitely not as bad as those those left like those when I chewed down like my teeth would get stuck together these aren't that bad it's just a little like a weird feeling but I do like the feel like the effect of these because I ate like all of them except for one really had a degree ass man so I would recommend me I don't know I can't speak for their safety and their actual brand itself because I can't really find anything on if you know where these are out of who makes these any info on them if they're just you know some if you can just order this packaging and make everything yeah I don't think that's what these people specifically did but I don't know let me know if you've heard of these thank you guys for watching and check out my channel for other videos and yeah", "nxqDA2gOybg": "let's talk about weed baby let's talk\nabout you and me let's talk about all the THC all the CBD that baby gets us high\nhi welcome back to the busy budtender I am the busy budtender the girl who\nsometimes likes to smoke weed online but also likes to educate you about cannabis\ncannabis lifestyle and how to integrate it into your world if you're interested in\nmore and learning about cannabis cannabis products in cannabis lifestyle\ndefinitely make sure to subscribe like this video hit the bell do it ever you'd\nlike to do to make sure you don't miss any of my videos without further ado\nthough let's take a look at the product that I'm actually gonna be talking about\nin today's video which I'm assuming is why you clicked it is the chowie wowie milk\nchocolate edibles as per usual with my reviews the first thing I want to look\nat is the brand and the licensed producer who actually makes the product\nthen moving into the product attributes unboxing my own tasting trying of the\nproduct itself and then finally my own recommendations and opinions so make sure\nyou stick around to the end to find out what I actually think about this product so chowie wowie the brand that we're looking\nat today who actually makes it chowie wowie is owned by a company called High\nPark which I recently spoke about in one of my videos they're based in Toronto a\nbig company that owns a lot of different brands and then above high park is of\ncourse tilray the big multinational corporation now Tilray as a licensed\nproducer my own opinion not my favorite licensed producer, not\nmy not favorite I don't really have any strong opinions on tilray yet I do\nknow that they're in multiple markets which is pretty cool cuz I'm always down\nfor bringing cannabis to more people but aside from that I really don't have any\nstrong opinions about tilray if you want to learn a little bit more about tilray\nor their brands I recently did a review about Canaca which is another one of the\nbrands that high park tilray owns which I pretty much enjoyed if you want to\ncheck out that video of course the links are gonna be wherever the heck I put\nthem so definitely check that out if you're interested\nso as for chowie wowie as a brand specifically chowie wowie exclusively does\nedibles so they don't do any dried flower no vapes but they do have two\ndifferent types of milk chocolates and some gummies today though we're gonna be\nlooking at the chowie wowie milk chocolate balance between 10 milligrams of CBD and\n10 milligrams of THC if you guys aren't familiar with the\ndifferences between THC and CBD they're pretty interesting\nyou're not like big cannabis nerds like me but THC is the stuff that makes\nyou high it's the thing that makes you uplift it it's the thing that you feel\nin your head and in your brain and does a lot of fun things for you\nCBD on the other hand is the more well on this side to the cannabis industry\nit's really good for inflammation and the really interesting thing that I\nwanted to talk about specifically with this product and CBD is that CBD is\nknown to counteract some of the effects of THC so THC sometimes can make\nyou feel anxious or paranoid or also in general just increases your heart rate\nCBD kind of like pulls the crank a little bit back which is why this\nproduct will be pretty interesting to try so in comparison with their other\nproduct which is a 10 milligram of THC exclusively I would likely expect a\nlittle bit more of an intense high rather than this one which is going to\nbe a little bit more balanced you can get the chowie wowie milk chocolate edibles\non the OCS which is Ontario's cannabis store for seven dollars and 20 cents so\nit's pretty affordable if you want to just try out some edibles it's not a\nit's seven dollars as for the packaging itself before I open this up I think\nit's pretty cute I I think chowie wowie's doing a decent job with the restrictions\nthey have with packaging in Canada that being said I don't see like a recycling\nsign on this so I'm not sure if this can be put in your curbside recycling\nprogram the alternative is I'm pretty sure that with every piece of cannabis\npackaging including stuff like this you can return it to stores that have\nrecycling programs but I'm not really quite sure about like specifically this\ntype of packaging I don't know I'm I'm a sucker for sustainability so\nit kind of sucks to buy cannabis and this kind of packaging but I'll talk a\nlittle bit more about the quantity of this product and the packaging a little\nbit later in the video anyways enough about that let's actually open this up\nand see what it looks like and smell it all right so let's get into the unboxing\non the front of the package we have our cute little chowie wowie logo milk chocolate big ass THC thing and then the total amount of THC\nand CBD which again is balanced at 10 milligrams and 10 milligrams and our big\nwarning about how it can take up to four hours to feel the full effects from\neating or drinking cannabis on the back we have our beautiful excise stamp\nwhich is the Alberta one because I'm currently in Alberta and then I actually\nreally like this on the back they wrote these balance chocolates are made with\n10 milligrams of THC and 10 milligrams of CBD per piece each piece can be\neasily split into two squares to enjoy with friends I guess friend\nwe've recommend starting with just one square then waiting to feel the effects\nbefore having more while you wait you can invent backstories for strangers try\nnot to think about capybaras watch clouds done I think that's cute\nobviously cuz it's an edible this is unfortunately not a zero calorie product\nit has 80 calories per container and then you have all of the important\nnutrition facts over here the packaged on date is late December so December\n17th so right before edibles were actually released in Canada so it's not\nto to old and of course the ingredients which it just looks like it's kind of a\nmediocre chocolate with whole milk powder and blah blah blah whatever and\non cannabis extraction of course anyways enough about that let's actually see how\ndifficult this is to open all right and then normally with these\nkind of products you can see it's like a zip a zip lock issue thing close a zip\nlock type of closure so with these I'm pretty sure you're supposed to like yeah\nOh first try baby did you guys see that oh yeah you're supposed to twist it I\ndon't let's check this puppy out cute the interesting thing that I noticed\nwhen I was unboxing this is that it doesn't say anywhere on the packaging\nwhat type of strain the extracts have come from whether it's a indica sativa\nor hybrid according to sources online this is supposed to be a hybrid strain\nso something in between which is my favorite type of strain but it's pretty\nweird they wouldn't put it on the packaging anyways aside from that when\nyou open it up firstly as for the smell I'd say it smells like 80% chocolate 20%\nweed which isn't bad at all it does have a very slight dankness to it but it's\nnot overpowering and then as you can see from the unboxing it comes in these two\ncute little squares sorry cute little rectangles that you could split it with\na friend and then the chowie wowie thing on the front let me talk a little bit about\ndosing edibles and how they're different for everybody\nof course we as we metabolize and consume alcohol differently 3 beers is\ngonna be something extremely different than 3 beers is for someone of a\ncompletely different weight and height the same thing kind of goes with\ncannabis and edibles so what everyone recommends is to start low and go slow\nso with something like this where you have 10 milligrams\nit's recommended that you take ok let me see if I can break this open it's\nrecommended that you eat one of these wait like 2 hours I'd say before you\nhave any more as for me I'm actually gonna be taking both of these because\nnumber one my tolerance is probably a little bit heavier than that of most\npeople consider I consume a lot of cannabis throughout my weekly day-to-day\netc and also because I want to show you guys what taking both of these would be\nlike whether you're someone who has a higher tolerance like me or you're just\ncurious as to what that kind of experience is and if you're a beginner\nconsumer or have a lower tolerance in general my somewhat assumption is that\nmy experience taking both of these is going to be somewhat similar to what it\nwould be like are you taking just one alright let's\ntry it out hmm it tastes like like a Hershey's\nchocolate or like any other kind of cheaper but fine chocolate and then it\nhas like that dink aftertaste II presence it's not bad like I'm not like\ndisgusted like it's fine I think I'm just a snob when it comes to food and I\nwant us to taste good the flavors not bad it's really really not bad once you\neat more you can't taste the cannabis as much as just very much chocolate so\nmaybe that helps all right bottoms up and now we wait while I'm sitting here\nfor the next two hours and waiting for my edibles to kick in so I can give you\nguys the full spectrum of opinions that I always do have I do want to talk a\nlittle bit about cannabis 2.0 and how Canada made some mistakes in my opinion\nand maybe you guys can agree with me or let me know what you think in the\ncomments down below if you guys are edibles people if you enjoy the cannabis\n2.0 products in general what you think about the rules and regulations I'd love\nto know down below specifically what I'm talking about is this package which is\nthe 10 milligrams of THC 10 milligram CBD that is the highest legal amount\nthat you can have in a cannabis package in Canada in the legal market\nspecifically what I mean is the ten milligrams of CBD and THC in an edible\nproduct is the maximum amount in a package in Canada the reason I think\nthis is kind of bullshit is not only because of course I come from a\nbackground of experiences on the black market and when you purchase black\nmarket edibles it comes in a package roughly the same size but it's gonna be\na hundred milligrams or even 200 milligrams or more that being said it\ndoesn't mean that you should take a hundred milligrams of cannabis or 200\nmilligrams of a cannabis edible unless you want to do that what it means is\nthat you have multiple gummies or multiple pieces of chocolate that are\nbroken down into 20 or 10 milligram pieces or five milligram pieces and then\nas long as you have the information that you're giving the consumer that hey\ndon't eat this whole frickin package they're gonna be okay I think it's\npretty ridiculous that the government feels like they need to babysit\nconsumers in making such tiny packages for edibles it's it's like buying one\nbeer you don't want to buy one beer want to buy a 6-pack or you want to buy\na bottle of Smirnoff and it's not like and it's not like the government\nrestricts the amount of Smirnoff because they don't trust the consumers it's that\nthere's enough education and in society to know that you're not supposed to\ndrink a bottle of Smirnoff unless you're pretty wild the same thing goes with\nedibles I personally am under the belief that\nnot only would it be more sustainable in that this type of packaging could have\nway more uses to it rather than just a single time use for someone like me\nbut in addition yeah it just doesn't make sense it does make sense to have\nsuch a small package if you want to share a bunch of beers with friends you\ndon't bring one beer and then split it into small cups you bring a six-pack in\nthe cannabis realm in Canada you can't bring a six-pack and I just I don't know\nI think that the Canadian government is really really handicapping itself with\ncannabis 2.0 I hope that things will change in the future\nbut those are just my thoughts and opinions again I love to know yours I'm\ngonna get comfy I got my switch I got my animal crossing and I can tell you guys\nupdates as they come... guys look it's me I don't wear glasses in real life but\nI thought it looked cute this is my house tell me it's not just like a chill vibe\nI like it so update number one as you can see\nKingdom Hearts is playing in the background because I'm at my parents\nhouse and I thought why not be 14 again anyway so at the 15-minute mark what I'm\nstarting to feel is I'm definitely started to feeling something in my head\nand then I'm not sure if I was just hungry or a spurt of the edibles\nmunchies kicked in but I had a couple pretzels and I'm feeling a lot better so\nstay tuned for how the rest of this goes welcome to the 30 minute ish checkpoint I\nam definitely feeling quite baked and having a really really fun time I'm\nfeeling really uplifted my heart rate is a little bit fast but it's not too bad\nyeah I'm having a really good time honestly that's pretty much it but I'm\ndefinitely feeling a very very strong high at 30 minutes which is pretty good\nbecause a lot of times with the edibles that I make it sometimes at home or have\nhad in the past it can take like an hour or longer than that to feel the effect\nso feeling under 30 minutes is quite enjoyable\nthe downside of it is I do have some dry mouth which is like fine\nand I've been a little bit hungry but other than that I think this is a really\nreally fun time hello and welcome back it has been roughly three and a half\nhours since I last sat down here specifically and was talking with you\nguys I just wanted to tell you my entire experience what I think and my star\nrating so I personally really really enjoyed it I will say if you're an early\nuser do not take two of like don't eat the whole thing because that's probably\ngonna be too much for you but for me it was like a great time I really really\nenjoyed it I thought that the high was very uplifting very fun at times I felt\nlike my heart rate was a little bit high but that just might have been me and\nthat's not necessarily because of the strain and aside from being uplifted I\nwas also feeling quite chill so like a mix between it was a hybrid essentially\nwith the CBD I do feel a very nice body relaxing\nfeeling my body feels like I just did a nice hour-long yoga session with like a\n15 minute shavasana at the end which if you don't know what that means it means\nlike taking a nap after yoga essentially so it feels like I took a nice nap but\nI'm still feeling quite uplifted with the hybrid-ness of the strain so the\npros and the cons of the chowie wowie is in my opinion the negative side is that\nfrankly I don't think there's enough of the product in here because I think that\nit's actually pretty good and then on the positive side I think that the high\nwas really enjoyable and fun especially with the THC and CBD aspects to what I\nfeel like I almost come out of here feeling better than I was before yeah\nthat's it it's a pretty solid product so what\nwould I actually pair this with if you're gonna watch something well I'm\ngonna say that because for me the high was a little bit more intense with the\nentire chocolate bar chocolate Square whatever is I would watch something that\nI've already seen before so for me that would be like as series like Gilmore\nGirls or maybe community or if you wanted\nsomething new something like haikyuu is what I would be watching right now so I\nthink that kind of chill TV show that you've already seen or maybe are okay\nwith seeing and that being said something that's still gonna be\nuplifting to encourage that part of the strain I think would be perfect\nso what star rating should I give this mmm I'd say a 3.75 am I allowed to do\nthat it's my channel to do that I'm going to give this a 3.75\nout of 5 the reason I'm gonna give it a 3.75 and\nnot four is because I'm like it's good like I really enjoyed it and like the\nprice points pretty chill but it's not like incredible and I think as of right\nnow the industry frankly only has things that are around the four star mark for\nlike their top I'm hoping that in the future in the next year or so can it'll\nbe able to push it a little bit and give us some five star products but for now\nwe're gonna aim for four stars so that's why I give this a 3.75 anyways that is\nall for me thank you guys for joining me on today's review and let me know have\nyou guys tried the chowie wowie anything for that matter\nlet me know down below again these are just my humble thoughts and

what's going on phone fanboy Chris you can also find me over on my youtube channel CK 2k but before you do that make sure you subscribe right here and hit that notification bell now they eat have been on a roll since the new season has begun but it's all built on one key player and that's dion Waiters the Miami Heat announced that they will be suspending dion Waiters for 10 games without pay buy the team for conduct detrimental to the team and the athletic reported that the Heat believe a teammate gave dion Waiters an edible containing THC which is one of the main compounds found in marijuana and prohibited by the NBA it was reported that dion Waiters suffered from a severe panic attack that was also linked to an overdose from a laced edible now it's being reported by shams of the athletic that the edibles could have possibly been supplied by a teammate sham said this the he believed waiters was given the gummy by a teammate but waiters has been reluctant and has decided not to say who provided it sources tell of the athletic and stadium where's this had its multunus series of events with miami this season well the odds are real one for not selling out who it was but at the same time man you gotta be careful who you trust unfortunately what was at first thought to be a panic attack was in fact a full-on overdose after reporting on dion Waiters going through a medical situation on the flight to LA and he later later tweeted this confirming that it was in fact on waiters and exactly what happened he said this update neon waiters is the heat player who had medical emergency on team plane I've confirmed waiters overdosed on gummies sources say and was passed out when plane landed he had a seizure when he was finally woken up I'm told waiters was listed out tonight due to illness seizures and all the heat listed it as was an illness this whole development is insane they he released a statement on D on suspension saying this we are very disappointed in Dion's actions this season that include the scary situation on Thursday night and grateful that the outcome wasn't worse guys how did you unpack all of this information should they heat press a bit harder to find out who supplied the ladies edibles let me know in the comments below all of your thoughts and I'll get you guys in the next video this whole thing is insane baby boy Chris I'm out", "yK4OR0yt0rg": "what's up everybody my name is Sarah P and welcome back to the haze today I'm coming at you with another edible review today we're gonna be doing the spicy chamoy sweeter high gummy is now sweeter hi is a company I believe based in California they do a lot of different products I think they do like vaporizers edibles so on and so on on their website I couldn't find too much information on them specifically but they say they specialize in high quality lead which I think all these companies do anyway at this point these guys are the 300 milligrams on the packaging and it does not tell you which how much milligrams is in each candy strip which is the hard part but on the back to tell you the nutrition it has lots of sugar so if that's something that concerns you be aware of that but they are very very delicious let's just go into opening them they have one of these on them not one of those child safety loved ones again they don't tell you how much milligrams they're in each strip but here is one of the strips now I personally don't like sour candies I don't have a high tolerance for sours but if you do you will absolutely love them they're very similar sour points you like sour patch kids those aren't these are for you I'm sure these are gonna be good the spiciness too is also not overwhelming and if you're not really into spice this won't really hurt you it's gonna be like comparable to like those little sweet Mexican candies with the spice around it those those are the most similar to these other than the sour being like obviously really overwhelming for me this flavor on these guys are really really good I haven't tried the other flavors but the spicy and the sweet the combination is super super nice the high so for me from those guys you do get high I wanted to say that it feels like 300 milligrams I ate an entire pack of these in one day and it felt like probably like a hundred and fifty so I don't know who does their testing but yeah it's definitely if you're looking for 300 milligrams this will be a little bit of a fall short but if you're looking for 150 labeled 300 this is for you it was not overwhelming high either I didn't get those little butterflies feelings in my tummy I just started a little giggly I'm always feeling the loose and then I fell asleep which is a thing I gotta say about edibles they will make you knock out I fell asleep like 7 p.m. and woke up at 11 so if you want to sleep these are a great sleep aid honestly um I don't know why they didn't get me super high and just made me sleepy usually both come together but I don't know maybe way to hit me or maybe it was what I was doing that day but yes these will make you sleep won't make you get extremely high won't make you get paranoid will make you get in your head but if you're looking sleep these guys are a great option also for smell wise in my last standing a video a lot of people are wondering about the smell I get no THC flavor no THC smell but if you're looking for something and that can be really hot on the low somebody can take in public something that you're afraid someone might smell it in your backpack person like that you won't get this with this this you don't smell any THC no oil nothing even in the flavor you couldn't you couldn't tell the difference between this and a regular candy to be honest so yeah if I was you and I saw these guys at the dispensary it's 300 milligrams I got these for 15 bucks I would get because oh I I'll be honest a lot of these kind of packaging a lot of these kind of candies I don't pick up when I see they don't seem to hit very well for me they always seem to be disappointing but these guys were actually something I have now revisited this is the second time I bought it and I didn't I don't regret it I think they're they're they're fun so if you want something a little bit different you're tired of cushy punches you're tired of lemonade's you're tired of the whole shebang you guys see the speeder hire any other gummies I'm sure they're all the same I would pick it up so again my name is Sara P thank you so much for watching the haze please follow us at our Instagram at the haze channel also hit that subscribe button on our YouTube please leave a comment below let me know if there's an edible you want me to review I will go out and find it so thank you guys so much for watching and I will see you next time [Music] [Music]", "oONRHdBHFfY": "hey love Sistani here and today I'm going to be talking to you guys about a new company that I was recently introduced to and all about how it helped me relax more so this company is called diamond CBD and you know a CBD is and you already know what I'm about to talk about my basically CBD is a what is it it's a component that's found in green and that's the component that makes you actually relax and feel better that's than what's actually helping a lot of people with their illnesses and pains and all that stuff so this company actually just done the work to actually take the CBD out of lead and separate it and put it into different products and all of that so you can actually they have a variety of products so depending on what you prefer you can get whatever so I got this candy cuz I'm obsessed with it means like I don't know why lately I'm in love with these rainbow gummy so not even gonna lie to you guys when I first saw this company I thought it was leave like we'd have just food food and I was like don't do drugs I don't know how that's gonna work but but that company like they explained it to me and then they have a video on the front of their site that actually explains all of this so you do not make you high they don't get you high at all you're not going to be like tripping or anything like that they literally just make you relax and feel more I don't know like say you have back pain like I normally no back pain it helped with that if you have issues sleeping if you have just a problem like with anxiety whatever and you just need to be relaxed this is for you it also helps with a bunch of other things okay so you do need to be 21 to use this or to purchase this and so on the front when I got this package I actually did not review this bottom part here I just saw this and then I went straight to the back because I started reading you know the serving size and it said four pieces so I'm like eating eating and I ate three pieces right to eat my fourth and then I see on the front and it says do not exceed more than one to two pieces every six hours so I took three like I said and I'm a small person I'm only buckling and I don't weigh that much like I'm pretty small so I took that and I promise you like the rest of the day and then it was just around around like maybe four or five o'clock for the rest of the day like all the way through the night I was like I don't know I felt so tired and I don't think these are supposed to make me feel sleepy but that's just how I react to a lot of things in general like whether it's alcohol and I've never really I've never done weed so I didn't know that this is how I would react but I just got really sleepy you know supposed to get sleepy per say but and it's got really sleepy like it helps you sleep better but that means that like your body will relax it doesn't make you like sleepy it's not a sleep aid so you're supposed to be able to take these any time of day so I got really really sleepy I wanted took a nap and then just the rest of the night I was like really tired and drowsy but the next day I took the regular dose I just took one piece of candy it's like just to help me relax before bed or whatever and I didn't really feel any more tired because of it but it definitely did help with my back pain and it helped me relax so I will definitely say these work like these are like probably one of my new favorite things because it's natural one and it's just it's just a good alternative to taking pain medication all the time and all of that now I do wish the serving size is a bit more because I like eating candy but I just I just probably need to get it in another form other than candy so they told me they have it they have drops that you can put in stuff they have well so they have they have it in other foods they have they have a bunch of options you just have to go to their website and see and then you can use that to make whatever you want and put it in whatever food or you can take it directly under your tongue whatever you wanna do now these in here it says the serving like if we're going based on what the back says it says serving it's four pieces so there's about two servings in here so if we're going based on the front and there's about four to five start rings in here so I think it's that's great these cost 15 dollars that's before shipping and these cost 15 dollars this back and they have variety of products all different prices if I if you're saying like I can get like maybe five pieces out of this that's pretty good that's actually pretty good and I would definitely get this again I'm probably going to get this again because like I said I do have back issues like I'm spine and stuff and so it did actually help with that a lot I recently got a desktop computer so the flora would often work off my laptop and so I got my desktop and so a lot of times I have to use it because a storage is better and all of that I have to use it sitting at my desk and that is always been an issue for me for years and years and years because I've you know even in high school I was home-schooled and so working at home you know doing my schoolwork I'd have to sit up and then at my desk and all of that it just always been an issue because my back hurts so I prefer to work from my bed if I have to do like you know stuff on my laptop or whatever because it's more comfortable and I can prop up a pillow and all that but yeah so sitting at my desk often time really hurts my back and I don't enjoy it at all like I will do everything I can so that I don't have to work at my desk because it's not the most enjoyable for me but this definitely helps I don't know if I should be taking it every day so I'm not gonna do that but I think it's safe like to you know do it every day it's not gonna be addictive or anything like that but yeah I'm probably gonna use it again and I would suggest that you guys check them out gonna link your website in my description box this is like a really cool product that very happy I was introduced to so make sure you check it out if you have not already make sure you subscribe to my channel and also in the comments let me know have you ever tried CBD not weed not just not weed if you've smoked weed that's great for you but like if you've ever tried CBD by itself let me know and let me know if it works for you and do not forget to check them out alright I will see you guys in my next video bye [Music]", "DKyoJGC4krs": "what's going on ladies and gentlemen in YouTube I'm here to do an unboxing of cushy punch it's a cannabis infused gummy ok so at first glance you'll see that the dose is clearly stated what it's made from full-spectrum cannabis oil on the side you can see that they are allergen free and kosher so if you have a lot of dietary restrictions this might be the product for you also has ingredients organic cane sugar organic just kidding Oh probably is I don't know the whole thing is 10 doses altogether 100 milligrams and one milligram a CBD ok well let's see let's just open this bad boy up and see what we got alright oh this is upside down alright it looks like it comes in a blister pack and it is in fact 10 gummy pieces single dose is recommended as you can see this gummy does not come separated it's a little oily I'm actually getting a lot of oil on me and honestly I since I only paid ten dollars for this I am gonna eat the whole thing and get back to you guys in an hour Bon Appetit and let's get into it hey guys I'm back it's been an hour and I'm here to do a review of the cushy punch gummy this is the 100 milligram okay so yeah not even an hour in and it hit me man I am [ __ ] stoned definitely something that's worth $10 at bottom $20 edibles that I've split in half and like they haven't gotten me this high before a lot of $10 edibles themselves from other companies haven't gotten hi before another thing I didn't mention was the taste this actually doesn't taste too bad for being as small as it is usually the small candies taste like absolute [ __ ] this one was actually pretty good I will say I am actually very impressed because I smoke every day and this this has got me really faded you know there really isn't much else to say this product is pretty good I will be reviewing more in the future but if you want to check this out they're cushy punch calm I've got this in Southern California so yeah look forward to seeing you guys in the next one let me know in the comments why I sucked or you know just roast me for whatever let me know how I can do this [ __ ] better so I can do in the next video alright peace out guys", "JbGHs1HYji4": "in this video we're looking at some gummies some candies and a syrup all with thc in them hello weed lovers my name is kyron mountain and today boy today we're looking at some yummy treats thanks to bc bud supply thank you so much bc butt supply you guys are making 2021 amazing i love the idea of having gummy extracts and and maybe some other ways to to enjoy your cannabis we're going to dive into it on this video right now first up let's talk about these twisted extracts bc butt supply sent out a indica we got indica this one's the black cherry this is the only one that actually is called a z-bomb or z-zed zed bomb what is it or canadian right um like all of them it's in a 8 by 10 milligrams dose don't know why that was so hard to say up next we have apple this one's a sativa these ones the next two are jelly bombs i think basically anything that's an indica is branded as a zzz bomb and anything jelly is everything else uh and then up last but not least definitely not least pineapple jelly bombs you'll notice these ones here on this side here unlike the other two who have the big fat thc warning these ones are cbd oops rcbd so um jelly bombs these ones are pineapple i will say this i um i had thrown the apple and the pineapple in the fridge after having a bit of a black cherry only because i thought the black cherry was a little bit too sticky and one of the ways you know to help deal with resin and stickiness is to chill it right so i thought i'd make a bit more malleable and i thought i almost wrecked the pineapple ones but after they they thought and everything you can feel them they've got a bit of a different texture than the apple and the black cherry i think this is because just like on the packaging they don't have the fancy thc warning i think they're just they've got a different compound right so they've got a bit of a different texture i think the pineapple flavoring is fantastic with the cbd these candies um if you're doing one of those micro dosing with cbd or um or any of the other benefits of cbd this is definitely a great way to consume it um especially if you want like something like on the down low and i mean how can you get in trouble there's no there's no warning like there's this is this is easy these on the other hand um i will say personal preference the apple was better than the black cherry i would say that a personal life if you gave me a black cherry candy and an apple cherry i wouldn't touch the black cherry i'm not a big fan of cherry so maybe that's it i don't like that's so i'm just giving that as a caveat i'm not a big fan of cherry candies uh i will say the black cherry when you pop it in your mouth you get black cherry it's a good black cherry it tastes good it's almost a lot of flavor and it's almost like it's there because it's trying to overpower the aftertaste of the black cherry and it's almost as bad where you're like oh i wish i was okay yeah no we're good we're good um so my only suggestion would be with the black cherry is um it wasn't nearly as bad the second time and i guarantee if you're watching this and you're gonna since i've given you the heads up it's not gonna be bad for you either uh it was just the kind of the oh surprise of it um that said the second time go around i did have a drink on hand i ate it i started tasting the bad calm i go wash the whole thing down we're good and i had a great evening uh the apple on the other hand i would say i don't know why like duh it's gonna be a green apple the packaging is green the candy inside is green it's gonna be a green sour apple right so i was really impressed with the flavor of these when i popped them in my mouth and i guess the flavor was if you want an example or an analog um the flavor was so good my wife actually realized that we had some jolly ranchers fruit roll-ups of all things in the pantry for our daughter and you know figured we were having some jolly ranchers candies and thought why not grab her something of a similar flavor the only thing i'll say is um where the black cherry tries to overpower the uh cannabis taste the apple kind of tries to pair itself with it almost the sour apple is almost a nice tangy flavor that kind of pairs with the kind of i don't want to say tangy taste of marijuana but not the skunky eve do you know what i mean it's uh it's it they pair really nicely and this this i definitely could just enjoy one of these gummies without a drink um definitely definitely enjoy this so if we go over to the website um i just searched for twisted extracts and i was just going to come over here and i wanted to show you all of the different flavors they have but before i do that i want to i just want to point something out here that i just noticed yeah one a single package is 14 bucks do i think that's worth it yeah it's definitely worth it now you're telling me that if i buy them in packs of six five four or three i'm gonna be taking a discount because what's what's three of those that's that's all i don't want to do math right now but i know i definitely know 42 is probably around it but 38 is definitely less than it and i'm getting a bigger discount the bigger i go um how many flavors are there one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve so if you want to try all 12 flavors uh you have to buy two six packs so before we go any further i want to mention one thing uh with the candy themselves they are this is just something like a little tidbit that i kind of might be a selling feature for you um each candy is like one solid piece of gummy but because of the way they're molded they've got divider lines kind of they're not pre-cut but they're kind of grooves they're pre-grooved we'll say and it makes it really easy for cutting out your doses and you get you know eight single doses of tin just like it says on the package i found myself needing at least two of the squares so 20 milligrams what i really liked about this is that it was really easy for me to measure out my dosage where and we'll get to the mystic metabols and they're great but each candy is 30 milligrams okay back to the website so what flavors do we have here so we have uh apple sativa black cherry indica those are the two flavors we've tried there's also a cherry sativa that says on a black cherry might be a different cherry uh haley's grape comet that sounds really good it's a one to one so you're getting cbd and thc in that one mango sativa orange sativa one to one orange sativa uh so i believe yeah sativa peach cbd jelly uh pineapple cbd that's the one we have here raspberry indica oh that's the one to one and then there's also a raspberry indica it looks like it's a blue raspberry by the packaging look at that that's that's got to be blue raspberry right i kind of want to try that one i think i'll be ordering one of those for sure um the z bombs too right so i definitely uh want to try and eat maybe more than two before bed and see see if that helps maybe i'm just not getting enough and finally watermelon haley's comment i buy that too that sounds delicious so maybe what do i need kyran's ordering the three pack just like this that's what we'll do i'll get a sativa an indica and a cbd that's what i would buy up next let's talk about the mystic metabols i was sent out some sour keys six in a pack three milligrams each sorry 30 milligrams each and cola blasts these cola blasts are actually really yummy they're not so when i thought i was getting cola blasts i thought you know remember those smooth coke bottles when you were a kid i thought we were getting those but and then there was always those like cheap knockoff ones that looked like coke bottles but they were all like coated in sugar so i got them and i would actually say these are better than the knockoffs as a kid yeah man these are great these are super yummy i would almost say for a thc gummy i don't think the smooth and i think that's why i was so excited i was like i want to see this train wreck to be honest fantastic choice going with this you don't even take the taste to see the thc and these guys at all they taste like coke bottles and like it's almost a bad thing because there's one left i'll be honest there's a reason why there's only one left and it's because i promised my wife that no one would eat it until we're done the video you know what i mean like these are great the sour keys on the other hand are also fantastic funny enough uh six again same kind of dosage but the sour keys were still quite impressive the only thing i would say about sour keys and for me it's a bit of a knock against them for my wife she said that was a that was a for them uh i think it depends how you like your sour keys i love a fresh soft chewy rip apart sour key where my wife says she enjoys the hard chewy ones this guy is somewhere in between but he's still a bit too close to the hard side for me uh just just because i thought it was fun isn't a comparison and because my wife felt bad that we were eating sour keys the other night and my daughter wasn't able to touch them when i was shooting you know some some fancy b-roll that you'll see in the video uh she bought her some sour keys from um walmart these are walmart specials these are those aren't sour keys these are um what were they tangy tongue teasers so i just want to show you these are the tiny ton teasers and then this is the sour key from mystic medables i think like these are clearly clearly knock offs this straight up dangerously you could probably get this lost in a pack of regular sour in fact i gotta make sure i put this you know better yet i'll just make sure i eat these ones the fake ones because then we're not gonna have any problems i think my favorite part about the fun shaped so just to throw these two at each other for for a second the twisted extracts are for some people who who want a more precision dosing aren't really here to have goof off and have i don't want to say these are for people who are uptight but you know there's there's a reason these these kind of gummies they taste good like i mean there's a reason vitamins come as gummies right they taste good they're easier to to to consume and these are easier because you're going to be able to to dose them out properly personally where i'm at in my life in 2021 during the global pandemic um having some candies that bring me back to when i was a kid and then give me a little bit of a high i think is kind of what i need right now and why i'm leaning towards these guys more because who doesn't want you know to have do you enjoy the candy that you had as a kid when life was simpler and then to enjoy that ride when that high kicks in man over here on the website uh looks like already it's a similar deal to the extracts where if you want to buy them in packs of six five four or three you're going to see a quote-unquote bill bulk discount my interpretation not their words flavors do we have guys one two three four five six so all six so what six do we have cola blast which we've tried is fantastic i want another bag grape shock so like sour grape sounds good gummy bears peach buzzies how much you want to bet those are like uh fuzzy peaches those again those are another one that you get them like a fresh pack oh man sour keys got those and watermelon sours how much you want to bet those are uh the watermelon slices so i know kyran so what's chiron ordering i'm basically ordering a three pack of the extracts and a six pack of the metal balls because i want one of each all right last on the block but definitely not the least presents got the most kick i'm talking about the space juice from milky way extracts yes i believe that is the same milky way extracts from our other concentrates video so milky way extracts is back now with they are 1 000 milligram thc 3 ounces flavored syrup this one this is it's going to make fun of this i'm sorry it's got fire grape fire i mean if i was going to put any symbol from from like like a printer that has a i guess that's the one i would i wouldn't want to put toxic right so fireworks it's not a spicy grape heads up it's a delicious grape um the only other knock i have on the product itself i would try and find new packaging i don't know what my issue is it's my personal problem i don't like that it comes in like a cough syrup bottle i mean i know that that's fantastic for dosing because you're i don't know if you're gonna be able to see it on the camera yeah you have your dosing size along the sides i think that's wonderful um i just don't like it being in a cough syrup bottle i have kids in the house i don't maybe that's what it is i don't want it to get mistaken as something that it definitely is not um that aside the actual product itself is fantastic i was reading the product's uh description again and i thought i had this great brainwave where i would mix the uh space juice since i had grape uh with some sprite or 7up we had seven up it was great it was fantastic my wife and i made one i think we had some extra vodka lying around i'm not saying that made its way into the drink at all um but what i think i actually would do with grape in the future and actually this is what i'm going to do i've already got a couple ideas for a couple martinis you look up um grape schnapps recipes and just substitute the schnapps for this i don't know what ratio you'd want to do i think i would want to feel like maybe a one-to-one hell do a one-to-one what what why not just be careful because this stuff does pack quite a punch and uh like the description does say a little goes a long way um if you are someone who does have a higher tolerance though i feel like um i don't want to say throw caution to the wind because no one likes being way too high it's not fun but um i know my tolerances were a little high so i had to take a little bit more i went a little too slow low and slow too low and too slow basically um uh and i feel like i wasted some of it that's my only real big regret with this is that i feel like i wasted some of but by not having enough of it and so that little bit that i did use went to no good i think i think this would also be another great way to consume cannabis especially if you if you have troubles because i know a lot of people uh even gummy vitamins are too hard to swallow or chew and i mean i cough medicine is really easy to take get one of those cough medicine over on the website milky way extracts there's only one product but there are multiple flavors we have fruit punch grape mango peach strawberry and watermelon personally i think i'm throwing on my cart i think i only want one because they're so expensive but i'm really torn between peach and watermelon i might have to do both might have to do both all right guys so which ones looked the yummiest to you was it the twisted extracts are those look the yummiest or are you a child like me and you really enjoyed the sour keys and uh coke bottles or do you just like drinking and you don't need none of that alcohol but you still want an adult drink then i think this is actually a really cool way i would just treat like i think the reason why i want peach is because i drank way too much peach schnapps as a kid and i i got some ideas of where to put the peach it goes really good in iced tea oh my god peach iced tea with this would be so good okay i'm ordering peach thank you so much for watching the video please hit like and i once want to say bc bud supply was so amazing to offer this product uh they are on twitter i know i've talked to them directly over there on twitter and myself i just want to

alright so that was pretty much it for this video thank you for watching and I will see you guys later", "8YfY_NDparw": "and welcome back to my channel today I am going to be showing you how to make canna gummies I did a video on my channel on how I make that infused coconut oil so this is just pretty much a part 2 on how I make my gummies I'm going to show you what I use I had all measured out just to make it a little bit easier for you so you are going to need two packs of this jello it's 85 grams you only 2 of those you'll need 1 envelope of gelatin you will need 1/4 cup of cannabis coconut infused oil so I will link that video down below on how I made this and then you will need 1/2 a cup of water you can use juice or water I chose to use juice it just gives it more of a nicer flavor and you can't taste the weed then you are going to take your gummy bear trays which I got these on Amazon I think all for five of these were $20 so let's get started on the first step this is a very very easy recipe and anybody can do it I mean I can okay so we're going to put this on low heat and we are going to add our canna oil [Music] then our half a cup of water or juice you're gonna walk to so you're gonna want to get this to a boil I already pre turned it on so that's why it's sizzling like that so you're just gonna get it to a nice little boil and I do have this on medium heat so you don't want it to burn so just put it on medium then once it is boiled I will tell you the next step it's already hot so I should be able to add in my next ingredients which is the gelatin and the jello so again it's one cup of the gelatin and two of these 85 gram cellos I usually do not turn the burner on to warm it up so that's why it's like that this is one of the easiest recipes I have found so I am just stirring it and waiting for it to come to a boil which doesn't take long then I will start putting them in my trays so once it has just came to a boil like this you are going to turn it on probably one or two cuz you don't want it too high but you don't want it to get cold and then I have this and you're going to have to keep stirring it well you were putting it in the gummy tray if you don't the can't oil will kind of like go to the top like oil and water doesn't mix right so you just imagine if you stop mixing it like this it's not gonna work and then you are just going to put these in as you keep stirring it's kind of hard to do like both at once but you have to make sure that you keep stirring it I have not stirred it and then all of the oil goes to the top of the gummy bear and the gummy bear is just a terrible consistency it'll be gummy on the front and then the back it'll just be like pure cannabis so really it's not enjoyable for you to eat the gummies I usually get about four trays so I will just bring you a little closer and this is how the wheel gummies come out so not too hard so I'm trying to do this about hand just like this cute little cousin bears so that's how you make it it's really really easy to follow I can make it so you if you have any questions leave them down below and I will try to answer them for you", "cFwlIAzxTGc": "[Music] hi welcome back to Diamond delight animals my name is Liz and this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular welcome back so today I am going to show you how to make these awesome Jolly Rancher gummies from actual Jolly Ranchers that's right so I make these with canister up you can also do them with the can of sugar if you want to know how to make those I do have videos they're made from textures there is a specific one can of sugar and then the other one for the can of syrup is can of flour powdered sugar and syrup not well show you how to make the syrup if you'd like so from the actual gummy art from Jolly Ranchers I've made these gummies and I'm going to show you just how to do that so it's usually I'm going to jump right into those ingredients and what we need to put that together and get it all put together for you so you can make these awesome candies well one thing I did I want to tell you so in the recipe I used three and a half tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I would recommend using four tablespoons of unflavored gelatin to the same three quarter cups of liquid so I I will put the correction in the ingredients in the comments I do sorry I'm they turned it a little bit softer than probably what I like so I would go with four tablespoons of the unflavored gelatin all right so now we'll jump into those ingredients and get right to her alrighty so for our Jolly Rancher gummies what we're going to need is about twenty of your preferred flavour of Jolly Ranchers so I'm going to use the blue raspberry and peeled of course take off graphics you're going to need a quarter cup of can of syrup that we're going to mix with this then for our candy syrup we are going to need one cup of white sugar regular sugar and 1/4 cup of can of syrup and a quarter cup of regular light corn syrup 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid and a quarter cup of water for syrup then we're going to need three and sorry three and a half tablespoons to four so if you've got the packages of the gelatin you can just use the four packets they got a little bit off one you'll be good and 3/4 of a cup of water for your gelatin cold it needs to be very cold and then for our equipment we are going to need a candy thermometer a double boiler if you don't have a double boiler just use a pot where another heat safe Bowl will fit on top and that will suffice another pot for your candy syrup a couple of spatulas and then your bottles if you've got the bottles for dispensing your syrup if you don't have these guys these are great things if not you just use your eye droppers you've got those and of course your molds and that's everything we need to get started so let's jump right in and get it going alright so our very first step we want to do is bloom our gelatin so you are going to take your three and a half tablespoons and you're going to sprinkle it over your liquid you want to kind of get it all mixed around and then you're gonna get that you're gonna mix this in your gelatin into your liquid so you don't have any lumps and while you're mixing this this is a good yet to know whether your gelatin is a good strength or that it's not too old while you're mixing this it should already start to gel and while you're mixing it it should how to get turns to about the consistency of applesauce and that's how you know your gelatin is good and then we're going to just put that aside to bloom or total ready to loot till we need it now we are going to melt our our Jolly Ranchers and our corn syrup so we are going to melt our Jolly Ranchers and a quarter cup of our corn syrup all on our double boil just don't forget to put water in your bottom of your double boiler I've done it how come I plug it in hold on alright so we're gonna turn our heat on to medium medium or medium-high and we're gonna get our candy put your Jolly Ranchers into the pot mine got a little stuck in the bowl here got a lot of humidity too don't want to give it up gotcha and we're gonna put in our quarter cup of corn syrup our can of corn syrup and that eats up everything will begin to melt the Jolly Ranchers will start to melt you just want to try and get the candies covered and covered in the syrup just start getting things moving around but just going to continue to stir and this until the until your candies though the Jolly Ranchers are completely melted so it does take a while for the candies for the Jolly Ranchers to melt just be patient it does get kind of goofy and glumpy don't you can see that but just be patient it will all nose what I do is I let it sit for about a minute or so let it get heated up and then I stir it around breaking trying to break it up mush it down you just don't want to really overwork it does that just continue to do that your lumpy mess will turn into a nice syrup will see very shortly all right so now my candy start my Jolly Ranchers are all melted so you can see that a little better so we're just gonna set this off to the side for about five minutes to let that cool down before we add in our gelatin because if we add in our gelatin now it'll be too hot and it can break through gelatin that's a lot of problems that happens with with it so the next stage I'm just gonna let that cool down and we'll add in our gelatin and get that melted in and then we'll make that by the candy syrup and get it all put together so now that my syrup is cooled down it's time to add in the gelatin and I like to just do this and cut it up into smaller pieces and then we'll just plop we're all in and get that melting now you'll find if it's not melting you can turn your heat on to low put it back on the double boiler auctioneers probably enough heat from the water still from the double boiler to to melt the gelatin if it's not hot enough right still Cece was started melting because we have the cold temperature and the warm you can kind of have a separation here but once everything comes to the same temperatures and everything will mix together so you may find that your candy is kind of is starting to solidify getting a little clumpy well the gelatin is not really is not fully melting if that's the case then turn your heat on to low or just want to gently heat the reheat that up you just have to be patient with this because it is gonna take a few about five or five minutes or so for everything to come together properly you might think oh no it's not working but don't worry be patient so you're going to continue to gently stir this over the low heat until everything your Jolly Ranchers and your gelatin of all melts together in one even uniform syrup and there's nothing sticking to the bottom of the pot yeah once everything is melted together and everything's one uniform texture and color and there's nothing sticking to the bottom and now if you find here you may want to add a little bit of additional food coloring because the blue with the green it's gonna muddle that blue a little bit so if you do want that with more intense blue like your Jolly Rancher go ahead and add a little bit more blue food coloring it's just exactly what I'm gonna do here so you took the one out of much just one drop will make one to two drops at the mouth you can see the difference there with one drop me get that mixed in so that's a much nicer blue how well you can see that so I skip it too much then it's gonna I'm gonna spill it and not like we haven't seen me see me do that before so we want to see what the color is gonna look like you just drop it onto something white there and I'll just see what it looks like so I'm happy with that color goody-goody I'm just gonna set this off to the side and we'll get our candy syrup started alright so for our candy syrup part portion we're gonna pour in our 1 cup of sugar our quarter cup of cannister up our quarter cup of light corn syrup and our quarter cup of our sorry our half a teaspoon of citric acid and our quarter cup of water and we're gonna get stirred together so you just want to get it mixed together so the water and Evert the sugar in the syrups are all incorporated and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high forever this pillar so we're going to continue to stir this until until it begins to boil then if you have any duty sugar sugar sugar sugar crystals are so acceptance I just want to scrape that off or get a pastry brush and hot water and just wash down the stop then as soon as your syrup begins to boil you're going to stop stirring and we're going to watch your candy thermometer and we're going to cook the syrup to 260 degrees Fahrenheit and that's it just the letter go now periodically don't forget about your jelly the gelatin and your candy syrup you want to go around and stir that because it we can do start to solidify around the edges if it's like to pull off too much solid once once go around and just make sure that it's all still doing good but don't worry it'll get remelted once it gets out we added into the hot candy syrup whose life my candy almost up to temperature once you hit 260 you want to remove it from your meat immediately keep the candy thermometer attached because you want to wait until the syrup comes down to about 240 before we add in our other mixture the best is that you have a stone or marble surface to put it on is the best thing it draws the heat out quickly and and it doesn't get the surface doesn't get hot at all if not just put it off to the side burner and wait until your heat comes down to 240 all right so now my temperatures come down remove your candy thermometer grab your can you stir up your gelatin and your Jolly Rancher syrup and now we're going to gently pour it into our candy pot candy syrup here it'll probably bubble up a little bit and then you want to gently mix this and and continue stirring until it's all combined and you want to try to stir it gently to incorporate as little air MIDI as little air bubbles as you can but we need to make sure everything gets stirred there we go and once you're all good with air we're gonna get this poured into our bottles or you're just gonna use your dispensers your little eye droppers so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to pour it through a little strainer this isn't necessary if you've got one great if not don't worry about it so because it gets so hot these gelatin may break a little bit you get that little bit of whiteness I can't really turn the pot that way for you but if you do you can run it through a strainer just so that doesn't get in and if not no worries it'll all kind of go up to the top I'm just gonna pour this in I don't want any left in here now one thing you can do is you can fill up if you want to know if your gelatin it's gonna set correctly is you can just set up one or two cavities in your in your candy mold put it in the fridge and it should start to solidify very fairly quickly within about five minutes or so it should start to set so you'll know if it's still really gooey and tacky then you may have difficult study let it leave it for twenty if after twenty minutes it's still not setting then the gelatin has gotten too hot or it is not it's not some notch Ellington's are all the same strength so it may not be strong enough you can remelt you can add that back into the pot and add in about another half a tablespoon more of gelatin so this way it saves you a lot of time and this has got to cool down anyway because it the bottles are too hot to handle even if I use the oven mitt you don't want to do it when it's super hot because what will happen is it'll warp your bottle and it'll screw them up so one of those will end up leaking on you so you don't want to do that so while my bottles are all that while I'm waiting for my syrup to call I threw a couple into the fridge so I'm gonna see how they're gonna set up now I wasn't setting you may find your bottles because the bubbles will start to come to the top and instead if any gelatinous broke them out White's gonna come to the top as well so what you can just do is get a little spoon and just scrape that tops kind of skin right off of there oh yeah that way it's not gonna end up into your candy and make it muddled want to have a nice clearer looking syrup all right so I did check my candies they are starting to set up nicely because the syrup is hotter it's taking them longer and I don't want to leave this get too cold so yeah so the velocity is really you just distribute it into the molds if it's still a little hot for your hands full you can use paper towels on it which is exactly what I'm gonna do cuz that's too small just hold up some paper towel to put around it I thought I don't go with the oven mitts because I find that they're heavy and clunky and that's it just disperse it into your molds and put them in the fridge for about two hours for them to fully set and I'll come back we'll pop these out to see what these bad boys looked and chase like I tasted the syrup and oh my god it's so good it tastes just like a jolly rancher now if you find that your candies don't set you put them in the fridge for two hours they come out and they're still sticky you can't get them out of the mold don't panic put them into the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours let me get good and frozen and then pop them out so I don't you have to do one mold at a time take them out one at a time pop them into a double boiler remelt it add another half a tablespoon to a tablespoon will be good enough bloom gelatin and that will fix that problem and the same thing if you you've gone you've made them set them up and they're just way too jelly they're very very jelly to sick you can still you remem and add in a little bit about a quarter of a cup of liquid and that should take care of that all right so I will be back when these are set and we'll pop them out and see how pretty they look all right so welcome back here so my gummies I have them sitting in the fridge just over two hours and now we're gonna take them out so as you see first it looks like they're gonna be sticky but you just got to pull around the sides and we'll start to pull away as long as they're doing that and you can pull them out you're good you're gonna slay them on your parchment paper or stand them up if you can some of your candies molds are able to stand up others won't so I bought these guys on their sides and then also when it's warm especially it's warm I only take out one or two molds at a time to take them out and leave the rest of the fridge so that they don't warm up too much if I don't have a hard time getting them out of the molds and then I'm just gonna let these little guys dry for 24 to 48 hours and they'll be good to go yeah if there is still a little bit sticky once you've dried them you can toss them in a little bit of cornstarch so you don't want to do too much usually what I'll do just coat my hands in them and then run my coat my hands and cornstarch and then just run my hands through the candy and just kind of get a very light coating on them the other thing is you could do the same thing with oil so if you want to just take some cooking water olive oil coat your hands to them rub it in and then just gently go over your candies look at a little bit of an oil that will help them to stop from sticking as well and there you've got it Jolly Rancher canna gummies look at that baby and these guys taste so good oh I tried one earlier I don't know if I'm gonna get these to drying time get them fully dried they're so good but anyway guys that's it for that tutorial I'll be back to say goodbye and yeah that's about it oh one thing is gonna tell you so if you tried taking them out of the molds and they weren't coming out they're too sticky as I said don't panic put them in the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours pop them out put them into a double boiler let them melt down again and then bloom a quarter or sorry a half a tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of liquid blue matte add that in and that will take care of that problem recast them and you should be good that's awesome thing we working with gelatin and the either if there is a mistake you can usually fix it as long as you haven't burnt it oh and remember that this version of the recipe is just for playing gummies we are not going to sugar or citric acid these if you do they're going to melt I will do another version of the Jolly Ranchers of the sour version for you okay so don't add your sugar and citric acid to this they will melt so that is my tutorial on a can of Jolly Rancher gummies I hope you enjoyed that and if you have any questions as always please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and as I said in the beginning of the video in case you just skipped right over it use four tablespoons of gelatin versus three and a half it'll make that little bit of difference or a little bit softer than I probably would have liked but if you like a softer gummy go the screen 1/2 but if you want that more firm gummy go with the four and you'll be good to go check out that baby's its see-through ish it's got that clear candy looking it tastes just like a jolly rancher it's so good so please let me know if you give this a try I'd love to hear from you on which flavor you prefer and once again thanks so much for watching you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "gRahhO7E9Rg": "what's up everybody my name is Sarah B and welcome to the haze today we were gonna be doing an edible review BAM the standard this guy is the hybrid Andrea this guy is pineapple first off let me just tell you guys I cannot find anything about this company online no website is on the box there's no no website I can find it you search their name so I have no idea where these guys come from I have no idea about their background but whatever you guys are using the balm products let's just go on the pineapple which is here in the indica the flavor that these guys have is is is the these guys I can honestly say are the best tasting gummies I've ever had

I love these also they don't come GUI like that my just melted I didn't make just I absolutely love these got me he's like I'm kind of obsessed I'm never going back they are also generally when it comes to your mood and how you on them you're gonna be kind of happy at least for me and my experiences have been very uplifting and they've been very positive I don't go in any type of cycle as well at least for me they're not overly strong what is really great so if you want something where you're gonna be able to like lay around your house and watch TV these are a perfect choice so if you find yourself in California or if you live in California and you're in the Southern California region at least I know that I see these from time to time and I would pick one up they also are at a really great price especially compared to sake and because you punch I only compare them because they're both gummies these you will find much cheaper again my name is Sarah P thank you so much for watching the channel the haze and again this is your guys who have cannabis infused lifestyle there's gonna be more videos different hoes so I hope you guys enjoy it please leave a comment below please hit that like button please share and I hope you have the agreement [Music]", "D--AfKOBJB0": "[Music] what up y'all that [ __ ] came to me how y'all feeling today man [ __ ] today we gonna do a little review about these Smokies so I got a little edibles something for you but before we get into that [ __ ] of course you know I gotta ask you [ __ ] the [ __ ] please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always say cuz always [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that thing so you can get a notification anytime I post some [ __ ] if you dig in the turfy shirt go over to counter me calm yourselves terpene shirts can survive 10 11 12 13 14 maybe it's a minim [ __ ] man I got some new designs actually that I'm working on so it's gonna be some new [ __ ] coming in I'd say probably Annabelle maybe give it two weeks three max but I got some new designs on [ __ ] with so I'm gonna get that [ __ ] done so uh anyway man Smokey's I it's a pretty good edible from what I've heard I don't think I've ever had these and if I did I might have had a sample but I don't think I've had any of these to be honest with you man but people come in I got this one cat he'll come in and he'll get no joke like 20 of them were some [ __ ] he gets like a [ __ ] ton of them and a lot of like older people like them a lot of ladies like them but also here a lot of dudes like man um motherfuckas tastes good you [ __ ] around and eat all of them so I think that's a pretty cool thing the flavor I have right here is the blue raspberry so it's more of a fruit chew versus gummies and the reason this is a fruit chew I think it's because it's vegan so it's kind of hard to get like vegan things to be like gummies so usually they'll use like a agar powder or something like that I'm not sure what this one used sugar and corn syrup though they use pectin okay yeah so it but it's hard to get it to be like more gummy so it's more so of a chewy type thing so still good though you know and they also use a distillate in it for their infusion this one is actually I think there's a slough pack if I'm mountains yep Wow pack this one is a lau pack so they get their flower for the distillate from from lau pack Smokies has like different I guess they're sponsored by different peanut sponsor but they're flour is produced by different companies depending located so they have California they have Oregon I think Washington and I think Oklahoma working yeah so I think it's like Oregon Oklahoma Washington and Cali I have a Sam in Cali so I got the Lao backward it's only 20 milligrams I'm 20 milligrams the 20 calories per [ __ ] gummy ten milligrams per gummy 100 milligrams and the whole goddamn package so I guess that's pretty much it man I mean that's the most we could say I heard that they use real fruit with it it says natural and artificial flavoring so you know not sure what all that means like I say they're gluten I mean they're vegan and they're gluten-free and I believe that's it let's open it up hopefully if he's ain't all melted to get okay man oh that is been in my closet so hoping these [ __ ] like me just one big mesh or mesh ball all right so circular about the size of a quarter roughly so [ __ ] man they also be having like sour flavors and stuff like that but this is just a normal Flav so let's make this [ __ ] happen dude it's to ten milligrams of THC and two milligrams of CBD per serving we got to talk about the CVD so anyway man that's it bottoms up [ __ ] and [ __ ] gets [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah I can see why comes our bomb honestly these are probably the best companies I've had that are infused I doesn't think these AVX gummies that I had before was probably the best or now the Kaunas is pretty good with these [ __ ] right here hang on front these guys are vomits [ __ ] dude yeah these it is it they get these right to it don't you just disintegrating you know in your mouth yes it is like it's digging it is chili he did they think these things are bomb Victor's life is normal but again you need the plug around to eat the whole bag of these [ __ ] yeah man so mm-hmm this isn't good now someone asked me how come I don't do like how I feel on them and how effective they are and things of that sort there's a few reasons why I do that and I think I've explained it on a video but I'll explain it on this one too the reason I don't do that is because eight how high I get has zero to [ __ ] do with you hi our tolerance is different so I could say oh I took 30 milligrams and I didn't feel anything you could take 30 milligrams and be on the [ __ ] moon right I could [ __ ] around and take 40 milligrams be like man I'm high as [ __ ] you can take 40 milligrams and that fella goddamn thing everybody's tolerance is different so it's to me it's a waste of time to sit here and come back two hours later and be set my camera back up boy okay that's how I feel because everybody's high is gonna be different I just think that's like a big [ __ ] waste of time as far as I'm concerned and then also I don't think it's fair to the company like let's say I hit I eat something and I'm like I didn't really feel anything from it but yet I've been smoking weed all day or something like that and then I said I didn't feel nothing I mean you [ __ ] don't go [ __ ] with them all over I just had too much weed that day and it didn't affect me so I don't like [ __ ] what other people's companies and taking money out they Pike it over [ __ ] like that so that's why I don't do that if it was a shitty tasting gummy I just wouldn't do the review like I wouldn't release it like that was my first time eating that [ __ ] is good but if it tasted like dog [ __ ] and feet I just wouldn't [ __ ] release the video but honestly that should have actually really really bombed so I definitely say if you can find some Smokies go look for that [ __ ] of your own one of those four states I mentioned Cali Oklahoma Washington and Oregon definitely go get them shits them shits a really really dope you can check them out on a website and share the things just Smokies calm and the Smokies would Izzie so it's not a half Smokies so I'd definitely go check them shits out man but I got to give it to him the [ __ ] badass so uh this weekend I'm gonna pop like four or five it [ __ ] and see how they do but I yeah man [ __ ] I got a lot of cool [ __ ] coming I got a gravity bar i'ma show you [ __ ] a [ __ ] so I'm just getting some [ __ ] together with that but I got some cool [ __ ] I got some hash then I picked up man I got a lot of different [ __ ] that I got now I got iced up with all kind of different things so of course I'm gonna show you share that with y'all so anyway man that's the end of this video y'all make sure that y'all love each other keep the love going be peaceful to each other keep the peace go on go over to Canada mink on get yourself some terpenes shirts that i'ma holla let you [ __ ] a [ __ ] ass later I'm out this [ __ ] peace [Music] we in a jungle smoking legal", "jEpiVivBANQ": "[Music] [Music] hi guys it's been a moment this is wheats i used to say this is a marijuana review show uh it's mostly just a weed show about weed talking about weed doing weed uh but we still do review weed here on wheats uh and today we are taking a look at an edible from steezy steezy um maybe one of the most popular vape brands for thc they're the little pod based system they actually have a giant headquarters here in la with the big retail store and yada yada recently they've been branching out into other products not just their uh trademark pods but also getting into the edible game themselves and this here is the steezy bite which is their take on the gummies very much like the plus brand gummies which are so big here as well uh but this is i guess the steezy take on it you excuse me foreign sorry about that um so yes this is their uh 100 milligram edible uh it is just like all the gummies divided into 20 pieces i suppose some are ten so it's five milligrams per gummy cube which is also their suggested serving we however here on wheats are gonna review the whole product like always so i'm gonna review all 20 of them not necessarily all 20 in front of you but i will eat the next all 20 of them in the next hour or so and then after i eat that last one it'll be two hours and i'll come back to you guys and let you know how this edible is landing just a second here guys [Music] it's uh post well i've mid corona virus i can't say post but it is post lockdown and these dogs are needing some exercise so excuse me so as i said this is the 100 milligram edible um this cost me a pretty reasonable 17 bucks from uh connected in long beach california which is a good price for a 100 milligram gummy edible um and i'm really excited to try it i like steezy's uh vapes quite a bit and uh the buzz around the street is that these are quite good too so here we go there is the product just like the plus gummies they look almost identical big blue gelatinous cubes with some sugar over them let's give them a try here that's blue raspberry flavored [Music] good gummy excellent blue flavor a surprisingly natural blue flavor like really replicates that um natural blue raspberry taste that you get in nature wow there are wizards there the wheat taste is minimal it's there at the end but um as far as gummy candies go this is on the high end not bad at all and with that wonderful all-natural blue flavor it's a winning combination only 18 17 more to go how many have i eaten i am not dreading it these aren't bad a little sour tastes good chewy so i'm gonna snack on these probably gonna take me an hour so as i said once i'm done excuse me i'll come back to you guys two hours after that and let you know if these steezies are worth the bite it's a dumb name all right guys i'll see you in two [Music] [Music] me that dumb hours how was that do you look like you know what i was doing so i hope so these are good welcome back to wheats guys it has been uh quite a bit longer than two hours since i had my first steezy bite i spread them out over a nice long distance i did that because that's how good they are that's how long they last um this is just another quality product from the fine fine folks at steezy you know exactly what you're getting here right if you've had plus gummies if you had any of the sort of higher end weed gummies this is right in that category as a matter of fact i don't know if there's anything to differentiate these guys from like a plus let's say to me they're pretty much the identical product it's going to come down to whatever one's cheaper at your dispensary is the one you should go with uh but that isn't in any way a a knock against steezy bite because i quite like plus gummies it's just to let you know you know these are great but they're not you know anything above and beyond what's already great so um i really enjoyed my steezy blue raspberry again i think i picked these up for 17 bucks at connected in belmont short uh again really liked it oh i did want to uh do this with you guys there is a peel here sticker i'm really excited to see what's behind it i kind of pre-peeled already but i didn't look because i knew it would take me a while to peel so we're going to do this together oh that's disappointing i thought it might have been like a a treasure map or at least like a snapple lid that gave me some kind of you know aphorism or something but that is not to be what is to be though guys is a little cherry on top we'll say a little steezy bite on top of your real life sunday uh and that is i'm gonna recommend a book to you guys i know books bleh reading bleh uh but i have to um recommend the age of surveillance capitalism by shoshannah zuboff zubov something like that i don't know i pronoun i apologize for mispronouncing your name dr zuboff i think i think she's from harvard anyways doesn't matter um incredible book about uh the sort of age of uh that we are living in and how it is an unprecedented uh capitalistic incursion uh it's great and yes i understand the irony of um talking about this uh on youtube a thing owned by google the sort of er surveillance capitalist doesn't you know i can be a hypocrite and so can you and with that guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats it's great to be back steezy bites the age of surveillance capitalism it's all great thanks so much for watching we'll see you guys on the next review [Music] stay healthy", "jFV3Nb-ulSo": "it has almost been a year since recreational marijuana has been legalized in Colorado and business is thriving edible cannabis products account for almost half of the nearly 70 million dollars a month earned by local marijuana businesses according to the Colorado Department of Revenue but the market has not avoided controversy over consumption and accidental ingestion have generated considerable negative press so I travel to Denver to learn more about what goes into the production of these sweet and savory pop goodies and to find out is anything being done to resolve its issues today we are with Julie at sweetgrass kitchen Julie is one of the pioneers of the edible cannabis movement hi Julie hello thanks for being here so I heard you are going to let me cook some products right so let's go I'm gonna start baking you ready for me I wish I could the marijuana Enforcement Division requires all employees to have a badge in order to work a licensed marijuana facility I think it's because my paralegal Greg told you I'm a terrible cook so I don't believe you but can I at least help out you got it Oh may I help terrific so what's the next step Julie as we've got to put on our hair nets our gloves and our aprons and we can get started hi gang sweet cross kitchen specializes in butter based edible products we make brownies cookies and a seasonal pumpkin pie both on the medical side and the recreational side so when you say that pot is in your food it's actually in the butter right Hanna water is made when cannabis flowers Lauren fine silver this you are the head chef here at sweetgrass kitchen yeah and you're giving up your duties for the day to me okay so chef do you mind if I help out a little yes we we can help oversee the process okay keep close eye on me ah okay so what are we doing here we're making single serving peanut butter cookies today okay so tell me what to do I'm ready let's go are you guys scared a little bit he's going into a field and hit the bottom of the bowl at something that's very important is that we mix all of our products thoroughly and that ensures that the final product is to Majin s what's the recommended dosage for a consumer someone who buys the products I recommend that if you've never tried edibles before or it's been a really long time to start with five milligrams or less and wait at least two hours if you aren't feeling the effects yet you can always eat more I always tell people you can always eat more you can never eat less Julie I've added half of my dry ingredients what's next after this the next step is portioning out the products into single serving cookies and because you don't have a badge and because portion control is extremely important we're gonna have to let chef Lauren and her team take it from here something that has been a concern in the edibles market in Colorado is overconsumption and accidental ingestion the edible industry is 45% of the market right now the backlash has mostly been with edibles and while you can say okay I recommend my consumer only have half a cookie or one cookie if it's your first time there's no way to control what someone eats right right who in take the pot out of the equation if you send me home with a box of cookies who is just going to eat one there's certainly a responsibility on the consumer level to redirections and of course follow them something that the cannabis Business Alliance and the edibles council has done to minimize overconsumption is create an edibles education handout what we found were four most important points were start with one serving or less wait up to 2 hours don't mix with alcohol or other controlled substances and of course keep out of reach of children and pets and in the original child-resistant packaging in March 2014 according to a report by the Denver Police Levi's fam bah a college student visiting from Wyoming jumped to his death from his hotel room after eating six times the recommended dosage for edibles to sweetgrass kitchen cookie wrappers were found in the hotel room the coroner ruled the death accidental the incident with Levi Samba was was very tragic but it's important to remember that marijuana was not the cause of death when you say marijuana marijuana wasn't the cause of death and maybe I'm just speaking as a lawyer an autopsy was performed on the young man and the autopsy revealed that marijuana was in fact the cause of death well a significant contributor is is that what was in the autopsy report marijuana is not a toxic substance it there's no amount of marijuana that can actually poison someone to the point of death some say that's not true American scientist magazine reported that consuming 100 to 1000 times the effective dose of marijuana could in fact lead to death and while that makes marijuana less toxic than alcohol the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment wants to ban the majority of edibles saying they violate the laws requirement to prevent marketing to children since marijuana has been legalized for recreational use there have been many reports of children accidentally ingesting the product and then ending up in the emergency room that is true and certainly a valid concern accidental ingestion by children is something that that the industry has worked very hard towards minimizing through very strict packaging requirements including child resistant packaging very stringent labeling requirements but the good news is that in the past several months there hasn't been a hospitalization of a child so what that shows me is that people are now becoming more aware of the intensity of these products and the importance of keeping it out of reach of children we reached out to Children's Hospital Colorado and they had a different take saying they've treated 14 children this year seven of whom required intensive care the hospital predicts it will treat double a number of children as they did in 2013 and as for sweetgrass kitchen their staff has quadrupled and their profits have increased five hundred percent since recreational marijuana has been legalized", "lC7spjFs2RY": "hey Pennsylvania patience it's me Medical Mary and we're gonna have an RS snow day the first thing that you have to do is learn how to open one of these packages so there's usually place right up here where you squeeze it and boom there it is microscope packaging is a little different so when this is closed you have to pinch it and then squeeze it open so a lot of the irises are a little thicker and you don't want to break the packaging so I soaked them in a cup of hot water for about two minutes the Terrapin click cartridges can be a little tricky to open you have to pinch and pull and it's real easy because you just dial it up to pull it anything out so what do we put that stuff in a lot of people bake with it but I have a little trick package of starbursts take them flatten it out kind of like this you take the RSO you click out the amount that you want and you just put it on there and roll it up in a ball the Crisco dispensers are a little easier to use but harder to dose see you twist and pull on this and with the plunger you have to push out but not too much make sure you put the dose right in there put that right back on there and then that you have your starburst you roll that up into a ball and there's your nose from the road so that's my little trick on how to make one day with 2dos fine doses to carry with you why did the cattle keep coming back to the marijuana fields it was calling the cattle back that's my easy trick to make as many doses of RSO as you want and why did the cattle keep coming back to the marijuana fields it was the pot calling the cattle back you", "R8VfWupqcK8": "what's going on hemp fans you're watching five best products and today we're gonna show you some of the best hemp gummies on Amazon

these ones are the strawberry lemonade flavors so they got a couple different flavors right now they're always looking to expand more and make more flavors but these are some really good flavor and consistency gummies with really good consistency in that like the gummy itself but also a good consistency in the effect so definitely something to look for something to try out yeah check them out", "BpKYde5BXHI": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today I'm gonna be showing you how to turn regular Cola bottle gummies into you guessed it infused Cola bottle bellies here's what you're going to need two tablespoons of warm water four ounces of Cola flavored gummies one-and-a-half teaspoons of gelatin 1/4 teaspoon of potassium sorbate mixture which I will link how to make below one to two teaspoons of a herbal tincture if desired and a soda bottle mold the first step is to sprinkling a gelatin over the warm water there's no need to stir it just leave it to sit for about five minutes so it can bloom now you can take your Cola gummies and cut them so the lighter color is separated from the darker color place the lighter colored gummies into a dish and add about a quarter of your gelatin mixture then place it in the microwave for about 30 to 40 seconds until it melts once it's melted pour in some your tincture and then stir it in I'm going to be placing my mixture into a squeeze bottle and then putting it into a cup filled with warm water to keep it warm and liquid until I have everything ready to go now repeat this process with the other half of the gummies you'll be using your remaining amount of tincture and all of your gelatin my tincture is having some difficulties binding to the gummy mixture so I'm adding in about a teaspoon of lecithin to help it emulsify now I'm going to pour in both mixture at the same time putting the light color on the top and the dark color on the bottom once that's done I'll place them in the fridge or the freezer for about in half an hour so I can take them out of their mold [Music] I want some of them to be coated in sugar so I just filled a little bag with some sugar and shook them around and then I will leave these to sit out for about 24 hours so any excess moisture can evaporate that's it now your gummies are ready to be enjoyed [Music] thank you guys so much for watching if you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe [Music]", "sINnYmma-9s": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary today is a classic ass episode which means edible review but this is not a company that is new to us but it is new to us in the world of edibles uh that is because it's from moxie the folks over at moxie uh we've actually reviewed a few products from them um i know we've done a couple of carts and live resin where they have a different branding mx by moxie there but now they are in the edibles game with the classic cannabis infused gummy uh it seems like if you are a weed company and you want to branch out from whatever your starting project product is you go gummies and that's what looks like it's happening with moxie uh this packaging is pretty uh nice it's uh kind of like a aluminum can little puck here uh pretty substantial actually uh this little tin is not cheap i'm sure uh but you got all the stuff you want to see on it uh we've got our lab testing results here on the side uh and then we've got uh our dosage instructions which these are uh 10 milligram gummies they're 10 10 milligram gummies in here for 100 milligrams in total uh and these gummies cost me 17 bucks at my dispensary which puts them at the ever so slightly above average price point for a 100 milligram gummy in my neck of the woods uh it does say on here that uh moxie has won 90 plus industry awards neat uh i always find those things to be more annoying than edifying or clarifying uh if you're not gonna tell us what awards you've won uh why should i believe you anyways uh we need some more uh you know packaging regulations here but uh that's neither here nor there let's get to the moxie good stuff i did not actually mention what flavor this is it is the member berry flavor or strain i guess i didn't realize there was a member berry strain before this it does show member berries on there uh i don't know what k i assume member barry got its name from the south park episode which minor rant here boy south park uh on the air for 24 seasons now i remember back when people were making jokes about the simpsons getting along in the tooth back around it's like 15th 16th 17th season uh and now we here we are with south park uh at its 24th season i think there was even a time where south park mocked the simpsons for being uh so long in the tooth that is not to knock south park it's just crazy how long actually and resilient that show has been around anyways member berries uh i don't actually have never seen the episode i don't really watch south park anymore still appreciate what those fine folks do but um i do remember hearing on the internet for about 24 hours people saying remember when a member something like that remember barry who knows uh i assume it tastes just like berries uh let's go ahead and get into this edible here this is 17 thing of gummies uh with my experiences with moxie have been good uh nothing to write a home about like um totally fine makers of cartridges uh and i've had some of their wax before too in non-cartridge form and found it to be totally unobjectionable uh nothing stand out but nothing uh to be suspicious of either all right well here is our here are our gummies rather got a little moxie logo on them uh 10 gummies in there i i guess the idea that every gummy has to be five milligrams everything has to be five milligrams is becoming irrelevant that was a law but i see everything lots of things now uh packaged as 10 milligrams so uh getting lax cool shut up siri she keeps thinking i'm talking to her uh anyways here is our moxie member berry let's give this a shot hmm wow very pleasant very pleasant starting taste um kind of a chewier gummy i don't really need to tell you what a gummy gummy's gonna taste like it's pretty fruity to start uh but there is actually a very strong cannabis aftertaste i mean it's not grotesque most gummies don't get uh offensively bad you've got enough sugar in there to mask the taste but there is a pretty strong weed aftertaste here so if you are very sensitive to it watch out fine for the first two or three seconds and then there it is actually about five alarm weed taste there you got a couple of seconds uh before it really hits you wow that is powerful that is one of the uh more weedy tasting gummies that i've had uh in some time i wonder how they infused uh if they did something different it looks like uh same process as far as i can tell just a very strong weed taste uh that does make me a little optimistic that these are gonna be pretty potent uh there's not necessarily a total correlation between oh well somebody just subscribed apparently that's what that noise was um there's not always a correlation between taste and potency but there sometimes is so fingers crossed that these member berries are going to be as potent as we hope uh for me guys i am gonna eat all 10 of these it's probably going to take me oh i'm going to do over the next half hour 45 minutes or so and then 90 minutes two hours after i have that last one i'll come right back here and let you guys know the most important part about the edible review is it gonna get you high and i've got really really high hopes no pun intended for these with that aftertaste until then guys thanks for sticking around we'll see you right back here in just a bit oh there it is bye welcome back to wheats guys it has been about uh just over two hours since i had my first member berry uh cannabis infused gummy from moxie and that is a really sticky inside of a container there a lot of residue anytime i'm talking about residue it means i'm pretty high uh so these are pretty good gummies these are um i would say um on the good end of average the high end of average they're uh good not outstanding not the absolute best i've ever had uh not the best test tasting gummies by a long shot but they are certainly going to get the job done uh for anybody who is familiar with 100 milligram edibles um 100 milligram gummies uh if they work for you these are going to do the job they are just a total uh thumbs up in terms of quality uh really the only thing to talk about here uh is gonna be the taste and price uh the taste didn't offend me that much uh i quite used to a pretty bitter cannabis aftertaste and uh there was that potency you want with the with that uh taste but it is a stronger cannabis aftertaste if you're looking for gummies with no weed taste these aren't for you uh and that these were the only other thing to mention is that these weren't the cheapest gummies these aren't the cheapest gummies available at my dispensary um so i would not necessarily buy these myself because i know that i can get just as good of a gummy for a cheaper price at my dispensary say a um punch edibles or a buddha's best they have a couple of different gummies at a i at my place for sometimes uh like five bucks cheaper than these so that is a thing to consider uh it really is just going to depend on the price at your dispensary because there is nothing again in this package that's going to say uh it's worth a premium over any other gummy um but you know totally perfunctory and good i'd say these moxie may not have moxie but they have gumption gumption what a weird word speaking of gumption no speaking of moxie let's do a little cherry on top we're gonna do something with some real moxie uh and cherry on tops by the way anytime we have a review that we like we like to give a little something extra that's not weed related uh and let's do something with as i said somebody with some moxie now normally i have a policy i don't like to uh give any cherry on tops for anything that i've actually finished uh because you know i like to it's a wheat thing we we do the entire experience but i've been enjoying this book so much i'm confident that even though i've only got about a uh i don't know a couple dozen pages or so left to go i'm confident that i'm still uh if enjoyed enough to give it my recommendation and that book is a nonfiction book by the author maria konokova uh former writer for the new yorker called the biggest bluff uh she is a fantastic writer and a psychology phd from harvard uh who uh decided to take a break from writing and instead uh spend a year training to become a poker champ after having never played poker uh she just decides that she wants to see what it's all about but really it's a book about how to make good decisions how to avoid making bad decisions why poker is a good analog for decision making it's a pretty fascinating stuff she's an excellent writer it's a really cool concept again the book is the biggest bluff by maria konakova uh that is an excellent book from an author who has a lot of moxie and somebody who has a little bit of moxie is moxie and their member um edible i almost forgot that's

discreet so let me show you a few tested and trusted companies that sell CBD gummies so that you can satisfy your sweet tooth and enjoy those incredible CBD virtues also if you want to buy any CBD products click the link in the video description that's where you'll find the best and latest deals so first on the list we have royal CBD gummies these guys are packed with 25 milligrams of CBD in each gummy they're offered at $79.99 and the pack contains 30 gummies they come in a round shape and they're or they're offered in an assortment of three flavors strawberry grape and orange they use only natural ingredients and they have no animal derivatives which means that there are a hundred percent vegan next on the list is Charlotte's Web gummies these guys provide three areas of focus for their gummies so if you're having trouble sleeping they have gummies specific for that if you want gummies to relax they have the calm focus gummies and then they have the recovery targeted gummies so each pack contains 60 servings with 10 milligrams of CBD per gummy the sleep version is raspberry flavor and it contains melatonin the calm version is lemon-lime flavored and the recovery pack is ginger flavored and contains turmeric and each pack is sold by a Charlotte's Web at $54.99 then there are two CBD effects products that I want to share with you the first one is just the regular gummies these guys are sold for 49.99 and there are 60 gummies per pack but each gummy is only packed with 5 milligrams of CBD that's one of the lower dosage and it's a great option if you're just getting started with CBD these are mixed berry flavored and they're also vegan the other product is the CBDs melatonin gummies for sleep so obviously these should be taken right before you go to bed and these will help you get a good night's rest so same price and same amount of gummy bears per pack except these gummy bears are loaded with 10 milligrams of CBD and 5 milligrams of melatonin the flavor is juicy lemon and of course they are also vegan last but not least the just CBDs gummies now these are for those who are dead serious about CBD gummies this 3,000 milligrams jar contains about 220 gummy bears packed with thirteen point five milligrams of CBD each so if you're taking a few of these daily then this could be a really good option to buy in bulk but you don't have to stick to gummy bears they actually have quite a few different options but they all have different CBD dosage so make sure to check it in the description all right this wraps up this video on CBD gummies I hope you enjoyed it if you're thinking about buying some for yourself or for a friend just make sure to click the link in the video description you'll get the best prices and the latest deals have an

trial of delta eight so got excited we order it i've already ordered soft gels i'm about to call and get some gummies ordered as well remember that i had a sample a company that i sell my flour through has the gummy so they had sent me a sample with my last order and i kind of put them off to the side didn't really want to try them if i couldn't sell them uh surely didn't want to get excited about a product that i wasn't able to offer anyone so now that i can i tried one at 12 15 12 30 somewhere around there 45 minutes 30 minutes before lunch time for me uh i know what was gonna happen didn't know what to expect of course i've looked up what it does how you can kind of some people get a better appetite or kind of gives you that relaxed feeling that positive vibes that kind of thing i said you know why not let's try it let's give it a shot so 30 minutes in you you really could start feeling it uh there are 25 milligram gummies uh that kind of gives you an idea the soft gels i ordered just now are 15 milligrams okay so keep that in mind but uh i did i felt i felt happy i felt like a motivated i don't know how to explain it it was it was uh it was it was so i i want to say unexpected i mean it definitely wasn't euphoric i mean i mean come on now let's be honest let's not reach into the vocabulary bag and start trying to pull words out like that i mean uh let's let's bring it back down to earth here but it was you could definitely feel it but it was still clear-headed you still could focus you could concentrate you can do all of that but you really do get that ah feeling that i mean i don't know i just i just don't know how to explain it to you it's it's it was surprising i didn't of course people tell you oh you're gonna feel this or you can read you know read an article there's a thousand of them oh you're gonna feel this or oh you experienced this or but until you try it it's different it's not it's creepy it's not like like creeping on you what i mean i'm so creepy wow um it's slow it kind of builds up builds up and you're just like oh okay this is this is good i can get used to this it's pretty cool so i don't know i'm really surprised by it i think i think y'all will really enjoy these i'm excited um soft shells should be here within three weeks i know that's a long time but they've got to create the labels for me they've got to do all that fun stuff so i'm thinking three weeks is a good guess hoping they're here within two but i don't want to get uh too optimistic uh gummies i haven't ordered yet hopefully to have those within two weeks second i get everything in i will pop on and let you know but i just wanted to kind of share my experience with the first time trying it it's the first time i've ever tried delta h so i will definitely be trying it again y'all have a great day", "MZrK0P33TWI": "what does Arkana fam and welcome back to another product review video just for you guys so check it out for this video right here I have some more edibles alright so these are the drops these are lime drops and these are 50 milligrams of THC each I got two of them so we got 100 milligrams total which I already know I already know some of you me be viewing this like hundred grams as [ __ ] that's just done a lot that's weak sauce yeah okay I agree with you but really quick just to let everybody know 50 grams is the limit here on our edibles in the state of Oregon okay so if your recreational 21 and up you have a limit of 50 milligrams now you can buy multiple you can buy you know five six seven of these you know what I mean but you're still limited to 50 milligrams and it's kind of rather expensive to be honest for just 50 okay I mean these were like 6 or 7 bucks a box for just 50 milligrams you know what I mean so you can see how that kind of adds up alright but anyway so these are a lime jelly okay both of these are a lime jelly and I believe they're just bite size let's see here a point or 0.8 percent or whatever 0.8 grams percent grams of sugar and no fats no no cool all right lime essential oil oil and cannabis extract and cannabis deprived terpenes okay okay this is balanced okay so right here let's see if I can show you guys this better right there they tell you the so if you just take one of those little slivers out of this that's five milligrams so if you're trying to dose yourself out they got a little dosage chart right there as soon as you open it up so you can get ten servings you can cut out of this five milligrams each serving okay for a total of 50 milligrams all right I don't know why I keep saying balanced on there it says balanced balanced like what the [ __ ] okay great you're balanced I'm not at least I'll try not to be here we go [Music] [Music] super line like super lime like holy [ __ ] that is a rush of lime flavor it's very nice it's got this covered in sugar so the code of sugar really adds to it it tastes great it nice and soft it's not like a hard gummy I like it this is a vegan product it does say vegan right there so if you are somebody that is vegan this is going to work perfect for you okay [Music] hmm you kind of get that taste of cannabis right there at the end the aftertaste you can you definitely taste a little smidgen of weed in there but overall it's got a nice flavor it tastes really good it tastes just like a candy I mean it tastes like a lime gummy candy and it's really good it's not bad um I actually like this product I actually like it I'll give it a thumbs up I give it a definite thumbs up I would definitely recommend it and the reason I recommend it is because you here in Oregon since it's 50 milligrams for each meaning if you want more you got to buy more so when you're buying more if you're buying ones that are like huge chunks of candy or huge chunks of chocolate or whatever the [ __ ] that's a lot of sugar that you have to [ __ ] intake just to get the milligrams that you need okay or what that's crazy okay I'm not trying to be diabetic so the fact that it's bite-sized the fact that it's just one little quick all right and I got my full 50 milligrams that's awesome I love that alright so let me know about your guys's opinions on the drop here let me I dropped it let me pick up the drop on the drop alright drops cannabis jellies that's that's the name of this company be sure to check out the drops cannabis jellies if you've ever had this product let me know your thoughts and opinions in the comment section below if you like this channel and support the channel then please please drop a big like

from much love guys seriously I appreciate each and every one of you you guys are all awesome and until next time I'm out of here oh [ __ ] Thank You Adam Vegas go hey the clouds around it look like", "_pg1lPaeQaA": "in your words tell me about the very basic difference of ingesting marijuana via and edible versus smoking or vaporizing it sure so so the first thing is your body deals with cannabis very differently when it's ingested it if you're eating something it's actually processed by the GI tract and processed by the liver it changes from Delta 9 THC to hydroxy 11 which is more potent and the biggest thing is that takes time right we when we drink wine with a meal we don't get drunk like that right we let it kind of prickly and enjoy the experience so edibles are very similar when consumed there's other uptake or delivery systems right your oral mucosa is a very efficient delivery system our mints for example are dissolved in the mouth or tinctures right go under the tongue those are quicker one of the hardest things about edibles is the delay and getting consumers to understand that you have to be patient we are not a patient people so there is a learning curve there right education we have to talk about it we have to talk to tourists we have to be able to have a dialogue and not be afraid to ask questions especially because if we do have history with marijuana maybe smoking marijuana it's kind of an instant gratification thing we know if we're at a six or even an eighth about five minutes in edibles it can be anywhere from what an hour maybe sometimes more than two yeah so the the state language is this will this product may be delayed by two or more hours what we see is depending on the product type really you're looking at 30 minutes to an hour and a half depending on a lot of things right are you eating an edible and then putting a meal right on top of that that will get the THC into your system much faster than if you eat a meal and then take something that is a slower process the state changed some of its regulations regarding labeling just earlier this year on February 1st and and and part of that was being more explicit about this could take more than two hours but I know before you guys were before that regulation took place the Dixie had some really creative activation illustration on the back of its products and and I'm wondering have you guys tweaked those since the states regulations have kind of caught up with you guys on that level yeah you know we always continue to tweak those as we get feedback on on how long products are taking to affect someone we will adjust our barometer right it's a strength time scale and one of the things we believe really strongly is we can have a whole paragraph of warnings that no one's going to read or we can make a visual icon that someone's going to see and get information from quicker so when we say that a serving size is 7 milligrams or 10 milligrams and we'll take 60 minutes that is a easier way for a consumer to understand faster what they need to do and and everything we do on our labels as much as possible is to get consumers to understand how to take that product and how to dose that product", "mAZXWAuWp6E": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys welcome back today I'm gonna be showing you guys how to make nerd ropes here's what you're going to need two boxes of nerds one cup of gummy bears and some tincture the first step is to fold some foil in an accordion shape and spread it along a baking sheet then you can pour your Nerds into each fold of the tin foil make sure you have enough because if you don't the gummy make sure we'll stick to the tin foil and it'll be harder to take them out after then you'll melt you're going bears in the microwave for about 40 seconds and if you like add 1 tablespoon of ginger and stir it in I'm gonna be pouring my gummy mixture into a squeeze bottle so it'll be easier to dispense be careful not to pour too much just like I did on that first one take it slow and just do a thin line now you can top the ropes with some more nerds once they've all been filled squish the tinfoil together to make them into a tighter more compact shape then put them into the fridge or freezer I still had some remaining mixture left and instead of making more ropes I'm just gonna make some little nerd bytes by using a mold that I had on hand I also added some more nerds on top before I put them into the fridge once they've solidified in the fridge or freezer shake off the excess nerds into a bowl and then peel them off the tinfoil now some of mine came off okay but some of them I had a little more difficulty with so I decided to leave them out for about 24 hours outside of the fridge or the freezer so that they could dry out a little bit more which made them a lot easier to peel off the nerd bites in the silicone mold came out really easily after letting them sit in the freezer for about an hour [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you guys they turned out so beautifully it did take an extra day for them to drive because they were sticking to the tinfoil but after I let them dry they turned out absolutely wonderful just make sure you put enough nerds on the bottom part of the tinfoil so that you're not having issues with the going mixture sticking I can't believe how fantastic they all came out I'm so excited and they're so delicious because I have already tried some and the little bites are so few I love them so much I could have made more ropes but I kind of liked having these little ones if you just grab I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you to the person who requested me to make this video because I'm absolutely in love with these and I'll be definitely making them again thank you guys so much for watching I hope you try these out have a wonderful day", "pQwaeMBquhc": "hi I'm chef Tony Galliano for magical butter calm and today we're going to do one of our all-time favorite recipes magical

reasons to try CBD gummies many people have a soft spot in their hearts for dummies after all how many of us have taken by the men's in gummy form at some point or simply grabbed a bag to snack on but what does this have to do with CBD well in the last five to ten years the health benefits of taking CBD oil medicinally for a wide number of ailments has grown exponentially with that growth manufacturers and sellers of the product have quickly found numerous ways to take the substance including oils vaping topically and yes in gummy form if you've already decided that you want to try CBD oil for the health benefits it's likely that your next question is why would I take gummies instead of the other forms of CBD in the next few minutes we'll cover the reasons you may or may not prefer gummies to the other forms of CBD oil let's start with the fact that it's easy to take of all the forms of CBD gummies are for most people the easiest to take many people who have tried the oil form of CBD struggle putting it under their tongue or with the taste of it pills can also be a struggle if you don't like taking them or have issues swallowing gummies are formulated to have a fruit taste which is light and satisfying and most importantly is easy to consume gummies also have long lasting effects both vaping and the oil forms of CBD get into your bloodstream very quickly both of these methods bypass the digestive system and can be great options if you need instant relief from pain or anxiety the relief is generally short-lived however as the effects of vapor normally wear off in under an hour while oils last for a few hours with gummies you can normally get six to eight hours of relief thanks to the slower absorption and release that takes place in your digestive system dosing is also very easy with Gummy's ever tried to figure out exactly where they product it isn't easy and what exactly is a dropper full of CBD oil on the other hand gummies are easy need 10 milligrams of CBD and each gummy is 20 milligrams cut it in half and you are good to go they're also very discreet unfortunately there's still a social stigma in some circles surrounding anything that is related to cannabis if you are part of one of these circles even CBD use could be frowned upon in these situations something as ordinary as eating a quote/unquote gummy bear will be questioned and will still provide the benefits that you're looking for and finally there's no smoking involved one of the most common complaints we hear from people not wanting to try cannabis based products is that they don't want to harm their lungs well problem solved you can find CBD gummies both with and without th e to give you the benefits you want without ever having to smoke cannabis now we realized that we didn't cover many of the health benefits of CBD or recommend any CBD gummy brands in this video but we do have a free ebook covering both topics that you can download by going to plant driven health calm slash book if you have any questions regarding CBD gummies please leave them in the comments below and we'll reply and before you go we'd appreciate it that if you liked the video you leave us a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel for more CBD related content in the future", "IPkXQ5Pi7G4": "[Music] my name is Liz if this is the first time you stopped by and for the rest of you guys welcome back Oh at the twenty five thousand mark woohoo thank you guys so much again could not do any of that with only all your support and your kindness and I do truly truly appreciate it so today I am going to show you how to make an infused can of honey yeah that's right it can infused honey and then we're gonna take that honey and make honey garlic chicken wings whoops that's right put a little stock your levels got away yeah honey garlic chicken wings right so of course as always I'm gonna get into those ingredients what we need and we're gonna get this stuff made alright so for our infused honey what you're going to need is I'm using a half a cup of honey so again it's gonna be however how much you want to do 1/2 a cup of cup if you use a lot of it go for a cup if you don't use it that often then stick to a quarter cup half a cup you're gonna want about a tablespoon of your coconut oil now a little something here if you were using the coconut oil this with a solid one the one that solidifies like that then you actually want to use a cream honey would work better however I don't have that on hand so I just had the regular honey if you were using a liquid oil like an MCT oil or olive oil basically any type of oil like that if it's a liquid oil then you want to go with the liquid type of honey so basically cream cream liquid liquid easy way to remember and then I'm using about three and a half grams of my d carved Erb and for those who don't know it but D carving is to activate your THC a to THC you do that by putting it into a class you can use a glass mason jar like I have or at oven-safe glass baking dish cover that with tin foil pre-heat your oven to 240 degrees put that in for approximately 40 minutes after that take it out let it completely cool before you're gonna do anything else with it and that's how to deke our viewer so that's all we need for our honey then for our chicken wings what you're going to need is well the amount of chicken wings that you want to use so I have about 10 years that have split so five full ones or 10 split and you're going to want or you can use black pepper onion powder some rosemary rosemary leaves that's right yeah rosemary leaves and thyme leaves they give it a really nice flavor but you want to use this very very little of it and kosher salt or sea salt is best it's really nice getting those pops of salt flavor because they're in that crystal form but regular salt will work too if you don't have that no big deal and some garlic powder and olive oil that's what we're gonna do to make up our base seasoning for our chicken wings this makes them taste really really good so for those who don't want honey garlic on your wings these are gonna taste awesome just on their own all right so let's jump into our equipment and then let's get some stuff made alright so the equipment that we're gonna need for the honey infusion is you are French press or you can use a mason jar with the lid that are perfectly fine a small saucepan that we're going to use to heat up the honey and our first you're going to want a larger pot that is going to fit your the container that you're using but you want to make sure that the water can come up high enough to come above your honey line you always want to make sure that it's covered by water that will control our temperature so that nothing burns so that's the only thing make sure your pot is deep enough yeah ham blender and an ingredient that I forgot which I'm not sure we may or may not need it is soy or sunflower lecithin to emulsify I am hopeful we're going to be able to accomplish that with the hand blender however we may need it if we do end up using or having to if it does because I didn't order them if it is a necessity ingredient I will put it in a list of ingredients otherwise I'll this list of is optional but other than that that's what we need for the honey oh sorry spatula and a small whisk or a whisk and then just for our chicken you just need a oven baking dish or cookie a cookie sheet of work and you can line it with parchment paper or use a nonstick oven spray my words today where are my words alright so that's all the equipment we basically need as usual you know I always forget something so the first thing I'm going to start is the honey infusion because that's going to take a couple of hours and then I'm gonna set up the wings because I'm going to do a first cook on those with all our spices then when our honey's ready we're going to do a second cook on them and apply the honey garlic sauce alright so let's get in let's make our honey and some chicken wings alright so first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna add my honey to my pot my little saucepan here Gideon Gideon and we are adding our shortening now the reason that you're adding shortening or you need to add some type of fat is THC is not water-soluble it is oil soluble as we know honey has no fat in it at all so for those who are doing infusions with just honey and heat what you may be getting is some of the loose crystals that come off and just staying there but you're not getting a true infusion because there's nothing to dissolve that THC away from the from the plant itself so that's why you have to incorporate some type of fat but as I said coconut oil olive oil any type of oil is going to do but you need some in there in order for it to dissolve and extract the THC into your honey otherwise really all you if you don't use it all you got is chlorophylls honey well a little bit of crystals alright so I'm going to put that put those two in and I'm going to heat them up on low until they're both til it's all melted together and you want to make sure you do it on low because you again you don't want to burn anything both your honey in your coconut oil you're using that melts at a very low at a very low heat meantime I'm going to bring my larger pot to a boil and then turn it down so once your honey and your coconut oil when sure honey in your coconut oil I've melted by the looks oh yeah all those things separated so we're likely going to be in abusing an emulsifier but epithet kind of hoping the hand blender I'll take care about that but we'll see anyway once it's melted you're going to take your jar or your French press we're going to pour this into yeah [Music] then I'm going to add my part plant material and you want to break it up [Music] there's my favorite smell anyone who doesn't doesn't just hurt a little bit when you pour it into something you know there's gonna be an awesome end product but it does hurt just a little when you just pour it into it oh but you know Oh sweetness at the end I'm just gonna mix that in there so again I've got a calculator I'm gonna put a calculator there for in the description for you so you can calculate how strong you want to make your your honey infusion Oh once I got all that mixed in if you're using your French press throw the lid on it you want to keep it the your thing up the straighter piece just above your honey and in your oil and then you're gonna place it into your water and was over point one yeah the most important thing is to make sure your water line is above the honey because otherwise your honey and the oil will continue to increase in heat and it will burn your herbs so very important that the water always maintains above the honey line and you're gonna leave that simmer on low or simmer on medium low for about two hours and you also want to make sure to every bit of ten minutes or so period I'll go through and use a whisk or your spatula just stir it around so while our honey is simmering there I'm going to do up the chicken wings so I give them in two stages I do a fake we bake them about 3/4 of the way through and then I let those cool completely and then we deep-fry them so you can use a deep fryer or I just make a makeshift one with a pot and just strainer in it or you can just use a frying pan with some oil in it that'll work too this way they turn out super nice and crispy and they're really awesome so what we are going to do you is we're gonna take about a tablespoon or two of olive oil that one and a half see what's cooking there's no other there's no real exact measurements well there is if you have a cookbook but with cooking it's very much to flavor and what you like so that's why it's kind of like in and about so we'll smart watch what they do alright so I am going to add in a little bit of thyme leaves thyme leaves you want to use a bed of maybe a no more than a quarter of a teaspoon they are very it is a very strong spice so if you use too much of it you're really going to know the sickness doesn't taste very nice and the same thing with your rosemary just about a quarter of a teaspoon or so rosemary onion powder and we're gonna use say that I have a teaspoon of pepper again you can use a little more little less to taste and but a quarter teaspoon of kosher salt now when you're using like the kosher salt or the sea salt you don't want to use too much of it like you would your regular salt because as I said you've got these big crystals out them and if you do too much like wool but it's really nice to get that like kind of single salt pop is so just don't want to use too much of that and once you've got all that in your bowl we're gonna oh I forgot the garlic and some garlic powder again about a tablespoon if you like however much there maybe not that much maybe about two teaspoons sorry let's not go that much on the garlic powder together to learn ice snow mix then we're gonna dump our wings into our olive oil and spice mix grab my tongs and you're just gonna mix it around get them all coated Oh smells yummy already you're not even done that's I said but spacing them up this way for those who don't like honey garlic um you can just eat these wings without any seasoning or straight without any sauce or if you want a hot sauce you can it'll go well with that as well just a really good wing and once you talk them all well mix put them into your baking dish spread them out and then we're gonna bake these for about 35 through 35 to 40 minutes depending on how big your wings are so you want them about just clocked or about 3/4 of the way cook we don't want them golden brown they're still gonna look a little raw probably a little bleedy but that's okay that's what we want them because again we're going to do a second cook on them so don't worry about that we just want to set get about 3/4 the wake up or just cook so I'm gonna pop these into the oven as I said for about a half hour I bet a half hour or 40 minutes should be good and meanwhile give a little stir up here with my honey and partway through don't forget to just to flip you're always around alright then once your wings are done you just take we're gonna take them out and put them on a plate to let them cool and once they've cooled down you can put them in the fridge until your money's ready alright so the honey is ready I take her out from the pot and so I just got a measuring spoon and a small strainer or get a larger strainer or you can use a cheesecloth and I'm gonna pour gonna pour this through a spatula get at all the yummy yum ease and then you just want to make sure to strain through get out all your honey and then what you can also do because this is a honey and coconut oil mixture here is you can save this pulp and use it as an exfoliator yeah you can make an expose with that but you can make a facial exfoliator from it it's really nice and once that's all stre nud gonna get my hand blender actually first I'm gonna let this cool for about 20 minutes then I'm gonna get the hand blender and we're gonna blend that up so started with a half cup I lost just a little bit not that much you use a cheesecloth you can really get really muscle it and probably get almost every every little ounce out of it so I'm just gonna let that cool for a bit and I get the hand blender and we'll mix that up and I'll see whether or not we'll need to add the lecithin all right got my blender and I'm hope this is gonna work because my but I don't have that much and my bowl is a little shallow so hoping the blender will work so no weird I are going to need to use a little bit of less in the oil is not completely I'm also flying with the honey here so we're gonna add a little bit about a quarter of a teaspoon of lecithin as I said I've only got a half a cup of honey here so I don't want to use two months so generous quarter teaspoon I'll let it dribble at all on the top all right so you're just gonna continue to blend that until it is one uniform color and texture and it will lighten up quite a bit so like so and and then you just want to make sure that you don't see any oil coming to the top if you do go with the hand blender a little bit longer or add a little bit more or less a thin and you'll be good so now just waiting for the chicken wings to cool finish cooling and we'll get on to that second part of making these oh so yummy honey garlic chicken wings actually while I waited for my chicken wings to cool look cool now I am going to mix my honey and my garlic to give my garlic time to infuse the flavor into the honey so I'm gonna use probably about a quarter cup of my honey because I want to save some for tea and stuff later mmm looks so good check it out and then you want to get about one or two about a tablespoon to the two tablespoons of chopped finely chopped garlic and mix that together and again the garlic can be to taste if you're not a big garlic person just use them about a half a tablespoon you really like garlic go for the full two tablespoons mmm and I'm just gonna add in a little bit of salt so I'm just adding in a pinch of sea salt salt is always good it helps to bring out your sweetness and accent those flavors and also bring out the nice honey flavor all right so I'm just gonna let sit let that sit until my chicken wings are ready to go for their second cooking and it's an option for your honey garlic for your honey garlic sauce you can add in soya sauce not a lot some people don't like soy sauce Biden added as the main ingredient you can do it optional so you just want to add about a quarter to no more than a half a teaspoon I stick it to about a quarter teaspoon and just mix that in well and there you go cuz you don't want it to be too salty or too heavy and that's it for the soy sauce just gonna get the chicken wings they're nice and cool we'll get those cooked up and add the sauce on all right so you're gonna get your chicken inside of the fridge you want to make sure that there see cold and you're going to turn your oil on the one eat it up to 350 degrees standby another metal bowl or blast wall for us to do our mixing up in alright so but oil is the 315th and we start frying these puppies up so you want to fry them to deep fry them for about five minutes or so remember they're mostly cooked we just want them to be nice and golden brown be careful [Applause] George it's about a nice golden brown like shake off the excess oil workin so hard today [Applause] and dump into your whole ears and I'm just going to finish Bryan up the rest of my buddies now all my chicken wings are cooked it in the bowl you're gonna take your honey garlic sauce let's mix it up make sure everything's mixed up and we're gonna drizzle that all on mmm mmm good oops oh well get some hands Tom Mix that all right make sure they're all nicely covered and I like doing I know something like why are you doing two-step method because you can't get the crispness that you do doing a single cook method doing this two stage method you get this really nice crispness on your chicken one and so it's a just mix those all around grab a plate pull them onto your peach and there you have it oops all that extra sauce and there we have it honey garlic chicken wings and yeah I can't wait to dig into these puppies so I hope you enjoyed that video if you have any questions at all or any comments please don't hesitate to put them you know where yeah look who's hanging around for chicken wings not these ones puppy all right well thank you so much for joining me I really appreciate your support as always once again oh happy New Year to everybody and thanks again for

peace", "0_nI-GJgVo0": "all right so we're talking about edibles and sex so when it comes to consuming edibles for greater sexual satisfaction here's what you need to know one what is inedible inedible is a solid or liquid form of consuming THC so a brownie a sucker a drink is what an edible is second dosing when it comes to pairing cannabis and sexytime for greater sexual satisfaction you want to be super super careful not to overdo it you don't want to get too high get in your head or pass out right we want to have a positive experience so dosing is really really important so for a beginner or a novice consumer I recommend about 2 to 5 milligrams for my more experienced consumers 10 plus that is kind of the range that I that I like to recommend and stick to the third thing that I want you to know is the timeframe so when it comes to edibles because of the way that it goes through our digestive system it takes longer to feel the effects which means that on average it takes about 30 to 45 minutes to feel the euphoric high or any effects of the cannabis what I don't want you to do is eat 5 milligrams 15 20 minutes later say I don't feel anything and then eat another 5 milligrams because the time the effects kick in you're at 10 milligrams and that might be just too much for you what I'd like you to do is eat your edible and then put a timer set the timer for about 30 to 45 minutes when the timer goes off you can check in with yourself how am i feeling what am i experiencing from there you can choose to add a little bit more but again you want to be careful because sometimes it can take an hour or even more again it's just an average of 30 to 45 minutes the key thing here is that you can always add more but you can't take away and here's just a little bonus what my partner and I like to do is we eat inedible and then we sit down and we have a communication exercise and connection tool to help ground us into the present moment helping us be more in our bodies more in connection and present with each other during that time is usually when we start to feel the edible kick in and it just flows really nicely into sexual exploration or intimacy so if you have no idea what I'm talking about what is a communication tool or connection practice don't worry I've got you look below in the comments and click three minutes a captivating connection it is a free video for you and your partner to help increase sexual satisfaction through connection and presence with one another so go ahead buy and edible do the connection and communication tools and then write me and let me know how it goes sending so much love and here's to higher intimacy and epic love", "42BJGT68owU": "[Music] hi my name is Bart and today we're gonna try th C rich + gummies they come in two flavors blackberry and lemon indica and sour watermelon sativa I really like the packaging all the information you need is front and center you can see they're gluten free with no artificial sweeteners the can keeps the gummies from getting squished and has a strong twist off seal the indica gummies are in a 91 THC to CBD ratio that means that their THC dominant so you may feel high with some psycho activity there's two flavors inside the indica blackberry and lemon now let's check out the sativa gummies these are 100 percent THC so these guys are even a little more potent there's one flavor inside sour watermelon the gummies are small but you can still easily bite them in half if you want a smaller micro dose well they taste so sweet and the best part is there's smells so good just remember they are small and poet so it's important to start low and go slow you can always get more at hello MD calm until next time [Music]", "duC7PNt55es": "welcome to 420 RX cannabis

doing candy yeah I'm doing baked Bros gummy bears again these are baked pros gummy bears this entire contrack ajiz 150 milligrams of THC 10 milligrams each piece and there is 15 pieces in here so 15 doses and this actually has directions on the bag most of them normally don't but it says start with one dose which is 10 milligrams I love worth up to 90 minutes for effects and consumers needed suggested use temporarily reduces pain stimulates appetite sleep aid and relief of nausea okay so again baked pros gummy bears 10 milligrams each you know guys you know I'm a lightweight so I'm just gonna start with wine right I'm going to cut into this right now I need to cut it again because evidently I didn't cut below the seal this cut low enough that I'm not cutting all right to hit me and just because I'm going for I get it so honey bear squishy yeah Oh something got put the sugar around it because he's very cannabis II and you know I tend to stray away from edibles that have a strong lead taste because I just don't like the V taste that's a personal thing you might I'm glad I read this it says testing accuracy plus or minus three milligrams of THC per piece oh and that's the thing would be good you kind of always don't know exactly how much teach so you're getting and that's why it's best you're like you know trouble I'm and then wait a little bit before you try nothing but they're gummy bears and they're good it's like to me once you get past that initial taste of it like the cannabis taste hmm I guess the sweetness other kind of mellows that out a little bit to me and they're good they taste like gummies you know like gummy bears but growing up and coming beers right and these are things that these especially when you start talking on gummy treats and things like that candy that kids normally eat or that they gravitate towards if you're medicating that way please you know make sure that you're keeping those out of the reach I mean seriously because for them all they see is gummy bear they don't really understand any of this other stuff okay so now that I'm done this is going back into my weed safe and again yes I can have a week I do have a weed safe and I try to keep my things away I have four kids to a grown and then the two youngest or in their team so just because sometimes it's candy and it might look you know killing even though they're old enough to understand what it is I still keep it you know am i safe just you know to keep it away from him but faith grows very good and as far as um I mean there's 15 in here so I mean this is a good amount to dose with okay and when I bought this actually bought this Micra so it's been a while but the price says $31 again baked bros and so many other companies out there they always they're always offering you know not always but sometimes they're specials that you can catch at your dispensary and there are places like weed Maps who else but I go to online they will actually send me notices about different specials that dispensaries are having and a lot of the companies offer you know boku you know buy one get one so what might be you know $31 you may end up getting tuning and that's actually what I did I think for sure I didn't pay the full price for this I end up getting something free or it was on discount or something so like I always tell you be mindful about the specials and deals that your dispensaries have because you can I'm getting your medicine or action alright alright guys that is it so also available in 75 milligrams and 300 milligram bags so you have options okay alright I will talk to you guys later alright y'all take care [Music]", "Vc13A94RRBo": "[Music] what's up guys it's a happy grower here in this video we'll be showing you how to make cannabis infused gummy bears there's just a few simple supplies that you will need [Music] the lead one ounce with unflavored gelatin 6 ounces of jell-o mace half a cup of water 1/3 cup of cannabis infused coconut oil and if you don't have this part ready a previous video shows you how to make it the link is in the description and lastly you'll need candy molds these can be purchased online eBay or Amazon to make the gummies first turn on the stove to medium heat then add your 1/3 cup of coconut allowing it to know once the oil is melted add in your 1/2 cup of water bring the water in oil to low boil stirring regularly next slowly whisk in the unflavored gelatin making sure it isn't even consistency then whisk in the jello mix doing the same thing once mixed only allowed to cook for seven or eight minutes on low to medium heat until does a nice rolling boil as you can see here my husband's great ear candy molds for that sticking and then using the droppers transfer the candy mix to the candy molds take your time during this process spreading an even amount in each mold after 90 minutes in the fridge you can use will then pop right out of molds [Music] two events ticking you can apply a light amount of sugar and that is how you make canvas infused gummy bears if you mind that they do look like regular candies so keep them away from children enjoy [Music]", "CuS8zdDf4Ro": "hey everybody hey guys Justin and Jennifer here with Ravi yoga and wellness so glad to have you joining us today we want to share a brand new product that we just got into the studio I guess it's been maybe a couple of months now months it's Smokey's gummies edibles they are actually out of Oregon and this company Smokies started with a THC product a product that includes THC and they only recently just started having CBD products on their lineup as a result you don't see terribly much information on their website but that is why we wanted to do this review it's really funny the the salesman you're really good of an away the salesman gave me a call it was a random maybe Friday afternoon and wanted to know if we wanted to carry these in the studio and where yoga and wellness studio so I thought no I actually no I thought no we don't need any more gummies and he said no no let me just send you these I'm telling you as soon as you've tried them you'll buy them and he was right they're good he sent me five different varieties and four gummies and one hard candy we still carry all of those in the studio and they were so good the first one I had is a different one that that we will review later the first one I had was so good I couldn't just eat one ga - no I ate all of them I one of all this so I basically had no beauty function the hard candies only had 15 milligrams so there was I think it I think I did the math it was like 85 milligrams so I must have had only four samples anyways I was not high because there is zero THC I did see it let's show them that there's that on the back corner there's zero THC so I was a high but but let me tell you ladies I did not care no should I think you're the rest today I was like what is wrong and then I put in a huge order because I love them and so does everybody else so in this bag you get ten gummies that are 25 milligrams of CBD each the nutrition labels right here on the back there is about 2 grams of sugar per gummy so it's not too bad for those people out there that are concerned about sugar and bean gummies they are 25 milligrams and each gummy right here well I'm just reiterating it there that's a logic of me CBD love all the gummies are gluten free they're not all vegan friendly they do have some vegan friendly options and we carry we have so couple of those flavors in the studio though we also have some sugar-free options as well yep that's true but today's review is on the watermelon flavors not just watermelon it's sour watermelon so I'll just take it from the team so you're gonna notice like when you open they come resealable which is really nice oh my gosh and I'm having trouble getting it open this might be a sign I did not I did not and they're little bitty squares and they're super delicious I actually really like the sour kinds of candies and so this is like a holler back to like the lemon heads or what are those super sour candies that the kids love these days anyway so they're a better sweet tarts but they're gummies but these are gummies in there there's no that's our daughter she just went potty okay so we will have to finish this review very quickly so this um you'll see a little bit of the sugar on the outside it tastes amazing you can eat half of it and then you get like half of the CBD but we preferred all of it so we like to eat all of it yep and if you got our website they said they're revamping their website so it's really because of the THC and because the laws in Oregon have changed to where they can't market gummies anymore because of kids obviously so the website will be updated in the next couple of months is what they said that they're a little bit behind but I wanted to show you the website a little bit they also said I actually talked to our rep on the phone today here is here is the about page well let me see if I can show you my inner I'm only as fast on my internet so as you can see it's a really nice website it's really pretty the problem is the about page is pretty it's it's pretty bare-bones right now they do not offer the third-party test results they do not offer any of the like ingredients list and you also can't buy the products online from their website yet however you can buy them from our thrive hemp store website thrive hemp store calm we should be able to keep the inventory updated there I hope and if you ever have any doubts you can give us a call at four to three to nine zero to three to six again this is in the US we can ship inside the US once you start shipping overseas it gets a little hairy I believe I know that several other CBD companies do have trouble trying to ship overseas so if you're interested in trying a really good it's absolutely delicious gummy it has 25 milligrams of CBD isolate it is not the full spectrum it is a nice lip we absolutely love the Smoky's brand CBD we sell a whole bunch of these things have actually kind of over passed our other brand that we had in the studio and so we absolutely love them and think you should try it out the sour watermelon is awesome so is basically every flavor so as a result of that we're gonna like review every flavor so that we get to taste them that's right so if you like this review or have some products you would like us to review send them to us yeah yeah and leave us a note below let us know what you think of the Smokey's CBD gummies with 25 milligrams each and if you want to buy some check us out at thrive hipster calm see you soon buh-bye thanks so much", "gFahOsF0rrc": "introduction the cannabis plant including hemp has over 120 cannabinoids but only a handful have really been studied and marketed let's take a closer look at delta 9 thc tetrahydrocannabinol and its close cousin delta 8 thc and learn how they differ delta 9 thc is the psychoactive compound present in cannabis that has had the most attention in recent years however over the last couple of years consumers have turned their eyes to delta 8 thc due to its unique properties the difference between delta 8 thc and delta 90 hc so what's the difference between delta 8 thc and delta 90 hc there are three differences there are the differences on a molecular level differences in availability and there are the differences when it comes to experiencing the highs molecular on a molecular level delta 90 hc has a double bond on the ninth carbon chain whereas delta 8 thc has a double bond on the eighth carbon chain despite this being a seemingly small difference it yields big results availability delta 8 thc is less abundant than delta 90 hc in the marijuana cannabis plant only with recent technological advances have we been able to isolate delta 8 thc for it to be publicly available experience delta 8 thc has been shown to give a similar high to delta 90 hc but with less severe side effects the high produced by delta 8 thc in comparison to delta 9 thc which is the most common thc is described as less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable on a more practical level the highs from delta 8 thc are found to have less functionality and pairing effects where to buy delta 8 thc and cannabis products unfortunately you probably will not delta 8 products at your local dispensary as of the time we're writing this article however fresh brothers provides has been able to take the cannabis plant and isolate delta 8 thc to create several products that include delta 8 gummies vegan delta 8 infused gummies delta 8 vape pens and vape cartridge delta 8 distillate in addition to delta 8 products fresh brothers has a whole suite of cannabis products

you being a crazy diesel could be high for all we know they've done the drivers on the road alright what's up you guys it's kink alley here for another a new video so I got Jessica and Lizzie so if you want to are wearing the same outfits from the last video it's because I'm filming a couple of review videos in a row cuz they have you know quite a few products that I want to review some that are edibles and carts and flour and I want to go ahead and you know review as much as I can and put out as much content as we can today we're out just the three of us we're not going outside or anywhere we're just cruising around we're going through the hills and everywhere just kind of cruising we're not going into the parks or anything where anyone's hiking or anything we just wanted to pull over though and I'll insert some of where we drove through here but there's gonna be a vlog as well just kind of us talking and chillin and hanging out but I want to go ahead and get another review in so today we're actually gonna be reviewing another year another heavy hitters product but this time it's not gonna be a cartridge it's actually gonna be their edibles so we have my excuse my nails again I'm gonna get them done soon at home because I can't go anywhere what so we have their two edibles here so one is a cannabis infused gummy pineapple flavor five pieces 20 milligrams each total hundred milligrams we'll go ahead and get closer in super bright where I am I'm sorry you guys but does he just wanted to go out and be out where the Sun is and I'll do a closer up of this maybe in a second so the other one is cannabis infused got me strawberry 5 pieces 20 milligrams each total hundred milligrams here anything to kind of get the point of it perfect and then let me try to do the pineapple one more time just get a really good one of all right so we're gonna go ahead and review both of these for the flavor so let's go ahead and see so star burning fuse - 10 milligram servings per piece let's go ahead and read the back if there's anything so it says gluten-free dairy-free not free so gluten free dairy free not free super vegan I guess that's okay right it doesn't say specifically v4 like vegan or anything but it does say clean kind of is guaranteed let's see let's go ahead ten milligrams THC less than 2 milligrams CBD per piece it doesn't say specifically indica or sativa so most likely it's a hybrid that these gummies are so we're gonna go ahead and get into the strawberry ones here in this video you know go ahead and try one oh these are cute so they are rippable it um it's like a super soft like what is it called like a starburst if they put sugar around it but it's also soft like a gummy bear and it rips in half into two pieces but I'm just gonna go ahead and eat the whole piece as a 20 milligram so I'm gonna let her try it first and then I'm gonna give my thoughts on it so that way I don't say anything that like makes her change her thoughts on it so don't say anything but let me know when you once you have your thoughts in it okay so one first strawberry I think that they could have put in more like um maybe some citrus just for a little more punch and then just really a strawberry flavor there's no like to me it's like a very watered-down like gummy but it doesn't strike to me as like strawberry kind of tastes more like almost like a gummy vitamin where you know it's a berry but you don't know that specifically it tastes like strawberry what do you think it smells like fresh strawberries or when he tastes it tastes like frozen strawberry that's been in the freezer too long while you were saying about the strawberries yeah like that's pretty good very hybrid yeah and I thought got me like it definitely tastes like I've got me it's sweet um you definitely don't taste like I need super wheat or THC in it so that [ __ ] tastes more like that you did like the old-school gummies really hard like a pure weed to it and then I think a lot of people wanted to go like a lot like the skittle slavers and stuff enchilada like people really want like our candy taste and I think that's why you don't even really taste the weed in it so next one that we're gonna open is the pineapple let's go ahead and open it and see if it smells like pineapple yeah it does smell like pineapple okay I'm not really tasting a pineapple oh I do a little little bit after I chewed it for another second it does taste like pineapple yeah and for the pineapple it says ten milligrams THC but each piece has 20 milligrams in less than 2 milligrams of CBD in it pineapple 100 milligrams the same thing it's gluten free dairy free yeah not free so mmm that's the best part I think it's a both of these gummies are really good by heavy-hitters I do like heavy-hitters products am a fan especially if their cartridges her mom recently picked up a cartridge - and what did your mom say about it that's strong yeah like she took popped it once and her eyes were like red she really felt the high I think heavy hitters really brings it you know because of their brand and they're really well known and they have some really good products out there I think they're gummies are really on point um I do wish that they would have a little stronger of like a flavour - pineapple and strawberry personally but other than that they are good gummies you know they are gonna take about 90 minutes to kick in so we will give you guys a little update on the gummies later as we go but yeah so we just wanted to go ahead do another little gummy review let you guys know what we thought of them the flavoring and everything if you guys have any questions or comment or anything please go ahead and leave them in the comment section and if you want please go ahead

"[Music] no till uh orange spatula sick you're a long time wheats fan you know what that means it means I'm breaking my cardinal rule today fellows because I am reviewing yet another gummy I always say don't be a dummy don't buy a gummy but today for you guys it smells good though you can smoke through the packaging I have purchased yet another gummy because people told me the flourish flourish F flourish gummies are really great and that I will actually get quite stoned off of them so this is a hundred and fifty milligram edible it has been rated by the SE labs which means that you know it really does have 150 milligrams of THC in there like the packaging a lot very fancy packaging oh so if you haven't tuned in two weeks before you probably wondering why I happen to tell with me well that's because I like to have a little fat with gummy edibles as a good way of ensuring that the THC hits your bloodstream so ask us where if any gummy review I always take a little spoonful and Nutella or spatula for and until a beforehand so that way I can take the edible and your optimal conditions and with gummies you want to be doing this under optimal conditions alright so here we go mmm great every time so I got my fat in my bite let's open up the flourish again really fancy packaging look at that that's so cool well shiny we that we so we gotta open up here and it's in four or pyramid-shaped chunks this is the mango hybrid flavor hybrid being the strange some kind of hybrid we'd strain mango being the flavor oh it smells great smells like mango let's give it a taste almost choked on it well that tastes a lot better than a lot of the other gummi edibles this tastes a lot better than like it appears or infuse creations any of those it has very little weed taste I mean it does have Sun but but totally fun mmm very jelly like a jello like texture kind of hard to chew in fact all right guys well I'm gonna finish these last two cubes here and I will see you in two hours to let you know if this SC or excuse me flourish h1 50 mango hybrid gummy is actually working keep your fingers crossed for me guys because I would really love a potent gummy I will see you in two hours to let you know thanks for watching weeds guys I am back it's been two hours since I had the flourish mango 150 milligram edible and I think I finally found the gummy for me maybe it's too early to tell what just a sample size of one I don't know if anything's different about me but man this gummy it's not perfect I'm not the highest I've ever been at 150 milligrams but I am high I am definitely high which is a lot more than I can say for even 375 milligram gummy add or candy edibles that I've had in the past and certainly higher than that I like how it tasted too I tasted pretty good um I like the packaging and I kind of like the high it's it's it's it's more of like a body sort of high whatever hybrid strain and it's kind of great pretty happy with this I've got another one to review of their 300 milligram errs coming up and I hope it is twice as strong as this one if it is I will be in seventh heaven guys I might have finally found the gummy out there for me whoever recommended the flourish gummies thank you I'm glad I tried this and I am definitely looking forward to giving the 300 milligram a shot as well fingers crossed it's not just an anomaly or a fluke and that these are really the the the real deal in gummy land but I will be sure to review more and let you know for sure guys again I'm excited I'm excited thank you so much for watching this episode

products that would be awesome I like to hear what other people's experience was with all these different products that I'm doing videos for so this it let's get into this this is infused cannabis infused sour gummies I believe there was other flavors this is a blueberry and a watermelon let's take a look these were two dollars each plus tax from hemp op station in Vallejo California notice that little thing so this is the packaging and these are a single gummy ten milligrams turn this around this company is out of humble no I'm sorry this one is out of I guess it would be Solano campers oh goodness anyway Grover Beach which is Central Coast I have to look at the county anyway let's get into this here is the instructions and my camera does not want to focus there we go there's the ingredients that you can pause to check out the ingredients if you'd like the standard government warning and your batch number if you watch my previous video these came from the dry through hemp up station kind of fun so let's get into this nice legs gummy little misshapen maybe that maybe it melted in my in my car who knows fun little THC stamped on it I don't know if you'd call it fun but THC stamped on the front and let's try a little not a huge blueberry flavor it's good not too sweet a little little in the sour side and that is the blueberry again leave leave the leaf information in the comments of what your experience was with it how the how was the high or the medicated reaction this is the watermelon similar packaging to the other one but this has a nice perforated area to rip it so this is watermelon and you've got that THC stamp so that kids don't mistake it for candy and let's take the flavor of this and this was the same same packaging as before how's it used by date mmm really sour note the the name of it sour gummy all right it's good and has a little bit of a chemical flavor can't taste the green in it all again some people like that and for two dollars not a bad not a bad investment in your health all right thanks for watching", "K3-PPyBdGOE": "if you're curious about cannabis but worried about getting too high then the practice of micro dosing may be the best place to start what is micro dosing and how does it work find out on this episode of we neezy by the growth of dipping your toes into the cannabis waters can seem daunting especially if you've had a bad experience in the past with overindulgence having too much cannabis or greening out can be overwhelming cause anxiety and generally just scare people off trying cannabis again that's where micro dosing can help this practice has been used by medical cannabis patients for years and is a great way to consume cannabis for anyone partaking but what is micro dosing micro dosing is used to help you determine what strain works best for you and at what quantity or dose since there is currently no standardized dosing guide for medical users this method has been used to help them find the best treatment plan for their cannabis medication but it works just as well for those who are enjoying cannabis for recreational reasons the standard mantra for micro dosing is start low and go slow starting low when consuming cannabis it's recommended that you start at a low dose first depending on the format you are using to consume dosing may be different with dried flower you may want to start with just a few draws on a joint vape or bomb if you're using oil capsules you may want to start with a 2.5 milligram dose versus a 10 milligram dose this also helps when trying different strains or CBD to THC ratios as every strain is different and your body will react to it differently by starting with a low dose you can monitor how each strain makes you feel and the way your body reacts to it going low on the dose will ensure you don't over indulge and give you insight into the strains and methods that work best for you going slow the second half of the mantra is all about taking your time don't rush the process as it may cause you to overindulge and have a bad experience part of micro dosing is about understanding how much you need to achieve the high you want that means testing testing and testing it's also important to understand how different consumption methods metabolize in the body for instance smoking cannabis typically metabolizes quickly and you can start to feel results in as little as 10 to 15 minutes while edibles can take anywhere from 45 minutes to several hours before you feel air effects edibles are a great example of the importance of the go-slow methodology often when people are first trying edibles they rush the process they become disappointed when they don't feel anything right away and either have more of the edible or consume cannabis another way because they don't think the edible worked this often leads to a very bad experience due to overindulgence as they aren't waiting long enough to be edible to take effect micro dosing is a tried-and-true format for finding your personal mix of the right consumption method strain and dose to maximize your cannabis experience thanks for watching we DZ by the growth up

"greetings youtube facebook this is dv lee back with another florida medical marijuana review today i want to do a quick review about florida's first first i say first edible these are from cura leaf they're labeled as some lingual tablets but these are very much gummies as you can see each gummy has five milligrams thc there's 30 gummies per container so 150 milligrams total you can divide them in half if you need to or you can just take a bunch of them if you need to these are supposed to be for people that are starting out so they're not really that potent plus i think the limit in florida the rule is 10 milligrams per so maybe they'll come out with some more potent ones but in the meantime you can do what uh i did which was i went and got some rso from cure leaf pure leaf has rso now believe it or not and i had to pick some of this up so what you could do you could take your gummy like so and this rso is about eighty percent yeah that's about let's see this is 83.5 thc right here you know it's 78.2 percent thc 83.5 total cannabinoids uh you only need to take like a very little bit like a little drop just put it on that like that easy peasy now i would recommend if you are going to get the rso if you are going to get the rso i would recommend you also get some of these cure leaf cbd capsules because the rso is very very potent and sometimes it can be a little overwhelming so you might want to use that cbd to counteract those effects so rso a gummy and cbd is a great combination for sleep i would have to say guys um and definitely try the rso try the gummies definitely good products um the price could be a little bit better but you know they are just coming out with these products so you know i'm sure things will change until next time guys i'm out peace stay medicated", "b9tzsDsfuXI": "yo yo yo yo top of the morning [ __ ] boy before the valley that's exotic reviews y'all i know my eyes [ __ ] up man but hey the show must go on and now i'm

during a podcast really yeah and do you guys start tripping during the podcast yeah yeah we're having fun what is what does it sound like it was great podcast was great we didn't take too much yeah we took enough and what like you know no one can tell when you're on them like you can still function normally yeah I mean it depends on how far you go please you guys are so funny yeah you can go down the rabbit hole okay I'm you can go down the rabbit hole and be incoherent mm-hmm mushrooms it's dose-dependent I mean what you're doing is like you're getting you know you take a little bit you're like shaking hands with the Angels but you're not going to heaven you're not going to visit them you're like hi how are you oh my god you're so wonderful but you're not like riding on their wings going going to the other dimension but if you take enough that's where you go if you take enough you're not talking to anybody and have you done Alice T yes and good yes great experience yeah oh you had a bad experience on that no no I took it I took it later in life I don't think it's I think most of these psychedelics where you have bad experiences what you're having is your own psychological dilemma and then your battle with whatever the the drug or the psychedelic is trying to do to you versus what your ego is trying to control and keep it from happening I mean I've seen a lot of people have bad trips on some of the worst trips I've ever seen people have was from edible pot edible pot is one of the strongest things that people don't recognize mm-hmm it's it's a very different drug than smoking it and when you know you when you think of things that can take you down the rabbit hole you don't think of edible pot people think of pot is just like oh you're gonna get a high maybe you can get too high but you're just getting high but boom when you eat it it's a completely different animal yeah literally like physiologically it's a different really yeah it's create something called 11 hydroxy metabolite that's five times more psychoactive than THC and what it's like not even psychoactive in smoking it it's a different drug that's a little different totally different drug that makes complete sense yeah it's a different drug it's processed by your liver well there's something called the one pass that passes through your liver and the THC gets processed into eleven hydroxy metabolites Google it's trippy [ __ ] I've way stronger registered on some Micro dos versions of mushrooms that I have to add two of them and they were it was great it just made things a

little bit every day woah yeah I know a lot of people to do that yeah a lot like dozens dozens of people who microdose including fighters I know a lot of fighters from microdose yeah I forgot today

to you guys with some slightly better content hopefully starting this weekend I can get the tripod up I don't really have a lot of extra product to be recording about but I'll have a weekend to like figure that out anyways anyways let me give you this review here of khiva bliss watermelon lemonade you know there cannabis infused gummies edibles five milligrams per serving twenty gummies per package so it's a hundred milligrams for the total package hundred milligrams THC no CVD um I just mentioned that every time though just so you know because some people prefer to have some CBD in their in their edibles in their products this one's called bliss so another Kiva confections another Kiva product I don't know if you guys recall but originally these were in a plastic bag packaging it was kind of like a thick plastic with that kind of shiny aluminum type of like glossy coating on the inside they recently upgraded to these Camino I guess in Spanish it means like way or path or something like that you know this information let's just pause it here for you it says one gummy see that this is one interesting thing it says one gummy 3.6 grams of you know all these other stuff they've got the serving size is there the sir this wind I mean it says this the gummy is 3.6 grams total calories it says pursuing for one gummy it's 10 calories each so this whole thing would be like 200 calories if you just went out and ate the whole thing um I wouldn't recommend that unless you know what you're doing um got total carbs 2 grams total sugars 2 grams fat none sodium none here's some ingredients for you organic tapioca syrup it's got sugar gelatin malic acid natural flavors such AG acid cannabis extract fruit and vegetable juice 4 color natural terpenes coconut oil and car carnauba wax carnauba wax so I'm guessing that this carnauba wax is the potent active THC type of ingredient um I'm gonna have to look that up and confirm it for you guys because I don't know you can look at all the warnings here heed as you please or you know keep it safe um so let's let's open this again so I'm gonna read this whole thing but go ahead and look at it if you want to so for me this is somewhere between like a hybrid and and the indica it kicks in strong last night I had two pieces of it so that's a total of 10 milligrams it comes with this plastic thing to keep pieces from sticking to the top of the jar and so it tells you what to do we at least two hours before the full effect start with just one piece they're good guys they taste delicious which is one issue with edibles man I wish they wouldn't make them taste so bingo Mike why don't they make them taste like medicine like cough drops or something like you make them like delicious gummy is of course somebody's gonna want to eat a freaking hundred hundred milligrams worth of these things it doesn't matter if it's too much like they taste good um so let's look at a piece here you see they're kind of like one piece is like one diamond shape square shape like this um you see how they have this little like mark in half for most of them I don't know why I'm just guessing maybe that's for dosing maybe people don't want a full five milligrams maybe you want to and a half milligrams because I remember the ones in the in the bag packages were the same um so I noticed like when I open this and I've had this for maybe two days now um it was you see how there's like a little bit of a piece that's kind of like broken or something um man didn't count them but I've eaten a few already I just have one today I had two yesterday doesn't really matter which direction this thing goes um in the jar it is a push push pressure to open so once I close this I can't open it with one hand it's a good product I like it it tastes good it's potent so I'll say the first time I tried the bees and this isn't like a brand new ingredient or anything that they have or anything like that but the first time I tried these when they were in the package like in the little bag package they were um I mean I still like them um I think they're still just as potent I don't recall if it was called bliss before but I know they have like indica sativa hybrid CBD so it's interesting that this one like they're naming them something different now that's also interesting that that that wax that we see on the back here with that ingredient it's also interesting how it mentions like that amount of it's it's interesting um it's also interesting that there's no CVD and it um but yeah so let's let's talk some about about the impacts of the effects of this it's it's potent so it's strong I would say for myself the first times I tried this it was just like other keep of products of edibles every piece is the same potency for the most part if you try to microdose it or cut up the dosages from the five lower down to like two and a half or maybe like one or so milligrams it feels exactly like what you think it's gonna feel like even when you're just cutting up a piece you know it always feels pretty much the same um the difference is I've noticed which really isn't on on Kiva's end it's more in my own end the difference is I have noticed is that when I'm like the first times I had I had these it was just kind of like average work day come home afterward popping out a bold chill you know um added an interesting impact last night though cuz when I was clove in nineteen and coronavirus stuff I've been kind of like stressing out and not really noticing it cuz I'm still going into work I have to go into work and you know I work at a mental mental health spot so uh I'm I have to be there and so it's interesting that um it was yesterday that I had like the highest anxiety and it was like I had one of these you know I got off work had one of these by about an hour and a half I was in my car on the phone had already eaten two of these so I had ten milligrams in my system for maybe like an hour and a half prior and um it was strong it was delicious it was good um but when it started kicking in probably because my anxiety was so high and because I hadn't really slept good in like two three days and because I have probably quite a bit of caffeine inside of my system it was not pleasant and I don't think it was because of the edibles I think I was super paranoid I can explain last night to you a bit like I'm here in California in Southern California there's a terrible rainstorm last night thunder lightning rain like like wind and out here that doesn't even happen so not only was a sleep-deprived highly caffeinated from just all of that catching up and having a late work shift last night and just like drinking some you know I drink and I drink some of this yesterday I don't drink the whole thing on warrants but I drink like half of it maybe and then another much sparkling much of uplifting kind of drink it was and it I drink maybe like a third of that so I was already like well into like 50 or so milligrams of caffeine I'm lacking sleep and I'm very sensitive to caffeine anyways I probably usually have like 10 milligrams of caffeine but yeah I was like over 50 I was probably 60 70 milligrams caffeine that's a lot for me and then lack of sleep and the stress was always Kogan 19 and then I started finally just like talking to my friend about it and then I was like shoot like just kind of opened up a whole can of worms there can but opened up a whole can of worms there of a lot of stuff that I hadn't really been thinking about or talking about or opening up about it was just like dude just kind of pour it on out of me and it was pretty intense and then I right after that trying to go to sleep and feeling highly anxious and super paranoid and then the freaking storm and and the reason why I mentioned where I live is because we don't really have storms like that here um everyone knows that we have Sun and a lot of it and that's what we're used to and that's what I love and I I don't mind rain I know we need it and all that but I mean gosh that was a little intense and then you know trying to sleep and the loud thunder and the flashes of lightning and I'm like oh my gosh like Cove is 19 and like we're all gonna die and like I was I was struggling um but I don't blame Kiva I blame myself um but I just want to mention that you know for people who might be on the highly anxious end I'm I'm kind of like the on edge kind of end of like super stress high strong feeling maybe this I mean I think it'll relax you but it kind of depends cuz I noticed when I have edibles in a high dosage with a lot of stressors under my belt and then caffeine on top of that even if it's like from an earlier time of day like that that's when I've had the most negative impacts and I've probably had maybe one huge experience and maybe 2 to 3 other experiences that were kind of similar to this one I'm explaining like where it's kind of like you know like heart rate and like just kind of like I can't tell like am I supposed to scream or cry or you know just fall asleep couldn't fall asleep because of the weather and like geez but yeah um I'm just kind of venting but yeah this this is honestly all that aside all the paranoia warning aside and talking about my own personal life I would say this is a good product it's still a good product different packaging different same brand for those of you who might also be familiar Kiva makes a chocolate bar that is mom it is good I recently tried the true one I was like a true it has like cinnamon and sugar like oh man yeah it's it's good and these are good to you I like that they have different flavors they don't really taste like we they kind of taste like fruit punch um they're soft the as you can see that I don't keep them in the car I don't keep them anywhere hot where it's gonna melt so that's something I'd recommend keeping in mind they might um but yeah I kept it kind of I keep them kind of in a bag that I take with me like if you want to call it a purse or backpack or whatever like yeah good body hi good cognitive hi almost felt like it like a hybrid at the beginning it kind of kicked in strong it's kind of like you get a little bit of like mental energy there and you notice your muscles and body relaxing and then then like probably like an hour to two hours after it actually kicks in so maybe on the 4 or 5 hour mark for me anyways that's when I start getting the drowsiness in and starting to feel a little tired um and just kind of eventually just suddenly fall asleep without even like knowing um so I've probably mentioned this before I always recommend before having edibles you know first thing if you're in your house go ahead and set your alarm for the morning before I do that before I sit down like I put down my stuff and then immediately set my alarm from when I'm waking up in the morning cuz if I don't do that um you know I'm never gonna set my

just this one check out the other ones too they're they're good they're solid thanks for watching guys bye", "-oohjzQjDMs": "so to begin you're going to need your bare molds your dropper a knife a spoon a whisk if you're using gelatin you'll want to get out your gelatin if you're using jello get off your jello packet if you're using gelatin you probably want flavoring like mayo a half tea of mayo a third of a cup of water you'll want to have your cbd isolate also a sensitive scale and a ziploc bag to put on top now you'll want to spray your molds with non-stick pam or other oil this is a third of a cup of water and half a tablespoon of mayo now what you're going to want to do is slowly mix in the gelatin to prevent it from clumping so we're going to do one tablespoon of gelatin second tablespoon of gelatin third tablespoon of gelatin you want to make sure that all the gelatin gets wet you don't want any dry gelatin and then i'm going to add roughly another half tablespoon so the consistency that you're going for is you want it to be kind of like porridge or oatmeal you want it to be thick scrape that off and now we're going to microwave this so we've microwaved this for 30 seconds you can see how it's liquidy now uh i want to get all the gels melted spoons i'm going to sort of stir it around in here i'm going to use the whisk to help scrape it off so 30 seconds you shouldn't have any trouble with the gelatin the second 30 seconds you need to watch the gelatin to make sure that it doesn't boil over in the microwave so the gelatin will start to foam and boil as soon as you see the gelatin rising go ahead and hit stop in the microwave so we're microwaving for our second 30 seconds and we're going to watch it because near the end it should start to foam and boil all right you see that it's starting to boil starting to grow just make sure it doesn't go over the bowl so we're stirring you can see the mixture is very liquidy i'm going to put that aside we're going to measure out the cbd now we're using a ziploc bag to make it easy to transfer the cbd into not gonna scale all messy so where we want two grams which happens very quickly so we're just measuring out two grams here's why you need a sensitive scale too much this should be close to two grams so you can fold the bag get it all back on the scale okay there we go 1.99 there's a little bit here that's off the scale that'll include so we've got roughly 2 grams put that directly into the cbd get a little bit off the lid and we're going to stir it in so you don't want any clumps i want everything to be uniform so we're stirring really aggressively here we want everything to be mixed in now if your gelatin is cooled you can microwave this again or if it's still fairly liquid you can start putting them into the molds just like that i like to do five at a time for each dropper and uh if it gets too solid or it gets too thick to work with just microwave it again keep an eye on it make sure that it doesn't boil over and microwave as many times as you need to keep it nice and easy to work with we've got our bear molds filled we're going to put these in the refrigerator flat for 20 minutes they're still somewhat liquid so don't lift them up or else the gelatin will fall out of the mold so keep these flat in the refrigerator for 20 minutes so it's been 20 minutes the bears are solid and now we just pop them out i used like to use a paper towel and just start pushing on the molds to pop all the bears out and they should be nice and solid they should easily come out if they don't easily come out then you didn't use enough non-stick spray in the beginning and so we just pop all the bears out if there's any little dots like this on the mold you can just pull that off as well and there you go 129 bears which makes each bear roughly 15.5 milligrams of cbd now you want to take these and put these in the refrigerator don't leave them out they will eventually grow mold if you leave them out for too long my last test they grew mold in roughly two weeks but if you keep them in the refrigerator they should last for months", "cf9uSYlnJqE": "hey what's going on everyone jay

help you make sense of your dispensary we help you decide what products are worth your hard-earned dollars at your dispensary and which ones are utter junk and today we are talking about one of my favorite companies when we haven't had a chance to review a product from in a while because they haven't had anything new coming out but now thanks to the new regulations here in California that make edibles be a hundred milligrams max and ten milligrams per serving Korova one of my all-time favorites has come out with a brand new line here they have the Korova Saturday morning mini cookies ten milligrams per cookie at it for a hundred milligrams total so ten cookies in here at ten milligrams each it's a huge package it's so much bigger than their normal packaging which is crazy its its massive and it was only ten bucks but then again that's a bit that's more expensive than their one hundred and fifty milligrams cookies that they used to have that were just single cookies but it's big packaging because it is holding ten little mini cookies in here I really like the packaging it's very handsome I really quite like it a lot it's got the new props on there keep refrigerated bla bla bla bla bla but shows you know it's compliant with them new regulations and then here on the back it's got it finally has nutrition information corroded before I don't believe actually had nutrition information on their packaging but they do now and it's got like the ingredients and all that fun stuff on there and now they have this child resistant packaging that is very tough to open because I've tried opening one of these before and they're quite difficult to open especially if you've not encountered it before I'm super excited to try these it actually I've been wanting to review them for a while they've taken me some time to find they're not in available and a lot of dispensaries yet which is odd because you know supposedly next month is when these regulations take effect although I believe you have until July to like get rid of your old stock of stuff but yeah I assume you'll start seeing these everywhere soon but I've been wanting to review these for some time because I assume they'll be as ubiquitous as kirova in no time so here's that obnoxious child-resistant packaging you have to place one thumb in the middle of the zipper and place one thumb into the back panel zipper and pull gently apart it's easier said than done you know what I'm just gonna cut into it because I hate it I hate the child-resistant label packaging I'm a child I'm too down for it dumb child here we go here are the mini cookies ooh they're handsome quite like them aesthetically they look a lot like the full-size versions don't have very much of a weeds odor chewy and kind of crunchy but good nice pretty good very little canvas ace if any at all I'd like it just as much maybe even a little bit more than their 150 milligrams Saturday morning cookie it's great it's got the rice krispies in there good cookie good cookie taste it's a little bit chewier and crunch here than I was expecting it to be but it's not bad it's not bad not a bad combination at all i I'm not dreading having to eat nine more of these so guys I'm going to finish the rest of this bag off I've got a lot more to get through and then I will be sure to let you know how I am feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review process I'm probably about two and a half three hours or something on my way to go see a movie and as soon as I get out of there I will let you know how I'm feeling thanks so much for watching wheats guys and I will see you in just a bit peace [Music] alright guys I am back it has been two hours since I had the kirova mini cookies medical cannabis Saturday morning cookies 100 milligrams THC 10 cookies and I am more than pleased to report that kauravas unrivaled potency is in still intact this is a strong hundred milligrams in these 10 cookies here in fact my only complaint about it is and it is a complaint well I guess my two complaints there the packaging sucks I don't like this child restraint and packaging because I'm I'm stupid I'll fully grot to that and you know I'm not I'm an intelligent person but it's annoying it's hard to open even trying to follow the directions it's not like the childproof pill bottles that are very easy to take off that's a minor complaint the big complaint is it's a lot to consume for one person I know these are designed for 10 servings and they really are because it's a lot to consume it's I mean you can see how big this packages and it's packed to the brim with those cookies it's for our calories of cookies which isn't a whole lot but at the same time ten of those little mini cookies it's not a insignificant amount it certainly feels like more than one of the normal size but still I'm gonna recommend it especially for this new wave of products that are coming in that are going to be these ten milligrams servings of ten servings each this is probably going to be really great III heartily recommend it if you cannot find if the any of the other Korova still lying around if your dispensary is only prop to 1/5 compliant grab these you'll be happy you did if not go ahead and stick with the original batch because that's gonna do you better but but these are a fine replacement it's not the end of the world for edibles but you know it's not it's not going to be the same same world we remember anyways guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching thank you so much and we will check you out on a later review peace that's okay", "bwbZTN4fMGM": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'll be showing you how to infuse starbursts so delicious and surprisingly was one of the easiest edibles i've ever made and i feel like i'm going to make these many times in the future they turned out so well [Music] to make these starbursts here's what you're going to need some starburst candy i wish i could have had the all pink kind but we don't sell them in canada so i just got the original infuse coconut oil and optionally you can also use a concentrate or extract to make them extra strong and some lecithin to help with absorption first i have the top part of my double boiler and then i'm going to peel the wrapper off of some starbursts and place them in the bowl i use 30 pieces here but the amount you use doesn't matter too much the recipe is very forgiving then you're gonna heat up a pot to a light boil and place your double boiler container thing on top and then using the spatula you're going to use to mix everything together add a scoop of some lecithin and then mix that in they do take quite a while to melt so just keep an eye on them and for the first five minutes or so they probably won't melt that much so you can pretty much just leave them be but then after five minutes when they start to melt like this um just keep stirring them and watching them until they melt all the way down then once everything is pretty much melted like this we can add our coconut oil so i'm going to be adding one tablespoon of coconut oil but you can add for this amount of starburst up to three tablespoons of coconut oil and to make it stronger i'm also going to be adding some concentrate now we just have to mix everything together so i'm having some trouble getting the starburst and the oil to emulsify together you can see um the oil kind of just doesn't really blend into it at all so i'm going to grab a whisk and see if that'll help us emulsify a little bit better so using the whisk aggressively actually turned out very well everything mixed together and it worked better than i expected honestly now i'm just going to put my starburst mixture onto a baking pan that is covered in waxed paper and then i'm just going to place another sheet of wax paper on top and kind of roll it and shape it out to the thickness i want in the end i feel like i wish i would have made it a little bit thicker so it would have been the exact same thickness of actual starburst but next time i'll do that i guess and then i just use this sharp utensil to kind of just shape it so i could have nice corner edges and then i placed it in the fridge now while i'm waiting for it to cool in the fridge i'm going to heat up my double boiler again because um i don't want to waste any of the starburst and the coconut oil mixture that's left in the pot so i'm going to make a little drink out of it so i have a whole video on how to do this and to be honest that video is going to give you a much tastier result than this one because this is just like a little makeshift one i did and i'll post the link of how to make that drink below pretty much you're just going to add some water and heat it up so you can get all the mixture combined and then you're going to add a drink mix to it and then cool it and serve it over ice but check out the video i have on how to make an infused starburst drink because it's like literally one of the most delicious drinks i've ever had and you can put quite a bit of coconut oil in there and you can't taste it which is very surprising considering how much i put in it okay so now that our drink is made and our starburst has cooled down a bit i actually left mine in the fridge a little bit too long it was about a half an hour and i felt like it was a little bit too hard for me to cut easily so i just took it out of the fridge for five ten minutes until it was ready to be cut so i'm just going to start by cutting these little edges on the side which i'll probably just snap on while i'm cutting and then i'm going to cut all of these into squares after i cut them i realized that i feel like the size was not accurate to the size of a starburst so when i make these next time i'm going to actually place a starburst on there and measure it out now they're all done so i'm just going to throw them into their little container and that's it they are ready to eat [Music] these turned out so well i'm so so happy with them this is probably going to be my go-to instead of gummies now they just just everything is amazing thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thanks so much guys have a wonderful day [Music] you", "G70-Bp6kHGU": "is it just pure pain now that's what you hate to hear goodness gravy I've got a story for you guys today listen in the pursuit of life sometimes we run into bumps along the road the bumps vary in size and severity sometimes it's a little tiny pebble in the road and sometimes it's a giant [ __ ] boulder like for instance if you were hiking and you got hit by a giant [ __ ] boulder we're doing our best alright and sometimes things don't work out the way we would we would prefer today is one of those little interesting conundrums that we run into every now and then in our lives and it happened to me I ran into a bit of an issue so sit back relax and let's talk about how I once accidentally drugged myself with the largest edible I've ever eaten last February for all the coronavirus garbage happened I traveled to Los Angeles for spring break and one of the things that I had to do was I had to sign a [ __ ] ton of posters for u2's there was probably more than three thousand posters that I had to sign and the posters were being kept at the house at The Misfits YouTube group were staying at in LA Carson was there Schlacht was there Cooper's there we were all just trying to like sign all of these posters as fast as we could because there's so many of them and it was take us it was taking us literally hours to do at this point there was maybe about five or six people in the house at this time and that's because at that point the whole main misfits crew had gone out to dinner somewhere I don't know if you know this about the misfits in general but they smoked a lot of weed every trip they do they probably spent a couple thousand dollars on weed okay they smoked the mary-jane they do the weed in order to make the process of signing these posters go a little bit smoother I had smoked like half a joint of weed so I was already decently high because I hadn't smoked in a while either sign in a way crossing my eyes Dodd might ease however my personal reaction to weed is that I get the munchies I get the munchies pretty hard I smoked a little bit of the mare Lona and then I say oh I'm gonna eat an entire sleeve of club crackers with no cheese because gluttony I originally planned to go to dinner with my girlfriend and her father so I was trying to wean off of the hi and just kind of sign the posters and wait until it kind of wore off and then I would go and do that one of the things that they had at this house was they had a giant counter in which a bunch of snacks were all laid out there was chips there was more chips there was I think pizza I don't [ __ ] remember as I look across this horizon of bountiful snacks I see a nerds rope and my monkey brain is like oh and I'm thinking to myself man I remember nerds rope I haven't had nerds rope and [ __ ] forever dude I'm thinking back to my childhood where we would go to a campground in Maine and I would wattle on down to the snack shack and grab myself a nerds rub and before eating it considering its potential applications as nunchucks or trying to tie a knot with it but then realizing I'm a kid I don't know how to tie knots and my prefrontal lobe won't even be done cooking for another 20 years so what's even the point give me a slush puppy give me a Game Boy SP let's [ __ ] it up but lord have mercy did I learn in this moment I no longer was a child but a man a man who experiences consequence in the worst way possible so I'm signing more posters you know I'm cruisin I'm having a great time all right nerds rope tastes a bit strange but that could also be my perception that I have of being already high and it's kind of you've ever been high before it kind of messes with your perception of taste a little bit it was like drinking a diet coke versus a normal coke where there's like you know there's something there there's something there but I don't fully process why it tastes different so I finished the Nerds rope and then I go to have another nerds rope because I'm high and have the munchies as I'm biting into the next nerds rope one of the misfits guys says Ted don't eat those those are edibles hmm sorry I said I'm back I must uh I must have heard you wrong um scusi yeah Ted that's inedible so I say no [ __ ] way how much was it he says I think I think it might be like 60 milligrams what 60 milligrams to give you context the largest edible I'd had up until this point in my life was 20 milligrams so of course I asked are you sure one of the guys walks over to the counter and picks up the package of the Nerds rope and with the most you are [ __ ] face I've ever seen in a person he says it's actually 400 milligrams now remember I've already freaked out when I heard that it was a 50 milligram edible and I've just been told that it is actually eight times that amount so you may be asking yourself Ted how the [ __ ] did you not know that that was inedible and that's a good question let's start with the packaging that's the packaging it uses the same packaging as the actual branded Nerds rope it's got a thing that says Terran share as if it's just a normal candy in hindsight that's very much so implying for a good reason that you really should be sharing it and not eating it entirely on your own if you're not really paying attention and it's been like eight years since you had a nerds rope this is pretty easy to mistake for a nerds rope in addition to that there was a very specific and deceptive way that everything was laid out as snacks in the misfits house and I'll just let swagger CIL's explain that for me there was a very reasonable way like we set it up because the Nerds rope was inedible it's a 400 milligram edible and he didn't read the packaging but we have on that bench it's a big-ass bench it's snacks and food chips Pringles gummy bears all that [ __ ] munchies and then there's weed food which is edibles in between that and the weed which makes sense like a spectrum dangerous that's the thing is that it would make more sense to kind of put the weed food away so that you don't confuse confuse you've ever been in a car crash even if it's not your fault there's a certain feeling after it immediately happens it's this mind racing feeling when you have absolutely no idea what to do but you also know that something has to be done or you're [ __ ] aka panic so at this point I begin to freak for three reasons first of all I didn't know if I was personally prepared mentally to get as high as I was about to get second of all I had made plans for dinner with my girlfriend and her father that night and I definitely won't be making it and I'm pretty sure she's gonna be a little bit pissed and the third reason I hadn't smoked weed in two months which meant that my tolerance was rock-bottom I like to explain this with what I like to call the skyscraper analogy right here we have the tolerant skyscraper which represents my tolerance to marijuana let's just say that whenever I smoke weed I started the ground floor in the lobby if my taunts were higher then maybe I'd go a couple stories up to the mid-level apartments that's where all the stoner kids from high school hang out and they're all pretty high up there but it's nothing really to be worried about you're probably couch locked but you'll be fine with my tolerance at zero though I knew in my heart and my soul that I was going all the way up to cheech and Chong's [ __ ] penthouse as an unwilling and unexpected guest for an undetermined amount of time as things stand right now I don't even live in the building I'm from out of town and I sometimes commute into the city oh it's a Friday night oh we should go we should go get drinks in the city that's the that's what I'm operating on I know that I'm on a timer most edibles take about 45 minutes to an hour before they kick in but I know that I've taken this edible about 10 to 15 minutes prior which means math I've got about 45 minutes before this edible hits me and I died although other things can affect this such as being on an empty stomach which I was my first thought was that I need to make myself throw up because if I can get rid of as much of this edible as possible I could potentially mitigate the level of inebriation that I was about to experience so I stumble over to the bathroom and I start to gag and I'm trying to make myself throw up but I've never made myself throw up before I don't know how to do it so the next step is that I got Carson on his phone looking up how to's on wikiHow on how to make myself throw up and then Cooper's in the kitchen and he's making cups of saltwater for me to chug because apparently if you chug saltwater it helps with the throwing up process I'm not sure how true that was it just ended up with me just throwing up a bunch of pinkish salt water so I can't speak for its effectiveness but there you go and I'm pretty sure since the Nerds rope was sort of a candy sugar based food it was really easy for my stomach to digest it really fast so I'm pretty sure if I hadn't thrown it up within maybe five minutes there really wasn't that much that I could do from there so by the time I was done throwing up some food that we had ordered earlier arrived and Cooper basically advised me that the best thing that I could really do for myself would be to just fill my now completely empty stomach from this point on all I could really do was buckle up strap in and get ready for the [ __ ] high of a lifetime god bless my soul [Music] so I'm gonna give you guys a walkthrough of what this high was like it wasn't fun I also have some video footage that Cooper took so link to his channel in the in the description once I kind of came to terms with the fact that I was gonna have to ride out this high no matter what I decided to give myself a home base just somewhere where I could ground myself and not really need to worry about moving around or anything I found myself a nice armchair and I sat myself down there and prepared for the ride of a lifetime the first thing that happening was a classic weed symptom which is cottonmouth which is when your mouth gets really really dry so I was pretty much just constantly drinking water I remember starting to get colder and The Misfits they had a room where they just had a bunch of extra merch laid out where they could just give that to friends and stuff while they were in LA and I kind of just walked in there and just threw on one of the sweatshirts and then just went back to my home base and sat down and I was wondering for myself if that cold symptom that I was experiencing was real I did research on the symptoms that I was experiencing and this was something that actually happens informally it's referred to as weed chills the THC literally lowered my internal body temperature so I actually was getting cold another thing that happened and I think this also might have been a symptom of being cold but I started getting shaky and it's really funny the way that I described that when I was high and I actually have video footage of that right here welcome back it's gotten worse friends we are it's been about 45 minutes since last and bad okay I think you need another stick of butter I feel like my entire body feels like rubber bands pretty much after that point was when things started to get um they started to get bad the shaking was also the reason why in the video you can see me clasping my hands together because I was literally like shaking so much that I had to hold my hands together really tightly and keep my body really tight and close so I could be in like a comfortable state and then I get into what is called the painful zone or the first level of weed hell pretty much any position that I was sitting in felt painful don't do too much weed I was in the pain hotel and I was its only guest any surface that I touched whether it be the arms of my chair putting my hands on my knees anything like that just felt bad and what I think I would attribute that to is just being so high my sense of touch was just so elevated that my brain was just overloaded or something most of the time I was just trying to like breathe deeply and kind of maintain my composure but whenever Cooper would turn the camera on me and he would start recording I would sort of like try to elevate my attitude and try to seem as cheery as possible because I didn't really want to seem like an idiot hi stoner on camera you know at a certain point I had to move my home base because it was too disorienting to be sitting straight up I had to go and get [ __ ] horizontal baby I pretty much had to make a mental agreement with myself just to survive is it just pure pain now that's what you hate to hear it was during this time of unbearable dizziness that my good friend Schleck decided to use a [ __ ] handheld massager on me I'm just getting the lactic acid fun I just want to get the juices I just want to get the juices flowing if you please organism do you see my attitude there I wonder why I wouldn't like that a rapidly moving massager if you want a lesson on what not to do to someone when they're high that really takes the cake eventually the fateful moment happens I had a weed barf I honestly think it was really just because of how dizzy I was getting from being high and luckily for me I had a whole sandwich about an hour ago I literally had to run across the entire room and just run into the bathroom and throw up after I threw up though that's pretty much where the high took the downturn now it was cleansing I had it was a cleansing barf yeah it was uh it was detoxifying I went to go eat some skittles but without even knowing I was on camera I went around to people and not trusting my own ability to determine this I asked them if the skittles were edibles or not I ate the Edible at about 6:30 p.m. that day and I stayed awake all the way until about 4:00 a.m. that night I woke up at about 9:00 a.m. and I was still very high but I was definitely a manageable amount of hi what struck me though was I was high for the entire next day I went to bed that night hi so in total after eating a 400 milligram edible I was high for about you know 26 hours if there's one thing you guys shouldn't take away from this is like any anti weed sentiment from this video I think weed is a perfectly healthy drug to use recreationally but we'd like everything else follows the rule that too much of anything is definitely a bad thing obviously only consume weed in a state in which it's legal and if you're of age I hope you guys enjoyed this video let me know if you want more stories from my life I don't really know how many stories I have to tell this is like the second one I've ever told on this channel but I hope you learned a thing or two and if there's one thing you should take away from this it's this weed is for sinners and I'm going to help [Music] ped accidentally took 400 milligrams of edible", "Ni8pQ4XnUfs": "[Music] so [Music] you", "iL9e5jV40OI": "[Music] another mastermind head [Music] hello folks Anthony again from Ohio cannabis live what's up everybody welcome to another video and today we're going to be talking about one of gummies check it out you want a gummy yeah I want a gummy so one of gummies are gummies that are produced by luck I believe I know they've got a bad rap but the gummies are different story folks and so is the key that's another video you got keeping out where because the keep video is common and you don't believe the experiment god it's lined up for that I've teased that later so let's talk about one of gummies but I decided to go with is the one of gummies blueberry and because it was $45 I think that's still kind of pricey we're talking 10 milligrams each gummy 100 milligrams total again comparing the Michigan that still kind of falls short of what we all think we should be able to get for this price I like the container let's look at what the gummy looks like and then I'm going to eat one and tell you a little bit more about it so I the container is a little weird to open but you have to push in on on each side here to get over so here's the gummies and I'm gonna take another one out for better view and it is blue folks you see a little bit sugar on it and you know I'm I like them i'ma say it tastes better than a bro how gummies compared to gibsonburg dummies I'm going to give it similarity but I'm going to say I do like to taste folks I can think it's one of companies are tasty in my opinion and the views expressed in any of my videos are selling my opinions based on my own personal experience and knowledge I work for none of these companies I do not represent anyone other than you guys so I just wanna make sure we clarify that any music you hearing in these videos if the music that I made myself I'm on a tight budget many of you know that is why I'm still wearing the same white t-shirt eventually we'll have Ohio cannabis live t-shirts and hats someday and maybe even business cards but we're not really in business right so we're just trying to get the word out about these products and we want to make sure that you are up-to-date on stuff when it comes out one of gummies are new let me give you our another close-up of it and on the back is the label here tells you about the dosage where are these at right now I know you know how cannabis company has them I know that Terra Center Columbus has them and there may be a few other dispensaries that actually have these comes as well so check your online menus check weed Maps check everywhere and there's three different kinds there is the indica the sativa and the hybrid and each different version has a different flavor god none of the other flavors that they had was watermelon I posted some more information some literature about the one of gummies on my Facebook page so you can check out a couple more screenshots some of the other material that came with the gummies but I'm gonna tell you I tried one last night and it definitely came in I was saying for a person like me and the way I've been in a lot of pain I'm probably a too gummy person at a time you might be at income ten milligram person I'm probably more of a 20 milligram bilities person and in extreme cases probably thirty milligrams really good for me I don't recommend you eat five at one time at me fifty milligrams of THC and in my experience when I see people take 50 milligrams you see that's pretty pretty much put you to sleep but you can get you in a really lazy tight mode depending on what kind of edible it is and 100 milligrams you eat the whole thing up oh my you're gonna feeling really really sleepy and probably really relaxed so yeah if you just want to if you could afford to eat them a whole pack in one day I mean go for it but if you want to make them last I think that one two gummies each session is probably appropriate based on my own personal opinion folks but I think the wanna gummies are a good product and congratulations Buckeye relief for making a nice product and you know making something to taste better I'm not gonna tell you tastes amazing and I'm not gonna say it tastes as good as regular gum use they don't have THC in it you're gonna taste THC close they're gonna taste medicine in there but it's not overwhelming you do give some flavors like I said this one is blueberry so I think the flavor was good and like I said I definitely compare it to the gibsonburg gummies and forest the texture in comparison very similar type of gummy so you know it's one better than the other right now I'm not ready to make their conclusion I would say they're probably very much similar products from two different processes so now we have a little bit more variety of products now yeah gibsonburg gummies and now we have one of gummies and we have Robo Ohio guns so if you want to see here we go this is the container or grow hi Oh gummies here's the one of gummies and here's a container for the gibsonburg guns so again folks when I tell you things I don't just speak from just other people's opinions I speak from my own personal testing of these products and that's why I wanna make sure you guys get to the information and I would say all three these guys are doing good here congratulations to staring the Wellness buckeye relieved in goo Ohio for making halfway decent products the first batch of these I did not like and second batches a lot better so I think didn't they grow Ohio is definitely improving on their alternative products and like I said I think I'll be within like gibsonburg gonna sigh I know I think so with that we're gonna head to wrap this view with the final conclusion that Ohio got some gummies yeah the price could be a little bit better so if my growers are out there listening see what you can do in the price man we can get these cubbies down like maybe $29.99 I think we would see him go out a lot faster this is my own person yes thanks for all the support and we are going to have more videos to come we appreciate your support make

taste the THC at all taste legit like those little froggy blue raspberries that just what happening yeah so the recommended dose is 10 milligrams to start start slow start low go slow not hot so there you go that was 30 that's my start that's not your start you figure out your start district edibles alright I'm back and I've been able to empty these district edibles and by empty I mean that I ate them okay so I ate the 30 milligrams to start and I started feeling a little bit like I said I wasn't high and so I ate 20 more and then I started feeling like wow this is nice and it wasn't a high head buzz what it was was a nice body buzz i felt really relaxed i was dancing around and just feeling good and my mind was completely like focused and clear I really like these for good throughout the day 50 milligrams did it for me again start low go slow for you figure out what your dose for me it was fifty milligrams for good steady seven eight hours throughout the day thanks district edibles and live well okay bye-bye", "ugdNM_4yUds": "hey guys today I'm going to show you how to make a preservative for your homemade goods and for myself I particularly use it for my gummies as you will see in most of my recipes that I have posted here they all call for potassium sorbate that way I can keep my gummies outside of the fridge I'm in a drawer in my pocket in my car and my desk whatever I want and they're gonna last just like if you were to buy a bag of gummies or candy from a convenience store or a grocery store I know a lot of people make their own gummies and then they mold or they just don't last and the simple solution for that is this bag of potassium sorbate which I bought for like $15 and this will probably last me forever like I'll probably never even get through this so the way to make it is with potassium sorbate and water and that's it so I already have some made here but I'm going to demonstrate to you guys how to make it yourself you can make whatever amount you want if you want to do a smaller amount you can do that a larger amount that's fine the only thing that matters is that it's one part fast-absorbing to three parts water so I'm going to do three quarter cups of water and 1/4 cup of potassium sorbate if you wanted a smaller amount you would also do 1 tbsp potassium sorbate 3 tablespoons water so it doesn't really matter as long as it's 1/4 potassium sorbate 3 parts water I'm just going to fill this up to 3/4 of a cup this is just room temperature water do not pour it into a mason jar and then I'm going to put 1/4 cup of the potassium sorbate granules in today [Applause] let's pour that right now give it a little shake so I just shook this up and it's been like 30 seconds and you can already see it's completely dissolved once it sits for a little bit longer it'll become more clear like the mixture I already have made I'm just going to pour this into my mixture I got made previously yeah and that's literally it it's so easy the hardest part is probably gonna be actually frying the potassium sorbate when you use this you'll just need about an eighth of a teaspoon or two a quarter of a teaspoon depending on how big your recipe is for companies I usually use between 1/8 and 1/4 of a teaspoon and I don't believe he throws in the fridge I do just because it's convenient for me and my apartments small so there's not really that many places to keep it I have heard some people struggling to find the tascam sorbet I was gonna post a link and I will when the time comes that it's priced better but I paid like $15 for this over a year ago and now on Amazon it's like $60 which is completely insane but I will post the link when I find it for a decent price but this is a standard ring convened it's used for people who make beer so I really know where you go to get their supplies but if you went to a place where they have very few supplies you probably find this there and I doubt it would be overpriced but yeah that's it please let me know if you guys have any questions I hope you enjoyed the video if you did please give it a like leave your comment and subscribe as always I love from you guys I hope you guys have a wonderful day and make some delicious shelf-stable snacks", "YT5GRLadfKU": "hey what's up everybody i was recently making a list of over-the-counter products that can help you decrease anxiety and stress and i ran into hemp gummies while i was browsing on amazon i was really impressed with the reviews that i saw it was not easy selecting a bottle as there are plenty of bottles with good reviews and some very confusing numbers on the label you'll see big numbers such as 400 000 all the way up to 1 million that i've seen recently and i had no idea what that meant a lot of these are also marketed the same way they have big numbers in the front unclear nutritional information on the back lots of health claims and happy people and photos with lots of lighting the bottle that i purchased was based on the reviews not based on just the highest number on the bottle if the bottle does not list the milligrams per gummy divide the total number in the front on this bottle it's 240 000 by the number of gummies 60. so that's 4 000 milligrams of what hemp oil also known as hemp extract on the bottle so here was my experience i initially took two gummies per day the first couple of weeks then after that i took about four per day i was curious because the claims were stress relief reduced inflammation improve sleep reduce anxiety reduce depression so they have a strong gummy bear smell with something else that i can't really identify the texture is softer than your typical gummy bear so initially they taste just like your regular gummy bear then there's another flavor behind it and i can't really identify it i had a headache the first day that i took one so i figured hey this is a perfect opportunity the headache really didn't go away i wasn't subjected to like a lot of stress so i can't speak to that on the first day nothing noticeable around the first try it did not change any anxiety ticks that i have it did not make me sleepy i was reading the news like always before i went to sleep so really there was nothing noticeable the first days other than eating a delicious gummy a month later i was reflecting upon any benefits because initially i didn't feel any and it seems to help with arthritis i have wrist arthritis right where my thumb meets the wrist and i suffered less during the month that i was taking them but the effects were not immediate it just took some time with regards to anxiety and depression i found the results negligible like a drop in the bucket kind of experience so i was curious about why these hemp gummies are so popular let's talk about cannabis a little bit so there are over 150 identified cannabinoids in cannabis with thc and cbd being the most popular so thc will give you that high and the cbd gives you the calming effects so let me clarify amazon does not sell cbd products so no these gummies don't contain cbd and they obviously don't contain thc but some people thought they did in the reviews the association with cannabis plant may be what brings customers to this product so let's talk hemp so hemp is a specific strain of the cannabis plant hemp is high in cbd but it is very low in thc i believe american grown ham has less than point zero two percent thc but the cbd is mainly found in the leaves and the flowering of the hemp plant but there is no cbd in the hemp seed which is what these gummies are made from so if the gummies don't contain cbd or thc then what are you getting so let's look at hemp seed oil about 75 percent of hemp seed oil is composed of omega fatty acids the rest is a monounsaturated and saturated fats about 50 percent of the hemp seed oil is omega-6 fatty acids more specifically linolenic acid about 17 is omega-3 fatty acids more specifically alpha linolenic acid i also noticed that this composition is very similar to flax seed oil so any benefits that people are talking about in the reviews is from omega fatty acids so i was curious and i did a search for omega 3 6 and 9 products and sure enough the reviews were aligned with the hemp gummy reviews yeah improved memory healthier skin lower cholesterol improved immune system reduce arthritis pain less anxiety essentially the hemp gummies are a cannabis-derived source of omega-3 and six fatty acids would i buy these again no for each of the benefits that are cited in the reviews there are actually other supplements that do a better job of addressing these issues that's for another video did i waste my time on this no from this experience i read up more on omega fatty acids and i found that omega-3 works great at reducing arthritis pain but the best source of omega-3 is fish oil so thanks to this hemp gummy i'm currently taking omega-3 fish oil that's a wrap if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below i always add more information in the description of the video thanks for watching", "1Vo1fbDetPw": "hi and welcome back to my channel um i want to do a real quick video i'm not feeling real well but i wanted to get this out these are true leaves new edibles the chocolate chip cookies by love's oven and the true gels blend blue raspberry i ate all the cookies guys i'm sorry about that um over the holiday weekend they were very very good stupid airplane they reminded me of chips ahoy minis some people said they were like famous amos minis um i haven't had famous amos minis but i know they taste just like chips ahoy let's take a look at the label real quick here's the ingredients for you and there's the label with all the thc info you get 10 10 milligram cookies for 25 dollars now let's move on to the truly true gels in blue raspberry i didn't eat all of these so i have some to show you okay we'll get one out and show you they're pretty big they're definitely gummies there's a close-up for you pretty big maybe the size of the nickel the true gels blue raspberry gummies have 10 milligrams in each gummy there's 10 10 milligram gummies per container and they're 25 i really like both of these i took um you have to keep in mind i take rso so i need a bigger dose the first time i had four cookies and i had to let it i had to add a little bit of rso because it didn't work so well next time i had six cookies and that worked better for me i had five of these and that worked pretty well i'm gonna go ahead and do five at the time and and they'll probably be a good dose for me please keep in mind that i use rso every single day so i'm gonna need more of these if you have a lower tolerance one or two might be just enough for you these are also kind of hard you might want to have some milk with them and dip them in the milk i like both a lot um the effects lasted for both of them they lasted about four to five hours for me like i said i have to take more of these because i use rso every single day so that's it if you have any questions let me know in the comments keep it real and be safe", "ifjcIiolSS8": "[Music] what's up everybody welcome to the channel today we're going to be making cannabis gummy bears so let's get into it [Music] so the first thing you want to do is measure out your cannabis i'm going to be using seven grams of cannabis to make my gummy bears [Music] all right guys i got my seven grams of cannabis so now i'm going to put this in a mason jar and the carpet all right guys so now i'm going to decarb our cannabis for about 40 minutes and the oven temperature that i'm going to be using is 240. [Music] so all right guys so while your cannabis is the carving measure out your coconut oil so for this recipe we're going to be using a quarter cup of coconut oil i'm going to be using coconut mct oil to make my gummy bears so even though we're going to be using a quarter cup of coconut oil i'm going to measure out a half a cup of coconut oil because we're going to lose some of that coconut oil during the infusing process so just keep that in mind all right guys my cannabis is now the carb so now i'm going to add our coconut oil to the mason jar now i'm going to add a teaspoon of lecithin to my mason jar all right guys so now we're going to do is put this in a pot and let it simmer for about two hours add your pot to the stove [Music] add your mason jar now let it simmer for about two hours all right guys so i've been over two hours so now we're going to filter out our cannabis [Music] all right guys my cannabis coconut oil is now done so now let's start working on the cannabis gummies so before we start working on our gummies i'm going to spray my gummy molds with this non-stick cookie spray all right guys so now what i'm going to do is put my pipe on the stove and now we're going to turn the temperature on low [Music] so now i'm going to add in my water i'm going to be using 2 3 cups of water [Music] guys what i actually recommend you to do is turn your stove on like medium heat just so it can speed up the heating process and then once my water get kind of hot i'm going to reduce the temperature back down to two and then add in my cannabis oil and then all of the other ingredients so um so that's what i'm gonna do all right guys so i let my temperature stay on medium heat for about two minutes and now i can see the water is starting to boil a little bit so now what i'm gonna do is reduce the temperature back down to low [Music] all right so now we're going to do is add the candle oil [Music] now i'm just going to mix it together now another thing too guys usually water and oil wouldn't mix but that's why i added the lecithin to my can of oil so if you already have kind of oil made and it's not made with lecithin at this point i would add a teaspoon of lecithin so just keep that about all right guys so we're going to keep the temperature on low and i'm just going to let the water and the wall incorporate together all right guys my mist is fully incorporated so now we're going to add the unflavored [Music] gelatin [Music] and just mix it together so i'm just going to mix for about 2-3 minutes i want to make sure everything is incorporated all right guys so now we're going to do is add in our pack of [Music] jello [Music] all right guys so now we're going to do is add our mix to the mold all right guys so once you finish filling your modes put your bows in the freezer for a few hours [Music] all right guys so been about four hours so now we're going to remove the gummy bears from the mood so now what i'm trying to do is just remove some of the extra gummies from the gummy bears if that make any sense so so this right here i'm going to strip that from the gummy bears just to make it look a little bit better [Music] there we go [Music] all right guys my cannabis gummy bears is now done to my left is the medium-sized gummy bears and to my right is the small size gummy bears i personally like the medium size better but what i'm going to do is leave the link for both sides in the description below but um thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace [Music] you",

just trying to keep it safe like we were saying we got some jolly rancher gummies right here look at this package guys some really nice packaging sours by the way yeah as these little characters maybe these little characters i with the characters i hope it's like different flavors yes this kind of reminds me of the last review we did with what was it the sour patch kids yeah it's kind of like that packaging it's kind of like the same kind of vibe and stuff and the dopest thing is uh they're heat sealed so oh yes open it you know it's kind of there's no pre-opening you know it's you don't know what's inside legit you know what i'm saying pretty legit what i'm gonna try to do is open up this little seal right here you can see the little strip on top yeah straight into it a little bit did they were good decent yep thank you hello yeah oh wow i think i got watermelon ones did you get watermelon ones too let me see yeah a bunch of watermelons thank you these are the watermelon ones i don't know yeah look yeah bunch of watermelons inside yeah jolly rancher let me get all these out that's pretty cool we weren't we didn't know what to expect so all watermelons that's pretty cool

there different flavors out there let us know let us know if you guys have tried it that's packed with flavor yes very sugary not too strong on the um like a weed distillate taste you know it's not too strong it tastes pretty sweet yes i won't say that's bad i would just say it's actually kind of good because you know a nasty distillate aftertaste is not what you want whenever you're eating your edibles that's why i don't like these taste really good eating my second one and get that structure on that that's what i'm saying let me do a break up they're kind of hard to break up yeah it's some dense snugs right there you know what i'm saying scrape gas these are pretty fire though i like the taste probably some of the best tasting edibles i've had so far we really like the sour patch

like edibles and  feeling a little something something but you know we didn't like the fact that uh it was only one one type of gummy you know what i mean yeah you all seen it was just a bunch of watermelon we were hoping it was going to be like multiple you know like some sour apple and all the different gummies you know water reviews all bunch of different varieties of this was just kind of one thing so yeah that was uh that was the only disappointing thing but we we didn't know what to expect you know what i'm saying i think it's hitting you know i'm saying i feel something so and people would say oh they're boofy and you know i'm just feeling pretty chilled out like my heads for sure like versus right now versus how it was before this video i feel way more chill you know yes

of my late night but I got souffle fleet they put it on spin move that we go be like s adaboost so without further ado it's a close-up hi Bert Club and get some little bird emojis flap in the comment section taking a look at base edibles they look at these dank gummies and these have 802 THC content of 500 milligrams for this entire package now each dose is about 3 pieces and that gives you about 50 milligrams of THC now eaten well ingesting cannabis is blade different than smoking it when your liver has to process it it gives you a way different hide then when you inhale it's a total body high where I'm smoking it gives you basically just a head um docena says that the appropriate dosage for these is different for each person and been conditioned so freebo taking these willy-nilly make sure that your you know how much they take for whatever problem you're taking them for if you're just using them recreationally still use caution when using or consuming these won't get take a look at some of these out the pack so let's get somebody's out this pack I got over here these are the gummies look like you can see inside here they have a blue one right here I see a blue one in this pack so there's no not really telling what colors you're gonna get um they're coated with like a looks to be like a sugary thing they're pretty soft like they're room temperature so there Gummy's guess if you froze on these stiffen up a lot I'm going to guess we'll eat the green one why not eat the green one and see what that tastes like so just pop this thing I see how we do I burped about to take one of these dank gummies now I have already took one earlier and I can feel fill it slightly I've been smoking all day but it's a very different kind of feeling and it's more of a relaxing feeling I will probably go to sleep right now sleep all night wanna try this bring window you know hopefully it'll uh increased my abilities sleeping Mike I don't typically sleep too well but I'm hopefully tonight these will help me crash there's a very slight cannabis scent from it it smells more like candy than cannabis not sure this is I want to say this might be Apple but also it also might be a line I want to say a Pluto John taste this sugar sugar doesn't seem to have that much of a cannabis taste on it and must be more inside the gummy so I'm gonna pop this in give it a couple chose and see if it tastes like alright that was a very nice apple taste didn't have a nice cannabis undertone to it too very chewy gummy unless you could kind of help with the texture of it yeah we'll check back this is a cold minute no all right berth up almost forgot check it for me for me it'd be very relaxed deep fry sleep forever right now gummies I mean it tastes real good got a nice cannabis tasting [Music]", "bssGLDvoBT8": "[Music] in two weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary I've got my trusty spatula and my trusty thing in Nutella why do I have these you might be asking if you have not tuned into one of these before it means I am reviewing gummies and the reason I have this Nutella is so that I can have a little bit of fact before I eat these gummies I find that having a little bit of fat in your system before consuming gummies enhances the high of that gumming so let's just take a little lick of Nutella here the best part about any edible review because who doesn't love just some freaking Nutella all right that should be that should do it for my fats now what kind of gummy are we reviewing we are reviewing lol edibles candy I have actually had a couple people asked me to review this I reviewed one lol edible product in the past that I did not like very much the Elwha edibles flamin hot cheetos this here is a candy it is blueberries our belts Meghnath be gorilla glue glue hybrid so you can see on the back they've got a plea to add them on social media they've got a missing lot ID batch number and best before date not on there so we don't know if we're gonna be doing okay says do not mix with alcohol first time I've ever seen that I don't exactly know why you shouldn't mix the two other than you don't like getting crunked but uh who cares I am really hoping this lol edibles redeems not only lol edibles which he's a really dumb name I mean it's just a colossal II stupid name I'm hoping it not only redeems them but also gummies in general if you've never really seen weeks before I have never been a huge fan of gummies or candies I finally get you less high than the confectionery edibles but maybe this will be the one that turns it around we shall see alright so let's open this up here these blueberries sour ropes alright that is a strong weed odor very strong you will smell that from a distance away as I think so be careful opening this somewhere in a closed area where you don't want people smoking weed because that has a very strong weed odor as do these ropes themselves these look a lot like the Buddhist hours which I've had in the past and reviewed hmm there's a considerable weed taste to them not overwhelming the sourness definitely helps not as sour as the Buddhist hours but still pretty sour with a stronger weed flavor so hopefully that means they're more potent than the the Voodoo sours Oh sure if I mention this this is a 300 milligram animal should should be pretty potent but then again gummies your mileage right back again fairly strong we taste but the sourness really helps them overcoming with it all right guys so I'm gonna finish these here off-camera I'm not gonna bore you to death eating you all these things here in front of you and I will be back in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because as always that is the most important part of any edible review all right guys please please please wish me luck let's hope these are better than our gummies in the past and ll WA edibles in the past and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know the results thank you so much for watching weights we'll see you soon peace guys I am happy to report that while not perfect and while not my first choice in any of the categories lol edibles the candy blue ropes blue berry ropes blue gummi ropes are are a nice little revelation they are not the most powerful 300 milligram edible I've ever had they're not the most tasty gummy I've ever had but I would say they are probably my new favorite gummy I am I do feel quite high not as high as I would be on a 300 mm gram confectionery edible like say akarova for example but that's a comparing you know something with like the best of the best I guess it's substantially better than their flamin hot cheeto knockoff that I had a while ago so you know it might be a combination of lowered expectations I was also a little tired going to this review so that might also be contributing to like my feelings of being high but overall I'm I'm I'm pleasantly surprised I know I used that phrase a lot but this was a welcome surprise I I had two strikes going against it one being lol edibles which I had a bad experience with and being a gummy which I've mostly found to be disappointing and I found it to be okay so that's you know that's good that's good I would not probably buy this again but if you are a fan of gummy edibles or if you really like sour gummies this is certainly better than the Voodoo candies I've had which are 375 milligram anibal's you might want to go and pick this up but for me it's it's a nice little surprise so thank you so much for watching weeks guys that's my dog walking in and we

and don't forget to chill macho cues in the building baby what's happening look we have another review for your hair time man y'all been loving the reviews so we got another one man go ahead and tell them what we got man this is the glowing buddha chili mango flavor man look man you know we haven't tried the glowing buddha on our channel yet we haven't reviewed them yet so we're gonna see what they're talking about it's the cannabis infused gummies you know 100 milligrams of thc so 10 milligrams per piece you know 10 pieces you know how that goes about right now by now yeah you also know you just take one you relax for a few hours if you do if you choose to take away you know what i'm saying look at the end of the day know your levels no your limits know your limits look already busted down you know me after you have to get my sniff back on you know what i'm saying oh look man look y'all y'all know y'all know what a chili mango y'all had the dry little mango fried little chili so you know what i'm go ahead bust one out see if they're looking like here look at that break and see the chili flakes y'all see the chili flakes let me do the makeup hand let me do the makeup here for y'all oh oh i can't really see this chili flakes but sugar man shout out to y'all this would be better as a belt yeah it would be better as well the flavor of that chili and that sugar right maybe on a belt right this like this this texture is coming with this texture is kind of strange but the flavor is blessing though this is like somebody who they trying to make a cheap i feel like this is a they didn't really put too much effort in a gummy right i feel like they need to put this on a belt stretch your gummy out to a belt because there's no flavor there's no lots of flavor it's just that texture's not matching with the flavor the texture was kind of strange in mouth but the uh the flavor the chili lumon that [ __ ] was good it's like just like the uh little candies you feel me man it tastes just like it look that's what i was gonna say next or makes a little thing a little like does the candies yeah like the candies you know either way the belt or the candies but you need to change your gummies man i don't know man this is just a weird little texture right well you don't write that too well i give it one thumbs up because the flavor is there and you don't taste the marijuana so you know what i'm saying look i know we can say that what you know you just i just come natural nowadays if i taste the marijuana that you could probably get a thumb down now at this point yeah i'm gonna be real know that you said that like when you in the edible section you probably can find like hell of [ __ ] that tastes way better than that but if you just want a chili lemon taste like i mean chili mango taste if you're looking for specific taste then grab those if not if you want just want something that just tastes good get something else you feel me cuz it's not too many [ __ ] busting on that milly chilly chilly fangirl milly chilly fangos fast in a hurry you feel me look like i said man that [ __ ] one thumb up one texture flavor would you rate them though i gotta agree with you one thumb up all right but i want to know man what was the best edible that you ever had let us know in the comment section because we might want to try it you know and while you're down there click like and bang that subscribe button let's go hit that bell like huh look at part of the squat squad hey you know anything else is down in the description down below we gotta go [Laughter]", "B7VCOKooBFI": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys jerky Andre this is a quick disclaimer if you're not 18 over this video does not apply to you do not try this product this is for 18 and up wrong folks no little kids do not try this product if you are not an adult thank you proceed to the recent video hey guys I'm back with another video so basically this video is gonna be different it's gonna be a product review for something that I've been meaning to try I was kind of not really worried but I did a lot of research on it and this is just something that I've been meaning to try hopefully bringing you in my video you in my video okay I like I was saying before um this product is something that I've been meaning to try and so yeah as you guys know I deal with anxiety and depression and haven't really been sleeping and part of it is because of my anxiety and depression and so I was asking my Twitter followers like what else I could do to basically do because I'm always irritated I work with kids so it just makes it 10 times worse to the point where I like don't go to work because I know I'm gonna be irritated I just need something to mellow me down but that was legal I do not smoke weed I don't smoke cigarettes I don't smoke anything I don't like the way it smells I'm like when smoke gets into my hair so smoking weed was just out of the question there's nothing against people who smoke weed I just don't so one of my followers recommended CBD oil or CBD gummies or whatever so like hmm ok [ __ ] so I did look it up and research it basically it comes from like a cannabis cannabis plant but it's not marijuana basically whatever is in like we'd like the THC that's not in these gummies but it still kind of gives you the same effect maybe just not as high that's how I understood it but basically it's like gummies without the legal stuff in it but it still gives you kind of the same effect so the gummies that I picked up from Amazon where these hemp gummies excuse me on these hemp gummies they are 30 thousand million in each gummybear has 250 milligrams of him ashtray in each one and it comes with a total of 120 these were well I was this video was all over the place these were $24.99 I think on Amazon and they got here literally within two days so wow yeah I literally ordered these yesterday and they got here today so real quick I'm opening for you so that you guys can see them so yes I'm excited to try these make mostly because of for my anxiety and my depression and also it's like asleep there very soon um only thing that I'm not sure about is if you take a drug test if it will show up my director I did a lot of research and they say that it waited because it doesn't have THC in it but I mean I don't know you might want to try that yourself I was trying to look for a drug test my story to take so that I can let you guys know or not they smell like sorry guys I checked but I can't find one so yeah it's up to you teacher them you know used to your discretion thank smell like organic coming berries I know if you ever had like gummies like health gummies and they smell like a whole bunch of fruits and vegetables mixed up together that's what they smell like I also want to note that whenever you do search CBD or gummies on Amazon all of these hemp oil products are gonna come up I read somewhere that Amazon can't sell CBD oil products I don't know if they're just disguising it as hemp oil or if it's really just hemp oh but just also pay attention to that whenever you do order they're like the meaning of evaders so it stays for the take to the day like one in the morning one at night but since I just got these imma go ahead and just take two I see what happens so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take them so I'm gonna take a green and a red one for Christmas and then I'm gonna come back 30 minutes later and let you know that it's a snake burglar coming beers already come back okay so real quick why I'm 20 sorry for smacking the ingredients say if they have him pimp extract him or omega three six and nine vitamin E and vitamin B other ingredients include corn syrup sugar water and gelatin citric acid natural and artificial flavors Connor Bo carnem hmm some plant leaf wax oh the other number five and number six red number forty and blue number one so yeah great taste so far I took two so that was 500 milligrams that I just took today so I'm gonna be back and let you guys know how I'm feeling hey guys so real quick I wanted to come back and come back come back and give you all an update on the gummies I know set up on come back 30 minutes later but I actually kind of decided to just maybe sleep on it and see how I sleep to give you guys a better review because honestly didn't feel anything which is kind of a good thing there's no side effects of the gummies I slept fine I took something this morning I've been very active I Oh actually after I took me I cleaned my room okay my bathroom today I went out and ran errands actually got off the bed I woke up early too so it's definitely giving me energy um I'm not really sad at the same time I also got paid so I might one during the review and I'm broke just being honest but so far so good I'm just happy there's no side effects of it I don't feel high I don't feel woozy I just feel happy like I generally have like no nothing back to say about it I don't feel angry or sad and oh so funny so last night I was looking for shoe this is really awkward a random story but I was looking first shoe last night and I found myself like getting angry but then I was just like like I got mad for like they're like five seconds I was like you know what I can't give that other things I can't control like stop getting mad over things retain control so I just you know brushed it off took a deep breath brushed it off can't clean in my room and then something told me to look in a certain spot it was an awkward spot a spot where a shoe should not be in and that's where my other shoe was and it's so funny because I feel like I don't know if I've ever told you this but I think I'm kind of psychic and I feel like these gummi bears opening my third eye a little bit and maybe tapping to my psychic abilities because the way I found that shoe yesterday there was no way to be God so I don't know that's just my experience with a gun me so far so good no complaints I would definitely recommend them if you feel like you need something and even if it's just all in my head and they really don't work I'm just happy I don't feel a high I don't feel a buzz I don't feel sleepy none of that I got slept great last night they're just good I liked them so far so if you're interested in them I'll link them down below thank you guys for watching until next time bye guys", "k6bZWStRazM": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with tokentown 420. all right say hi to all the new subscribers old subscribers

had a good weekend um or is gonna have a good weekend i don't even know what day it is anymore help me um today is friday so the weekend is starting today so hopefully everybody has a good weekend all right that's the last sticker all right let's get something lit up here that's what's wrong we ain't got nothing lit let's light this bad boy all right we're smoking on a little bit of that purple five keys f something or another from truly if you guys know what i'm talking about the name nobody can remember excuse me for a second all right i wouldn't do want to do a couple shout outs today in this video you guys haven't checked out proper major quality they're in jacksonville florida go check them out we also got another florida youtuber she's not really doing reviews i don't think which that's fine because she's got a great personality i can't wait to see what she's going to do but it's cut hat brie i'll leave a link down there now she's also from jacksonville now i know proper major quality likes to put people on their podcast and have guests if you guys want to get together so bri go watch their stuff proper you go watch her stuff and see what you guys think um like i said i've been following her she's only got two youtube videos up i've been following her on instagram for a while um she is like i said pretty funny girl so i think she's going to get maybe michi 69 a run for her money sorry guys um but yeah go check her out she's got a graham dab video she took it like a champ she turned real red but she finished it so like i said check them out guys if you're one of the first ones to watch the video because some of you guys are crazy little ninjas when it comes to the video popping up i can't get the thumbnail in for you guys have watched it and left a comment you have to give me a minute i'll have to go copy and paste copy and paste the two links okay all right so let's do the hall part of this video first because i'm a little bit confused by it maybe you guys will be too um so i did get the sublingual tablets today um what are these 150 milligrams five milligrams of piece 30 infused pieces now it still says sublingual but this is their version of a gummy now this is an arctic berry i think that's the flavor they said it's a hybrid blend yeah arctic berry so they are gummy and they do smell good now here's my thing on these um if you go to their website and look it says they're coming out the 8th which is tomorrow today is the 7th um but if you guys follow the nurse colleen um she does a 7 10 morning show uh they also drive the gr the big green buzzer and i think it's pete um they had these last week so i kept looking online and daytona gets theirs on the 8th port charlotte if you go on there online it says they'll get them on the 20th i've seen a couple others that said the 11th i couldn't find nobody that released them yet so i called my cure leaf this morning because they don't have a corporate number that i could find and i didn't look too hard so if there is one don't give me a hard time on that one um and i was going to ask i was go you know how come how did north colleen get them when they're not even out yet so i asked to speak with the manager um and she tells me they got these last week they got a shipment in for their top 10 customers so if you was a cure leaf top 10 customer you got these last week i'm not a top 10 customer because i don't go there that often because they ain't got a lot of crap but um i find that in medical i find that a bit disturbing i don't know that some people should have got this early it's almost like you know you guys know i got five kids if i had one candy bar i'm not gonna go pick my favorite kid and give her a candy bar [ __ ] i just said it was a girl all right i'm gonna wait till i get enough candy bars for everybody i think cure leaves should have done the same thing if my dispensary wasn't going to get those till 20th i think they should have hold production until the 20th so everybody could have got at the same time but not to mention that i don't think you should have a top 10 customers that get products before anybody else that's just my opinion but she said because she had extras i guess one of her top 10 customers didn't want to damn things that she was able to sell these today and i just happened to be one of the lucky ones and grabbed it i also got a flower what did i get the purple sunset and i have no idea if it's an indica oh oh camera almost dropped you uh let's see keerley prepack florida purple sunset thc uh oh indica it's just so hard uh 16 so this is an indica they need to make that stuff a little bit better we still got the old can't get into unless you've got you have to kill them sometimes uh so hopefully everybody had a good day i've been working on the car all day so i didn't really leave the house so that's why i'm a little bit extra medicated um feeling pretty good right now not bad not the best looking stuff that's for dang sure it feels pretty moist they're not super moist not super but it does kind of look a little leafy this time the leaves are kind of dry but it feels okay smells good some of them are a little darker than the other ones so not bad so we will have a review on the gummies um coming real soon i'm gonna try one after the video i just wanna talk with my mouth full through the video i'm probably gonna do two of them uh to try that to start with i know it's gonna be a low milligram for me um but edibles do affect people differently i've never really had an edible so i'll start low and work my way up i do plan on eating one and then sucking on the other one see if that helps put it in your system a little better because the some stuff like this tinctures and stuff like that you're supposed to hold underneath your tongue um and the longer they stay in your mouth and dissolving the saliva the quicker it dissolves in your system so we will try that see if it's any different and then we got one of their elite live this is enhanced live resin so i'm imagining this it's supposed to be a live resin cart um but since it says enhanced i imagine they might have added some terpenes back to this not real sure um so we're 79.4 percent how we're going to get you out of the box so it is a hybrid it's got a little sticker label on here that we i guess we can put on the thing i'm kind of digging that if we can figure out how to get it out it's got one push button so i imagine i'm gonna have to slice this open real quick guys let me get this little sticker out of the way um but this is their select so it's a different company um and as you guys know we're seed to sale in florida so there is no different company what they sell they produce so it's a different it's still cure leaves product in here the only thing different doesn't look very full it's got a big ass [ __ ] bubble in there see how that settles down and let it sit up for a while but um so the cart is going to be different the actual thing the liquids in um but that thing's only going to look like it's half full i'm hoping it's a [ __ ] full gram carton that just charged me for a half i'm not sure if it doesn't say yeah i guess it is a half gram so but you can see it's not going to be quite full so like i said i imagine this is going to have a different flavor profile let's leave that sitting up then there are other live resin carts that's supposed to have a cotton instead of a wick in there i guess um what else was i going to say on that oh so the reason i did get this because i'm running low on flower this month for sure i'm going to run out way soon um and i renewed my card last month so i still had the 75 off 150 at cure leaf hadn't been able to find enough flour or i would plan on getting you know two shatters two crumbles and a flower that i made at 150 i couldn't ever seem to find those in stock together so when they had these these are 45 dollars by the way their flour has been on sale for a while for 35 so that was 80. so i added a 60 cart onto there and then i added a 10 battery the batteries are the only thing that you can get a discount on that aren't product like i was going to get a t-shirt and he's like you can't use the discount it won't register the discount for a t-shirt so instead of doing a pre-roll i did a another ten dollar bait battery you can never have enough of those they go out you need an extra one always keep a spare one of those around so but most people should be able to get these tablets tomorrow at most of the true leaves some are cure leaves sorry sorry freudian slip so um those should be available to most everybody tomorrow um a few of us are probably gonna have to wait a little bit so the review we're gonna do is on their citrus farmer coming at 16 thc this was a hybrid they said it was a sativa leaning hybrid um got one little buddy over left this is the one if you guys remember had the nice orange big hairs in there nice beautiful buds it was supposed to have or some people said it had you know lemon taste i don't know if they thought that because of to me this was more gas and earthy it was good flavor i wouldn't really count this as a sativa i count this as a hybrid um it had a little sativa to it but it had been more like um 55 45 you know i mean not a lot it was real close to being balanced for me so close that i was able to do a sativa wax with this in the morning and it didn't overdo me so if you haven't tried that yet like i said it is more of a hybrid for me what it is for you you just have to wait and see and that was coming at 16 was also 35 bucks like i said their flower's been on sale for 35 bucks for a while i don't know why they just don't they're not going to sell any back at the 48 dollar price range when they jump the prices back up so i think the sale is going to last it's been lasting for several months now i'm pretty sure we're going on three maybe four months of their flower being at 35 so it's pretty good guests to say it's going to stay there unless they come out with a you know better version and they raise that up and keep some of the other ones at 35 i don't you never know that's just me guessing and talking out of my a-hole uh but right now their flower is 35 bucks looks like across the board some of them was 30. i did see an afghani for 30 in there not today or anything or i might have got it because you've seen there's one little bud in here there's one little bud of the other stuff left and i got a thing of this and that's about it so i would have bought more but that was the only strain they had except for the citronella sunset which is a sativa and you know i'm not a big sativa person they did come out with some black tuna today i know michi 69 got the black tuna so if you guys haven't checked her out check her out i did not get the black tuna the black tuna sold out at my location so i will not be getting no black tuna for a while not until black tuna comes back apparently um so if you want to check that one out like i said check out mi269's channel that's going to be it for me guys um i'm gonna let this one go make sure you go check out the proper major qualities cut hat brie like i said i'll leave the links down in the description for you guys hopefully everybody has a fantastic weekend and hopefully you guys are taking on something good this weekend till next time keep", "t09qduS2YBQ": "oh hey time for another gummy review this one's going to be pretty quick i'm going to try to keep the rambling to a minimum and since i've done some gummy reviews in the past i'm sure if you've seen those before you know how i feel about them this one we have here is going to be delta eight hemps gummies okay i give up on that focus i'll just post it right up here or here or here there's 33 milligrams can't see it from this far obviously 33 milligrams of delta eight per gummy the other ones i've tried such as the moonwalker and the three chi are 25 so this one's a little bit heavier figuratively not literally so there were actually only about 10 in here this little tub but there are two different flavors this one being like a blueberry and a lemon and the other one they have sour gummies so both of those are i believe 10 gummies for about 20 bucks think they have a sale right now as you can see we only got one left so i've tried making some reviews in the past with these when i after i've had them and that was a that was a nightmare so i'm just going to have this last one on camera and then potentially be back and let you know what i think but i'm sure you all know what i think by now i do love all these gummies the high i experience from those it's more intense and it lasts longer than the vapes definitely better for me to just have the edibles but hey any other companies want to send me some vapes to try out don't be turned off by what i just said so we have this lemon gummy here it's a little bit smaller than the moonwalker but obviously has more delta eight in there so these ones are super delicious well i have a handful of gummies from other companies that i have to review but so far these are the best tasting for sure the moonwalker are great the three chi are great but this one just tastes exactly like if you've ever had lifesaver gummies i mean i haven't had those in so long but these taste very similar to that and there's absolutely no like that earthy flavor or anything you get from the hep extract or the delta eight in there so these could potentially be dangerous you could 100 trick somebody and just give them one of these and they would just seem like kind of an overly chewy a little bit harder regular gummy you would find anywhere but yeah two flavors in here it's like a blue raspberry ish and then the lemon they both taste awesome so no complaints there whatsoever but the effects on these are great they're just like any of those other gummies i haven't noticed any big difference in any way shape or form compared to the gummies aside from these being just a little bit stronger than the other ones i've tried but that makes sense because these are 33 milligrams delta 8 versus 25 and the others that i've tried not that big of a difference from the high or anything but maybe it's just in my head thinking it's a bit stronger so maybe those eight extra milligrams do make a difference or they don't i just had one dude comment on one of my previous videos that has kept up with a lot of my videos and he said that he tried the three cheat gummies and he didn't notice anything at all took two of them didn't notice anything gave it to some of his friends took two didn't notice anything at all with all these and i just recently replied to his comment that with any of these gummies or any of the delta eight products i've tried i've noticed an effect on every single one i mean some being a little bit more mild than others i guess but nowhere have i noticed absolutely nothing so that's why it's only worth my personal experience and then my opinion so hopefully that may give you some idea about how it may work for you but all this is just my opinion because these things can affect everybody differently but enough of that it's a beautiful day outside even though it's cold as [ __ ] so i'm going to get outside for a while enjoy the effects of this gummy and i'll probably film a bit more of just my overall experience and try not to ramble on because last time i tried when i'm making these videos i went on a rant of just the the beauty of life and all this [ __ ] that the uh that a lot of these gummies and just a lot of other things in general can just really bring that perspective out and everything like that but i don't know maybe i'll do that when i come back a little bit but i'll try to keep it pretty short in time so i'll be back well it's about five days later what's the verdict same exact thing as all these other gummies it's incredible it's a great experience what do i do when i've had these whether it's say after a day of work i'll have one of those well not when i get home because i work from home but i'll have one of those after my work days done it's a nice chilled out effect throughout the rest of the evening definitely perks my mood up just gets me in a very nice grateful present state while that high still being there and on the weekends or anytime i go outside and just enjoy the day that really helps perk everything up not like i need things to be perked up but i'm sure you know what i'm talking about just that perspective shift and just being able to really appreciate the beauty of everything especially on a very nice day the gummies really do just take everything to the next level much more than the vapes in my opinion i do love the vapes but i love the gummies more don't really have much else to say except check out delta 8 hemp's website or instagram i'll have both of those linked down in the descriptions below if you're looking for gummies vapes disposable vapes anything like that they have a great selection and as i mentioned in my previous video on them i love the way their sites laid out they have all of the lab results and everything there and they also provide a good amount of information on delta eight and a bunch of other things so check it out thank you delta eight hem

look at the base edifice never look at these dang gummies these are peach rings now I'm already about to in um I wasn't smoking if you know video so I can tell you how they make the reef you just go ahead pop this third one it you know explain to you how to take all right Burke up these have a very decent peach scent oil you don't really get a cannabis scent coming out of them you know it's a very good peach and kind of sugar scent place papi can try to break down how to taste actually it [Music] coating very sugary when you start to break it open very nice peach flavors come - and it's actually a pretty good Pete very good peach representation like it almost tastes like biting into an extra peach [Music] not really picking up too much of the cannabis at first but starting to come through is still behind the peach flavor a lot but figured up on the very end of the taste as far as what I'm feeling right now three of these are 15 milligrams this is the third one out hat so same won't break that break down the third mini twenties they're almost 30 milligrams I've already a and it's a nice feeling nice body high relaxing everything on and you spiny gummies but I will say they do them a try you don't want to go just eating a whole bunch of them because it takes a while creme to uh jump in nice you start to feel the effects so you can easily overdo it but they'll be afraid these at will be real good I'm I definitely recommended that to Lamar come out there [ __ ] cuz [ __ ] bring buddy trumpeted but daddy what a comedown [Music]", "TbKo4fcfJEE": "they strung up to buck

at these dank gummies these like blue raspberry rings we've all put them out in Testament this whole package is 500 milligrams that's three pieces equals 50 milligrams warning hair so it may take up to two hours for this to kick in so you don't want to just go munching on a bunch of these you all get a couple out to pack see [Music] all right bird club these are what they look like yes I think they're blue raspberry but we're gonna try and taste them it should be infused in the candy and into Cody but we won't try them to see how much of a cannabis taste comes do it so it's ready to eat this thing all right Burke up about to take this date dummies it's not really I can't even smell coming from I don't really I can't really see it smells like blue raspberry I'm pretty sure that's what it is but no he doesn't see what it tastes like see how about to a cannabis taste this actually is [Music] [Music] [Music] nothing really picking up any of the cannabis at all I'm just getting like sugar a little bit of a sour flavor it's too little yeah I don't really pick up the taste of cannabis in it I'm still not about to go like forward ease right away because you don't know how strong he is so some weight a little bit I'll come back let you know I was doing [Music] I Berkeley I almost forgot to come back to you I kind of ruined this review because I don't know how much time passed I three of them that's supposed to be 50 the whole entire time so I am hi I just can't tell you whatever high from like I don't hide from smoking is waiting I can't tell you that really hard um because I'm absolutely dead the taste of these is decent it's a nice nice raspberry taste kind of kind of sour on this finish but starts off sweet pretty sure I'm gonna sleep real good so so that's that's decent then I see I'm still smoking so so I don't I can't really tell you tell you the effective but I will say this to be CDs here we try let me know what you think haven't tried it before how was they for you did you try it without smoke weed let me know in the comment section um maybe with that we go Marley mom Berkeley [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "3pvzLPqxT9s": "hey cannabis world how's it going it's your boy with the cannabinoids here tobin we got our expert bud tender as always kaitlyn with us in the house and today we're going to do a product review on some dance gummies if you're unfamiliar with the vince brand they're i'm sure you've seen it there's they've got like some really awesome packaging they've got some really intricate artwork on their packaging so um but anyway yeah if you haven't heard of the vince brand maybe you've heard of the name stizzy or church those are both vape pens um also ether gardens but those are all under the the all those products are underneath the the ether gardens name so you know that you're getting quality when you when you purchase something with that with that name bins um so yeah let's let's uh let's dive right into the review [Music] so i noticed that these guys really had a really nice mellow uplifting uh effect on me uh the taste was really nice it had a decent texture to it too um i noticed that this ski tries to put out uh quality products that create a more euphoric experience and these guys are perfect to pop in when you're when you want to go for a hike or if you want to clean the house or something like that um but yeah these guys come in 10 pieces 10 milligrams they come in blackberry lemon mango lemon and mixed berry my personal favorite ones are actually the mango one they're really satisfying very nice so i tried the blackberry myself um and i think i kind of made it i kind of got a little overzealous and i put quite a few of them in my mouth at the same time to chew them up and the flavor of the blackberry was they were a little overwhelming so i kind of took i took a second pause and then i ate one at a time and then the flavor was there it was it was a much better experience when you when you go one or two at a time um and for for me personally um these worked like a sleeping pill yes maybe it's a dosage you know there's many factors involved but but i definitely got some very very good sleep off of these whether i wanted it or not but yeah they they the flavor is there the quality is there and you know there's many people out there suffering from insomnia or just you know stress in general i really really think that that this would be a good tool for the people that are dealing with stress or anxiety to just mail you out give you that calmness and uh and just let you cruise through your day a little easier so it's definitely um definitely a good product they're also made of all natural ingredients i believe so that's pretty nice we like that for all you for all you health nets out there yeah i really love the packaging though those are super cute oh yeah don't be dummies come get them um one cool thing about the tin is it's got a lot of artwork on it like i said which is pretty cool but it does fit right inside a stocking for stocking stuffers and we know the holiday season is upon us so you know you know what they say a friend with weed is a friend indeed so they would really make a nice stocking stuffer and you could get plenty of these in a stocking that's right something to think about all right guys so we are located on 1324 south third street so please come on by we are directly behind the wedding chapel there is a lot of construction going on right now but please don't hesitate to look for us because we are still here um but please

mixture yeah well just have a guesstimate oh don't put that in there okay all right so we know that this is still cornstarch and that's no powdered sugar [Music] lick your finger and then put it on your face and then lick it again and then we'll know what it is okay now look at is it sugar or is it cornstarch it's gummy bears powdered sugar powdered sugar okay that's way better than corn starch right now it's good show us that mixture sure see my mixture is almost melted I saw a couple Wolf's little gummy bears just gotta melt them I thought we said not to do that I found me a lot right there okay you're taking all the powder sugar and putting it the cornstarch are you crazy someone's lost their mine I'm giving up messy now up to take another bath yeah you will my squad is just over

back [Music] as you guys can see Rory did not make a mess of me at all when I was putting her into the bathtub no mess a better technique to make it easier to stretch it understand why you suck it ready in this cuz there's more force you're like more focused on spinning so that it's easier to stretch it's kind of weird but it works what anna has made the ultimate gummies [Music] take a bite out of it taste it mmm I'm just gonna be so mad enough yeah I went down shots ready right away ready no wait let me get to the position it's not gonna work this time ready ready yeah Micah twirl I think bad just happened Jilla decided to go and take her little gummy slime and throw it on the roof so I had to jump on top of a chair jail had to jump I got my chair I had to put Jayla onto the roof so she could grab this slime thankfully we only have like I don't know ten-foot roofs at the lowest part so she's okay she's alive I'm alive we're all alive guys hi it could go H and I try to catch it but I didn't know where it went what do you think the gutter is it's in the roof girl yeah but the gutter and the roof are two separate things yeah that's true I find for you in smart well we are making our final slide it's gonna be the green slime are you ready Jay yeah over here I'm gonna put a disclaimer out there for everybody who wants to try doing this this stuff really sticks well the countertops and it really sticks fall to the floor see that we were gonna show you the final slime but you said I think we're gonna move on to cleaning up and doing all that good stuff so we'll see you guys soon look at this mess you see it you see it and now you're done Wow just like that the house is clean what do you think Enzo my pants are clean now and so are you happy about this huh these oh yeah okay about this yeah we have to put you guys in your beds you know why you would have eaten all the gummi bears all right well it's time for them to see the end results of the gummies here they are guys this one had too much cornstarch on it that's why it looks like you know all nasty still tastes good though this one's pretty good but it is firm like a rock cuz once they cool down they return to their gummy form and even a little bit harder because of the cornstarch this one's still a little bit warm I would say this is probably the best gummy that we made yeah tears here guys just suck on this one the one that got on the roof and you wouldn't want to eat it cuz it has little bits of shingle inside of it so nobody's gonna eat that one this one right here I got nothing to say about it okay that is it for today's show guys I hope you enjoyed it as much as we enjoyed making this for you guys remember that we post a lot of videos for you guys to enjoy and for us to enjoy as

boy cbd smoke doctor i am back with another review this review is coming in from mr hemp flower and we got a couple of strands to show you guys check this out right here we got the bayox and all of the flower is showing that is zero point thirty percent thc and uh we have one gram sax we're getting more depth with these in a minute then we got the lift the indoor it's also one green cherry pie guys also one gram we have the five all right and that's one gram and then we have some silver hands we got some paperwork in here we got the mother lode guys so we got all our paperwork look at this guys crazy eight delta eight cart yes indeed got a lighter in here oh yes we've been blessed guys and there's another special product on the bottom hold on one second here we go full spectrum magic drop gummies 25 milligrams per gummy guys all right and this is a three pack and this also says 0.30 thc so here we go guys let's get it done all right guys as you guys can see from the unboxing we have quite a few strands so what i did was individually test each strain out so i can give you accuracy on how they taste how they make me feel and most important how good it is guys all right so the first one i got ready for y'all guys is the cherry pop take a look at this picture [Music] all right so y'all got a good look at that cherry pie now i already have it ready it's in my marley i have my mr hemp flower lighter right here so before i even start that i want to give a shout out to anaya empress she's the sativa diva and she recommend i try these guys out reached out you got it on the channel guys okay so shout out to her and shout out to mr hempflower themselves all right so far so good guys so here we go with the first one i'm going to try and this is cherry pie cheers guys [Music] [Music] this light is a little high let me use my other one [Music] okay guys so with the first one with the cherry pie this one is a little peppery um the taste is good it's just a little peppery so a little bit of spice added to it the smell the smell is good i like the smell can i deal with it yes but some people are a little sensitive so the pepper might be too much for them and as far as far as the effects goes i like the way it makes me feel though honestly guys okay so let's move on to the next one [Music] all right guys so yeah here's the baox that's this one here and this is a one gram zero point thirty percent thc guys cheers let's get it in the line [Music] this one's a lot smoother than the last one as far as um they eliminated the peppery i mean of course it is a different strand so you know it comes with the territory this one is a lot smoother [Music] [Music] it also has a richer taste too guys i like this one and the flower's super red you seen it matter of fact take a look at this super rain guys super red so it's so red you see it in the picture you probably think it's something wrong with the camera or something like that is not it's like a dark orange almost really red and the effects were really good guys okay i like this flower here so we're gonna move on to the next one [Music] it's rule five it's really small little tiny popcorn buds just like the cherry pie was but this one here is a darker green and it doesn't really have the red hairs like the cherry pie okay that's how i could tell the difference when it comes to the presentation of the flower now it's time to get some in the lung i already have it in the marley it's already grinded up and ready to go guys here we go [Music] chairs [Music] okay so again it seems like their small popcorn buds seem to all be a little peppery this one is not as bad as the other i can deal with it once again like i said some people may be sensitive to it but this one is not as bad the other one is a little stronger than this with the pepper this one isn't okay guys even though his peppery still has a great taste the smell of the bud was good so i mean it's still a good flower guys okay just a little tad bit of pepper and no problem no problem so with that being said with the effects guys i'm telling you this flower right here this one got me feeling super relaxed all right guys so we're gonna move on to the next flower here we go all right guys now we got the silver hands and this bud is actually big enough that i could show you again on camera but here's a look at the picture of it that i took [Music] okay so that's looking real nice the trim game is awesome ah i have prepared it so let's get it in the lung and cheers to you guys okay so so far out of the three flowers that i have reviewed this one is the best tasting so far we still have one more to go guys this is the best tasting i can't forget not to use that liner they have the settings entirely too high for what i'm trying to do guys this one i like the flavor run sorry guys so the flavor is good the flour looks good it smells good so far like i said this is the best one the effects now the effects they're taking a little longer to kick in but i do feel nice and relaxed right now so this one i'm guessing is a good relaxer all right and um since we have more on the show let's move on here we go we got the lifter indoor and this one is also a little baby nugget okay so it's really not much you know i could show on the camera but here's the picture guys [Music] all right now that that guy's got a good look at the indoor lifter i already got the marley loaded so let's get some of this in the lung guys [Music] cheers okay the pep is all right the small popcorn buzz that you sent me wasn't really too much i could show the people in the channel as far as picture wise a lot of my followers they love to see pictures of flower so i had to minimize that ah most of the flower you guys sent me they were a lot a lot like uh similar most of them there's nothing that really stood out between them the small ones were mostly the same one had red hairs one didn't uh and then with the silver haze and the indoor lifter those kind of look almost identical it's just that the indoor lifter is a little darker okay so um you guys had my expectations super high when it came to the flower so with that being said that's all i could say about the flower portion we're going to move on to the d8 um but oh i have to say though the effects were there all of the flowers the effects were there but um like i said nothing just stood out and uh blew me away okay guys so i'm keeping 100 with that when it comes to the flower um we're going to move on let's do the d8 here we go here's the d8 and this is the crazy eights delta eight cartridge sour diesel this is a one gram and it has the pop top so i'm gonna put this on my battery here all right guys so we all get excited about delta inc so let me guys give it to you i said let me guys give it to you let me give it to you guys here we go now this delta 8 car [Music] i actually really like this the sour diesel it has a great flavor and the effects were awesome i have to give it to you guys with that one [Music] so i haven't know my trusted battery i smoked on it for half a day before i recorded this for you guys and i'm gonna tell you now i love it i really do this right here is it guys all right you did a great job with your delta eight so this right here i will definitely be trying to get some more of i'll put an order in or whatever if i have to i like this one okay i usually don't like the flavored cards but the sour diesel is not too it's not overwhelming it does you can't really tell it still has that natural taste and it says premium cannabis oil okay and it also says it has 0.30 percent delta 9 thc i really enjoyed this one guys all right so the link will be below the video for you guys y'all gonna have to check them out for yourselves okay so i'm gonna move on because we still got the gummies to do but i gotta let you guys know the d8 is where is that guys this is where is that this is fuego all right so we're gonna move on to the gummies guys [Music] all right guys so here we go now we have the gummies this is how it came packaged [Music] so let's open it up wow look at this see i like that they even put a cold pack on the inside to keep it nice and cool and these are the gummies here like i said to keep it nice and cool so that they don't stick together or start to melt so let's open these up and get a good look at them [Music] okay here we go guys it smells nice and fruity in here wow so these are the gummies guys can y'all see them okay let's take one out says a three pack but i got four thank you guys and it's two i mean 25 milligrams cbd per gummy and it also says that is 0.30 percent thc so here we go guys this is what the gummy looks like [Music] and i'm going to pop this and i'm going to let you guys know exactly how it makes me feel i'll come back in like a half an hour all right guys [Music] all right guys here we go these are the gummies and i have to tell you the flavor was really really really good really good i mean i could see myself eating like 20 of these but i only wanted to try one and um it did make me feel a little drowsy so i know these actually are effective because it did feel drowsy so with that being said now when it's ready for bedtime i'm gonna pop maybe one maybe two of these and i might have me a great night's sleep but i will have to give you guys an update on that and i'll do it in the description below so to sum it all up overall the delta 8 was great the presentation the packaging great the gummies i liked so far i didn't get a chance to take them all as you guys see it's only one missing the one that i took about 45 minutes ago that one is gone that's the red one so i will take another like i said and just let you guys know in the description but um so far it seems like those are on point and the delta eight crazy eight is on point now when it comes to the flower i have to be honest with you guys the flowers average um the red baox that's the only flower that really stood out a little okay because it was just red um so yeah guys um with the flowers just a just average flower i'm sorry about that guys you got to be 100 with you it's not bad flower i'll tell you that elsa wouldn't be on the channel but is it the best no will i enjoy smoking it yeah because the effects were there the effects were there guys okay so if i didn't like the peppery stuff because that's me that's just me guys i gotta know that i don't know you might like it but me personally the pepper stuff is just it was a little much on some some it really wasn't there um but besides that um everything else man everything else was on point so with that being said guys the link will be below the video i think y'all guys should go ahead and check this out yourselves all right so smoke doctor is signing out for now but i'll be back with another review soon guys all right peace", "5hsCZVvIsbU": "all right what's up everybody your main homie EDF India's bringing you guys a little review of wild edibles now these are a delicious way of consuming cannabis or the consistency to match so finding your perfect dosage is honestly really easy my favorite is about thirty milligrams or three pieces which I personally found was the perfect high before you start hitting that area where you start getting anxiety here and there you know ten milligrams was also a very comfortable micro dose amount it was a really easy high and you weren't really gone you were just chilling having a good time the packaging was a fun experience honestly I really had a good time just opening it up for twenty dollars for a hundred milligrams this is like your average price and honestly it's a really good flavor it's consistent and it's really potent which make it worth trying but it honestly is just another edible on the market there's nothing so special where it's like oh man I'm gonna keep coming back but honestly it really is a great product and I would do it again alright guys thanks for checking this out just like subscribe share do all that good stuff and I'm out [Music]", "enm9eT1cyio": "what's up everybody welcome to the channel today i will be showing you how to store your candle oil edibles and other cannabis infused products so let's get into it alright guys so i'm going to show you guys how to store your cannabis edibles so for my gummy bears all i do is put my gummy bears in a ziploc bag make sure your bag is completely tight and then put your gummies in a cool dark place like your fridge for my rice krispie treats what i like to do is wrap my rice krispie treats and parchment paper and then add it to a ziploc bag [Music] i like to make sure my bag is completely tight and then i store this in a cool dark place like my cabinet all right guys now when it comes down to store your can of butter what i personally recommend is just putting your peanut butter in some type of ziploc bag however let's say if i'm going to be traveling for like a week or two and i want to make some edibles for me personally what i would do is i would use a vacuum steel bag like this here so what i would do is put my cannabis in this bathroom steel bag and then i will back and seal my bag so once you back and steal your cannon butter what you want to do is put this in a cool dark place so i'm going to be putting this in the fridge [Music] now i'm going to talk about how to store your kettlebell so i recommend storing your kennel or in a mason jar so for a short term storage you can use a regular mason jar but if you plan on storing your kindle oil for maybe like a month or two i recommend using an amber mason jar so the good thing about an amber mason jar or any type of jar that is dark it's going to help prevent light from penetrating your mason jar if you don't have access to an amber mason jar or any type of dark mason jar no rubbish you can use a regular mason jar just remember once again to store your mason jar in a cool dark place alright guys so now i'm going to show you how to store your cosmetic products all right guys so currently you are looking at cannabis with body butter so so for my people who are looking to make cannabis cosmetic products like cannabis body butter or cannabis balm or cannabis salad i recommend using some type of uv cosmetic amber jar to put your product in but let's get into the next one all right guys so now we're going to talk about how to store your cannabis all right guys so the cannabis dash box is definitely a short turn option i don't recommend using this over probably a few days at the most so my favorite option would be using the mason jar instead of using this regular mason jar right here to store your herb or cannabis i recommend using something like this here so these are amber mason jars the reason why i like these is because of the color of the mason jar so the color is going to naturally help prevent light from penetrating your mason jar which is a great thing light will degrade your cannabis over time inside of my mason jar i have this little rh pack so that little pack right there is a two-way humidity regulator so what it does is it maintains the humidity and it preserves the flavor and retain the aromas for my herb [Music] all right guys so hopefully you guys learned how to stir your kennel oil your canned butter and other type of cannabis infused product so overall what you need to remember is just store your cannabis in a cool dark place and you'll be good to go but uh thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace", "NCVBujyWvyE": "hi my name is coupons in this video is for mature audience so you better be mature if you're watching this today we are celebrating a thousand subscribers on YouTube that's right a thousand of you awesome people subscribe to my youtube channel thank you everybody who Tunes in and watches my videos and shares them and likes them in comments I really appreciate that holy [ __ ] so to celebrate a thousand subscribers I'm gonna stick to the theme of a thousand and what I've got here is a 1-1 gram snake of some shadow I've stretched out here so we're gonna do a 1 gram damp of some of this grape star shatter if I can get it to focus I picked this up earlier from the hem Center really cool dispensary and this is about who cares what percent 66% but we've got a 1 gram dam which is a thousand milligrams of concentrate and then I also have a thousand milligrams of edibles that we're gonna take today so a 1 gram Babb and a thousand milligrams of edibles do you think that you can handle this what I've got here is the let's get it to focus I have the Colorado cannabis oil capsules and there's four capsules in here and there are a total of 350 milligrams through the whole bottle and they actually make these words four capsules and it's a thousand milligrams but I couldn't find that so these are just I guess less filled and the capsules but let me give you a breakdown we're looking at okay so each capsule is about 93 milligrams of THC and it is full spectrum or RSO so there are other cannabinoids and there's really good stuff I've had this many times before and it's actually my favorite edible so this whole bottle is 372 milligrams of THC and it's not like it's full there's only four little capsules in here and we're actually gonna take we're gonna take three of these which should be just over a thousand milligrams it'll actually be about 1100 milligrams so I'm excited and then I'm gonna try to stream on Twitch after this so this is for a thousand subs on YouTube but you know I stream every night on Twitch if you don't sub to my twitch channel like twitch that TV slash coupons check that [ __ ] out I'm probably live right now if you're watching this and I'm probably not on my thousand milligrams and one gram that but maybe we hit some milestones again I'll do it check out my twitch check out my other social media we have links in the description below follow my Instagram my Twitter sup to the subreddit check out the Facebook I don't know check out all that stuff join the discord that's the good one let's take some of the capsules first maybe like a half now and half after cuz like what if the dev just wrecks me I can I can't continue let's give it a go so this is 350 milligrams for four of these and they're just little capsules and I guess this is the same size for all of them so if you get the higher dose which ones they just they fill more but they have more of the liquid in it early oil so let's go for it let's take a nap now [Music] just little GHC capsules I kappapa movement in this or above okay so that's four of them I think and honestly guys I mentioned it before this is my absolute favorite edible I hate if I want to take a thousand milligrams I usually hate a thousand to get high if I want to take it it's like several brownies or like a fuckload of gummies you know what I mean I'm not trying to eat like a [ __ ] eight ounce bag of gummies to get a thousand milligrams I'd rather just like pop a few capsules and this is actually these are the low dose not like a pop four and get a thousand milligrams some of them are even more potent so I need to look out for those they're hard to find and they're kind of pricey well that's half of it down it's about 550 milligrams of THC here was 1100 for the capsules overall so we have half of that down and let's fire up the let's fire up the nail here we're gonna do this on quartz banger I got the pearls in there hopefully hoping I can get the time right I don't do a lot of dabs on this lately so I'm hoping I get the time right but if not I'm down for four reheats and whatnot we were just gonna milk this a one-gram dab is like it can be a million different things a hundred people could do a a 1 gram them and everybody consumes a different amount so there's different amounts of waste or whatever so I'm just gonna try to go pretty hot minimal waste but you know how it is let's let's see we got here [Music] we got a nice big old Glover here let's see how it looks [Music] oh that's thick [Music] not nearly enough holy [ __ ] [Music] take us amount of oil in there [Music] my eyes are watering [Music] oh it's so hot in here [Music] Oh [Music] Oh Mike covered in sweat now

got 400 milligrams of delta 8 thc per pack milligrams in each little gummy and 16 gummies per pack and this retails for 39.99 if you want a quick brief history about what this is uh it's a cbd gummy basically made with delta 8 thc which is basically like the brother of delta 9 or the thc that you would normally find in marijuana delta a contains similar psychoactive properties as its little big brother delta nine thc but the catches it is still federally legal here in the united states um the problem with delta eight is it's very hard to get it concentrated to give you like a real high it doesn't exist too much in abundance however companies are finding way like 3g to concentrate the delta h delta 8 to give you um a nice cool relaxing experience i took mine about four hours ago it's starting to wear off a little bit uh it came the high high quotation marks came about an hour and a half in and i will tell you if you've tried cbd gummies and you don't feel like you're getting anything out of them like they're not getting you that relaxing feeling that you want uh 3g delta 8 thc gummies did it for me past two and a half hours my body's been really chill kind of relaxed um a little bit tingly just nice i've been having a real nice feeling what i don't have is too much of the head high or feeling like oh hi or any kind of the psychoactive properties they don't feel like they're they're you get that kind of head high that you get with the some strains of marijuana you get just a more like peaceful relaxed chill feeling and i honestly think like that's what i've been looking for in cbd gummies and this is not a sponsored video by the way this is just me being truthful i like these you i tried multiple cbd gummies and they haven't given me that chill relaxing feeling at night when i'm just chilling that i wanted but this did like i i feel good right now um i've had a little bit of trouble filming these videos uh today because i mean i feel like you know i'm pretty chill like i'm not on top of my game as much as i would but i wanted to do this um i want to get this out there because is it worth it even at 39.99 a pack definitely definitely this is cool this i like this experience i had a good experience with these sorry guys this budget baller uh thank you for liking subscribing doing all that i really appreciate it um have a great day and then i'm gonna close out on the pack for you here there you go nice little look on it cool see it", "yoZbe2XLzOc": "I want a transition here and start getting to some science sure so Ohio approved multiple routes of administration for medical marijuana some of the ones off top of my head would be sublingual like the tinctures inhalation methods whether you're vaping off of dry flour or vaping off of oils or concentrates oral where you actually swallow the medication capsule form of gummy form and topical where there's lotions and patches yeah so can you kind of run us through those different routes of administration some pros and cons some on set duration just some of the science behind that sure and that's where it gets tricky and that's where I think another benefit I'm having a pharmacist on staff helps they didn't really get a good sense of the science behind it and why different routes of administration might be better for different patients so really the roots of administration one it boils down to convenience that's a big factor for instance if you're buying flour you have to you know loaded into a vaporizer grind it up versus if you buy oils that you can vaporize it could be quicker and simpler onset of action what kind of condition are you dealing with so if you're dealing with severe pain that comes on every now and again suddenly you need something that works quickly if you are dealing with having trouble you know say you have some seizure disorder and it can come on at any time so I need a baseline level of some sort of compound in cannabis you probably want an edible form because you're not dealing with the symptoms all day you just want to prevent them so PT SC is another thing you never know when an attack may strike or some sort of them severe anxiety you may come across so some people may want the edible form and other cases sometimes you want to take something that works immediately where you could do the tinctures and keep it under your tongue and have a quicker onset of action so it's all what you feel comfortable with some people don't like inhaling so they would prefer a quick onset of action and sublingual is their best read some people may not even want to absorb cannabis at all they may have a localized condition some sort of skin inflammation localized pain they could put a top to pull on mm-hmm and other people may like the convenience of a patch where you're absorbing it and it's a long-acting product unless 8 to 12 hours so it's all patient specific based upon the onset of action what kind of symptoms you're dealing with and not just what you hope to gain from the product so it's not a one-size-fits-all solution the good thing about having these different methods of administration is the fact that depending on what your symptoms are what your condition is what you're hoping to gain from it there is something out there that is tailored to that need ok very informative", "SdvR0-uCd_s": "what's up guys it's your guy here pears here and we're back at it again with another storytime and as you guys heard in my last three times the spooky story times I have to do it October paranormal

and like sweet stuff and there is a savories heavy with like pizza and a little sub sandwiches like this this felt like this didn't feel like on my age group type of party this felt like somebody's mother loves a child and like really organized this [ __ ] to make sure everything was perfect okay like you know back in the day when you're a child and your mom like hosts your your your birthday party and you got the ice cream you don't listen I know y'all all had this experience when it was your birthday or you had a birthday party and you have those ice cream where half of this vanilla the middle is strawberry and the rest is chocolate that decides chocolate that's what it felt like like it was just bringing back memories I was in a stall gym I don't say guys like this is well organized love the well organized events I'm here now y'all know I'm not into sweets y'all know I do not like sweet stuff the only exception to sweet things that I like are anything sweet with coconut in it and gummy bears that's the only sweet things a key and cheesecake I like me some cheesecake as long as it's plain and there's nothing on top of it I can eat that too so me a lot not walking down you know it's awkward because you don't know nobody there but there are people there who are coming up to me like oh hey like watch a [ __ ] like oh hey girl what's up you know so I'm feeling more comfortable because I know I'm like a little bit some of my subscribers here you know some of my subscribers are here like if I'm you to conversate gala there you got my back you gotta say with me and y'all already know I'm awkward so it won't be awkward cuz I already know I'm like words you know I'm sayin so I got a little bit more comfortable you know the social anxiety was fading away or whatever that's one thing for sure whatever I go somewhere even if it's my friend's place I never know if I'm gonna run into you guys because my friends don't know if y'all watching you're not so that's always a surprise to me I like that but anywho I'm sitting out with one girl we're talking with chatted up whatever and Lila on this side Lana's like I'm gonna go up and get something to eat I'm like [ __ ] I'm hungry too like let's both go and this is where y'all got me for real again I don't like sweets so why the hell would I be over at the sweets bar for what reason why would why my there for what so I went over to the savory bar and I got me a sub y'all gonna start with some Mila sunny cheese I'm les at the bad girl Tomatoes up an event I had that ain't no luck it was delicious and then I hear somebody at the party say aren't these gummy bears rose' gummy bears jumping on the alcoholic so I was like rosy gummy bears I'm in that I'm in there like swimwear okay I took a little Bowl and I filled my [ __ ] up with so many gummy bears yo hello before I start eating the gummy bears I hear boom quick we say bon Qui Qui is the one who's hosting a party for a boyfriend I have one quickly saying by the way guys be careful because the brownies on the sweet side they have THC in it if you don't know what THC is then you know what have gone with this okay a [ __ ] like me I like brownies okay only grandma me I like is Cameron so obviously I am go you know no brownies I'm not about to you know magic brownies and get high in this [ __ ] no I'm not now I don't know if someone said up warning about anything else okay but I've been hearing I didn't hear nobody say nothing about no warning about anything else on the sweet or savory side I mean I just heard that the brownies have teeth seeing them so I'm like I will not touch the brownies because I'm not trying to get stoned okay so I got the gummy bears in my hand and I'm eating it and it's not a regular gummy bear like it don't taste like a regular gummy bear it's a little bit softer almost it's almost like uh you you bite it and then it melts like it doesn't taste like a gummy bear like from the store it's like it feels like it was made in someone's house like it had a little bit of a salt not a salty but like uh I'm grainy texture to it like someone didn't mix it up properly or something like that either way it was delicious it was delicious okay it tastes like Rosie I had that alcoholic taste to it wet light a hint a strawberry and then at the very end of tasting this gummy bear you taste this like this earth be like ground tastes at the end of it which I was like at first but after a while I'm like no but the Roseate part of the strawberry part like that those days amazing like I'm I'm down with these gummy bears this is amazing they're they're good [ __ ] I was sitting down eating these gummy bears like one quick way walks back so listen it both weekly walks by and she's like hold on Paris I said yeah this [ __ ] bon Qui Qui looked at me with the most fear in her eyes the most fear I've ever seen in someone's eyes in a very long time she looked at me and she said girl there's tapes team the gummies to THC like these all weed gummy bears as we do this well I made them they made them right because I don't feel nothing I got these are this is amazing though was like you know a round of applause whoever made them but input enough we Deniz because a [ __ ] Shanghai when I tell y'all I do not remember ball at all what happened within the next two hours I don't know boy we go fast for it to like who I was now [ __ ] I just remember feeling a hot I remember sweating I remember feeling tired I remember feeling I didn't feel sick but I saw way too relaxed I felt like I had no bones in my body I felt like my I just I'll be honest job I felt like my booty was floating inside my body it was it was very uncomfortable I know who's going on Lookout my hug that boy what you can't be going on real that would it all because I need you down to help every single touch I was feeling on my arm it felt like if I touch my arm right here I felt it in my neck you know I say if someone had touched my toes I felt it in my knees I was like what is this feeling I know one thing I remember more than anything is everything was in slow motion I'm talking about everyone walking in the room was walking like this in my hand I'm gonna hurry up that wall play there was no reason for y'all to be walking that slow I am a human Lala talking to me in my ear and me being like in my head I was not saying nothing out loud but in my head I'm just like [ __ ] you're not even making sense I cannot even make out what you're saying because you talking way too slow like you're talking mad slow the music is mad so why is the music so slow why is Drake singing likes one of the girls who told me that she watched my video came to sound beside me and she's like are you okay and I'm like you took way too long to say that like you were sitting down here for 15 minutes before you said that and for you to finish that sentence are you okay took you another six minutes to say like what is going on so one quickly comes back around now but quickly is like you're I told you I've had these gummies before you can only have like two you're nice from - I'm gonna be honest I ain't maybe [ __ ] almost a half of the ball so I understand at least at least fifteen it's not more their reasonable size gummi bears they're like this big you know what I'm saying so now digging in my head for some reason I don't know what it is but for some reason I was in my head saying I can't breathe in my head I'm like I can't breathe I don't know how to breathe like breathing is not an option but [ __ ] I could breathe there was nothing wrong with my breathing so after I said in my head I can't breathe like a panic attack in the Sun so I thought that maybe I was allergic to something in the gummy bear and my throat was closing up yes but it wasn't but I guess because I was stoned I felt like I was gonna die so I ran out to the balcony I grabbed not like oh I gotta come to LA I took some gummi bears - but she never as much as me I bet she had like one or two and she liked it I liked it okay but she was good like what a whole night she said she didn't feel nothing at all anyway so I grabbed Blanco we go on the balcony and I'm like trying to breathe as a bunch of fresh oxygen as I can but [ __ ] really the Tyrande the oxygen is polluted so now I'm feeling like the pollution in the air is going into my lungs and I'm getting secondhand pollution like sickness or some [ __ ] my heart beats I'm okay bone quickly comes out on the property with us and she's like girl just sit down relax I take a nap or something you know I'm saying because there's no way for you to get rid of this hi this hat won't be with you for a while you just gotta try and sleep it off a [ __ ] like me I'll sleep but no parties but I'm the like the party I am the life of the party what are you talking about ain't no way I'm gonna be sleeping everybody having fun not gonna have fun too high or not I could be high drug and constipated I still want a party something like nama be good I would be good you like five minutes I see the breathing this pooed in air maybe I'll feel better in a second so I'm outside breathing in as much oxygen pollution as I can I start to calm down you know my heart rates going down a little bit but I'm getting higher I'm seeing that the I'm walking and I feel like I don't have feet I feel like feet what it's feet like I don't have a football game I don't have a bottom on my foot because I can't feel nothing I could have stepped on glass I could have stepped on a nail I could've stepped on a night I wouldn't have felt it because I didn't feel nothing at all I remember hitting my shoulder on the balcony door before I went to go sit down again and I didn't feel [ __ ] but I woke up the

said I have no clue what this guy said to me at all I don't know all I remember is nodding my head and the reason why I don't know what he was saying is because number one I was high as [ __ ] so I really thought that he was talking to too slow but he was talking normally number two I could have stopped staring at this [ __ ] mouth because because there was like a line of spit that just would not cut like it wouldn't go away like he didn't open his mouth wide enough for it to snap and go back down so I'm just looking at the spit on his lip like you know what I mean he finished rocking and

these are pomegranate gummies THC CBD hybrid enhanced not for kids not for anybody under 21 so they kind of come hard to open obviously they're childproof so you got to squeeze the sides here and pop it open and then you get to see the edibles here they look like candy and you know you could probably just take half of one or maybe a whole one but that's what they look like they smell kind of like a pomegranate they smell very fruity so ya pick these up at Planet thirteen here in Vegas and don't forget to subscribe to the channel for more product info thanks", "vjKKFeBvBuU": "hey my name is vero i am vendor educator for item 9 labs i've been getting lots of questions lots of emails about delta 8 and i thought instead of responding to them all individually i'll just create a 5 minute video talking about everything delta 8 hopefully this answers all of your questions and then some so first of all let's get right into it what is delta nine i assure you that you do know delta nine also known as delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol is thc thc that cannabinoid responsible for the psychoactive effect of cannabis so what is delta 8 well delta 8 is another of the 150 cannabinoids found inside of the plant it is native to the cannabis flower but it is made in fractions of a percentage it is not as abundant as delta 9 thc when you look at the molecular structure of delta 8 and delta 9 you will see that they are very very similar however when you consume them you realize that they're different for one thing delta 8 has a much lower psychotropic potency than delta 9. now notice i did not say it's not psychoactive when you give this to a patient it is very likely that they will feel a change it will feel an effect so we like to say that delta h has its own unique feeling it feels like what delta eight feels like it's hard to compare it to delta nine but patients wanna know what does it feel like so how can we describe that feeling of delta eight this is how i talk about it when i consume delta 8 i feel clear-headed i am lucid thinking i can concentrate i am focused and in the sound i am not foggy i don't have any paranoid thoughts i'm not impaired however i still have that general feeling of wellness that i have when i use cannabis i feel calm at peace content i might feel it from the ice down depending on how much of it i take but i just have all the benefits without that mental impairments right so who likes delta eight when i worked at the shop i remember golfers love delta aids cyclists hikers caregivers people who need to be productive for part of their day which is a lot of people it's important to realize that people who like delta 9 and people who like delta 8 can be the same person the what your patient is looking for on a friday night is not necessarily the same thing he or she is looking for on a wednesday morning to get ready for finals or to get ready for work so it's really a great tool for everybody's belt what are some of the medicinal benefits that you may experience when you use delta eight for one thing you may feel a release intention and anxiety it could be a sleep aid it could even protect your brain cells but one thing i hear overwhelmingly from butt tenders and patients alike is that it is great for nausea anytime you hear a patient talk about nausea not being able to eat think delta eight grab that delta eight for that you could be changing somebody's quality of life i'm not gonna get into it here but i really encourage you to check out a study from hebrew university in jerusalem israel where they studied the effects of delta 8 on pediatric patients who were suffering from the side effects of chemotherapy now let's talk about the item 9 labs delta 8 line we have cartridges and capsules the capsules are 14 milligrams and they come in a pack of 10 so that's 140 milligrams of delta 8. the cartridges come in c cell half gram or 500 milligram cartridges they're about 80 to 85 percent delta eight thc and they come in a wide variety of flavors we just released three new flavors that's cool breeze strawberry fields and lychee lychee is my favorite but they're all really really great these are complex flavors that taste really well you don't get tired of them they don't make they're not like overly sweet they have a lot of depth to them i'm really impressed with them if you have tried delta a talk about it with your peers um remember just really remember delta eight and nausea that is such an important thing all right well that's all i'm close to the five minutes so i'm gonna leave it at that keep sending me your emails keep sending me your questions i will post my email at the end of this video you guys have a great day okay bye bye", "t2Pd-13M20g": "- I'm cosplaying as a gummy bear! (beep) (classical music) All right friends, Halloween is just around the corner and I have some issues with Halloween. First and foremost, a lot of gummy candies, which is like my favorite thing, are not vegan! I still think it's weird that strangers are giving out candy to children. So, (laughs) I wanted to see if I could make my own vegan version of gummy bears at home. Flip It is a series on my\nchannel where I take one thing, and make it into the vegan thing. So I'm going to take gummy bears today, substitute out the gelatin, which is not vegan, and substitute in agar agar, which is. (claps) So let's see if we\ncan make vegan gummy bears. (whirring) (pouring) (mellow electronic music) All right, what is agar agar you may ask? It is a seaweed or an algae. It has a little bit of a taste, but not much, it's very mild. But it acts the same way\ngelatin does, almost 100%. The only real difference is that it doesn't quite get as hard\nas traditional gummy bears, which is fine, they're just gummies that\nare a little bit softer. We are going to naturally sweeten them and also naturally color them. We're going to make a blue-purple color, we're going to make an\norange flavor and color, and we're going to make green ones. And I'm going to use\nspinach to turn it green. I'm going to use an\norange to make it orange; and taste like orange. And I'm going to use\nblueberries to make them purple. If you guys are new here, I'm Candace the Edgy Veg, and you should hit that subscribe button 'cause I make new videos every single Tuesdays and Thursdays. And if you like this series, give this video a big thumbs up 'cause you know it's gonna rock! Also appropriate that this\nis my Halloween video, that I have a new hair color. Oh, if you guys want to know where to get these\nlittle gummy bear molds, and then I not only have gummy bear molds, but also little bears and little robots and little dinosaurs. I'll leave a link to the\nAmazon thing that I used, just in the description box. Well, this comes with a dropper. All right, to make these\nas super, super simple, depending on the flavor\ncombinations that you want, and the color combinations that you want, really the possibilities are endless. What I like to use is just apple juice. It has a pretty neutral flavor. But you can use any sort of\njuice that's your favorite to achieve different flavors. Another think that I am going to do is just color them naturally as well, by blending different ingredients to get the color that I want. So if you want like red, you can use beets. If you want purple, you can use blueberries. So all I'm going to do is\ntake the apple juice... You could also do this if you want cocktail gummy bears. You can do this with wine as well. I've done ros\u00e9 ones, they're so good. But you just wanna blend whatever\nyou're using for the color together with your liquid. So whether it's water, whether it's apple juice, orange juice, wine, blend that together in a blender and add it to a small sauce pan. Bring that liquid to a simmer and add in your agar agar and give it a good whisk. Now you can taste it here\nto see if it's sweet enough. If you want to add extra sweetness, add some agave in there\nuntil it's dissolved. This will also make it\na little bit chewier, making it closer to the texture\nof traditional gummy bears. I find between maple syrup, agave, and regular sugar, the regular sugar sets the most naturally. It does get a little bit chewier than the agave or the maple syrup. I opted out of maple syrup just because you're always\ngoing to have that maple taste. Sugar and agave are a bit more neutral. All right, so I brought these to a simmer and then let them simmer\nwhile stirring constantly for about three minutes. And now I'm going to take\nmy little eye dropper and fill in my bears, my gummy bears. These are like little piggies. I thought they were\npiggies when I bought them, but they're little panda bears, gummy bears and robots. So the green is looking a\nlittle darker than I would like. I would prefer it to be more vibrant. I think you could probably mix in a little bit of spirulina but I just picked something that was more neutral like spinach, spirulina does have a taste. But the cooking and oxidization\ndefinitely made it brown. So I'm just going to take my dropper and then fill in the little molds. (mellow electronic music) All right, so I'm sticking\nthem into the fridge. I popped up a couple just to test them. I have some here, some up here. My freezer's pretty full, so I also stuck some in the fridge, but I'm going to let them set. Now a lot of websites\nsay just 10-15 minutes. I'm gonna leave it for a\ncouple hours and come back. (classical music) All right, I've popped\na couple of them out. Look at that little guy. A little teddy bear. I mean obviously this\nis a tiny little mold, but you can get bigger ones. Like I said before, the texture is different\nthan a gummy bear, it doesn't have that\nsqueaky gummy chewiness, it's a little bit softer. But they're really tasty. I was thinking, if you wanted to do sour versions, you could probably add\nsome Vitamin C powder or citric acid powder, which is just Vitamin C, and then you get that tang.

wanted to go over the street value versus dispensary value of some of these edibles here these edibles they are selling for about forty five dollars in the dispensary over by the Cape forty five dollars for 100 milligrams street value you can get them for about ten to fifteen dollars sometimes up to twenty definitely less than forty I've seen these go for as much as twenty as low as ten hundred milligrams there's a lot of them to a pack this one only has one left but there's a lot of these to the pack usually about fifteen not that strong the watermelon blasts over here the sour watermelons they're about 100 milligrams as well same thing ten to 12 ten to twenty bucks sometimes maybe a little more there's only about ten of these in a pack same thing missing a little bit when we bought ten of these in a pack and yeah street value of ten to twenty five ten to twenty what elbow but these are much want I don't know that are stronger two of these will have you feeling alright one if you're drinking if you don't do this stuff often I'll have you feeling good and then the CBD CBD can take you now from the THC high you can also help reduce anxiety and these things here I got from the amazing porn store down the street twenty five dollars for this pack he they're 100 milligrams it was five frogs in here 20 bucks twenty for whatever after-tax 22 I don't know 20 bucks 100 milligrams twenty bucks is cheapest ten bucks for one hundred milligrams as well you can pick these up almost anywhere Amazon that Bethany on your gas station pretty much anyway same price or similar pricing fifteen to twenty five so all around not a bad product what if you're going to dispensary for this expect the payable forty-five dollars", "X4O60iQXJho": "[Music] 500 milligram lead cereal bars for 12 bucks 300 milligrams of bags of chips for 10 400 milligram breakfast cereals we breakfast cereals for $11 and not only that but all the products are pretty tasty too this is just a small sampling of the great value you can expect from lol edibles and nearly ubiquitous edible manufacturer here in Southern California sounds too good to be true right well that's because it is welcome to wheats everyone the marijuana edible review show where we do our damndest to help you make sense of your dispensary this is a show where we try to save you from throwing away your hard-earned money on dud ass edibles and speaking of gun ass edibles today we're going to take a deeper look at LOL edibles where LOL presumably stands for lies on lies we have reviewed a variety of LOL products on wheats and so far have found them to be all greatly exaggerating their potency LOL edibles conveniently does not have an independent tasting testing laboratory rate their product or if they do they do not display it anywhere on their products packaging or on its the website without an independent testing body there are seemingly free to make up whatever dosage they want to put on their packaging and while I certainly cannot prove at this time they are exaggerating their potency my extensive experience with high potency edibles leads me to believe that they are full of [ __ ] so one of the cardinal rules of edibles is you get what you pay for with a few exceptions and we pay $10 for an edible that claims to have 400 milligrams of THC unless you see that independent laboratory verifying those results I would be pretty skeptical of that claim and lol edibles is the king of these shitty shenanigans an another tip-off that they may be less than honest is the taste of their products they usually print is pretty great but a 500 milligram edible should taste at least a little terrible these don't why well most likely because they're lying about how much THC is actually in the product let's compare them to say a 500 milligram kuroh an\u00edbal the kirova product will likely cost and double the lol edible or more and it will taste far Wars and while this might sound weird to say that's very much a good thing two hours after eating an lol a 500 milligram lol edible I'm stone-cold sober like a lifetime lifetime teetotaler but two hours after a 500 milligram Korova edible and I'm [ __ ] over the moon and probably under my covers passed out asleep so let's go back and talk about their website again it's [ __ ] laughable and that's four tabs products about contact and order there order tab seems to it seemed seems to be in good working condition which makes sense because I see this [ __ ] everywhere everything else on their website though god damn what a [ __ ] show the products tab only Keynes contains a small sliver of their products and the pictures look like they were taken on a crusty iphone 3gs by some bored seven-year-old the contact tab of course doesn't do a goddamn thing it's a completely dead link no way to contact them on their contact me tab my guess never worked they don't really want you to contact them they know you're pissed at them why don't they want to hear from you and actually if you really really really do want to get ahold of them just look at the bottom of their page and there's a link to their email and Instagram so you can contact them there psyche those are dead links too they just want you to think that they're able to be contacted but they don't really want you to know they're your feedback because they know they [ __ ] you they know that they're lying to you and they know that you're pissed they don't want to hear from you and finally let's talk about that about page that shows up on their website here's what it says on I quote the medical cannabis industry needed a well respected brand of edibles that patients can rely on for quality and reliability while tasting great lol edibles aims to take the industry by storm by providing great customer service and amazing products you can find LOL edibles throughout the Los Angeles Orange County and San Diego regions at fine reputable medical dispensaries ask your dispensary for LOL edibles today what a load of [ __ ] horseshit let's take that sentence-by-sentence here so I agree that the medical cannabis industry needs a well respected brand but lol edibles sure as [ __ ] ain't it they have the audacity to say that patients can rely on their quality and reliability they also brag about their customer service you know the one you can't actually reach out to or get in contact with them in any way shape or form so guys ask your dispensary the opposite ask them to stop selling these products tell them they are inadvertently ripping off their customers or maybe intentionally ripping off their customers I don't know the only true thing about that sentence or excuse me about that about page is that you can find them throughout LA and Orange counties as unfortunate as that is so I've tried the majority of the Ella Buhl's products but not all I will confess I've never tried their boob cubes or G bars but you know what at this point I never will and I don't care if they're actually good these guys have taken enough money from the pocket of consumers wheats will never review any of their products again their name is lol edibles but the only one are laughs the only ones laughing are them and they're laughing all the way to the bank let me just be totally here to click totally totally clear here to wrap up do not buy any lol edibles products do not let your friends buy their [ __ ] tell your dispensary not to carry this [ __ ] garbage leave them a negative review on weed maps and let's all work together to put these scumbags out of business

result let's\nget into it hey what's up welcome back to The Aspie \nWorld I'm down for all of you guys who don't know me I love to read comments I\nread and reply to every single comment you guys make so if you have tried CBD\ngummies before if you try CBD products before or know anything about this\nsubject I'd love to know please put it in a comment in the comment section\nbelow and give me a cheeky follow on Instagram so in this video we're gonna\nbe covering what is CBD what is CBD used for why make CBD into gummies how\nmuch CBD are actually in these gummies we're gonna look at the smell taste and\ntexture of these specific ones I'm reviewing today also I'll be assessing\nwhat effect they had on me do I prefer them to like CBD oils and how can you\nget your hands on some of these okay so this is the main event this is the CBD\ngummies they are a greenish grape flavoured gummy which is comes in a\npack of 60 but you take one a day so you got roughly about two months in this\nspecific pack I found them very very interesting the box is awesome I love\nthe color of these and I love the packaging I just love really neat I just\nlove really neat packaging look at this I just Oh God so good I love it okay so\nwhat is CBD? let's get into before we look at the details in the raw kind of\nurgh let's talk about CBD what is it so CBD is a cannabidoil  but it doesn't have\nthe psychoactivity that THC has coming from the marijuana plant so CBD is\nhigher in the indica  plant I hope I'm pronouncing this right part of the of\nthe cannabis plant because I think there's male and female cannabis plants\nso the indica don't which one it is but so indica is high in CBD so they use\nthe indica plant to take the CBD out which is how they\nmake things like these gummies and the oils and like creams and stuff like that\nand the cool thing about it is that it has no psychoactivity which is\nmore normally associated with cannabis and marijuana so this is why CBD is\nlegal in most countries it's legal here in the UK now it has been for a couple\nof years and I know it's legal in that most of the USA and part of you know\nEurope and things like that I'm not sure if it's legal everywhere in the world I\nknow that Australia are having an issue with it even CBD oils so I'm just kind\nof lucky that we live in a in a country where this is actually legally allowed\nso what is a CBD used for and that's a great question a lot of people use CBD\nfor things like aches and pains it's it's an anti-cancer supplement as well\nlook I don't know the science behind the specifics of it but they do use it a lot\nof people use it for you know like a cancer prevention thing just like eating\nhealthy and things I got like a food supplement it's also used a lot for\nthings like arthritis and fibromyalgia being on the autism spectrum I know that\nfibromyalgia is very common within females on the autism spectrum\nso CBD oils are used a lot there to help with that but one of the main things\nthat it's used for and one of the things I've used CBD for is anxiety now having\nAsperger's syndrome it comes with a whole host of crazy stuff and one of the\nthings is extremely exciting anxiety about kind of all kinds of crazy stuff I\nget anxiety social anxiety daily anxiety anxiety the postman poster through the\ndoor and that if people phone to me picture my phone thing like oh my\ngoodness you know like you know all this stuff really really freaks me out so I\ntake CBD to try and feel a little less anxious and more relaxed in my day and\nI've been using the CBD oil but I found that I have to take it as and when I'm\nfeeling anxious rather than a daily supplement because it tastes really\nnasty and the oil is kind of it's a bit it's a bit potent when you put it in\nyour mouth so that begs the question is why make it gummies now the reason\npeople made CBD gummies is because again the oil tastes a bit nasty and you've\ngot to take like a quite big dab on your tongue and you know the the oil tastes a\nbit rubbish the oil is very very expensive and this is\nnot fun you know you don't get there davon oil and tabacky or your throat and\nespecially say you're out and about you're traveling or you travel for work\nand you you're using as a pain relief you don't be like opening this like\npipette in the middle of the office meeting just like dabbing in some oil so\nI would say that the reason CVD always existed because it's a more convenient\nway to take it and like it doesn't like sweets or candy if you're American you\nknow like sweets are just great you know you just like punk hey I can give me\nanyway you've been laying in the park be like hey man what's going on I'm having\na great day in the pack sunshine and a feeling about anxious clunk let's take\none of these TVD gummies I'm feeling pretty fly and that to me is way worth\nit because before I knew that they made gummies I was always kind of like oh\nI'll try mix it in with tea so I used to drop the pipette in sysm tea and drink\nwith teas to get rid of the nasty taste and then I'd kind of like put it into\nall all kinds of stuff to put into food you know if you don't like a yogurt or\nsomething or smoothie but you know it wasn't as effective sticking and on the\nin orally directly into your mouth rather than mix it in with something\nelse but when the goes-- were released I thought what a great idea and the lovely\npeople are yummy nutrition actually sent me these to try I've worked on them\nbefore and I did a video on melatonin does melatonin help people with autism\nsleep I will leave a link for that up in the description above here so you guys\ncan check that out as well but this company is really really nice that these\nare all like this is a vegan product as well which I really really like and this\nis the product we are talking about today so these are the yummy nutrition recover\nand destress a CVD 16 gummies food supplement take one a day these are\ngreat flavor and it sounds you in a back here what it's got in it so it's got a\nbit of vitamin E vitamin C and the cannabis kind of at all which is a CBD\nhas 10 milligrams per serving one serving is one CBD gummy so let's let's\nget them or another look they smell phenomenal these things smell\namazing so this is well this is what they look like um these are just like\nthese the little green kind of gummy sweets you know there's nothing amazing\nabout the look of them I know a lot of people kind of make see me to gummy\nbears and gummi whatever but little gummies like these these things so these\nare really cool and a bit more grown-up as well you know you take it like a box\nof best weed still like your meeting again you look kind of a little bit\nchildish maybe I don't know but I just feel like this is way more like\nprofessional slick unlike grown-up and stuff like that they smell amazing the\ntexture it's really really gummy like this in capacitors just like a normal\nsweet that you'd buy like any other sweet the smell is really really great P\nand I really like it Anna yeah so it's really chewy it's full of\nflavor and this is something I noticed when I did the the video with the\nmelatonin gummies they were strawberry flavor and they absolutely tasted\nexactly like strawberry these are such a good flavor so this is the CBD gummy pack as you can\nsee there it's got all information on the front and then it has all the\nnutritional information on the back and you can also reach out to the company on\nsocial media they're really really cool and I tweet them all time on Instagram\nthem and stuff like that so please check them out on social media is all because\nthey're super super awesome if you're interested I did a video on the CBD oil\nfor Asperger's syndrome and autism and I'll leave that in a cat above as well\nif you want to go and check that out because it's obviously related to CBD\ngoes-- to the CBD oil so I thought you might actually want to check out ok so\nnow we've gone over the idea the ideologies the taste of smells the\ntextures the type of sweets these our type of comas these are\nwhat fact did they have on me so like i said i have been using CBD oil for about\na year and i used to take it daily but the taste was so nasty that i used to\ntake it like every other day and then obviously now i just take it as and when\ni'm feeling anxious and it takes a little while to get into your system and\nthen it you know it takes a while for it to kind of just kick in and it's it's\nannoying that i can't just take it in the morning but it's nice to have it\nthere as backup now i've been taking these i k told you\nthis is the fifth day taking these the CBD gummies and i gotta tell you that it\nis the best like relaxer I guess I've had ever so when you when you don't when\nI don't take the CBD I feel kind of like on edge a bit like I've tie in a bit\nworried and anything can trigger me at any one time but when I take the CBD\ngummies it kind of just chills me a little bit more than usual but it also\nmakes me not like stress out about the the smaller things that would really\ntake me off here in a day but like the small things that would take me off tuna\ntoday it doesn't trigger those things but something I will make you aware of\nit's not a cure for anxiety or a cure for being stressed what it does is it\ngets rid of most of it yeah so with autism there are gonna be things\nthat are going to trigger you and cause meltdowns but this will eliminate I\nthink I would say good 80 to 90 percent of it I have to tell you that these are\nthe best things I've ever seen I was so excited when I seen these\nsweets so I reached out to company and said hey look I'd love to do a video on\nthem and they were kind enough to send me this bottle of of them which is which\nis absolutely amazing and yeah I find that taking them in gummy Pharma is when\naccident taking of an oil former and so to me yeah the effects yeah it\ndefinitely helps was like aches and pains I still wake up with like really\nnumb hands and my my feet and hands ache a lot but now having the CBD gummies I\nactually haven't had those aches since taking them because I'm taking them\nduring the day every day and it's been like consistently not for five days so\nI'm feeling pretty awesome when I wake up and I'm feeling super more children\nlaughs and this make me a bit more productive with my work and things like\nthat I'm doing for YouTube so while the side effects of CBD\nthat aren't really any side effects and CVD a lot of people say that it can make\nyou a bit more drowsy bit more sleepy and I've experienced that with CVD but\nonly when I'm already feeling a bit tired during the day it's kind of like\nif you're feeling a bit tired and then you take like a sleepy tea or some more\nmilk you're gonna feel way more chilled and way more tired because it's making\nyou bit more sleepy so CBD is kind of like that if you're feeling really tired\nanyway and you take some CBD there's a potential like you could feel a little\nbit more sleepy I'm not like dangerously sleepy you're not gonna fall asleep in\nyour desk alright the wee little car but I'm just saying that like you know that\nit could be a side effect it's not really a side effect\nso do I prefer CBD gummies to CBD oil yes 100% and I think I'm going to get a\nsubscription with this company to actually have CVD gummies every two\nmonths get a bottle of these and just this is this is awesome I love it I\ncan't believe how good this is I just awesome so if you don't know where to\nget your hands on your very own tub of CBD gummies like this I will leave a\nlink in the description below so I will leave all the links for that in the\ndescription below so you can get your hands on these very CBD gummies if\nyou're really interested in it I'm pretty sure these guys ship worldwide\nbut don't hold me to it make sure you check out the website\nfirst and all the small print but yeah awesome I highly highly recommend these\nand I highly recommend the company they're a manchester-based UK company\nthat make fantastic supplements peace", "-peOJy88-C0": "hey what's up YouTube I'm heading on a trip in for about ten days and I like to show all the marijuana related products I'll be taking with me to consume on my adventures at the back here you can see I've got two ounces one purple punch another one of Girl Scout cookies the left is the purple punch the other one is the Girl Scout cookies I got a couple grams a master cush super potent I forget what we got here right here we got White Widow and here we have blueberry Kush so all on total that's maybe close to three and a half ounces roughly so I'll be taking all that what I'll be doing with the two ounces is rolling them up ahead of time and I'll show you with what so when I roll them up ahead of time I will hold some of them with distillate which will be gone before my trip but I'll use it to coat all the papers and I will add hash here's a grandma hash so I'll crumble that up and I'll also add that to my joints that I will roll with that stuff this I will be taking as is and if I when it comes down to it I'll roll it but I shouldn't have to being that I roll the whole bunch with the stuff in the back and I'm also taking five pre roll one gram black tuna joints another one gram shatter infused black tuna that's also a ground so that's as far as the smokeable that's what I'll be taking just still it will go towards covering the papers the hash will go in the joints with the weed so as far as edibles go I'll be taking this beauty which is flat as could be I've had it for a while but it's two giant sour gummy bears and those are I think a hundred milligrams apiece and also take with me seven bags of just assorted gummies each pack is a bunch different flavors in it or whatever but each one of these bags is 225 milligrams so seven of those so yeah that's ten days worth I likely will have a little bit of the stuff in these containers left but all the rest of this will be long gone so and that's that's pretty much it so in the comment section below tell me is that excessive is is that a dream come true for you how much would you smoke or consume in a 10 day period yeah put it down below hit subscribe I'm likely to have a few adventures with these edibles and they'll be visiting an amusement park and yeah so it should turn out to have something to put on YouTube at least at the end of it all so look out for that and yeah we will see you soon take it easy", "5-gIY7HuJNo": "they honestly turned out so good and I'm also going to show you guys how to make a coating on them that's like sour and fizzy kind of like on like the root beer ones you can buy at the store so these are actually like legitimate gummy bears instead of just like Harding jello like a lot of recipes have let me just show you them so you can see the texture of this is like really sticky this is what's making your gummy bears actually be like real store-bought guy bears and not just jello so here's the texture of the gummy make sure when it's still warm so you can really see that string yes this is just like candy nothing like just hard jello that you see recipes for so you know this is gonna be a good one so chewy just like the ones you buy in the store like they're so stretchy just like a gummy bear and like they're fizzy when you eat them so good hey guys welcome back today I'm going to show you how to make Mountain Dew soda bottle gummies I'm going to be using coconut oil to infuse mine but you can use butter or a tincture all three of those options will work for this recipe you're going to need some soda you don't have to use Mountain Dew you can use whatever flavor you like you'll need some jello I chose line because it's the closest to Magic Mountain Dew without like over powering and I'm do flavour some gelatin citric acid corn syrup lecithin potassium sorbate mixture which will keep your products shelf stable so you don't have to put it in the fridge you can just keep it in a drawer or in your car or whoever and I'll post the link for how to make this and some coconut oil you can also use butter or a teacher I actually would prefer to use a tincture for this but I don't have any right now so I'm just going to use coconut oil I made them last night and they turned out really well with the coconut oil I feel like you can taste the coconut oil flavor a little bit more than if you were to use like a tincture but whatever you would like to choose you can use because I made quite a bit yesterday for this recipe I'm going to do a smaller amount in the description box below I'll put the measurements for what I'm doing today but you can make whatever amount you like just multiply the recipe I have it below to make this recipe we're going to have to reduce our soda so that we can get the flavor without too much liquid we need half a cup of soda and then we're going to reduce it to a quarter cup alright we have half a cup here we're going to put on a stove on high and we're going to move let this cook for however long tanks to do half of the mixture so I'm just kind of going to have to eyeball it and see where it is and when it looks like it's a little bit lower I'll pour back my measuring cup and see where I'm at so we started with half a cup so we wanted to be 1/4 cup this will probably take about like 15 minutes now that we have our soda on the stove reducing we're going to prepare our gelatin so we're going to put 1/4 of a cup of our soda into a why dish dish so 1/4 cup and we'll just pour it into a dish and then we're going to put our gelatin on we need one and a half tablespoons of gelatin alright so we put 1/4 cup of soda into this bowl and then we're going to sprinkle a tablespoon and a half of gelatin on top so we're just going to sprinkle it lightly over so we can get as much much coverage as possible so that's one tablespoon and then we're going to do half tablespoon for a total of one and a half tablespoons then we're going to add 1/4 to 1/2 of a jello of flavored jello pack so yesterday I made these with more regular gelatin and no jello pack I need these ones here and while he turned out good I felt like the flavor wasn't strong enough and it needed like a little bit more flavor so I thought this time around I would add a little bit of jello so it can be anywhere between a quarter and a half of this depending on how much flavor you think you want so you can always take this out and measure it but I can just eyeball it we're going to sprinkle this on top so it may be like a third of it and then we're just gonna leave this we're not gonna stir it in we're not gonna do anything with it we're just going to leave it here and by the time you get back around to it most of the gelatin will have absorbed absorbed into the soda now we're going to add an a quarter of a teaspoon of this potassium sorbate mixture again I'll put a link down below this is gonna help it so you don't have to keep it in the fridge you can keep this outside in the fridge it's just like regular got me to buy from a store and then we're going to do a quarter teaspoon of citric acid the citric acid is not necessary it's just if you like them a little bit more sour if you don't have citric acid you could crush up vitamin C tablets and those who work as well so we're doing one quarter teaspoon and then we're gonna add in a teaspoon of lecithin I only have the pill capsules cuz that's what was cheaper for me to buy but if you can buy the liquid kind it would be a lot easier because it'll save you from having to bust these open now my coconut oil already has less of shin in it so I'm not going to add too much this mixture but if your coconut oil doesn't have less its it lecithin in it then you might want to add a little bit more of this so I'm just gonna do one for mine if I had the liquid kind I could just pour oh I probably would just do a quarter teaspoon so this is gonna help bind the coconut oil together with the gelatin liquid mixture so that our coconut oil doesn't separate from everything else and like I said I have more of this already in my coconut oil so I don't need too much in here but if you don't have any in your coconut oil you're going to want to add a bit more to your jello mixture and I barely even got out any with the pills really actually just by the liquid all right now let's check in on our soda we started with half a cup and you need to reduce it to a quarter cup so I'm just going to pour it directly right back into my measuring cup and see we're at all right looks like we're exactly a quarter cup which means I probably should have checked on this sooner that way I couldn't have reduced it too much but if you do end up reducing you too much just throw it away and do it again soda can always be replaced all right so I'm just going to pour my reduced quarter cup of soda back into the pot and then I'm going to add a quarter cup of corn syrup now this is the most important thing for your gummies to be like a real store-bought gummy so corn syrup helps but will helps the most is having the sugar heat it to a high enough temperature to get it almost to the softball stage so I'm gonna use a candy thermometer for that I know most people aren't going to have one of these but if you are planning on making gummies often I usually just purchasing one they're probably like something like ten dollars and they can be very helpful with making your dimes so I'm trying to put it on here and we're going to try and eat this to 230 degrees Fahrenheit now because you guys most of you guys won't have a candy thermometer I'm going to try and see if I could help you out by just telling you the time so I'm going to turn this on high and I'm going to set a timer on my phone or a stopwatch so I started to now and we'll see what time rats when this is got into 230 degrees Fahrenheit all right so we're four minutes in and we're at 180 degrees Fahrenheit and we're waiting for this to go to 230 degrees Fahrenheit so it looks like it's starting to thicken a tiny bit but it's still pretty much all liquid it will started thinking a bit when it gets closer to 30 now you want to be careful to not go over to 30 that's why having a candy thermometer it's good because if you don't have one you can easily within 30 seconds to a minute go over temperature and then it becomes too hard so while having it to that higher temperature we'll give you that real kind bear consistency if you don't have the candy thermometer just ear on the side of not too long because you don't want to ruin it but luckily this is just sugar and soda so if we wreck this mixture and just throw it away and that's why we add the coconut oil after so that we make sure that this mixture is perfect before we add our coconut oil or a tincture or butter that way we're not risking wasting it all right we're at 210 degrees and it's moving up fast so we got to keep an eye on it now now I'm not gonna leave I'm not gonna leave this unattended I'm just gonna watch it up until the moment it gets to 230 Thunder 8 minutes and we're at to 3000 or at 2:30 so we have to take this off now take that off the heat immediately see how fast that happens holy yeah eight minutes on high heat okay this is getting a little too hot so I'm gonna go hold it by the fridge so it doesn't heat up anymore all right so we see how fast the temperature can go up so if you don't have a candy thermometer be very careful to really not let it get too hot you do want it to get as high as you can safely without your candy thermometer because that is what gives a texture the gummy bears but it is hard to do it with other thermometer so I just took this off the heat and left it for about like five minutes so I can demonstrate to you guys what happens here so you can see the texture of this is like really sticky this is what's making your gummy bears actually be like real store-bought guy bears and not just jello so this is the key out this they're just going to be like hard and jello so that's kind of like what it looks like and this is gonna melt back down when we put it back on the stove and mix in our coconut oil now I'm going to turn the heat on like medium I'm going to add two tablespoons of my coconut oil so have some medium heat and stirring in the coconut oil with the soda and corn syrup mixture that we just brought to 230 degrees now we don't want to add in the coconut oil right after it hits 230 we want to take it off the heat we want to let it cool for a little bit like I would say five minutes is fine because we don't want to be adding the coconut oil for something that's 230 degrees because that's too hot all right we're just stirring this in and you can see that it's not actually combining so there's the oil and there is the corn syrup mixture so we're going to need to get a whisk to combine this a little bit better now we're just going to try and stir like this we don't want ki to be too high medium or medium low is good now we're gonna add in our gelatin mixture which is gonna help bind this okay this is getting too hot you can see so I'm gonna turn the heat down to low just take that off for a minute so don't have that I'm too high I would say medium low will be perfect now we're going to add in our gelatin mixture so clearly I had that too warm I should not be bubbling that much so I know I said to put it on medium heat do not put it on medium do medium low or low okay now we just have to be patient and let it melt a bit more so this is the hardest part is getting this all to combine because the texture of the corn syrup might stay chunky and then it won't mix properly but if we keep it at a low enough heat and mix it in with the whisk we should be able to properly combine it and you do want to make sure you have the lesser thin to help emulsify it so this is going to take a while probably going to take about five minutes with me stirring this all in make sure you're patient and you don't turn up the heat trying to melt this fast because that just won't work out well so just keep it at low or medium low to stir this in and do it slowly and by slowly I don't mean whisking slowly but just take your time you can see the chunks are less stuck together now it's starting to combine now you want to make sure before you do this you have your molds prepared so just lay your molds oh and put them on a tree that way as soon as this is done you can pour them in the difference with this and most of the gumming recipes you see online is that this one has a different texture using that corn syrup and heating it up to that own soft ball point so it does harden really fast it is really sticky so once this is done and we're going to want to put it into the molds as soon as we can so I've been stirring this for close to 5 minutes now and almost everything has combined just a couple chunks left on my whisk so I'm just going to push those out with a spatula she's looking really good you can see it has that stringy texture it's not just like liquidy so it looks like it's just about all mix perfectly - that one little chunk there and this took about ten minutes of slowly stirring incorporating on low heat so now we're going to put this into our molds I'm using one of these to put it into my mold but you can also use the little droppers that works fine I just find that this is easier and if you're making a lot of gummies this is really useful overtime to spend like five dollars or whatever it was now I'm going to turn the heat off and pour this mixture right into my little squeezy container if you're going to use the little dropper you can put this on a hot pad and do it directly here whatever works for you okay now use ones I guess that's just a snack for me so that's alright so here's the texture of the gummy make sure when it's still warm she can really see that string yes this is just like candy nothing like just hard jello that you see recipes for so you know this is gonna be a good one so chewy just like the ones you buy in the store alright so I just wrap a towel around here because it's a little bit hot and it's right off the stove and I'm just going to put these into all of my molds you can also just use any molds going bury molds or find you now let's just put these into the fridge it shouldn't take too long probably about 10 minutes all right now we'll just take them out of the mold they were in the fridge for about 20 minutes you can see how they're kind of different than regular jello gummies like they really have that like that sticky gummy bear texture and that stickiness will go away after they dry out for a bit and we put their coating on you all right so now for coating on them I did in three different ways I did one with sugar coating one with a fizzy coating and then some with no coding so the ones on the top here I was just sugar so I just shook it in a container of sugar and put it back on the tray and then for the fizzy coating it's one third of a cup of sugar one teaspoon citric acid and then I'm going to say 1 teaspoon baking soda but that was too much baking soda so do half a teaspoon baking soda instead so here's that teaspoon of baking soda but like I said we're going to use half a teaspoon not a full teaspoon like I did you could taste it too much and I'm just gonna mix that up quickly once I just shake that up I'm gonna add the gummies into it shake it again and put them back on the tray the one thing I do want to mention with this recipe is you can put them in their sugar or citric acid mixture as soon as they come out of their mold whereas with some of the jello recipes you need them to drive it first these ones you don't need to do that so you can put them on right away in that way you can make sure they really stick whereas if they get too dry they won't the sugar won't stick to the outside of the gummy and if that does happen to you you can just spray them with a little bit of water and just wipe them off so they're a little bit damp and that stickiness comes back and that should work for you quite honestly I kind of enjoyed them with nothing on them the most but I really did enjoy the fizzy sugary coating anyways that's all you guys I hope you enjoyed this video please comment if you try it out and if you did enjoy it please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe I hope you guys have a wonderful day", "DGlNc6tjTT8": "the cannabis edible one of the many glorious ways to consume cannabis they're tasty they're filling and best of all they get you high so you've been thinking about trying a cannabis edible for the first time to see what all the hype is about you should know that eating cannabis edibles to party your relaxed can be a fun and rewarding experience but remember THC does have the ability to intoxicate and should therefore like anything else be used responsibly I have before us the ultimate guide of all you need to know to guarantee an awesome edible experience ladies and gentlemen I give you the puffs puffs posts official guide to edibles I shall start us off with a story that is all too common among so many edible users and me Gwen Gwen wants to try cannabis edibles for the first time and enjoy a healthy dose of THC with her friends tonight she's inedible and eagerly awaits the euphoric effects she waits and waits expecting to feel something at any moment a full hour goes by and still no feeling of a cannabis hi she waits and waits another full hour still nothing by now Gwen is growing impatient and suspects that the edibles she ate just aren't potent enough for her she eats another edible this one should do the trick no more than five minutes go by and suddenly Gwen is hit with a full-frontal TC sensation she is consumed too much and the effects are overwhelming her she spends the rest of what should have been a fun night feeling over intoxicated what went wrong here did the edibles do this - Gwen or an a momentary lapse of preparation did Gwen do this to herself to find out what happened here we need to delve into the rules of edible consumption and examine just how Gwen broke these rules rule 1 know your notes unlike alcohol cannabis THC is a very safe non-toxic substance with no known lethal dose however much like alcohol when somebody ingests more than they can handle there can be some undesirable side effects excess of THC beyond one's threshold can result in a temporary increase of anxiety agitation elevated heart rate or even vomiting one of the biggest mistakes when made right off the bat was eating a cannabis edible without inquiring what the dose was one thing to remember for your first time is to start low and slow with a more manageable 20 milligrams of THC eaten will give you higher than 20 milligrams of TC smoked so you may have to dial your usual dosage back of it most health experts recommend a conservative 5 to 10 milligrams of THC to start you off just because your party animal friend can down cannabis animals like their potato chips and function fine doesn't mean you should immediately follow suit understand that everybody has different limitations when it comes to metabolizing THC the process of knowing your dose is crucial to gauge how much TC you can consume comfortably without erling yourself into a sour experience know your limits stay within it rule to wait just wait there is a difference between smoking and eating cannabis when cannabis is smoked your lungs absorb the cannabis right away and you feel the high instantly but when you eat cannabis it is processed through the liver and may take anywhere between one to two hours to feel the full effects another one of Gwen's many errors was failing to recognize this waiting period she mistook the delayed process of the edible digestion as it being ineffective in doing so she overcompensated by doubling her dose unnecessarily now any negative sensations she feels off the first edible will compound two hours later when she fully digest the second one she what when should have done was relaxed sit back eat Cheetos and let the edible run its full course so if you take an edible and you were waiting to feel for its effects but they never seem to arrive don't worry just wait some more give your body the appropriate amount of time to fully digest the edible and then decide whether or not you want more THC in your system rule 3 know what to expect so you've taken the appropriate dosage that best suits you and you've exercised patience and waiting for the substance to run its course good job the effects kick in the process of liver digestion is much more thorough than lung intake and your body will therefore absorb more properties from the cannabis at best you may feel a very cozy and content feeling or experience a heightened libido and increase sensuality rule 4 there is a time and place for edibles especially if it's your first time try not to drink alcohol while on edibles whose can magnify the effects of THC potentially making the user too hot I also would not recommend driving working or operating machinery after you take them since they can't intoxicate you instead it may be wise to reserved an entire day set aside for them like maybe the weekend or on a date you can just sit back and relax these conditions are optimal because you can feel the effects of an edible six to eight hours after ingesting them so be ready for a long day of fun taking an edible before you go to bed is also an option since the effects can combat insomnia for many people just like baby pictures and recounting your last trip to Las Vegas there is a time and a place for edibles so I hope you learned a thing or two from our guy remember when trying any new substance do your research find out the ideal dose for you educate yourself on what you can expect to feel and know when the best time to consume them is with all that being said I wish you all the best of trips follow these rules and I can guarantee you a safe and fun edible experience every time thank you very much for watching and follow us like us subscribe to us for more news cannabis thank

why I recommend the quarantine shave", "LKXcqp7bHWI": "99% of the gummy bear recipes the DIY how to out there that you will find videos or in text are gonna tell you basically to make jello jigglers it's not the same thing as gummy bears but I'm gonna give you some tips and tricks on how to make real gummy bears not just jello so stay tuned and now but I'm the one that has the culinary arts degree and does most of the baking and cooking in the kitchen anyway this is going to be a bit of a review and how-to video all in one I was given a free sample of this here bear mould and it is silicone it's machine washable and it makes 50 little gummy bears now it really only contains like for retail spoons with of liquid when I measured it out that's if you're just pouring water in there but we all realize you'll definitely need a recipe that has more than three tablespoons cuz trust me I tried to do like a micro recipe and it didn't get me very far but so far I really do love this mold I haven't had a spray it I haven't had any problems they just come right out so there's two main camps of homemade gummy bears there are people that are just making their own for the fun of it and they're gonna be using jell-o unflavored gelatin water then there's a camp that is usually doing it for the health benefit so they might have some kind of eye they will probably have juice and honey and unflavored gelatin most likely beef gelatin which is higher quality more health things to it so I that's what I'm trying for I don't have a special gelatin but I did try to do this with juice and honey and a couple of failed batches with double die vitamins but we'll get into that so this mold actually came with a pdf recipe book I really didn't find it very helpful but you can look around and find different recipes kind of experiment with what you like especially if you're doing a juice phase to go me what kind of juices do you like they do say to frown away from pineapple because the enzymes in it do not work well with gelatin just a heads up let me show you how I went about making some gummy bears myself so this is the ingredient list off of your store-bought gummy bears and you'll see here you know there's sugars there's gelatin but there are some extra waxes and that I just don't have in my kitchen I don't know about you but I'm going to give you two big tips on how to make this as close to legit gummy bears as possible less like just jigglers the recipe I have makes about 80 to 90 gummy bears and it calls for 1/3 cup of juice so I used some orange juice and lemon juice to top up that last little bit but it's primarily orange cuz that's my favorite and then it calls for two tablespoons of honey and 2 tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I did try grinding up some multivitamins it was foul and profusely disgusting so I haven't mastered that yet I'm going to show you how to do it without the vitamins take your juices and honey mix them together and then gently sprinkle your gelatin the unflavored gelatin on top and wait several minutes it'll kind of soak up like you see here and that's called blooming you don't want to add it directly into hot liquid or you'll have problems then I just slowly warm it up in a pan I'm warming up a larger pan to the side and then tip number one is boiling you are making a candy so with taffy with that sort of thing you have to boil the sugar and water to get basically a soft ball to get to the right consistency there at texture so since this is a really small batch I only did it for a couple minutes I was afraid of burning I think the consistency could have been nicer if I had done it longer but I was great so you can kind of experiment with how long you let it boil next I keep my smaller pot in side of that larger pot and just let them sit there with the spoon and dropper that they give you just so that they stay warm so they don't start setting that because then it becomes a real mess this little dropper that they give you with this set is awesome and yeah just fill them up one by one no big secret there try to fill them up as big as possible because they do shrink a little bit as you'll notice there are some bubbles you can try to skim off that before you put them in but I like them and then I put them in the fridge for just a few minutes or even the freezer and they pop right out didn't need to coat that with any oil or anything so here's the mold and I will say tip number one is to make sure and boil your sugar tip number two is to let your gummy bears sit let them dehydrate a little because in the factories where they make them they actually do put them in a drying room for a couple of days and so letting out a little bit more of that moisture should help them have a little bit more of a chewy consistency than just thick jello and here's the final product next to a Haribo Haribo gummy bear so it's a little smaller slightly different design but I like it I think it's adorable and I think it's tasty I hope that the video was helpful for you here are some of my orange lemon honey gummy bears you know they're not 100% like this stuff at the store I know they're gonna be healthier and they're cute and I still taste good so I'm gonna enjoy these snacks and if you don't want to take the time and effort for gummies even though these are awesome that you can make your own healthy version or custom flavors and colors if you don't want to do that you can also use this mold for chocolate bears make a little bag for your sweetheart for your kids throw it in their lunch a little bag of gummy or chocolate bears that says I love you very much I'm cheesy like that I would totally do that so all in all I definitely give this mold a 5 out of 5 recommendation I don't have any problems with it I really like it I love that it came with the dropper to help fill it up and if you follow my tips I think things should go smoothly let me know down in the comments below if you enjoyed this video what you think if you've had any problems or if you try it after watching this let me know how that worked out for you but I want to thank you very much for tuning in here today sorry for the cheese but if you haven't hit that subscribe button please do and we will make it worth your while join us here on this journey we call life here on the judkins journey gummy bears bears they're made out of fruit juice it totally works with my new year's resolution", "_XVNvnQLo44": "hey thanks for joining me today I want to show you how to make gummies a lot of people ask about hey do you have a gummy bear mold well essentially all of our chocolate molds are gummy bear mold so you can really make any shape that you want to so what I want to show you today is you're doing this from scratch we're not using a box mix of any sort so the powder gelatin that we have here at sweet wise is a really great deal because you can get a whole pound and then we're going to be using some of the sweet wise flavorings those are all natural and then the citric acid that we have here as well so the recipe is pretty basic I'm just going to use a cup of water and two-thirds of a cup of sugar and then I'm going to use four tablespoons of gelatin but before I get the rip to the rest of it like with the flavor and color and everything I want to give you a few tips on mixing this what I did I went ahead and did a cup of hot water with my sugar because when you pour the sugar into the cold water then it takes a little bit more time to dissolve that granulated sugar and you really you know want to dissolve that before you get to the gelatin it just makes it a little bit better so I went ahead and this hot water that I mixed with the sugar and I also went ahead and mix my color because let me show you this if you add the color I'm going to do red in this one just to show you the difference if you do the color in here then it can be kind of gloppy and it's a little bit hard to mix into cold water as well you have these little spots that don't mix as well so when I mix it with the hot water this is essentially the same thing with a different color okay so you can see how much clearer it is when I use hot water mix the color in and the sugar that's all I am right here 1 cup of water 2/3 cup of sugar and the coloring and then it's cooled back down to room temperature now we can add the gelatin and I've got 4 tablespoons of the sweet wise gelatin and I'm just going to go ahead and sprinkle this slowly on top and I'm not going to stir it quite yet I wanted to start absorbing all of that liquid and you'll notice that it starts to bloom is what it's called it starts to absorb that liquid over time and once that's all absorbed then we can melt it so that'll probably take a minute or two so we'll just leave that alone and come back to it okay so my gelatin is all dissolved so now I'm just going to add a teaspoon of the lemon flavoring now this is an actual lemon oil so if I was going to use like this cherry flavoring over here in the red I would probably want to do two teaspoons in that but the lemon is so much stronger I'm just going to do one teaspoon in that give it a little stir and then I'm going to take it over to the microwave should take about 20 seconds and then it will probably be ready all right so I'm going to check it give it a stir I think this needs a little bit more time I'm going to give it about another 15 seconds you want to make sure that you don't overdo it on the first round because you you can scorch some spots you don't want to do that so this is ready usually I have a lot more foam on the top and this this batch turned out really nice but what you want to do before you start using this is just kind of skim this off just kind of gather it off to the side and take a spoon then just kind of discard it off to the side that way you can have a nice clear gummy okay you don't have to have every single particle out of there but just having the bulk of it out really helps now you can pour it right out of here it has a nice funnel but that really only works well if you have a bigger cavity like this if you're doing something more finely detailed like these teddy bears or these little gems I really like to put it in a squeeze bottle so let me just go ahead and pour that in here and since it's nice and warm that'll go quickly if this does cool off you can pop it back in the microwave for 10 or 15 seconds and it'll be a lot more fluid again you may have a few little leaks in this but I wouldn't worry about that too much okay so let me show you about preparing these you really don't need to oil these or anything but it does help but come out a little bit more easily I'll show you an example these have not been oiled they sat at room temperature about 20 minutes this one was oiled and this one was not so you'll see I'm just gonna take a toothpick and I'm going to kind of start the edge and then get my finger under there and pull it out that one pops out really easily this one will come out easily but not as easily as the oiled one this one does have a little bit more shine to it if you'll notice but what I want to warn you about is if you do add like a spray in here and we just do one of these down here like a quick spray like this all these bubbles that are here we'll come out in the surface of the jello so you want to avoid that by just kind of brushing it around or maybe taking paper towel and get that excess out of there so just to show you how to fill these I want to fill this one just to the edge these bigger ones I pop in the fridge for like 20 minutes and they're fully set if you left it at room temperature I'm guessing this would be at least an hour these take about 20 minutes these little bitty cavities they take about 20 minutes at room temperature and then they pop right out and I'll show you one of these as well you see how easy that comes right out and then of course the rubber Ducky's it which is why I did the yellow with the lemon if you want to do that for a baby shower again this is a little bit bigger cavity so if you want to pop that in the fridge for about 20 minutes that would come out as well but you want to avoid like over filling these you can take like a bench scraper or something to clean that up but if it forms on there then it's just a little bit ugly and then you can always go back and trim it up with scissors but that's just more work so I just say use the squeeze bottle and make it a little bit easier on yourself one more tip if you want to make the sour is to use citric acid now this is very very strong so don't use it straight you're going to just really give somebody a heart attack I do like 5 or 6 parts of sugar just granulated sugar to one part of citric acid so if you're using a teaspoon measure I have two teaspoon measure whatever that's fine too but what I like to do so like these already done you can put this like in a little salt shaker if you want to but I don't like to sprinkle it right out of the container because it'll just be too heavy so just put a little bit in my hand and then I also don't sprinkle down close to the piece I'm doing it just kind of it sticks too much in little globules if you'll raise your hand a little bit higher and just kind of sprinkle from up high then it gives you a little bit more even coating and it's also not quite as strong as if you did it really really close so there's a really great easy way to make gummies you can make them the regular way or the sour way I really like that you can kind of customize your color if you do want to like for a baby shower for a wedding or for a birthday you can kind of make the colors and flavors work to your advantage rather than just buying something that's pre-made plus just having the custom shapes and different sizes people are really going to be impressed that you made these so give it a try thanks for watching have fun with it you", "szIfo0BJMs0": "[Music] there's a color-changing pineapple behind me see know what that means it means it's time for weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's episode I'm gonna help you make sense of one thing I have never understood at any of the dispensaries I've been to because I have seen this product at practically every dispensary that I have been to and I have never ever picked it up because it always seems like such a bad deal to me and that is cheeba choose as I said I have seen these at practically every dispensary of it around but I have never actually picked them up because they just seem like a tremendously bad value so this is their extra strength hybrid and chew at a hundred milligrams of THC see if we can actually get that oriented properly for you probably not oh there it goes um so yeah you can see hundred milligrams of THC 520 milligram doses but let's look at the back and you can see that price tag they sell this for 15 bucks I got a discount for 13 to 13 dollars for this tiny tiny tiny little thing now I do like small edibles I do actually have always have an affinity for potent things in small packages that's what she said but this just does not seem like it could do the job hundred milligrams isn't that much especially for 15 bucks and it just doesn't seem like it could pack that much of a punch in something this small I mean I've had like the punch bars before which are quite small or I've had the bang the bite and each of those actually had nearly twice as much THC in them as there's this thing did and they were considerably bigger even still so I do not know what to expect I'm hoping because they are everywhere they're sort of ubiquitous that means that there's some reason they're so popular and they're as potent as they are but we're about to find out together all I know is if this ends up being a disappointment I'm gonna have some harsh words for Chiba Choo so I'm gonna shut up now open this up pop it in my mouth poll tell you how it tastes and then I will be back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling although for you it'll be just a couple of seconds okay so I'm unraveling it here comes in it is definitely a caramel I don't know how you would split this in five doses otherwise it's pretty pretty mushy it smells good it smells like a caramel I'm just gonna plunk this whole thing right my mouth I'm gonna do it in two bites just do it in one here we go well maybe actually cut some music in my new tune there we go down the hatch so it taste is good you've got to give him credit for that wow that was a really good taste in caramel perfect sort of consistency very little cannabis taste I was happy with that but what I'm unsure about is how this bad boy is actually going to hit me for that guy's you're gonna have to wait a couple seconds me on the other hand I'm have to wait a couple hours to see what its gonna do to me I will let you know I'll see you guys in just a bit peace it's been two hours guys since I had the Chiba juice and it's just as I feared Chiba I'm afraid I do not choose you it's it's about as bad as I had hoped um yeah I can't say I feel nothing I would say I'm at maybe a three two and a half somewhere in there um so you know not high at all you know I feel something maybe there's sort of the effects after you had smoked a joint an hour later or something just like the echo of a high so it's you know it tasted good I like the taste of the chima choose it's just too expensive for what it is and does not provide enough of a high I have tried other 100 milligram edibles that I've hit harder than this and that 15 bucks for this thing it's just it's it's too much I cannot recommend the Chiba choose at this point I don't think I would be reviewing any more Chiba choose just because you know one and done with this one maybe unless you guys really have some wrong feelings about other ones or if there's something you really want me to review from cheap at you let me know but otherwise this one is enough of a bummer on its own then I don't feel like I have to run down there their entire catalogue I think they have more projects than this I think anyways that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys I appreciate you watching as always and I will see you on our next review peace pretty good", "a61vjUPxcFc": "hello senior stunt fans is the real senior stunner back at you today we're gonna be discussing powerful edibles this is non liquid mostly chocolate but let's talk about starting at the top with my WoW brownie remember edibles are to be used very carefully this in particular is some of the strongest edibles I've come in contact with the WoW brownie 500 milligrams bottom line even though it's not that big one bite and you got to put it down and wait an hour and a half two hours because I found it to be almost too strong so be careful with while brownies they're very strong mostly a sativa / hybrid on the upside there Delta which is a more traditional Delta nyan edibles this is a classic 250 milligram milk chocolate that for people it's scored into nine different pieces for people who just want to have it casually this one is much more intense for the experience usually this would be something even a beginner could eat into over here let's move on down to our pj butters assortment we have two today that we're gonna look at on the right is a traditional Belgian milk chocolate double dose with 300 milligrams that means you can take it to a movie or a concert pop it in your pocket it's real small look how small it is and it's very discreet here it is in Belgian chocolate with cappuccino flavor also PJ butter 300 milligram Sheriff with a friend please I bought this because I thought it was gonna be really exciting I'm looking forward to it this is a hive I've talked ilat Belgian chocolate flavor came a lot of different flavours what they do with this 400 milligram puppy is they score it they score at a number I think they score at 20 different pieces he bought you cut out a little piece for yourself and / - so you're in 40 milligrams apiece take two of those and you'll be very very happy let's move over to bang this is medical cannabis pretzel chocolate and this is one for one person that says double strength but for me 120 milligrams really is gonna be for me now I want to take this and go into detail the Wow 250 bar is made by the same people that make the Wow brownies and you have to be very very careful some reason I don't know what they're using on inside of their edibles because it doesn't tell me if it's distill it or cannabis oil for weed it's incredibly strong their brand let's move to something that I've experienced with I've tried the G bar before the 500 milligram buy lol edibles very tasty this is done really nicely it's a pretty package but it's also a very tasty bar because of that I purchased some 1000 milligram bars they're the same size but more potent so yesterday I attempted to take a piece of one of these were the day before oh my goodness I had a piece of one of these and I had a bite of the brownie no drink during the day and oh my god so I think what has to be said about edibles especially edibles with this type of power because these are really powerful animals is you need to go very slow and in small small pieces you're not like me don't think you are with edibles most people I've been doing edibles for a very long time if you have and you understand what I'm saying they can overwhelm you very quickly so you don't want to turn book could be a great experience and have it be a pain in the ass because you don't feel good so remember go slow but go bold or go home right this is a fine assortment of edible high potency edibles I wanted to take a look at from the real senior stoner everybody have a great day thanks taking a look", "26LRTorzvBg": "goes to God here aha marijuana today we're doing another review want some enemies they should save you a book I got from high level health and downtown Denver and these were recommended to me because I was looking for an edible and try something new and I was asking for something that was vegan because usually a lot of edibles or chocolate base and it's milk chocolate so they're not vegan case you didn't know I'm vegan so I got you sweets ours here these are made by Eddie pewter and they're basically just like sour patch candies but um they're edibles with we like I said in the last video so um these are there's 10 10 milligram pieces now 10 milligrams is the base dose that they've actually established now here in Colorado because there's been some people out of freaked out with edibles so they say that the standard dose for an adult would be 10 milligrams and wait about an hour or two and then you can go from there you have to develop your tolerance now just because you have a high smoking tolerance does not mean that you will have a high edible tolerance this is a whole different kind of high it's ingested its processed by the body differently so just because you're dab or just because you're smoke all day doesn't mean you can come and take five or six of these and things it's okay now these particular edibles are rated at eighty eight point seven percent THC so it's actually higher than the concentrate that I did the review on yesterday now like I said these are ten milligrams there's ten in the jar I initially took one because I'm kind of new to the audible thing about hours who later I didn't feel anything so I took another one still didn't feel anything so the next day I woke up and I took three and I still didn't feel anything so I can do mad let means I have five left now and because I've worked my way up and I've been responsible we're going to go ahead and take these five today in this video and I'm gonna do a little review on the taste and show you guys the texture and everything what's going on and I'm gonna come back in about an hour or two and let you guys know and five was the right dose for me now unless you know I'm not just jumping up and being irresponsible also did some research already and people the kind of neutered down the dosage is for people that are new to smoking and things like that and I actually remember I think I said verbatim in some form ten milligrams will even get your grandmother high and they said for an average smoker about twenty five to fifty milligrams it's probably about an accurate dosage to get where you want to be so as I said we're gonna go ahead and try these five here now I'll try them the other day and they taste like if you were to take it I hated some wax or any kind of concentrate or oil I saw definitely very concentrated as I just said a moment ago these are actually at a higher percentage than concentrate that I did a review on yesterday I've got a few here I don't believe the flavors are different I got some some yellows and some greens and some blues here consuming on there and see the little sugars just like a little sour patch kidding me so Cheers I'm good pop now first it is really sour but then the sugar comes takes over in the Whedon tasting this is better I've had flour per pie flour prepared edibles before um brown using cookies and things like that in the past and this taste is a lot more pleasant it's a lot stronger and I mean I just like the taste of concentrates better than flour now but um pretty good pretty solid no one sticking your teeth as bad as most this is a positive for me but um one time just will remind you guys I don't think you can buy these and just pop a whole handful of them because and you will freak out I got a will teach you a lot different if you've ever been to high before anybody serving it too high they know exactly what I'm talking about these last two ring and pop these down playing a sentiment check back with you guys here and buy our oohs whoo and see how we're feeling and these still don't work come to conclusion the edibles aren't quite for me I'm gonna take a couple more trips out of the bait sound good okay I'm at these back up check back with you guys here in about an hour or two ghost God mile-high marijuana signing up I was some guys back now it's been a couple hours trying his uh Eddie Pierre of sweet and sour now if you remember we took five of them and I'm actually ashamed to say didn't really get stolen again this time um I got really tired though and I actually found out that these are actually uh indica heavy and that's probably why I had the tired feeling but I definitely didn't feel like I was ripped and I'm definitely preferring the flowers and the concentrates at this time however in a couple of weeks and we'll go ahead and know I'm gonna get a little bit more a higher dosages and I'm gonna get something that's the Teva heavy and we'll try that out but as we promised go ahead and rip the rest of this job Walsh berries and um we've got another video coming up real soon I made another little stop today and I got something special for you and these guys are gonna like that so that means that unfortunately what's the game I don't I don't think edibles really work from you and I got a I got a fast metabolism and I'm onna they work this time but we're gonna try them doing a couple weeks one last time though with this odd job balls berries there's nobody love this you guys know the deal though man comment like subscribe share all that let me know what you want to see me do any strange you guys might win let me buy I mean I got it all on my disposal here right now so anything you guys want to see me review just let me know certain things aren't like medical like I don't think I think achieved she was I think those are medical only so you know just let me know hit me up in the comments once again no ghost of God mile high marijuana signing out", "kQC2ShkiMcQ": "hey everybody we have our resident colorado-based subject matter expert on with us today Laney ganja is going to talk to us about some beginner advice for those of you who have never enjoyed a THC infused edible what to do when you're choosing your edible how to take it how long to wait before you feel any effects and what to do if you are experiencing some of those negative effects that THC can sometimes be associated with well first of all edibles are definitely not we're impatient people because that's a mistake that I hear a lot is people are like well I ate this cookie I didn't feel anything so I went back for more that's the number one mistake people make you don't want to do that if you're gonna go the edible route it takes patience your body is literally consuming something and it's breaking it down just like you do food and it's processing through the liver so that is a whole process in itself and not something that isn't like when you're inhaling something so as a beginner just say for instance you went to the dispensary here in Colorado they make a lot of 100 milligram portions of things that are then broken 10 milligram pieces so as a beginner say you picked out your I don't know maybe you picked out the coolest chocolate bar that they had and you open it up as if it was like a Hershey's bar it'll say a hundred milligrams on the package so you know this has ten servings and you will just pick up that one little piece of ten milligram portion and if you're nervous about it go ahead and cut that two milligram portion in half consume that five milligrams assess yourself in about an hour even up to two hours and then decide if you'd like to have your other half or have another piece um you know definitely just be patient with the process and understand that it's going to be much more enjoyable when you approach it that way so well you know if you ever consumed too much of an edible and you're not enjoying yourself you're not having a good time just remember that the negative feelings and bad experience you're having will pass it's not permanent it's all gonna fade with time if you're really not enjoying yourself make sure you're just drinking water make sure you're relaxed make sure you're comfortable watch a funny movie watch music videos scroll on YouTube do all kinds of things go outside and get some fresh air if you need to tears just know that it's all gonna pass with time you're going to be fine and use it as an experience to learn a lesson like oh that's too much for me I should not consume that much and understand how much to take for next time to make it more enjoyable does caffeine help does anything like can you take something else that might help take the edge off so that's where CBD comes into play that's where CBD is like your best friend and such an amazing thing to have on hand because it really counteracts sometimes the negative experiences and feelings that THC might bring bring on so if THC is causing you to feel paranoid or anxious CBD can then balance that out take away some of that anxiety and create a really nice experience so utilizing something like having CBD tincture on hand or CBD capsules like what Daryl has having things like that on hand and those times of need could be very beneficial or better yet if you're somebody that's even to begin with about being anxious and paranoid you should probably take CBD in conjunction with your THC to begin with you should probably just take them at the same time or better yet find an edible that's already been infused equally with both so at the dispensary when you're looking at all the different products you could even ask the budtender you could say hey I'm nervous that I might get a little paranoid I'm new to THC could you point me to some edibles that are already infused with CBD and THC and they'll point you to that direction if the dispensary does not have a plethora of CBD items that's where it's cool that companies like Charlotte's Web and pure hint Botanica 'ls and companies like that that have good quality sources of CBD that you can just buy straight off of online we've talked about how important the sourcing is before but those are really good trusted companies Charlotte's Web Puran botanicals there's several others there's like Haley's hope out there so there's some religious ones that you could just purchase online if your dispensary does not seem to have a lot of good CBD options yeah just throws an extra precaution it definitely does not hurt to make sure that you've already eaten before you take your edibles so it probably wouldn't be the best idea to take your edible on an empty stomach especially if you're brand new to it so just to ensure to have a good time you might as well make sure you have at least a snack before you go into your edible this will give the edible and the THC something to kind of stick to something to help it hit and activate within your stomach and it's just gonna make for a better experience is there is there a possibility that it could upset my stomach kind of like aspirin can upset your upset your stomach I just feel like if somebody is brand new to this and they take it THC edible on an empty stomach that I feel like it could just be a lot for their system to have a brand new to it and especially on an empty stomach I just feel like it's giving you a chance to upset your stomach or just make it less enjoyable so just like as a precaution basically don't forget we don't eat and don't forget to drink water because those things are so very important for a good experience do you have a product or business you want to share we want to know what you have to say leave us a comment on our website at the THC foodie comm or on twitter at safety HC foods [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "2eUpdII0Iw4": "hey guys it's me cubix so the

thank you [Music]", "8OJ6v23ah6w": "good morning guys I wanted to quickly go over how to calculate milligrams of THC and explain what it is exactly I think this is one worth knowing since milligrams of THC is quickly becoming the new dominant unit of measurement when it comes to trying to discuss dosages just like it's the dominant unit of measurement with prescription medication and a lot of other substances also in legal jurisdictions it's becoming increasingly the standard way to label the dosage up on marijuana edibles and drinkables when we talk about weed traditionally it was always done by weight grams ounces pounds and so on which was very broad and also very standard and in the last 15 years we also started using percent THC to be more precise which describes the THC content of a particular strain per gram and thus its potency per gram but that figure was always expressed as a percentage for example this strain is 12% THC but now we've gone one step further to the milligrams that milligram figure is not as confusing as it seems if you have one gram of weed also known as 1000 milligrams and it's a strain that's 12% THC that means there's 120 milligrams of THC in that single gram why do we need to take things to milligrams because one standard dosage especially when it comes to edibles has been defined as 10 milligrams 10 milligrams of THC is the amount of THC that a relative novice consumer would need to consume in order to feel mild of cannabis effects a mild high so if you buy a marijuana chocolate bar and it states that the whole chocolate bar contains a hundred and sixty milligrams that means that's that chocolate bar has 16 of those standard doses and they're most likely divided into the little chocolate squares in that bar now that doesn't mean that to the average marijuana consumer they'll be able to get decently stoned off of ten milligrams as I said in my episode on tolerance just like with alcohol marijuana tolerance Rises 10 milligrams is really just a measurement for novices for myself I need at least 25 to 30 milligrams and my tolerance is above average but it's nothing special I know super heavy marijuana users who don't feel much of anything until they get to about 50 milligrams but if you're just starting out with edibles 10 milligrams should be your first trial run obviously to control dosage on such like with such precision you have to live in a legal weed jurisdiction because that's the only way you're gonna see the percent THC or the milligram THC vigor expressed in a reliable way on the package so there you go now you know what milligrams THC is and how it might apply to you hope you enjoyed the show if you found it useful be sure to subscribe and hit that like button see you next time", "dRCWeLKTTyw": "hey YouTube this is grant Smith from Colorado I'm coming at you live from the mile-high and I am just going to do a quick review here of another edible medical marijuana product here and that is the sour gummies by a company called wana I am not familiar with them this is my first experience with their product and so these are sour gummies really not sure I think that yeah they're about 10 milligrams apiece in terms of THC per and apparently it was made I don't know you got all sorts of information about the plants they used in different trim apparently they use some trim I tore this package up like an idiot so anyway these are what they look like and you know if you're into gummies and you're into that whole thing that's flavor and that texture you would really like these the flavor is great I'm not really the biggest fan of the texture personally so sorry one sec here we are you know here if you're a gummy pen you will enjoy them if not you probably just you know like me you'll be able to tolerate them and you know I'm certainly not trying to knock this product at all because they definitely tasted great again I'm just not a huge fan of the actual gummy textures so you can see they're covered with you know crystals or whatever infused I really don't know anything much about this particular process but this is what they they look like you know standard candy and that's ten milligrams of THC infused within this and that's a pretty good deal you know it'll get you a good little buzz going on and you know if you have a high tolerance level you may want to eat a couple of them if you don't well um I'm sure one will do it and so you know just again I just wanted to remind you all out there that if you're not you know here in Colorado or California someplace where you can kind of get these things with a little less you know going to the street kind of deal you know you may you may not really know how to use them right and so I just want to help everybody out there you know if you get your hands on this kind of stuff just remember don't go overboard with it you know you'll enjoy it so much more if you don't eat too many at once you can really make yourself sick and you know regret doing it if you just tear into them like that so anyways hope you guys are out there having a great one tonight and if you would like me to review anything or have any questions or anything like that if you want to see anything let me know and give me any suggestions that you've got thank you for watching and be safe out there alright peace", "H8EhvA8Tp-I":

hey out here in Cali visiting checking out some of the dispensaries and stuff out here I picked up this mystery baking company new canvas infused green apple strips there's a hundred milligrams in the whole bag and each piece is about ten milligrams so here you go right here nice little strip ten milligrams in here so since there's only 10 milligrams per piece and only 100 milligrams in the bag I kind of got to eat like the whole bag to get an effect which since I have a high tolerance this product is not the best for me it tastes delicious it's an awesome taste I love eating them but it just as imprudent enough if you're new to cannabis and cannabis edibles then this might be a nice one for you because it tastes good it's only ten milligrams for anyone that's accustomed to taking in cannabis not the best option go with something a little stronger not saying this company's bad just this product is not the best for someone that has a high tolerance so that's my review on the cannabis infused gummy strips by mystery baking company 100 milligrams and whole bag ten milligrams apiece not a huge fan tastes delicious though they taste they taste awesome they're so good I love eating them they just don't really give me the effect that I want", "pUhJnKKQDTE": "as marijuana becomes legalized throughout North America [Many] are trying edibles for the first time as a healthier option but with Edible marijuana Providing such a different experience than smoking how does it work and is eating pot Actually better for you? When you heat cannabis you effectively change the chemical makeup of compounds within it called Cannabinoids Smoking heats it to around 800 degrees Celsius and converts thc a to Delta 9 thC which binds to receptors in your brain making them continually fire and causing your imagination, thoughts and perceptions to magnify this is why every thought can feel like a significant one and Because it travels straight from your lungs into the bloodstream and to your brain the drug works within minutes and lasts about two to [three] Hours, but when making edibles the weed is heated to around 150 degrees Celsius burning less of the actual plant and minimizing Carcinogens ThC is Lipophilic not water-soluble so the activated Thc must be dissolved into something fatty like oil or butter and once the substance is consumed the onset of the high is delayed as the drug is absorbed more slowly through your gut but this high typically lasts four to eight hours and most report feeling more high than Compared to smoking marijuana [this] is because when you eat edible weed the ThC is first metabolized by the liver before entering the bloodstream and here Delta 9 thC also becomes 11 o h thC which Passes the brain barrier more rapidly and is a more potent chemical so using the same amount of marijuana You actually get more high with Edibles because it ends up creating both Delta 9 ThC And 11-OH-THC which is a stronger compound and because there are more? psychotropic types of Cannabinoids acting on your neurons you'll be high for longer of course you also get to skip out on the toxic chemicals that smoking provides like Carbon monoxide Bronchial Irritants and tumor Initiators smoking anything means you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules so if you can get high without smoking it will be healthier for your lungs and body the downside it's much harder to control the High you'll get because it can take up to one to two hours to feel the full effects and the dosage can vary significantly modulating the effects or Titrating as it's called is much more difficult [and] as a result you can end up a lot higher than you intend - but unlike those who consume too much alcohol Opioids or other drugs you won't be suffering any serious long-term harm Toxicity [or] Lethal overdose if you do consume more than you intended [if] you've ever wondered why marijuana gives you the

that experience while you were high I'm sure yeah so I was in Jamaica and my friends there was like 15 of us got all guys we decided to take brownies one day and like the crew range from guys who smoked weed everyday to guys who had never smoked weed in their entire lives but everyone was no pun intended pot committed to taking these brownies they're like this big I took one we all went to the beach and then like all of us were hit with this ridiculous wave to where everybody was I can't even like astronomically high like I wa I couldn't even cross the street like I was trying to cross the street at this pizza place with my two friends and I couldn't I kept backing up and I can I finally sat down and got food and then we ordered buffalo chicken pizza and I was enjoying it and then my friend said like ma'am I've gotta get out of here like I think like the walls are like coming in and his friend was like a very like he was like the guy who would get so drunk and not feel it like he was like the big type of dude who wouldn't get freaked out and he got freaked out to freak me out then all of a sudden I just woke up and what happened was apparently I woke up on the ground with like ten Jamaicans standing over me and my friend said that my eyes started wrong in the back of my head they thought I was joking they slapped me in the face and I fell off and like I guess essentially having a mini seizure and since then I haven't taken edible it was the only time I've taken edibles and I just have I mean the ruined edibles for me I'm not doing it man it's crazy we went to bed at 4 p.m. that day it was a complete waste of a spring break danger you", "AyDIzNfK6_w": "hello Senor stoner fans happy holiday this is another in our rolling series of super reviews of cool things we're

the joy and playfulness found in life's journey to provide a pure experience kind of candies uses highest quality co2 extracted cannabis oil standard warnings and here's my experience with this get down sir there's my experience with this the belt actually tastes good that's the first thing that's important secondly they separate very easily for sure get down there separate easily from one another they also are efficient what I mean by that is you can separate them which is me and you don't waste much you get 50 milligram belt chew it and you have seven belts left so it really works effectively for people who like myself don't have strong fingers don't have strong hands it's a way to easily medicate yourself you don't have to do biting and cutting and tearing and ripping it just pulls right apart no the other thing to remember is that 50 milligram belt might be too much for somebody start with half a bell start with third of a belt get yourself comfortable I don't want anybody being unable to drive this holiday season or just falling euro into an uncomfortable state so kind of candies is info at Cana candies calm these really are cool they come packaged really

back to my channel and if you haven't already go ahead like comment and subscribe turner those post notifications to be notified every single time I post a new video and before I start the video I just want to say thank you so so much for 1k and for all the support that you guys have been showing like it really it really means a lot to me and it really pushes me more than you guys will ever know it's just you know those kind of words just like whenever I'm having a bad day I guess I can think back at it and what are we but today I am going to be like I said taking 1000 milligrams digibytes and this how she looks these bites I mean this bit dizzy bits I said bites and I have ten of these containers which contain 20 pieces weight 20 pieces in here yeah 20 pieces in here damn I thought it was 10 20 pieces in here 100 milligram that was orange I have blue raspberry I have black cherry I have strawberry I have and I have assorted flavors and repetitive they're all here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 behind my seat excited for these I really hope that I'm gonna be eating some right now and then right now I'm gonna go to an ice cream shop and pick up some ice cream and mix them in with some ice cream because I seen a wee tuber do it and I'll say well that's pretty sweet and it's yummy so I was like I gotta try that first should I do this once this is like the only one and I can get a mixture of all the things around this so the first container that I have is the assorted ones colorful packaging of bits well let's do this he looks cute I don't want to drop them wash can you see first one is gonna bark I'm guessing this is blue raspberry shits just bomb it's really squishy though and since I have braces it's like two times harder for me to chew especially because like all the time he's getting still to my teeth yeah sugar too so I'm gonna need like [ __ ] you can't see you're constantly gonna be seeing me drinking my drink but that was BOM and I didn't taste any THC I mean tasting mm-hmm which is next let's try that orange little verges it's like a candy oh [ __ ] I spit in the orange one it tastes like this orange candy exactly like it I don't know the name of it exactly my teeth I don't know how the [ __ ] am i doing nah-ha and this 20 bytes in each container so 200 damn I have to go check up on my dentist is the next one is strawberry you can see or is it not it looks darker there's two Pink's you see this may be cherry I can live with my favorite mm-hmm this was one I'm very bad with like trying things and figuring them out but I'm kind of debating this it's the second one was watermelon like the light pink one I think it was mm-hmm [Laughter] but I want to show you guys that I was gonna eat the green one already so yeah the green one is green apple mm-hmm I like learning okay so I showed you guys all the colors are in here now I'm gonna go ahead and finish them right now head and I'm gonna finish sorry and I'm gonna go ahead and head to an ice-cream shop because and I did get this idea from third high-production on the leaves they're called um he's gone his name is Edwin and he did it with his girlfriend and it was it looks pretty cool and yummy so yeah I was like that's the less painful way than to be like biting each one you know that would be like [ __ ] 200 bits I'm gonna have cavities and that's gonna be it I can't afford that for a damn video but yeah I will catch you guys up no I will be back when I am on my last can of bits and I will be recording every hour even if I [ __ ] knock out somebody will record me [Music] and yeah see you in a bit hopefully I'm hiding the [ __ ] sky already okay so it's about to be 5:30 hopefully you guys can see that this is the time that I try to start at the challenge like I said I will be keeping you guys updated go ahead and ask them some questions and hopefully in two hours when it's hitting me I can answer them already I'm joking and yeah I'll see you guys in a bit guys so I have my ice cream I chose bubblegum flavor just because I feel like everything's pretty sweet still hold like and yeah I don't think you think I'm little David like the best flavor um and yeah so I have my skin I'm gonna dump some of my ice cream on here and mix it and show you black cherry or blue Rosemarie hey how she's looking so far this is gonna really be a tick tock hack Wow look at her she know that I make ice cream Hey one race one go Oh fight see I see so sweet so sweet I have gum oh yeah and push I could eat this gum I was a wait I'm gonna solve a gun but it's obviously gonna make it so hmm woman the bit I most wished together pretty good and right now another good idea a little bit we're gonna make it into a slushy we're gonna blend them you [Music] okay okay so I basically put the rest of the edibles with eyes and I see a blue raspberry I see and the rest of my ice cream because ice cream with bits was like it made it turn way too hard for me to buy it so I was like nah I can do this so this is what it looks like so cold and I can already smell it and it smells way too sweet I like sweet things but not this way there are 52 and shrinking Suzy bits the [ __ ] it's pretty good actually it's very good Oh a [ __ ] like the blue raspberry and the bubblegum um ice cream just gave it like a very very good flavor that doesn't mean way too sweet for me it's currently 6:40 yeah I had to run some errands before that and I am now finishing and I'm sick so I'm probably gonna be even more sick damn you guys will see me in an hour or when I am finished with this finish before the witch it's [ __ ] well me they should really try it like that ass alright guys so you guys have reached the end of the video and you guys are probably like this is a different scenery where's the QA so I asked you guys to ask me some questions on my I gene and everything was going good you know I thought everything was gonna go smooth I was gonna be like alright when is he kick in I'm gonna be able to do a Q&A I felt like poop like poop I'm not really used to drinking liquids and on top of that I don't eat much so that much sugar like a whole fifty-two ounce full of sugar it just didn't make my stomach feel well at all and those edibles sure enough did hit I didn't feel like high all the way like completely but my body was just so tired like I felt like I couldn't even talk all I wanted to do was knock out I ended up throwing uh uh it was crazy those edibles hit me back but I tried to do look your name I'll go ahead and start a clip but you guys are gonna be able to see that I was just like ever was able to capture when I threw up but obviously a minor so that because I don't want nobody to throw up but I'm gonna go ahead and answer I'm gonna go ahead and actually redo the video because I already answered the questions but I just didn't like how it came out at all like I said it just didn't work out so we are here it's pretty much Hills all over as you can see pretty quiet um before we start the video and let's go ahead and take a hit this is my raw garden 2 over 1 CBD and THC I only have a little bit left as you guys can see like it I'm practically finished with it but let's go ahead and take a hit go ahead and grab whatever you want to grab your bowl your dad eat an edible get it doesn't really matter with us or drink them high with me first question who influenced you just smoke weed nobody really influenced me to smoke weed I guess you can say we're just kind of more about I'm curious to try it so my friend and I we tried it we experienced it and I think we just smoked like a couple times because he like [ __ ] with it but nothing too drastic like now smoking on a daily basis I would say like after high school once I started smoking on a daily basis on social social media I started saying there's a saying I meant sing I started seeing medicated Marley JK 420 ja hey JK I don't know how to say his name but he's [ __ ] dope they're both dope um a friend showed me life being death and I was like well she's cool you know if she can make you either how can I so I guess you can say that kind of pushed me to start my youtube journey no that wasn't even the question yes sir what and we just went off topic huh yeah yeah I forget everything I went a little off-topic on that one what's your goal by the end of 2020 my 2020 goal for myself is probably being more self-confidence confident self confident because I think if I'm confident in myself that'll help me with other things and I can push myself if I start to believe in myself if that makes any sense I you just make sense in here and my youtube 2020 goal at the beginning it was to reach 500 subscribers but we're at what K yeah okay so my 2020 for YouTube goal now is 3 K let's do this a little challenge um also whenever I was recording the video I would literally just sounded like a robot like I was just like reading it and like answering it and not even answering it if that I don't make any sense huh I'll what age did you start smoking I started smoking the very first time I smoked weed was probably when I was 16 years old 16 or 17 I'm not too sure it was one of those ages that was a very first time I smoked Kang JA do you have any dogs if so what breed okay I like how you guys aren't just asking me cannabis related questions yes I do have dogs I have a husky girl her name is Lily I have Mason boy he's really mixed with pitbull and German Shepherd and I have Bambi and Maxie that you all's and then they're singing my mom's and then now I'm gonna keep going with so many animals and then I have cha Chi Coco caramello and Dulce and then my husky it's just funny because I'm just like talking and talking about how many animals I have and then my husky dog she just gave birth so so I'll added [ __ ] dogs and I have a cat her name's Daisy if you care I hope you guys enjoyed my dumbass and keep having a great day I hope at least maybe

looking a boat I said boom welcome brother welcome back so another installment of edutainment the pace of your laughing being entertained but most importantly where you are learning something may apply to your own personal life and make it better how y'all doing today hopefully doing more saying less and keeping that same energy you know I'm saying hoodies linked in the description of this video I don't plug my emerge that often but you know keep that same energy in the description now this video is a prime example of over or being over confident with your edible experience time and time again in my comment sections and in stories I watch story times like that people underestimate the power of the edible when you smoke weed it begins to affect you almost instantly whereas in the case of an edible it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours for you to throw any substantial high that's why if you plan on being productive afterwards or you plan on being something else after you initially eat an edible you need to account for that time because you don't want to be out work high right and I'm not being able to perform and but potentially you get fired because of a mishap that you did at work a tried and true way to safely and responsibly enjoy your edible high is to gently activate your brains cannabinoid receptors and you do this by starting off with five milligrams or if you must and you have a higher tolerance start with 10 milligrams or we just start with the 10 milligrams if you have a higher tolerance but ideally I would say 5 milligrams and then gradually increase your dosage amounts you don't want to just instantly become high in order to get a better high experience and to better enjoy the whole hi moment want to gradually get to that peak hi there's nothing worse than all the edibles you've eaten because you felt overconfident all hitting you at once I also want to add that especially in that second video that you watched the way that guy would handle the situation that's only out of pocket he was essentially the guy crying on camera who is essentially having like a mini panic attack along daddy attack right so when you do smoke want to be mindful of the people that you are around I do I don't watch that don't go watch that you won't be mindful of the people that you are around like you trust these people yeah are you comfortable running people or are these like strangers or or randoms second is there a fear that you might get caught or is there fear that if someone caught you smoking you'd be in trouble because that can also play kate's into the whole wheat anxiety or panic attack so be comfortable in the environment around like this is your place and who you're with and in the event that it is indeed still a panic attack despite these precautions always have black pepper or lemon on hand these two things are set in before but not anybody watched any videos so I'll repeat it maybe will sink into your brain even if you Bri watch all the videos but black pepper and then never forget the science behind it but essentially there's an uncharted effect where in the the compounds found in lemon and black pepper counteracts the compound found in THC which gets you high and we deuce teaches effect on your body the the fact that you are either biting into the lemon or sniffing it it helps you get out of your own head and become more present in the immediate moment because you have a second thing the red bar right your mouth is sore or your brain or you just know this is nothing right because of the black pepper or lemon so ideally one of those two things will definitely be a game-changer for yourself or put any newbie that is smoking around you or is taking edible for the first time just have that on hand as a resource like a first aid kit it is then should be for marijuana usage yeah also keep in mind that the more food you've eaten and the more full your belly is the longer it will take the edible to kick in so if you want like a little hack don't eat too much before you eat your edible as a result it's more likely than the edible will take effect quicker I'm just saying so these are some things to keep in mind it's a short little video hopefully you laughed hopefully you were entertained and don't be like the man right there unless of course you want to play Washington Bullets with your life and why should we let with whatever else you have going on at the moment then do you you are big boys big girls my mind them rubber vet y'all can do what you want my responsibility is to give you the proper information so that you can make the choice decision and have the consequence but yo if you look in to quit marijuana for a long period of time what you want more of a guided

the regular guys welcome back so today I am going to do a very quick video for you guys on how to do tincture since I've kind of moved over to tincture using it for can't sugars and syrups and flowers and so on and so forth so for those of you who don't know how to make tincture there's two ways of you can do it there's the old-fashioned way of using a mason jar and your plant material and your vodka or if you've got one of these handy-dandy puppies the magic butter machine or another type of machine like that that does infusion or that does t-shirts then you're much better off to go this way so this method takes four to six week or sorry six to eight weeks and this takes four hours so if this is something that you want to do just as a one-time do you can go ahead and try that but it tinctures is something that you get into for your edibles on a regular basis I highly highly recommend trying to get one of these things it's gonna save you so much time and effort and yeah so that's it for that so I'm just gonna get right into it there's not a whole lot here we're talking vodka a jar or the machine and the biggest thing is your alcohol so for your alcohol mainly vodka is the best one now you need to make sure that it is at least a 100 151-proof or at least seventy-six percent or higher in the States you can get Everclear which I believe is around a ninety four ninety six percent in Ontario or and I don't know about the rest of Canada however in Ontario if you can find spiritus this is 76 percent you can buy it off the shelf if not we have what's called alcohol that is ninety four percent however you have to contact the LCBO the I don't know what was it I'll put the link in for you just to make it helpful quality control that's it you have to send them a request as to exactly what you want to use it for how much you want to use it a year and if they agreed then they'll send you a letter and you take that to the LCBO and while off they will give you the the alcohol alcohol so or it come back way easier get right off the shelf and so that's about it this is more than the difficulty is getting the higher percent alcohol now a trick for you if you cannot obtain the 76 percent alcohol you can do the oldest method of distillation so get your 40 percent alcohol put it in the freezer wait till the water that's all completely frozen once it's frozen you will take it out and put it over a strainer and and you just take the lid off because the alcohol does not freeze it will work its way through the ice and drip out and that is going to almost double your percentage in your alcohol by taking out that water that is the oldest method of distillation is freezing so there you go or an easy trip an easy trick for you then you can do the second time to increase it even more so that I said waited should do it if it is difficult so I'm gonna just back up the camera a little bit here for you so we can see everything and show you how to put that together alright so to do a t-shirt now you can do a tincture for any type of plant materials so this goes for your herb if you want to do rose petals so if you've got a garden and you do all kinds of herbs you can do this is the exact same way that you would do those type of textures as well if you're into herbalism and things like that this is that exactly the same way you would do it so you are going to first of all deke are pure plant material if you don't know what the garbage decarboxylation which is converting your THC a to THC you do that by putting it in the oven in a glass oven safe pan or contain here hold on one sec something like this hourglass food would be better for you if not covered with tinfoil and you put it in the oven at 240 degrees Fahrenheit for 40 minutes and then you take it out and let it completely cool to room temperature once you've got that you will place it into a mason jar if you were doing it the old-fashioned way you will pour I've got three cups here of my 76 percent spiritus alcohol shoot well hopefully your partner is not all over your counter that's it you will place your lid on for a minute and you're gonna give it a good shake then you're gonna place it in your cupboard in a dark cupboard for the next six to eight weeks and every day every once or twice a day a couple times two or three times a day whenever you happen to go into your kitchen take her out give her a good shake up put her back in the dark and I said about six to eight weeks later that tincture will be ready you will strain that material out and you're good to go now if you're doing it with the herbal magic holy mackerel the magic of butter machine sorry if you're doing it with the magical butter machine the magical butter calm it's just a simple it's actually simpler you will take everything now you have to do at least a minimum of two cups to a maximum of five cups so I am just gonna take this because I'm not doing the six to eight week method and we just pour it right into our magical butter [Music] let's go scrape the rest of that out well it's easier said than done just give that a little bit of a stir up there put your lid on Luger in and you are going to set the temperature to 130 degrees Fahrenheit or I can't see what it says in the cells if he says 94 Celsius and you are going to set it for the four-hour t-shirt that's it lights are gonna come on it's gonna do the grinding in that and after four hours we are going to strain this and that's it we'll have our texture so a lot of great reasons as I said we're making tincture is that you can make so much from your tincture as I said you can do the can of sugar check out my video on how to make kin of sugar there's the other one on canna flour powdered sugar Cantus syrup and simple syrup how to cover those so you can pretty much make all your base ingredients now with your tincture and it shows you how to do it to dehydrate it so it evaporates all the alcohol leaving your good stuff and you can then use all these ingredients then for your base cooking so you're no longer having to put butter in two places butter has no business being like jello so I'm pretty sure we could get a million recipes enough one of those recipes is going to call for butter so that now lets you eliminate the most of fires and things and lets you make things more in their natural state as well as being able to better control how strong or weak you want to make your products so you can either just use a little bit of sugar so 1/4 because sofa for example if a recipe is 1 cup you can either use a quarter cup it would be pretty mild or you can use a whole cup of can if you really wanted to render people unconscious so it's that it gives you far more versatility than using the butter or the oil you're going to get the same type of strength and yeah I definitely love using that I have a lot more oh and one thing also when you are if you are using the machine I always make sure to either have a fan if there overhead fan going or Stan fan or have the window open you want to always have air circulation whenever you're working with alcohol especially alcohol that is so highly concentrated all right and one other thing that I know a lot of you are gonna ask me which I probably should have said earlier about the D card would I would de carbon so generally on average people again it's all how personally strong you want to make your base your t-shirt so I've included the a link for a calculator so you can calculate your own but my route what I generally do is a half an ounce to one cup or one pound of butter so that's generally my rule of thumb of how the strength that I like to make mine as I said use the calculator and then you can figure out exactly how much you want to add of your plant material in order to get the strength of the dosing etc of exactly what you aren't personally and so once your your texture is done if you're using the machine after four hours you can then just strain it well with your handy this bag is awesome if you guys have this machine you know this bag is almost worth but getting it for the machine so yeah just straight around if not if you've got if you're doing it HR method then you will strain it you can use a strainer and a cheesecloth or a coffee coffee filter and for those of you who don't know what a cheesecloth is it is a fine fine mesh cotton cloth that you double and triple up to to get it as fine as you want it to and they're awesome for straining you can get them in any grocery store any dollar store they're really easy you easily two pot they're very easy to find story and yeah does it said and they're really inexpensive they're like a dollar and they're huge and you can just use whatever size you want but so that's it once you're done you will you will store it in a mason jar secure the lid on tight and keep it in a dark location and that's it for textures alright so my infusion is now done they got the lid pour it through this handy-dandy strainer just gonna get out of the extra pulp maybe squeeze around forever dropping things pour back into your clean mason jar on it and that's it you store it in a in your cupboard in a dark in a dark cover so this needs to stay at a direct sunlight that's very important otherwise it will deteriorate everything and that's it for tincture easy as pie so I hope you enjoyed that little demonstration there for you and again as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and you guys are awesome this is the first time you're watching I do hope you subscribe or at least just check out some of those other videos and I think that's all I've got for you so I have hope you have an awesome rest of your day thanks again for watching bye [Music]", "qNO5CYMky3k": "hey guys what I want to talk about today is the subject that I always get asked about and that's cannabis and sleep you know a lot of people just don't sleep well these days and they need something to help them sleep at night and a lot of people have found candidates to be really helpful so let's go over how canvas can be helpful for sleep and first of all you know what you should know is that there's two different cannabinoids and canvas that can help to sleep you know some will argue that there's other cannabinoids as well and you know I would be one of those people but unfortunately you know the only ones that are really commercially available are CBD and THC so you know fer today's discussion I'm gonna restrict our discussion just to those two cannabinoids but CBM is another canal going that a lot of people have found to be really effective for sleeping and again there's others but we're just gonna stick to CBD and THC today so cannabis is sleep so you know one of the big things that we need to know about canvas and sleep is that you can't develop a tolerance to THC okay so there is a talk that you can develop to THC but the good news is that it doesn't seem like there's any tolerance that you can develop to CBD so CVD again has no tolerance so you know that's something that's really important to note because you know we do need to acknowledge that THC does have some tongs to it you know if you do use a lot of THC over time you'll find that you'll need to use a little bit more to get the same effect so now that we know that let's talk about CBD and we'll talk about GHC specifically so first we'll just start off a CVD that's that's the easy one okay so CBD you know a lot of people do that CVD can actually be helpful for sleep you know it's not everybody but some people do find that you know CBD on its own can be helpful but you know if you are looking to use just CBD to help you sleep you know what you need to know is that there's gonna be other terpenes that are in CBD they're gonna affect how that CBD affects you so if you want to pick out a CBD for sleep you're gonna want to pick out a CVD that's high in mercy so mercy is that's known to have very very sedate of properties so you know this is why a lot of people who say that when they use a lot of heavy cuff strains mean all of them but a lot of the Kush strains do tend to be high and mercy and because they're high in mercy you know a lot of people do really well with that so again you know most people who use came to sleep do use a little bit of THC some people though can sleep really well with CBD and generally with the people who sleep well with CBD they get products that are high in mercy because if you get a product to say hi and something like piney you know that way it actually gave you energy and I might keep you up at night so that's kind of CBD in a nutshell you know of course there's you know a longer discussion for that but in a nutshell you know that's kind of how you pick out CBD and you know like I said it feel like there's no tolerance to CBD so you know people who find seem you need to be effective for sleep you know two or three years ago they're using the same dose now they've never needed to to change that dose because again there's no tolerance so let's talk a little bit now about THD and how he/she can can affect you you feel that it helps them fall asleep and they feel better helps them stay asleep so you know just to quickly chat on that you know big rise is gonna be your best option and the reason why is because that's fast right so within about one minute to three minutes you know five minutes maximum you know you're gonna feel a lot of the effects of the THC and that's gonna help you fall asleep because they stay in your system longer okay so we're talking about six to eight hours okay so about six to eight hours sustain your system roughly very fast onset of action but the game you know comes out your body really really quickly so what a lot of people find to be effective is that the bait to fall asleep and then we use the oil to stay asleep and then that way to you know if you forget to take your oil till right before you go to bed you know no big deal because as soon as the date wears off the oils gonna kick in and I mean it gonna be ready to sleep so you know that's just a little bit about THC and you know how to use vaporizer and how to use the oil or inedible to fall asleep and stay asleep now let's talk maybe a little bit about the THC tolerance okay so you know a lot of people you know you know figure out what we can do about instead so you know we know again the chief sees the fact of your sleep but we want to use in the most effective way you know one thing I'll say you know right off the bat you know the more THC you use you know likely yes the better you'll sleep but also to likely more you have that hangover or groggy feeling in the morning so again the more you use you know the more of a Tartar gonna develop also too you'll probably the better you'll sleep but again in the morning you'll feel more of that rawness effect you know I don't have any you know PubMed references to to acknowledge this but you know I do have a very very good colleague and friend dr. Carolyn McCallum and you know she kind of finds a lot of people their sweet spot with THC is about thirty milligrams a day so meaning that you know try they're not to use any more than about 30 milligrams a day you can we might be putting yourself at higher risk of developing the tolerance to THC if you go beyond 30 milligrams a day so you know again I would try to you know stay within that type of range you know if you're someone who has chronic pain and PTSD and you have this excellent you know regimen that works you when you're using beyond you know 30 mil absolutely no big deal go ahead and do that but you know for most people I would try to stay more to the 30 milligrams per day recommendation so what happens to if you do develop a little bit of a tolerance to to THC you know there's a couple different things that you can do one thing that works really really well for you know a lot of my patients is you know what we'll do is go back and forth between the flower and what so again you know some people like I said use the baby fall sleep and they use the world stage sleep and that works well for them but you know for other people you know what they what they do is that they they go back and forth so say flower for a month right for one month and then use oils for a month and then kind of go back and forth and they find this to be really effective so that's another thing you can do you know a lot things that I'll also mention you decrease your your overall constant the GHC is that you may have a little bit of a withdrawal period right so you're just going to you know in some ways he's not saying suck it up but you know you are gonna have to pop possibly experience some you know difficult effects though you may have a withdrawal period with with THC if you're trying to get off of it when you're going to sleep whatever him during that period is I would add melatonin and you can go all the way up to 10 milligrams if you need okay so guys that's just you know a little bit about Chi Chi and CBD and how they affect us when we're trying to sleep and some different strategies you can use to make sure that you know when you don't felt too much of a THC tolerance and if you have any questions or comments or different strategies that you use that I didn't discuss today you know please go ahead and let me know in the comment section and as always guys I'll be back again soon", "w38dtFM1Pdg": "kush burst starburst edibles they're [ __ ] big bro this video is for educational and entertainment purposes if you are not of the legal age to consume

"hey everyone so if you know anything about DC or just you know the cannabis life there you know that Sunny Patch was popular for a while and so things started to get a little weird my really really reliable pop-up shop lady stopped carrying these because she said they stopped putting actual cannabis inside of these edibles and you know at first when I would get these from this woman they provided the best experience a very powerful you know it was a very powerful high and the best part is like you know you didn't have to smoke weed because you could just pick these really yummy sour candies but when I made my first videos on stony patch a lot of people were telling me oh no this stuff isn't real this stuff is you know hogwash this stuff is fake and I was like I don't know what you're talking about the first several times that I got sunny patch packages it was like the best thing I've ever experienced and oh just a heads up cannabis is completely legal in Washington DC DC if you know anything about DC you know that there are no legal issues with consuming consuming cannabis okay alright so with that said now that we know so knee patch is unreliable altogether there is no centralized provider for stony patch I just want to talk about some alternatives so I know a lot of people are not in the DC area but if you're in a DC area and you want kind of reliable edibles then you know what I think a good alternative would be this this is Capital confections - came in here yeah yeah - came inside and the gummies are in the shape of puzzle pieces and I'll just take these out these are really good as well so it looks like this gummy and the gummy is sugarcoating oh it's hard okay so it smells sour and really kind of a sieve and the directions on the back I'm gonna read them for you they say nibble half of one gummy and wait one hour before consuming more I think that's a good idea cuz this is this also tends to be really strong I don't know if these particular gummies these gummy edibles are as strong as the first time I tried the good stony patch ones but a lot of people here on my channel had been telling me that when they try a sunny patch nothing happens it's fake like just nothing is happening so with that said in the fact that the supplier lady stopped carrying these all together I think it's safe to say that for a lot of people who Sony patch was like a scam but I promise for me the first time I tried sunny patch it was not a scam and the reason why I'm like making this video is because I finally got confirmation from the lady that introduced me to this edible that yeah this is a no-go now okay so this is why I am suggesting maybe if you are in DC try this and hopefully you'll get a better experience with this one okay so if you have any more questions you can let me know um [Music] these tastes really good and I like them and yeah they'll do but I really did like the stony fresh ones as well and I'm sad that they're kind of fake so yeah see you guys later bye [Music]", "0m8U7y-rv-E": "hello you guys and welcome back or welcome to my channel i'm bringing back a favorite i'm going to be doing some edible eating and i'm very excited for it i haven't posted an edible eating video in a minute today infused pink lemonade i think it'd be a really cute tattoo actually and these are one two one cbd let's see if i can open these because edible packaging is always extremely hard to open do you want a bite do you want an edible don't take it unless you're 21 or you have a card or you have your medical card do so so i'm not the biggest fan of how these gummies days fanned in this band not the biggest fan of how these gummies taste they just kind of like almost a bitter taste at the end but i know that it's the hd whatever speaking of tattoos it's fake but i really like it i'm thinking about it just thinking about it i swear i have tick-tock references to everything but sometimes i just decide to keep them to myself let's go for another one these make some good mount sounds though [Applause] so so that's about 10 milligrams of thc and 10 of cbd so these are definitely typically one edible is 10 milligrams of dhc so this won't be as strong because phd is what gets you high and cbd just calms you down you don't get high off the cbd but there are a lot of benefits to it i do have a link to um some cbd gummies down below and a discount code so if you guys are interested check them out i like the sound of this packaging so it's just knocking down my pillows back there so so all right you guys so that's all i'm going to be eating for now um i believe i'm going to be doing a another high asmr video so i'll probably take some bong you guys want to see more smoking videos don't forget to check out my patreon i hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you guys so much for watching don't forget to like comment and subscribe check out my second channel my instagram twitter valley underscore michelle underscore underscore and i will see you guys in my next next next video bye guys", "Lvu2en6ja6Y": "hey everybody in here with me take out your [ __ ] tame bird and I am back with you guys to do some edibles today yeah we're gonna do some edibles which is something you really don't see a whole lot up here on the gank actually you don't see a lot of edibles but I do got some here for you and I have to count it to lunchbox alchemy squibs these are 100 milligrams each these are the medical ones they got the medical em and we're gonna take both of these alright we are going to take both of these now the again these are by lunchbox alchemy and these are like a gummy fruity gummy not made with real fruit but fruity gummy nonetheless but so 100 milligrams of active THC no CBD and this our boat these are both cherry we love it cheering but uh anyway cherries were not their flavors by them they do have other flavors they got like oh wait no they have a blue raspberry that's my favorite so scratch scratch the cheering's is my second favorite the blue raspberry they got is phenomenal I love it and yeah they do have other flavors so if you don't like blue raspberry or cherry they do have other flavors I believe they have like a pineapple or a mango or something like that so anyway let's crack these babies open and take them alright so we got the second one we're gonna take here now really quick guys forewarning if you are not like used to edibles if you all have a low tolerance if you're a beginner new to cannabis you don't want to be doing what I'm doing right here you don't want to be loading up especially 200 milligrams if you're a beginner if you have a low tolerance somewhere between you know like 10 to 50 milligrams would probably suit you the best okay you don't want to overdo it with edibles because they can you know trigger panic attacks and stuff like that you will not die though always remember that if you were like if you take too much out of bulls and you start feeling that we're going it took too much and just remember you know in your mind that you're not gonna die okay you're not gonna overdose you're gonna be safe if anything you're just gonna trip out for a little bit maybe eat something and then go to sleep okay then you're gonna wake up and be totally fine some people wake up believe it or not and are a little bit high when they wake up I've never had that happen to me I've never woken up high but I've have had friends and tons of people you know that told me that yeah bro I wake up high man that [ __ ] was so good I [ __ ] woke up high I'm like what how does that work you must be only sleeping for like 30 minutes or something huh anyway so we got the second one another hundred milligrams two hundred milligrams two which for me still isn't a whole lot two hundred milligrams really isn't jack [ __ ] but at least I'll be able to feel it somewhat you know what I mean I I'm more of like a six to a thousand milligrams person believe it or not all right here we go here we go Jacob here goes ooh oh man like you get that perfect cherry flavor as you're chewing it but as soon as you begin to swallow it I don't know Lee's like how funky taste in your mouth really weird really weird anyway so these are the squibs all right say with me squid these are squibs by lunchbox alchemy they do have rec available at 50 milligrams these are the medical at a hundred milligrams because unfortunately here in the state of Oregon good old Oregon we are very limited on edible wise okay so like recreational limit is 50 milligrams of tea hc' then the medical limit is a hundred milligrams of THC so that kind of sucks altogether because that's not one especially compared to a lot of other states those of you viewing from those states you're you know so uh all right so these are the squibs check them out they're not badly priced you can get them for like anywhere between fifteen to twenty bucks depending on where you get the match and like oh yeah they're good they're not bad don't don't let the aftertaste fool you they're gonna do the job very well they're gonna work very well and you know it's just a bite-sized gummy that which is still good okay it's better than having to eat like this whole big [ __ ] whatever so nice little bite-sized gummy much love to lunchbox alchemy from mcdhh anq and yeah so if you like this video if you like lunchbox alchemy squibs if you like edibles if you like cannabis please drop a like on this video please share to your friends so they can also see that the light that is the squibs and until next time Andy here with macdanne entertainment reminding you to have a very big day today Mik take interchange this tank Entertainment Inc interchange yo past it got [ __

they've got the most [ __ ] awesome dispensary man um i actually got a gram of this green dot labs uh black cherry og butter from them and uh it was only only uh 18 too man in green dot it usually goes um more along the lines of uh 30 40 dollar grams but uh they have green dot for really cheap so if you got a medical card you can get it for for 18 plus tax a gram it's black cherry og and it does have a black cherry smell to it man i can't wait to dab some of this stuff in a little bit um let's review these doubting gummies and i'll be honest with you guys i went ahead and opened them to check them out i haven't eaten one yet uh but down here if you'll notice uh i don't know if you can see that but uh the um the thc they put in here is cannabis risin extracted from ice water hash so i mean this is a saliva edible um i just ate a [ __ ] brownie like an hour ago i don't know if y'all saw my video from that but uh i'm already starting to feel pretty [ __ ] high and you know me i got a i got a pretty high tolerance to edibles sometimes they don't even really get me that high i think i'm uh lacking this uh compound in my liver that they say like 10 of the population has that edibles they just don't do you like they do everybody else like me i get a really heavy body high but people talk about like [ __ ] tripping almost off the edibles like my my cousin for example man he gets [ __ ] so high off of just one of those 50 milligrams man he if he ate a couple hundred milligrams he'd probably be hallucinating uh z you know you know you uh uh [ __ ] i don't know man i'm just mumbling i'm a little [ __ ] up already you guys gotta excuse me but i think these are going to be really [ __ ] good and you know what else is kind of cool i picked up they have the stickers for them they have these just for free laying out and it's actually the sticker they put on here they had those at the dispensary um now what i thought's really cool about these they make an actual numbered batch uh these medical uh batch number and then these are batch seven and it actually has the strain up here of papaya cake and puntain pie and they only make 420 of this particular strain and it looks like i got number 158 of 420 so you see that it's kind of cool it lets you know it's a real small batch operation um probably a lot of care goes into these gummies now it's a really cool little tin way you open this is you just twist your palms in opposite directions and it screws right up i thought these gummies were were pretty cool looking right here where they got them placed in which one should we try first let's go with the green one first what do you guys think got a nice green one right here thc label it's 50 milligrams you have a pretty happy good gummy only thing i like is it got a lot of sugar in it i make sure back your teeth hurt a little bit there's mmm and it's got the hashy after flavor i love that man if you don't [ __ ] want to know you're eating weed go get some [ __ ] wanna gummies they taste like [ __ ] sour gummies you buy at the gas station but if you want to know you're eating a little something have a little bit of a cannabis flavor because i mean he doesn't [ __ ] like the hashy flavor of cannabis is great [ __ ] buy these gummies these are the hashiest gummies i've had so far man that's pretty good um gosh i have an interview today shall i do one more why not for the video ma'am 100 mil or 50 milligrams more gummy these are superior um other might as well give you a little review on this if you're into nicotine salts the smok uh it's the

auditorium or whatever right here in Los Angeles and I'm better Munch out on these stony patches that I just got a dispensary let's see how these are they look like sour patches I better take the whole 350 milligrams the whole thing I'm about to take the whole thing while I'm out here cuz I got like an hour parking and I'm not trying to really wait I've been waiting to eat them at the house but we've been out all day so I'm even here look the different colors they're little squares they're not the little sour patch figures and I got about like 10 of them so they smell like candy I do smell a little bit different in between they don't taste different that all tastes the same no matter what color they were um first time I ever see these they look like the exotic cards for some reason but they're edible got a matter dispensary for $15 so why not I will be coming back they get an hour to to see what the fix were and let you know they were worth the $15 or not so for now just stay tuned and Cheers and stay hi hi guys I'm back as I breathing for 23 hours later after taking 350 milligram edible I did not feel anything guys I went to the observatory in LA and I was up there for like 2 3 hours and they did not even kick in I had my moon rock art and I think after like 2 hours that I waited to see if they kicked in I just started hitting on the moon rock art and I got me it got me high as hell but these they didn't do anything for 15 bucks I bought these at a dispensary in Compton and yeah these are not worth it at all guys definitely 15 bucks down the drain but you know you pay for what you get or you get you get what you pay for and these two out of 10 don't even try ever if you come to LA so let me know if you want me to do more edibles don't forget to Like and subscribe comment down below and stay tuned and stay high [Music]", "FIvxTPO_x3A": "hi folks its flower child 1970 and as promised I am going to show you how to make homemade gummy bears the easy way this is the easy way there's so many ways on the internet I just this is what three ingredients four ingredients actually if you include the water okay so you are going to need Knox gelatin I'm gonna bring you up just so it's not crooked you will need Knox gelatin okay or brand name gelatin don't go I've tried to go the cheap route and just by no-name gelatin I'm telling you folks I don't know what these name brands stop having them but there is an extra ingredient or something that allows this to work so you will need Knox gelatin only two packets okay so I have my two packets of Knox gelatin you will also need half a cup of kind of oil which is kind of this oil or coconut oil infused with cannabis so this is kind of coconut oil a measuring cup because you need half a cup of hot water and whatever brand of jello you want to use today I am using grape okay so it's gonna get a little shaky I'm sorry so do not turn on your stove yet what you do first is put your dry ingredients in first so you're gonna add your jello I'm opening it up oh god I broke a nail okay so just put your jello in whatever flavor and use name-brand jell-o do not use no-name jello its I'm not sponsored by them or anything but it does make a difference folks okay you can try it doing in a cheaper way but I'm telling you it's not gonna work they won't set right though they'll separate that Kenoi 'el will separate from the jello and you'll get a two-tone candy gummy bear and it looks terrible and it tastes terrible so we put our gelatin in again you're doing the dry ingredients first grape jelly smells good my garbage aside and then you're gonna want to mix this really well so that you don't see the white crystals anywhere on top you can even do it this way just shake it about it works it either way of stirring it or just shifting it in the pot pan and I'm using a nonstick pot it's very important that you use a nonstick pot as well so I am going to add my half of cup of hot water I did boil it already and now it's okay to turn on the stove because you're putting in your water I have mine at medium art whoops terribly sorry about that just mix it around you're gonna want to make sure that the there's no clumps in here and all the grit is gone you don't want to feel great at the bottom of the pan you want to make sure it's smooth much like how you would make it when you make you jello so we're just going to stir this around for a little bit for a few minutes just to make sure everything's separated and something fell on my burner sorry so what you also need while that is it'll boil a little bit it's just on four but what you also need are molds okay and what I have here and you'll see it over on the other side once this mixture is ready and you will need one of these little plunger things but if you where did I buy these I think I bought these at bulk barn I think I bought them at bulk barn and when you buy them you get three of these trays which have 50 divots each they're little gummy bears 50 divots each so you get 150 total in three trays and you get two or three of these little plungers to suck up the stuff and the mixture and put it in here so you're not burning yourself or using a spoon or anything like that okay and because there's always overflow it makes more than 150 I have my other trusty Molde here with the emoji faces on them so yeah I mean it's pretty basic it only takes a few minutes what takes the longest in my opinion is having them solidify in the fridge so I think this is pretty well mixed yeah it's mixed so just because I'm going to rush it but don't rush it because of a mixture might not work out as well it's actually starting to bubble so I chose great because I find that you taste the can of oil I know it doesn't bother some people but I like to taste the sweetness and the sugar and stuff so I guess you could put it less than half a cup in there you could put a quarter cup in here depending on your tolerance but my tolerance is quite high I eat a fair bit of edibles and I do consume it by smoking it so throughout the day and so I use a half a cup of the can oil so it's pretty good right now I think I'm just going to add the can of oil okay so we're gonna add it slowly just make sure that it gets mixed in there's a lot of stirring involved in this it's just I mean I've watched different people do it online and I know some people just leave it be but I don't I prefer to keep stirring it because I find the more you're stirring it the more it's going to stay mixed together I find it separates a lot sometimes so just be careful of that be cautious and be aware because if they don't mix well when they're solidifying they separate and it gives you a two tone candy I don't like that I find the butter it just or the kind of oil separates from the gelatin and I don't know why that is so I prefer to do it mixing it a lot stir stir stir came and add the rest of it you know just see the gelatine ah oh no glad I noticed that it's a little hair there so you want to mix this once all the butter or the can oil sorry I keep saying butter and used to make it with butter instead of the coconut oil but it's just it's not butter it's coconut oil so I'm sorry if I keep saying butter I don't mean butter I mean it's kind of oil kind of as coconut oil so now it's starting to heat better and it's gonna boil up as you can see which is good you do want that but stir as it does that so you're gonna want to stir it for about five minutes you might have to turn your stove down like I'm going to do cuz I find that's bubbling too much I'm actually gonna lift it up off the stove and move you up I'm sorry my phone's getting a little hot I'm gonna move you over here okay you can still see hahaha sit in the bunk pot they're just silly to do that so yeah I'm oh five minutes four to five minutes you're going to want to keep stirring it as it's sitting on the stove on medium four or five degrees depending on how your stove how hot your stove gets but it's pretty well mixed even the stuff on the side is mixed into the pot I'm gonna lift it up just so I can see how well it's mixed and then it's all mixed and looking well together excuse me I'm sorry about that so I hope you guys enjoy this video I can't believe I've never showed you guys how to make gummies before but this is homemade gummies they're not gonna taste exactly like and the textures not going to be exactly like this way the way I'm showing you I mean they still taste gummy obviously because of the gelatin and this is the easy cheap way to make yourself some gummies you can use whatever mold you like but I prefer to use the little gummy bear molds and the emoji molds okay I'm gonna shut the heat or actually no I'm gonna keep the heat on low because the mixture kind of cools itself down when you're dispersing it into the mold so having it a heat source is a good thing because it helps keep it hot or warm depending on what temperature you're gonna keep it set at when you're putting it into the mold it's important not to have it too higher you're just gonna burn the mixture and it's not gonna work at all so I've got it on low because I'm going to get ready to put it into the molds and I move the pot back and forth but since I'm filming it I'm gonna put you in another spot yes so that looks really good it's mixed really well I don't see a lot of the remnants of the the cano around the rim which is nice that means I've been stirring enough and there it's gone off the spoon or the mixing spatula okay I'm gonna move you over here you're gonna see my broken picture on the floor I can't believe that happened to fell right off the wall and boom down to the ground it went and it smashed okay it's kind of crooked you guys are gonna be having crooked necks trying to watch this oops well I'm sorry for all the movement I'm just trying to get it so that I can film it set it like that then okay here we go you have our little little miniature turkey basters [Laughter] okay here we go so just take some up obviously you guys know how these little things work where are we start on this end okay and sometimes I noticed because it's so hot it'll squirt back out I'd yeah it's kind of hard to see that but just be careful this stuff is really hot so you just put it in squeeze it into your molds kind of at medium to fast pace because this whoops this stuff cools fairly quickly I notice when I'm doing them but you will get if you're using this small gummy bear molds about a hundred and fifty plus gummies yeah so you can once they are solidified I've noticed some people on the internet use sugar powder I can't remember confection powder sugar to sprinkle on them because they are a little oily from the kind of oil that's mixed with them but I don't do that I just keep them in the fridge and then if I want some because obviously the touched her when they're in the fridge constantly is a little harder than if you left them at room temperature once they are all solidified and ready to be eat so you just continue ba-ba-ba-ba-ba get them all in there squeezing as you go so yeah I just I couldn't believe I was looking through my videos going yeah indeed I've never shown anyone how to make the gummy bear so this is how you do it this is my way of doing it this is and I find the texture fine you just got to make sure that you're also doing this stirring it around because it does separate and putting it back on the stove is a nice idea to keep the temperature hot whoops making a bit of a mess but I mean I'm sure instead of using cannabis oil to make these like some type of edible or treat for the kids leave out the kind of oil obviously oops no there we go was a little raised up there we gotta have them even so they harden properly and they're all ready to go at the same time you know what I mean so I find this fun to do this I mean I love to bake especially when they're edibles we're almost done here folks I'm actually gonna put this back on the stove for a second be right back just noticed it was starting separate you don't want that to happen okay all right she didn't had the stove on hot so I might take a little longer for you guys if you have it on medium or low so obviously we're gonna get more than 150 there's 25 in each of those gummy bear sheets so we're just gonna fill these up now obviously the emoji the pink sheet that I'm doing right now is going to take longer to harden because they're deeper bigger so I won't be showing you those but I'm hoping that these little ones if I put them in the freezer will solidify really well and I'll be able to show you them in the video no guarantees because my phone's been really wacky lately and when I pause it it shuts off on my phone sometimes so we're getting to the very last of it and it will the last few gummies will be very mediciney because of the butter that stays behind that's really what I'm soaking up here I can just see the difference so I'm just gonna pour it in there okay okay so I am going to cheat and put them in the freezer alrighty and hopefully hey that looks see that that looks like the Mickey Mouse symbol you see that a little dollop right there two ears all righty so that's what we do so far so good okay got a bit of the counter in there that one was never used so I'm gonna put these in the freezer hopefully when I pause it it won't mess up but if it does I'm sorry and I'll show them to you in another short video so we're gonna pause it and put them in the freezer for about ten minutes okay see you soon folks and if not love and Huggies and I'll show you the finished product in another video if that's what happens okay so that's how you make gummy bears folks it's pretty simple it's pretty basic and it's really easy and quick it's quick nothing to it the longest it takes in my opinion is to solidify them in the fridge which is usually about 15 20 minutes but we're gonna cheat and use the freezer okay lemon honey see you soon right alrighty so it only took five minutes but here are some this is what they look like whoops it's just what they look like gonna eat one so yeah so there you go folks oh my gosh where's the camera here we go ha ha sorry so yeah they look like rug dummies they just taste a little different you know what I mean so there it is I'm actually gonna have a couple more and put them back in the fridge but there they are dummies ready to be eaten folks lovin Huggies stay true stay unique and enjoy I hope you enjoyed the video folks and I hope you give it a try and if you do please let me know how it turned out ok bye", "Rasb-rz1Hts": "- I love pot but, the people\nthat are making edibles need to slow the fuck down. (audience laughing) Oh my god, what're you\ntrying to do to people? (laughing) I had a pot gummy bear the other day. (chuckling) I think we can all agree a gummy bear shouldn't be able to steal your soul. (laughing) Right? What the fuck are these people\nmaking these things, man? (laughing) They're not consistent, that's\nalso part of the problem. You don't know what you're getting, 'cause they're not making the same place where they make Tylenol. (laughing) Now there's some greasy dude with a Grateful Dead tee shirt\nand a gray ponytail. (laughing) He's got a bowl of ingredients\nand he can't remember whether or not he put weed in yet. (hearty laughing) This dude's time traveling,\njust back and forth and just keeps chucking\nweed in there 'til it looks like lawn trimmings. (laughing) You eat it and that's not\nwhat you're looking for. (laughing) It's not regulated, you\ngotta ask questions. I ask the dude at the pot store, I go \"Hey man, how strong\nare the gummy bears?\" He goes, (laughing) That's not a unit of measurement! He's like El Diablo, El Diablo. (laughing) Fuck, man. How much should I take? He goes, just the leg. (laughing) Just the leg? Why you selling whole bears? (laughing) The fuck you tryna prove man? (laughing) They just watch you leave\nwith that bear they go, \"Oh shit.\" (laughing) They know, they know you're not gonna die. You gonna think you're gonna\ndie, but everybody lives. (laughing) Learn some shit, you learn\nsome shit from the scary trips. (laughing) See the thing about\nedibles, one of the problems with it being illegal, is that\na lot of us don't have a lot of information that we could use. Like there's a difference\nbetween smoking it and eating it. When you smoke it you get\nTHC, but when you eat it, it's processed by your liver, and it produces something\ncalled, 11-hydroxy-metabolite. That's five times more\npsychoactive than THC, and it lets you talk to dolphins. (roaring laughing and clapping) This is a real moment\nthat changed my life. (laughing) I was in Hawaii and we were\non a boat and we were fishing, we're pulling these lines behind the boat, and I was so high, I\nwas trying to figure out which way the Earth was spinning. (laughing) 'Cause then like the\nboat's going this way, and the sun's up there, I'm like, (long droning humming) (laughing) For like 20 minutes, I'm paralyzed. (laughing) So, while this is all\nhappening, these dolphins just show up, and if you've\never been around wild dolphins, they're very trippy. It's very different than you expect. Because, they look at you. They like check you out, they\nlike pop out of the water and they like look at you. (laughing) Like a person, not like a\nfucking deer, a woodchuck, they look at you like another person. Granted, I was so high I\nthought I was gonna die. (laughing) But, I'm making eye\ncontact with these dolphins and I start thinking, \"How\nsmart are these fucking things.\" (laughing) Because we're fishing, dolphins eat fish, but you never catch dolphins. (laughing) Ever. (laughing) No one has ever gone fishing and accidentally caught a dolphin. (laughing) And all I could think of\nwhile these dolphins are like hopping through the water\nand looking at us and shit. (laughing) I was thinking if people\nlived in the water, you fucking catch them all day. (laughing and clapping) They wouldn't even have\nto live in the water if cheeseburgers just\nfloated down Geary Street. (laughing) At least once a week a guy would be like, I'm taking a chance! (roaring laughing and cheering) And you see them get\nyanked up to the clouds. Fuck, we lost Billy, the\nbottom of his sneakers and a puff of cloud. (laughing) You don't caught dolphins on\nfish hooks man, that's weird. They're around fishing all\nthe time and like, psht bitch! (laughing) They're fucking smart, how smart? Well I watched a dolphin\ndocumentary, and it said, they have a cerebral\ncortex that's 40% larger than a human being's. I don't know what that means,\nbut if you say it right, and don't fuck up the\nwords, it makes you sound smarter than you really are. (laughing) (funky music)", "-C4haoCp-S8": "[Music] hey guys this is Janet with CBD apothecary solutions.com I just wanted to come to you today and talk with you about questions that I'm seeing out there quite frequently I'm not sure why but a lot of people are wondering if edible marijuana will stress or damage the liver and I'm not sure if they're looking to find out if edibles that have CBD in them are dangerous are damaging to the liver or if they're looking to eat marijuana and they're wanting to know if that damages the liver I'm so I'm not really sure what the reason for the question but I'm going to give you a lot of medical terms or medical advice medical information here some of it all make some sense of it some won't but in the end I'll answer your question in fairly layman's terms everything that you take in and you absorb goes into the small intestines and then it goes directly to the liver and goes through what's called the first pass metabolism and what is the first pass metabolism that's when a drug is metabolized before it reaches the body or circulation with first pass metabolism it greatly reduces the amount of drug that reaches our body therefore we need to consume more in order to get the intended results now let me explain what that means to you with medications that are taken orally or rectally by suppository they take longer to get into the system and they go through the first pass so we why are taking more sometimes of those drugs so that they will give us the intended there's a what we desire which is pain relief or you know Tylenol you know headache relief muscle muscle spasms for muscle relaxers just whatever you know I guess marijuana if you ate it hot if you're taking it from the CBD but CBD is not consumed like that so we're going to talk about that in just a minute the first pass metabolism does only occur with medications that are taken orally and by suppository first pass metabolism is not not going to affect the way you take CBD drugs are metabolized through your liver and mostly some in the intestines with medications that are taken intravenously or IV or intramuscularly with a injection into the muscles the large muscles which are usually their thighs your buttocks or your upper arms and sublingually which is under your tongue those don't go through the first pass metabolism they go straight to the body pass straight through the liver last meaning our arm sorry they go straight to the liver last meaning that it requires less to get the desired effect and less damage to the liver so let me go back and see if I can make sense of this for you pills that are taken by mouth or rectally by suppository goes through first pass they're the only ones which means they will go straight to the liver and bypass the body and the circulatory system which means we'll need to take more of them in order to get the desired effect anything that is taken by IV by an injection or under your will not go through first pass they are last to get to the liver your body gets more your circulation gets more they go through the circulatory system and your blood system and it takes less of it to get the desired effect and it hits the liver last meaning that less damage to the liver so it's probably going to answer your question right there in that if you're eating marijuana are you're eating edibles they probably are going to go through the first pass and it probably will require you to do more if you do like the sprays this is a spray it's a little spray container if you spray you just spray it right up under your tongue if you spray it under your tongue are you use the drops that you drop under your tongue those are probably going to be your best bet with CBD if that's what this is a you know I don't know what this question like I said in the beginning is about but if that's what it's about you know and if it's about marijuana smoking marijuana eatin edibles like brownies or whatever they are going to go through the first pass and those are not going to give you the desired effect on a smaller amount it's going to take larger and they are going to go through the liver and they are going to be a risk of damaging intestines or liver that's you know that's as I understand it the first pass effect on the many chemicals that are in marijuana is significant this means that marijuana products undergo significant metabolism when you eat them there are some drugs that actually become stronger during the first pass and one of them happens to be THC which means that the liver metabolizes more of the THC so as to your question about stress or damage anything that's metabolized by the liver is in in essence stressing the liver or damaging the liver in some way anything that's you know depends on what you're consuming and how you're consuming it if a product package says say THC jellybeans 80% THC and then you know that that jellybean has 80 percent THC in it but what the question is is what is the other 20% that isn't natural THC it's just that there are some important questions that need to get answered before you start consuming products you should always require a lab result document before you consume or use that product that you're purchasing especially when you're talking about CBD marijuana products THC 9 THC things like that you should always and if a company is on the up and up and operating as they should they will they will I repeat again and again and again they will have lab results that they can show you we at CBD apothecary have lab results that we can show you we can show you exactly what's in the product how much is in the product what's not in the product okay and you should demand that when purchasing these type products no matter where you go sometimes humans do weird things in the quest to make money so they will improve they will pressure investors to make consumables that have things in them that they might not should just for the gold rush just for the quick money so please be careful with that as with anything a person puts in their body exercise caution don't try new substances when alone always keep yourself hydrated when you try new products or new medication even doctors prescribed medication don't do it alone for the first time until you know how your body's going to react to it certainly do not drive a vehicle until you know what your body's going to do keep yourself hydrated during that process so that you know you know what's the difference and dehydration and the product if something's telling you that something is not right that something is wrong get medical help ASAP get it as quick as you possibly can or get someone to get you to the hospital to an emergency room and be a hundred percent honest with the medical teams don't lie to them don't don't flood what you've done you know if you've eaten around it is loaded with marijuana tell them that because they need that they depend on you being honest with them in order to properly treat you and try to save your life if it is a life-threatening product if you have to bring the package if you ain't brownies and and you have some of them left or you have the package remaining bring it they can take the brownies and test them so they know exactly what is in it in exactly how to treat you okay so be safe guys really be safe and know what you're putting in your body whether it's marijuana CBD or prescribed medications by the doctors we only have one body one guys and as far as I know you can't trade them in and you can't get newer models so until we talk next time may God bless you thank you", "dwhdujJvYFY": "[Music] hi everyone thank you for joining me today this educational video is about hemp oil edibles you heard me right edibles you don't have to take a tincture and hold a liquid under your tongue and may not taste very good and so forth just like vitamins come in gummy form you too can have a cbd product as an edible as a gummy as a chocolate as a honey stick hard candy the list goes on and on and on and i'm going to show you a few that we carry at our store just for show and tell so you can see what it looks like for example peach rings this one's very popular uh this is a six no i'm sorry this is a 1200 milligram jar by the way when you see 1200 milligrams you're not getting 1200 milligrams in one gummy this is 1200 in the entire container in the entire jar so 1200 milligrams you're getting 60 pieces if you're taking one piece a day it'll last you two months this one happens to be 20 milligrams per chewable hence 60 times 20 equals 1200 milligrams total this is very confusing to a lot of people because they think that they're getting the 1200 every time they eat one i hear it all the time no you're not you're getting 20 milligrams per chewable that's important to know because some people need maybe 10 20. we have some by mile high for example those are 50 milligrams per edible and sometimes you just need something stronger it just really depends on what you're trying to address so just remember whenever you see that big number it stands for the number the amount number of milligrams per container that one happened to have been a just your typical regular gummy but there's also chewables that are for example these fruit snacks this one is vegan has no dyes as you can see the color is more natural looking it's they're using fruit to color it so it doesn't have yellow number five and blue number three and what have you that's important to some people and then uh these come in full spectrum or broad spectrum or isolates and sometimes we have also a pm formula some of them have a little bit of melatonin to help you with sleep but there's different ways to take it i like tiger woods who likes his chin gum when he's out there playing golf and is stressed out and needs something to calm his nerves you can have a chewing gum you can have mints you can have chocolate fruit bites pistachio bites we have almond butter and honey in a jar that you can just take it out and eat it and it's delicious and you're dosing yourself with cbd just know how to shop for it though because about eighty percent of all edibles out there are made with isolated products so what that means is the cbd is it's just that it's just pure cbd when it's an isolate it's used in edibles because it doesn't have the waxes and the chlorophyll and it doesn't have that hempy flavor it's good but it's not great and when you're out there shopping make sure you ask is this an isolate is this a broad spectrum or is this a full spectrum now if you get drug tested at work and you're afraid that you may fail a drug test by all means ask for a broad spectrum or an isolate because those have zero thc and it will put your mind at ease and you don't have to worry about failing a drug test but you know there are some people who just can't have the tincture don't want to have the tincture and for those people i say well have a gummy it's actually very easy to port if you're getting on an airplane if you're at work and uh you want to keep some gummies or something in your desk great no problem easy to carry around i've had a lot of women who've carried their hemp oil bottle in their purses i've done it myself where you don't screw on the top totally and a little bit of that oil leaks and it gets in your purse it's messy and it happens it happens so that's not fun but you know what you can have a gummy a chewable chewing gum what have you and you can dose yourself easily that way and you can leave your hemp oil bottle at home and just carry some gummies at work and or when you're traveling just take the gummies i hope this video was helpful to you and making a decision as to whether you want or need an edible it's certainly very easy to dose to children and sometimes to older people who already take a lot of medication which by the way if you're taking hemp oil you can probably get off of most if not all of your prescription medication by taking hemp oil i can you can watch that in my next video where i talk about that and how it's benefited so many people and why they're able to get off their medication it's not a big mystery but there is a reason why you're able to do that i hope you enjoyed this video if you have any suggestions or comments for me uh for my next video please feel free to do so let me know with social media i'm happy to do the research and again thank you for watching i hope you have a beautiful and blessed day", "5BXoeB5n-YE": "[Music] we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review I am super super super excited because we are taking another look at flourish the first time we have taken a look at flourish in almost a year we are going to be reviewing their new flavor their hybrid grand-jury n-- gummies so a mixture of tangerine and cranberry really excited about this if you've seen in my florist reviews before these are my favorite gummies hands-down there are no gummies that come even close to the magnificence of flourish I love them love them love them a lot and I hope that this cran Jurina gummy does the trick as well so this is a 300 milligram edible picked it up for the leave $20 at my dispensary so a pretty good deal for a 300 milligram edible and it is for show it is a if it's like any of the other so it's gonna be tasty and it is going to be potent on the back here you got everything you want to see you've got your nutrition information your ingredients all that wonderful stuff there on the back this is a hybrid variety so it doesn't tell us what strain but this is a hybrid strain that they used so let's go ahead and open it up here and take a look at what we got oh it's different than it used to be this is not the way they used to have a package they used to have a package in one thing now there are four individually packaged gummies just like this still in there ziggurat shape let's go ahead and open up this cran doreen hybrid here and give it a taste new smells wonderful smells so good hmm now there is a slight weed taste to this one which I actually encouraged by means that there might be as all of that milligram \u00e4j-- as promised but it still tastes really good good solid fruity flavor like the texture like everything about it mm well flourish hits it out of the park again when it comes to the taste texture packaging all that love the packaging love this little box love it all but the most important part is it still gonna get me high cuz it's been a year who knows if they've changed the formula what the case may be for that guys you're gonna have to wait two hours oh no you're not gonna have to wait two hours I'm gonna have to wait two hours I'm gonna come back to you guys and let you know exactly how this flourish cran Doreen 300 milligram has landed I'm gonna finish those other two pieces off and for you guys it'll be just a couple of seconds so thanks for watching wheats and I will see you in just a bit several hours since I've had the hybrid flourish 300 milligram cran Jurina gummy and I am pleased as punch to say it is as potent as it ever was another knock it out of the park homerun sports metaphor for flourish I really like this one real quick it didn't have the most cannabis II taste of any of the flourish gummies I've ever had then again it's a 300 milligram edible certainly that potent at least in my estimation I got me up to like eight and a half somewhere in that range or maybe even a little higher and that was actually spread out over about five hours I only had about the first half of it over two hours and then took the second half two hours later just in the circumstances I was in it has sustained me there's 300 milligram edible has kept me high for about going on about five hours now so really we're impressed with its longevity with this flourish again just the taste outside the cannabis part was good I like the consistency like the like the texture of the gummy it's so much better than at a pure or infused creations even with that slight cannabis taste in terms of that bitterness that awful as cerebral cannabis tastes it's not present here just a slight cannabis taste and I'm harping on it too much it's just I surprised me I've never really tasted any cannabis in their products before but there was it was here but it lets you know it's gonna be as potent as it is I really really enjoyed this one another absolute - thumbs up for flourish for me sorry I've been rambling a little bit but before I go I want to share with you guys my little cherry on top something that is not necessarily weed related but could be really weed related that you guys might want to check out and on this cherry on top I want to share with you an excellent movie from 2017 one of my favorites from 2017 and that is Briggs bbear starring Kyle Mooney of the Saturday Night Live Fame he always plays this sort of dorky guy long kind of curly hair anyways it's the story of a guy who lives in a fallout shelter and every day gets a new tape of his hero Briggs B bear who tells him a different story and adventure about his galactic life and it's about this kid's obsession with this bear that he knows brings B bear and I don't want to spoil too much more because the movie goes in unexpected places and it is easily spoiled so if you are at all interested in something and this probably goes pretty well with weed to be honest so if you're interested in something that's gonna be a little bit different than most movies that you've seen be sure to check out brings to bear I want to make sure that it let you know that this is one of the most optimistic heartwarming movies I've seen in some I'm there are adult situations and language and all that in there but this is not a cynical mean-spirited movie even though it does feature some again adult situations check it out again Briggs to be there really really enjoyed that one and that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you making it to the very very end guys thank you so much and we will see you guys all on the next review peace", "ka1V0ztvt24": "[Music] hello goof-offs and jack-offs and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary although this time we are not going to be reviewing an edible we are instead going to be reviewing capsules delta-9 capsules to be exact 300 milligrams of THC 10 capsules in there with 30 milligrams each this will be the second time I have reviewed a capsule I reviewed I think it was gold caps the first time hated them a huge waste of money they were very expensive and they did nothing for me these are both cheaper and more potent I believe the other ones were 250 milligrams for 40 these were 300 milligrams for 30 so not a good sign necessarily but this is from Delta 9 this is why I decided to give capsules another chance Delta 9 is a company that I know from their chocolate I've reviewed three of their chocolate bars and have found them to be all amazing so I thought I would give their capsules a fair shake because I've never tried anything from gold capsule than there's one capsules and those were terrible so because this is from the trusty brand delta 9 or at least their chocolate is the trusty brand I thought let's give the capsules another chance who knows you might find some some gold here if not liquid gold so but I think I'm gonna do with these actually is I'm not going to eat them or take them all right off the bat I think I'm gonna do them in two batches 250 milligrams batches about 90 minutes apart so do all three of these over the course of the three hour span and come back to you guys two hours after the last time so this will take five hours in in totality to let you know how we're doing so I'm gonna take or four and a half hours I guess I don't know something like that so I'm going to do ten of these then come back to you guys in 90 minutes let you know how I'm feeling and then take the other ten and then come back to you guys two hours after that and lets you know how we're feeling with the whole batch so let's get started with this first half here let's open it up and just like you would expect this little bottle here oh and we've got our dastardly packaging which I opened nice and easy alright so here we go open open open here are what our capsules look like they're pretty handsome capsules white and green just like the packaging so let's grab five of these for now let's put the other five back in the model and let's take the five that we've got here and just uh I pressured that male life like I could choke okay [ __ ] it'd be funny did it choke thank you Ron Palmer love you alright well those pills tasted like plastic and amazing oh my god such rich complex flavors and those pills ooh still you know decoding all of the complex and just interesting tongue feel that I had with those pills of course I'm just [ __ ] with you who cares what they tasted like they tasted like pills I will see you guys in 90 minutes however to let you know how these first half of these pills are filling so I will see you guys in just a bit thanks for watching wheats and I will see you soon all right guys on back it has been about an hour and a half since I had the first five of the Delta nine capsules which is 150 milligrams of THC and I would say I'm already way higher than I was before when taking the gold caps 250 milligrams of THC definitely way higher than that but not outrageously high I'd say I'm at a four maybe a five somewhere in there so definitely feeling it which is a huge improvement but not you know this isn't like akarova 150 milligrams cookie um these excuse me these five pills um but we still have half the bottle to go so we'll see how much more these final five pills are how much farther they get us in the process all right so here we are we've got our final five these handsome little devils here we'll just do the same thing as before risk choking to death and take them all down in one go still alive that's got to be a sign of something so we've seen how it the first half go after about 90 minutes now let's see how the second half of the bottle goes and for that guys I will check back with you in about another 90 minutes and we will see if I am maybe at Delta nine instead of a delta for that kind of works all right guys I'll see you in about 90 minutes peace welcome back guys another 90 minutes has passed since I had the Delta nine capsules the remaining 150 milligrams and that seemed to do the trick put me from about a four to a straight linear about eight or so I'm quite high as you can tell from the eyes well no no no let's not say eight let's let's let's let's pump the brakes a little bit and go with a seven it's not let's not jump too far I think I'm maybe at about a seven but I'm pleasant with them I'm happy with where I'm at capsules I don't think are ultimately going to be for me these are a hell of a lot better I think than the gold caps the Delta nine capsules that's just on a sample size of one from both companies so you know take with that what you may but but my experience on these are a hell of a lot better than what I have with the gold caps and these were cheaper so that's a total win for Delta nine I don't think I'm gonna be purchasing them they're a little too expensive for me for what you get I do like the concept of them I do like the idea of capsules and just being able to like have something super super discreet that you don't even have to eat I just haven't found one yet that's as potent as I'd like them to be these are close these are close and if they were a little bit cheaper I would buy them on the regular for different occasions but as is I think I'm going to probably not be picking these up in the future but you know who knows maybe if they come out with different dosages or change the price or if I'm looking for something just to mix into a medicine bag or something maybe I'll maybe I'll still give these a chance and also let's give the wheats producer here round of applause for this back here oh my god isn't this amazing the wheats producer just which the they came in here the other day and they're like this place is a piece of [ __ ] we're whipping it into shape and I was terrified because if you ever met the wheats producer you would be you know mortified if something like that were to happen to you and look what happened you know a few days later we have this professional-looking thing in quotations thank you so much for watching wheat skies we will check you out on the next review Papa Papa peace great", "dO7VuHMBPhI": "[Music] what's up everybody my name is sarah b and welcome back to the haze today we're going to be doing another edible review we are going to be reviewing the very well known but new to me wild edibles so let's talk a little bit about wild in general they are a portland-based edible company and they specialize in using things that remind them of the pacific northwest and what makes it special and using those ingredients and those fruits and other items found in nature to make these awesome little gummies now in this box there is a hundred milligrams and there are ten small gummies i also want to just talk about real quick how the packaging is it is so cool so you open it like this and out comes this little pocket super easy to open you just squeeze on the side like this bam pop open and you will find these small little sugar coated gummies these gummies are made all with natural flavoring i absolutely loved these edibles they are not overly sugary at all which is fantastic they taste like a natural gummy something that you will find like in a trader joe's or something like that i started out with 40 milligrams and it hit it hit good too i loved it i wasn't overly i didn't feel dumb which some edibles can make someone feel dumb i didn't feel dumb i didn't feel like falling asleep was just so awesome i've been finding too many edibles lately that make you just want to pass out and these guys kept me up kept me going and once the high kind of wear it off and the after effects kind of left i still was able to have a great functioning day which is really nice i love the artwork that will did i love these little huckleberry flowers you'll see all over it and i believe every box looks a little different it goes with whatever the flavoring is which is really awesome on the inside it gives a little message and i'll read that for you the edible contains hybrid perfect for preparing for life's adventure it's a little like the perfect balance of wearing pajamas to work i just really appreciate the the thought process that went into the packaging and making of these edibles now i believe these guys are the number one selling edible in all of oregon and it makes sense they're based in portland but i found them also all over california they are a little bit more expensive than your normal edible but they are extremely consistent some edibles are really great one bag and they can taste great they'll be just like mind-blowing you can give a bag to your friend next thing you know they say it never hits them i don't believe this will be a problem with these guys i'd say if you if you were going to be hanging out at the house like all of us are right now but you're going to be studying maybe doing something for work i'd say eat one of these little guys and you're going to be chilling you'll be chilling you'll be chilling hard yeah so if you

"QHxhZ1_U4ns": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show YouTube's preeminent marijuana edible review show I only say that because I think I'm the only marijuana edible review show I'm sure if there was another one it would be the preeminent one because it's hard to have a worse one but what are we talking about here today other than how bad we are we are talking about gummies that's why I've got my Nutella and spatula here so that's what this is for this is for fat this is for fat for the real review the infused creation sativa strawberry apple sour melts strawberry apple sour melts what a weird combination don't even understand what the Apple is supposed to be in that strawberry Apple sour belts 300 milligrams of THC this will very likely be my final review of infused creations they've all been bummers from the get-go and if this one isn't doesn't pick up or it doesn't change my opinion in any way that will probably be it for infused creations and we can go ahead and write them up so I've got my fat here just with the gummies I like to ensure that I eat them under optimal conditions so I take a little bit of fat beforehand and I like to do that in the form of Nutella because I'm a red-blooded human being and I like Nutella like everyone who should creamy chocolate hazelnut evening delicious now for something a lot less creamy Nutella II and delicious this all of infused creations gummies we've got a strong whiff of it just as soon as I open that package have that very recognizable gummy weed aftertaste that very bitter a very astringent yeah makes you want to rub your tongue on sandpaper type of taste and I can already smell it coming out of these so I'm not looking forward to it this is smell strong boy does it smell strong I do like sour bells traditionally but I'm pretty sure I'm not going to like these anyways let's go ahead and put it right down the hatch let's stop bitching and complaining and just go ahead and eat it well oh my god that is terrible that is so bad oh [ __ ] me oh there's no like sweetness right on the get-go it's ah it gets worse just that awful awful awful aftertaste oh [ __ ] this [ __ ] these things are terrible but I'll do it for you guys so I'm gonna finish these off and I will see you in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part I don't we'll review actually in this case I'm pretty sure I haven't I'm gonna feel not high at all uh maybe the taste is the most important thing and the taste is [ __ ] sorry for such a bummer sorry to be sitting down and see you guys in two hours peace oh hi guys I'm back it has been two hours since I had the strawberry apple sour belts from infused creations and they are terrible boy are they terrible they taste terrible I'm not high at all totally stone-cold sober I feel like I wasted my money on these total total waste of money thankfully not does not cost a lot for the infused creations I believe these only cost me nine dollars which is really affordable for a 300 milligram edible the only problem is I don't think there are 300 milligrams of THC in there because I am NOT high at all not even as I said I yeah yeah nothing to say about it nothing nothing kind to say about it if you see it at a dispensary near you pass totally avoid it actually go and tell your bud tender they should not be stocking these because it's just an insult to their customers sorry to get so real with you guys and sorry to get so real with you infused creations I wish I liked your products more I just think that they are garbage thank you so much for watching weeds guys I'm sorry it's been a bummer over of you but hopefully next time we'll find something a little bit better thank you so much

"tFiPPb3WFG0": "hi well welcome to Diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular subscriber welcome back thank you so much your support has been truly awesome so I had a couple requests there for vegan gummy bears and as I said it previously in the past I tried it with epic fail and so but I am never one to give up so I kept thinking about the method I knew would have just something to do with the method so I I thought I figured it out and the fact that you're seeing this video actually means that I did figure it out so I've created a vegan gummy candy for you so it's not gonna be exactly like a gummy bear but it's gonna be about as close and probably with you being vegan this is probably something that you're far more used to anyway and and with that yeah so I'm really excited to be able to bring that for it to you and the one thing I decided is if I'm ever gonna want to pick up somebody rich I'm gonna pick up a vegan because seriously man if they can afford the Google's groceries or that kind of food holy mountain they must have money because that stuff is expensive so anyway I'm gonna get into the ingredients here and the steps on how to do it and stay tuned alrighty so for our vegan can of oil gummies you're going to need well now I'm just making a small batch because I'm testing it so I'm not a hundred percent sure if this is gonna turn out and I really don't feel like wasting a whole bunch however if it does turn out you're if you're seeing the video then you know it's turned out so I'm going to be using 1 cup of juice I'm just using a peach cocktail you can use whatever juice that you'd like just not pineapple juice because it has an enzyme in it and that will that I know causes gelatin not to set I'm going to think it probably has the same effect on agar you're going to use one and a half tablespoons to one cup of the liquid if you want to make it more so if you're going to go 2 cups of liquid then you would do two and a half tablespoons of agar 3 cups of liquid three and a half a garb so on we're going to use one tablespoon of blue a gob syrup a quarter cup of our can of oil now I've just used regular coconut oil I haven't infused it because again I'm not going to eat this so I didn't really want to waste it and there's really no difference whether I've got THC in it or not and we're going to use Gore gum as our emulsifier so we're no further ado and we're gonna need our handy little blender and a saucepan and a spatula obviously your molds and that should be about it so I'm just gonna get this stuff cleared up and we'll get going alright so we're going to turn our heat on - so we're going to add our liquid to our saucepan and we're going to add in one tablespoon of the aghasura that's a coconut it was a lot different than butter so what we're gonna do is we're going to emulsify our our oil and our liquid first when I've tried it the other way adding everything into the agha R it just didn't work so I'm hoping that emulsifying our liquid and our oil together first is gonna solve that problem so I'm going to use 1/2 a teaspoon of our agar our sorry of our Gore gum Gorgo Mogar it's very tongue-twisting if you have a strainer like a little small strainer strainer works great for doing the gums so because you can evenly distribute it all over the top otherwise if you have to do it with your hands just try and do it as evenly as possible just kind of take little pinches and sprinkle it around like so and we're going to get our handy little hand wonder and start blending this up [Music] all right so that looks all thoroughly mixed so that looks good all our oil is nicely blended in so once you're that it's all nicely blended and it is all one uniform nice uniform homogeneous texture you're gonna add in one and a half tablespoons a Gaur now you can get Oh Garf lakes or agar powder the flakes are less expensive the powder I'm pretty sure you would use at the same but you'd have to look at the instructions for it I just don't have a hue a lot of experience with us with it and a half a tablespoon is one and a half teaspoons three teaspoons is one tablespoon and you're going to turn your heat up to medium-high we're going to bring this to a boil and once it's boiling we're going to turn it down and let it simmer for five minutes so now that my mixture is coming to a boil I'm going to turn it down to medium medium-low and just let that simmer for five minutes or until it is completely dissolved and you just want to keep make sure to keep stirring that alright so I'm kind of seeing some oil the oil sitting on the top here so I'm going to use the blender here to see if we can get that mixed in there because that's not looking quite right [Music] so I'm still seeing it set up at the top here the oil on the top so I'm gonna add in some more I'm gonna add a little more girl gum so I'm going to add in just a quarter of a teaspoon this time [Music] well that looks a lot better all right so what we're going to do now is distribute this in to our moles so whether you're using your squirt bottles this might be a little bit thick for the for an eyedropper but you can give it a try all right so once your your syrup looks like this it's nice and smooth no lumps you can put it into your squirt bottle oops oh [ __ ] all right don't do that on the mold learn from my mistakes all right so I'm just gonna clean up that bottle we'll get this into molds all righty so now that I've cleaned up my mess now the bottle is going to be very hot so you want to wrap it either in a some doubled up paper towel or use an oven mitt or something and you're just going to distribute it into your molds now don't fill your molds all the way up to the top like I just did there that's an oops you want to keep them just below and that's so it doesn't create an edge a sharp edge on your candies now with agar you're just gonna leave these sit on the counter for a few hours for them to set they do not go in the refrigerator whatever you do a guard is not set in the fridge it is completely different than gelatin also has a very different texture well if you're vegan and you you use agar you know what the texture is like but for those of you too new to it are trying it something different it is a different completely different texture than gelatin I can't really describe it it is a gelatin but it's not jello it's filling these up and I'll come back in a couple of hours we'll take them out and see what happens right so let's see how these little puppies came out well they come out of the mold really holy mackerel they actually worked this time I can't believe it last time they were partially set and partially mushy and they were really disgusting but this this method actually worked so I did some reading on how you actually store these because you can't do them like a regular gummy bear or a regular gummy candy and with four agar actually it says but it's served best cold so actually once they're all set you know just put them on a plate put them in the fridge for a couple of for about an hour George's for them to cool down get cold and then give them a try so I'm gonna do that and we'll see how they are now these puppies just pop right out of the mold look at that lot easier than the jello look bear overboard alrighty so I put these guys into the fridge for an hour and so they're nice and cold and you can see how much they lighten up and as well they're not as greasy so when you first take these guys out they are gonna feel a little bit greasy once you put them in the fridge that tends that goes away but as I said you can probably see you store them in the fridge I'll just wrap them up in wrap it up with saran wrap and they'll probably be good for about two weeks I'm gonna guess if you find that different please let me know in the comments that would be great alright so that is the little tutorial there on a vegan can of oil gummy bears and I'll just be back to say goodbye so that was my little demonstration there on vegan and can of oil gummy candies I hope you enjoyed the demonstration if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments I will get back to you as soon as I can and I'd love to hear from you and let me know how yours turned out alright well thank you so much for watching I really appreciate it and if you enjoyed this video I do hope you subscribe thanks again have an awesome day [Music]", "tWt_5FJe4M8": "what's up it's budget baller not a sponsored ad one take review this is another three cheats my third three chia three cheat three peat this is the three cheek gummy comfortably numb 25 milligrams total plus delta eight plus cbn which is a new craze uh it's like cbd uh but it's made to get you a little bit more relaxed a little bit more chill uh none of the kind of psychoactive high properties that the delta 8 thc has but you're in luck because comfortably numb comes with not only 200 milligrams of delta 8 thc but also the 200 milligrams of cb and 16 gummies per pack 34.99 i think it was on sale for 29.99 on the website could even be cheaper i got a free t-shirt out of this uh because of black friday sale again i'm not sponsored not sponsored but 3g if you want to sponsor uh any of my videos go ahead send me some free i will not argue that point okay so you've seen my review on the tincture you've seen my review on the 400 milligram delta 8 thcs between these two is there any difference uh price point about the same uh these get you a little bit more kind of feeling you know nice loose uh relaxed the quote-unquote uh high you'd be looking for in the big brother of delta nine thc these if you saw my other review about the tincture these are more on the line of tinture uh this is again this is something you would take on a saturday you're watching college football during the day take one at night you know just kind of chill relax watch a game watch whatever do whatever i can make you kind of happy kind of loose relax but not like crazy these won't give you uh they give you a nice little feeling but it's not like whoa like the uh the 400 milligram but these uh do make you tired so if you're looking for something to sleep uh i'd probably recommend these better uh so this one gets you kind of the regular 400 milligram just delta eight gets you nice relaxed yay this one's more designed to get you chill and uh relax this is kind of like the nightcap this is kind of like uh the party with the bros bro party after night cap hitting hay uh so i think that's what it's designed for so in terms of that i mean these are kind of make you know i'm kind of chill these are meant to be taken at night kind of put you to sleep um they do that so 34.99 is it worth it 29.99 uh you can find it's somewhere between 25 35 range is it worth it yes but know what you're getting into these are the uh knock you out uh chill you out kind of sleepies these aren't the ones you take when you want to uh lower the nerves or get kind of relaxed for a meeting these bad boys the 400 milligrams are the ones uh you want to take for that during the day watching the game barbecuing doing whatever night time bad boys these are going um do about both i kind of take half of this half of one of these uh around seven i go to bed at like ten around seven i take another half of this around like 8 30. boom i'm dead i'm out like a like a light that was a horrible metaphor all that time thinking i came up with the most cliche thing ever i'm terrible um but yeah it's worth it these are nice again 3g uh this is not sponsored but 3g go ahead sponsor me uh send me a message i'll give you all my deeds for all the free stuff you can send me and then i'll just like bunch of baller i love 3g not really i try to give honest reviews uh but that's a review so this is my um i

"[Music] all right so hello i'm happy trailers and we're gonna do a tender and edible review excuse my crazy hair okay I had a phone call was it recording anyways he happy trailers so today and I'll excuse me I have my messy hair my didn't invited my double up they record it but it I'm not sure if it was still record from earlier um but anyways the video today's with me an edible review what the Caminos Kiba Caminos gummies the pineapple habanero I opened it up but I want to try it on camera with you guys the first time just like this um trip first time and this is pineapple one else's habanero like little habanero by be spicy we're gonna see it doesn't it doesn't doesn't look spicy another little chili flakes or anything in there okay pretty good whoa whoa Habanera just kicked them okay these are spicy it does bring your tongue a little bit um just a little just bring your tongue and don't buy second one dirt worm okay the heat does develop with more and more to eat at one time your hair I'd say three before mmm-hmm the heat builds up the more you put your mouth yeah it's hot spicy spicy these are spicy they are 100 milligrams for the whole bag or five milligrams for each little piece that you eat and they are spicy you don't like spicy don't get these or not if you don't like spicy you can't eat spicy do not get these it does have some fire to it it really does and we back in two hours that you guys know how I feel so hold on hang tight okay yeah it's been like two hours I'm taking a look back what I did ate the Hoboken Caminos after a 'those a look around five after I ate the whole pack I was like I'm gonna smoke a blunt so I rolled a blood this blunt Irie don't get high off the bud it was a 16 no 16 percent THC I'm story short I was like around 5:15 when I ate the gummies I smoked it like around six o'clock and when I smoked it um I got really high off that blunt I also go with but I forgot that I ate the gummies and then like around 7:30 wait right now is yeah like all right like well look bro it was six seven thirty when I took the clock it's a little later now that I'm high as and I feel like it's kind of a little bit it's a fine a little bit I don't know the blunt made the edible more like amplified but I didn't feel this high when I ate the when I ate the the other Caminos pretty hot sorry I didn't feel this high when I eat other Caminos which were the apricot that I brought to get this continue soon I'm sorry that my bun I'm looking here I'm sorry but um yeah I'm I'm really good I feel really high um I don't know if I if I sorry I don't know if it's because I smoked that blonde that made me extra higher or it's the Caminos itself I know I should have smoked that blunt but I figured that my high would have been down by now if it was the the weed like my I would have been I really like dead and gone so I don't think I'm sorry so I don't think that oh sorry someone's come that I know later you did the freaking Sun went down pretty quick so long story short these are a sativa those gummy is the pineapple habanero it's just at Eva it is the head high for sure and I got me pretty high I'm gonna lie I know that Blunt didn't I mean the blunt did it give me high but not this high because the blood high marijuana high went down already I'm sure right now it's about almost eight and I'm still like high not like to the point where like oh my god I'm so high like so stone no this is a cool mellow good little buzz high more than a buzz it's a head high it's at the t-virus one soldier's know that and the flavor is good but it's spicy and I hope this video could help someone out peace out toodles and happy trails to all my happy trailers and all the people that are watching bye", "QHu5YfavhGE": "hey YouTube this is Chris the Candyman again and I'm gonna teach you how to make some extra-large gummy bears first you need a double boiler a wire whisk silicon gummy bear moments you don't baking sheet kind of keep them steady first you want to add one cup of cold water to your double boiler add your one pack of six ounce flavored gelatin just kind of give it a little stir you don't want to bring this to a boil you just want to actually dissolve the gelatin into the water if you boil it too much you'll get a lot of nasty foam on top and the bottom of your gummies will be all like discolored and the different consistence next I add four tablespoons of unflavored gelatin give it a stir add one cup of my can of butter then I add a teaspoon of legend and a half teaspoon of citric acid and last I add my liquid sucralose and my terpenes all we have to do is heat it up and dissolve the rest of the granules gelatin into the liquids we'll be back for part two hey YouTube this is Chris I'm back again and this is round two making the extra-large gummy bears now after we've gotten all our crystals to dissolve I let it sit for about five to seven minutes and then I it lets all the bubbles and stuff get out of it and make sure there's no foam on it I'll give it a little stir you can use one of these little silicone eyedroppers if you want you just start filling in your gummy molds now this way takes a long time I usually don't have much patience for that stuff so I just usually pour them it gets kind of messy I'm going to try to get rid of all the little bubbles in there you can move them around pop them at the dropper that's another reason I like to pour them because usually it works out a little easier but it's still kind of messy if you don't control it that's just kind of how I do it though the back / part 3 now once your gummy molds are filled this is why you want them on I like a sheet pan or something because if you try to pick these up to like spill over I put them in the fridge let them fill for about an hour and we'll come back and check them alright hey youtube let's just Chris them back again and I just pulled my gummy bears out of the fridge and they're setting up really nicely as you can see these are almost about 2 inches by about 1 inch and then pretty big but you can make these as potent as you want all depends on how potent you make your can of butter and you can also add wax into it if you have some or even like you know like extracts or whatever else you have but that's how you do it they always turn out pretty good I usually set them out on a paper plate and let them dry out overnight a little bit and get a little more chewy but that's how I do it and here's an actual copy of the written recipe if you would like to try it out at home", "hFu5lMER7CE": "hey y'all it's grant Smith and I got some new medical marijuana infused gummy bears here to talk about and let's see these are called fruity bears by highly edible a can of punch company this is my first experience with these guys and let's see they're 25 of them and there's 10 milligrams of active THC in each one and I gotta say these are just so good I mean they smell amazing when you open that thing I mean it's just the best smell I've already actually eaten one of them and it tastes great so let me try this yellow in here and we'll see how how their flavor consistency is I tried to read one earlier really enjoyed it so let's give this guy a shot so 10 milligrams that's pretty good um good flavor there I guess that's a lemon not not very sour real nice and that's a red one I guess this is like a cherry or strawberry or some didn't really sign some right on knobs a really good one there and I guess I'll just go ahead and try this orange one these kind of tastes like those little gummy sharks that they used to make back in the day not sure if anybody knows what I mean by that but boy they were good so that's all the flavors on Wow those are good I could literally sit down and eat that whole bag right now if I wanted to um I'd probably be pretty high but goodness that is Wow excellent so those are fruity bears by can of punch and I hadn't really come across these guys highly edible is the name of the company so I hadn't really come across them before but I will definitely say I got a recommendation that is some good good stuff I'm not the biggest fan of the gummy texture but I gotta say these are very very enjoyable flavor texture everything and so if you come across these in the field I would say that you can pretty much rest assure these are these are a legitimate product and you know you're gonna be getting what you pay for they're very evenly dosed great taste and just a real enjoyable way to get your your medicine or to catch a buzz whatever you're in the market for there all right guys I hope y'all enjoyed it if you got any questions or anything drop me a line and I'll get to them as fast as possible peace", "JCOOZXVbq8k": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "Fr_5HHlZpDY": "hey guys this is bud mail reviews I've been away for a little while but we got some new stuff so let's get into it so today we're gonna be reviewing the DOS peach Bellini now I've never had those edible before I usually stick to Mota baked a couple other ones so I decided to try these guys out now these are the DOS peach Bellini I got the bigger pack so ten gummies twenty milligrams each gummy this is what they look like so pretty standard dose that's pursuivant so actually like half of that here you can see the line there so what do I think about these well you can already see that burn through quite a few of them but here's my main impressions of these in terms of taste this is eight eleven out of ten this is the best edible I've ever tasted in my life though skunky taste nothing offensive to the mouth it literally tastes like a peach gummy it's actually fantastic I can't rave about it enough it take and it's like it's like a luxury edible as well so it's not like some cheap like candy store I don't like gummy it's really good like the texture the flavor everything is good now in terms of potency um I consider myself to have a mid tolerance and I need about maybe two two and a half of these to get a bit of a buzz going but honestly like I got these for a pretty good price from bud mail they were reasonable they're nothing crazy for edibles or they're in the ballpark it's cool because they come in 200 milligram packages so it's cool you couldn't take one tell me instead of like three because usually down these are like 10 milligrams so yeah I definitely would recommend these great flavor and we got a CBD one coming up so I'm going to do that review and then yeah so keep it locked and we're gonna be back with more reviews coming soon", "K4Ll5lbckG0": "hey this is Jay the Kansas Explorer here and today I'm going to do a little product review from the edible company that we got from chalice while

vlog style video i'm actually gonna take some edibles and then we're gonna go out and just kind of have a day on day in the life on edibles so let's get on into this video so i'm officially done getting ready now i'm getting ready to head out and take some edibles so i want to show you guys this shirt really quick though um so the shirt i'm wearing is from light bulb connections and there's a really big pineapple on the back and it's super cute i'll have a link down below if you guys want to check it out and get your own and i have a discount code got the edibles and we're going to take the lip balm with us because i'm obsessed with this so now we are going to head out on so we are currently in my car and i'm not driving i just want to make that clear me and my mom are actually going to go just kind of like have a little shopping day at the mall or whatever so i have the zilla's 200 milligram gummies here the double strain i haven't opened the bag yet i wanted to do everything like with a reaction for you guys so you can see like my real reaction and everything like that so i'm gonna pop the bag open oh they smell really good let me show you guys what the bag looks like so they're double strength there are five servings per unit and this is what it looks like inside there's a whole bunch of them oh they look really really good who's excited to try so three gummies equal 40 milligrams so i'm gonna take the first one on camera very chewy very good so i just took three of the edibles and i think they taste super good um i'll be honest like i said in other videos i'm not the most gummy person i don't always go for gummies but even for someone who doesn't really go for a gummy snack these are really good they're really really nice so i already ate three which is 40 milligrams on the way to the mall i'm gonna eat another three so by the time i get to the mall i have eight and eighty milligrams and then we'll start our day so i took the edibles about a half an hour ago i took 80 milligrams and now we are on the way to the mall we should be there in just a couple minutes and yeah i'll check in when we get there so i just put my mask on hold up trying to adjust this real quick i'm not one of those idiots that drives around with the mask in my car i'm just literally about to get out of the car um i took like i said 80 milligrams about a half an hour ago i feel like i'm starting to feel like kind of high already though like oh like i definitely feel like a little high i feel like you even said i was acting a little high right what did i say oh i said business in the front party in the back cuz my hair was a mess but this was the front not the back yeah okay let's go i'm feeling good like i should dancing all around the neighborhood feeling blessed never stressed so currently at best buy it's been like two hours an hour it's two 39 so it's been about like an hour since i took them i'm definitely getting pretty high definitely can feel like a little bit of a high coming on for sure um but i'm in best buy and i'm just looking at like they're vlogging stuff and like i don't know i'm a nerd when it comes to like tacky stuff so that's what i'm just doing right now so we're in target now my eyes are like getting pretty freaking glassy bro and i'm definitely starting to feel like you know when your eyes just get that heavy feeling i'm feeling that so i'm looking at like surge protectors because i have like way too much stuff plugged into my room right now and like i'm scared i'm gonna start a fire this is two usbs and then it has one two three four five six seven eight nine times you can plug 12 things into this that's what i need but it's 42.99 i could probably find a cheaper on amazon if you like i don't even have a dog and i'm looking at dog stuff i've never heard anyone call their dog fido that's the oh look someone dressed their cat up into a cat look a cat was a lobster okay so now we're finding some cat costumes like they got like a pumpkin hoodie they got oh my god the butterfly set oh that's so cute that's almost as much as a freaking child's costume but it's cute so there's like fake grass here but it's like paper and i thought it was gonna feel like grass and it doesn't so i just left target and i was telling my mom because we were walking by like the pharmacy section and i'm like i don't know because it's like can you get tested for cova cvs pharmacy i don't know but there was this lady and she was like telling the pharmacy guy like her whole story and they went into this like little booth so yeah she could have been getting a flu shot but i was like maybe she's getting tested for covenant i'm not trying to be around here so i left because like i know you could get tested at like riding and stuff so i don't know if cvs was like doing the same thing so i'm like and like why would you be telling somebody your whole story if they're just getting a flu shot like it sounded like she was telling a story like why she was getting like probably wanted to get tested or something i don't know i just got like paranoid that's how you kind of know somebody's high when you get like paired when you overthink the stupidest [ __ ] i could care less though all right i kind of got the munchies though so we're heading to the car and we'll figure that out from there my eyes are so glassy and like you know when you just feel the high like go into your eyes like i feel like it's just starting to come over me i was kind of like should i take some more edibles but i think i think i'm just gonna wait a few minutes because like of how it's feeling oh i guess my mom just got a phone call i was like where the heck she going but yeah um it's 303 so it's been like an hour and 15 minutes since i took them um we went to best buy went to target and now um i don't know what we're gonna do i'm kind of hungry so i might just go home and make something maybe i'll pick something i don't know i really like don't like fast food anymore like i used to love going out to eat really fast food but i don't know i just kind of like making like healthy stuff at home now i don't know maybe i'm adulting so currently we're driving home to get something to eat because i just want to make something at home my eyes bro i feel like when i take edibles for me personally i don't know if anyone else feels like a lot of people like probably are like high and awake i get like my eyes get so small and i start feeling like i can't keep my eyes open and i just fall asleep so like i kind of feel like that like kind of like not sleepiness but like the eyes getting shut like low-key like mad mellow [Music] these edibles i just have to say are amazing it's been a long time since i got like really good edibles and got super high like i went to the dispensary and i bought 100 milligram edible and i felt [ __ ] and i only ate 80 milligrams of these edibles and i am feeling hella baked so would a thousand percent recommend just putting that out there just so everybody knows 10 out of 10 would recommend cause i know how it is because i've been thinking about you forever listening to gospel music while we're stoned the gospel is a different form i've loved the song for a long time i haven't heard in years ready is my favorite part i need jesus you're my defender you fight for me and i'm yes here on capitol hill so basically it's 3 30 too basically to summarize the past half an hour we've just been driving on our way home we just had to stop actually at a like a gas station just to get up some stuff um but yeah i'm pretty high i'm gonna put some snapchat snapchat clips and i don't know if i can they might get copyrighted but i'm gonna try to put some snapchat clips in uh that were really funny for me driving oh not me driving my mom was driving she's just in the store right now don't want to be like told i'm driving on edibles like me doing all that [ __ ] now my mom got me a forever rose and i'm like oh my god you got me a roast with the forever rose it won't die so it's like fake yes it's so beautiful thank you that really made my day was purple that was so thoughtful of you very well not like it looks you can really see it against the yellow so i just had some lunch i had rice and chicken i should have vlogged it but i honestly forgot and now i'm watching youtube i'm watching um the gram stefan show and he he just uploaded this three hours ago and it says i just lost two million dollars in tesla's lock it's just a slock tesla stock um i forget who's interviewing but yeah i should watch it's really interesting this is my cat monkey bear can you say hi monkey hey that person my baby so we're just chilling out together we love you it stopped raining out it's like pretty um what's the word like just gloomy and gray but it's like very humid oh i should show you guys an update on the grow so it's almost 4 20 so i thought it would be a

hi me and monkey bear hanging out watching youtube we're watching out this 18 year old sold 10 million in real estate in his first year and how he did it because i you know what i've always been interested in real estate i've been a fan of like the show uh million dollar listing when it first came on since i was a kid so i don't know i'm just watching it because i'm just high it has been a while guys it is 7 51. i have just been literally slumped just watching youtube eating food just chilling but i think i'm finally starting to come off of not really being high anymore like just like a slight bit of high but like you know what i mean like that just chill so i think i'm gonna end this vlog off since the edibles are basically done um i would a hundred thousand percent recommend these these zilla best thc double strength 200 milligram gummies they work so well i only took 80 milligrams and that's two servings uh yeah two servings and wait right yeah three cups equals 40 milligrams so yeah oh yeah two servings okay um yeah i took two servings oh my god okay baby i'm so high i took two servings and i was so high off my ass i still have like 121 120 milligrams in here that i'm gonna wait probably do maybe tomorrow or the next day just because you're calling not to do edibles in so long i've been loving the lip balm the zilla's pure and natural cbd lip balm been using it all day it's like a butter let me hold on i'm gonna probably all right here real quick i can see my pants here they're like bright ass green wearing my nickelodeon pants i'm wearing my labolic connection

huge thank you to zillas for sending all of this over i love it all so so much thank you guys so much for watching have a great rest of your day and say hi peace", "4h8sTpIMn10": "what's up everybody so this is something I want to say real quick about these way there's another review of doing about about the sweet and sour candies I wanted to do this one these are called watermelon candies and they you know they taste like watermelon varying got very sugar-coated type stuff you know comes with the standard thing they will tell you what kind it is indica oh I forgot the other one was indica - these ones are absolutely delicious these tastings is like watermelons um you can taste the cannabis taste in it but I don't care because medicinally holy crap these are awesome I need about four of them and I was doing pretty good I'm not gonna again again I could ate more and got completely medicated but it was okay um it just proves that these are pretty consistent pretty strong I always kind of liked the small touch this is why I'm talking about this company here I'm not sure where they are um everybody always says the bay but that's probably good chances they're from around the Central Valley or or one of those areas so I just wanted us a quick review on this one is that these are absolutely freakin delicious the watermelon candies I love them additionally they're freakin awesome the ingredients unfortunately the number one ingredient is corn syrup right you know again a lot of these sweets there's not much you can do about that the second one is sugar but the third ingredient is cannabis so that means that's a good thing as this there's more cannabis in this thing then there is a gelatin which is pretty awesome because that's what the mainly made of I'm just supposed to contain about 13 to 15 milligrams per candy I ate I can eat eight five and was doing pretty good again usually when I eat them it's between three and five and that's again if you really wanted to get you know screwed up I guess this is the word for it then seriously medicated then yeah you can get a whole bunch of them and you'd be doing good the consistency is pretty awesome every time we've gotten these is my good these are 30 bucks a bag for this I'm sure through the distributor they don't cost that much but that's usually what the price of going through a co-op is or dispensary but anyways for sure check out this product if your co-op your dispensary has it this is pretty awesome so again share subscribe and do all that other good stuff love a piece of chicken grease", "BwSxDovwTvg": "oh gosh I'm watching you cut me out of weird time so good to see you though welcome to wheats everybody goalie I'm so glad you are here gosh welcome to wheats you sons-of-bitches the marijuana review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and oh boy am I excited today because Kiva one of my all-time favorite edible companies is getting on them the gummy game and anytime Kiva makes a new product I am excited as hell to give it a try so that's right guys we are reviewing a Kiva Camino cannabis infused gummies they are flavor profile is dark and juicy and the effect is chill let's read the [ __ ] on the back inspired by the diverse landscapes of our wild and wonderful state let Camino transport you to a California state of mind our wild berry gummies pear calming indicator beans with notes of wild blackberry and fresh raspberries for a laid-back weekend vibe take a stroll through California's Pacific Northwest and relax a while so there are twenty gummies in here five milligrams each pretty standard affair for it the new edibles here in California with the new laws and you've got everything you want to see on it there are test results ingredients batch numbers all of that fun wonderful stuff and it comes in a beautiful package because it's Kiba keep it makes great packaging and it's not even that ostentatious there's not a whole lot you have to dig through or throw away it's just a bag but it looks really nice because it's keyed up and they make a nice packaging well let's shut up about how nice kiba's packaging is and talk about how good their gummies taste finger crossed and how high they're gonna give us double fingers cross if you're a long time wheats viewer you know that I love me my Kiva their chocolate I think it's maybe the second best edible chocolate out there behind defaults a delicious in potent AF that's a spot for that you see we don't know yeah I got open the child resistant packaging all by myself I'm a big big boy let's give it a sniff whoa smells good so there are our gummies in the bag let's take a couple of them out here they're a little bigger than I would have guessed much bigger than the plus size yummiest so here we are here are our Kamino Keva wild berry gummies a little cannabis e flavor but very fruity holy crap wow that is the best tasting canvas gonna be I've ever had it's so good it's so sweet it's so sweet it tastes like mmm god damn Kiba I'm legitimately not joking that's one of the best gummy candies I've ever eaten edible or otherwise holy [ __ ] [ __ ] Kiva man oh my god it's so sweet Wow mmm I'm not dreading I need all 20 of those gummies I'm dreading having the bag empty to be honest that is not hyperbole those are delicious those are delicious gummies but as we know we're gonna have to cross those fingers because gummies can be a little all over the map I found them to be getting better now that we're illegal world so I've got high hopes for these chemo gummies but like all our reviews guys I'm gonna eat all 20 of these sons of [ __ ] and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to actually let you know how these Kiva Comino are landing because that's what you're really in it for it so guys wish me luck I'm gonna enjoy eating this back and I will see you back here in about two hours thanks for watching wheats [Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome back to wheats guys it has been two hours since I had the Camino the Kiva Camino cannabis infused gummies and we're really going with that cannabis infused gummies named with all these companies aren't weight cannabis infused that is and this seeming to be the new enclosure du jour for all gummies going forward uh first and foremost these are the best tasting gummies I've ever had edible gummies for sure possibly even just normal gummy candies these are excellent uh and they are pretty damn good too um I'd say they're maybe not quite as strong as the plus gummies that I've reviewed a couple of which I really really liked but these are not far behind at all and they taste so much better than the plus gummies which don't taste bad to begin with it's just that Keva they have some witchcraft they they have some witchcraft and they can keep that nasty cannabis taste at bay nothing all cannabis taste is nasty but it's usually really gross in the gummies but not here and so it's still pretty potent today got up to about a six or so for a hundred milligram edible not too bad not too bad at all so I definitely enjoyed my first experience with kiba's and Kamino line and I yeah maybe three or four flavors and I look forward to reviewing them all because my boys at Kaiba dog and that guys is gonna do it for this review really positive here so anytime we have one of those positive reviews we like to put a little cherry on top a little some extra that you can enjoy throughout your week that isn't necessarily weed related doesn't need weed to help you enjoy it on this week it's something a little bit different I don't often endorse food but this one is such a good deal that I thought I had to give it a shoutout and that is imitation gruel not so not real gruel real gruel is you know it's it's okay but you pay extra for it the imitation gruel is amazing it's got a very sludgy texture a kind of would you describe it as kind of an earthy may be a dirty taste a dirt dirt a posture or dirt - white kind of tastes you know it's it's great um and according to Krusty the Klown nine out of ten orphans can't tell the difference so we are talking Kiva wildberry Caminos super thumbs up and imitation gruel Krusty the Klown says nine out of ten orphans cannot tell the difference and this guy totally agrees imitation gruel check it out I don't think you can actually find it it's from The Simpsons so maybe that's what my actual cherry on top is The Simpsons the good Simpsons not the bad Simpsons so season 9 and then stop Wow that went a long ways for that but I appreciate you guys watching thanks you guys are wonderful just such good guests and wonderful conversationalist so we feel like we have a real dialogue here you and I the audience so thank you so much for watching weeds guys I will see you on the next review I don't know why I said that so inquisitively goodbye this is taking forever goodbye", "G_jmMfjsKtw": "hi everyone so today is Sunday and it's a pretty boring day today I don't really have much to do today I have some housework but nothing like you know major that I have to do and it's cold I think he got down to like 0 last night it's cold here this morning I'm just gonna have my my tea and I'm going to be doing a review on the twisted extracts cherry jelly bomb cooking green bastards style sent this to me I never had this before so I'm excited it's uh it's 80 milligram THC and it's a sativa so that should just it should just be fine I shouldn't be you know tired I'm hoping I'm not probably not anyways let's open this up you can really smell the cherry oh my goodness okay so it [Music] so it looks like like this it comes in this type of thing and it looks like a Lego so I guess each um because it says eight eight by ten milligram doses so I guess each little round thing here is ten milligrams it smells it smells like cherry but it smells like um like the 1980s like the Cabbage Patch Kid when you first gotta go with that that could smell it had that but plastic I was just telling ed about this the other day about plastic smelling things it was like just a smell that came off the plastic anyways let's uh okay it smells like cherry it doesn't taste like cherry you could taste the THC in it I'm sorry but odors doesn't taste good like I thought the stuff from Dana bhisma was strong well this is really strong good thing I brought a drink that's tapas hole and it leaves like an after taste in your mouth wowsers okay so I will come back when I feel something I don't know how long it's gonna take probably not that long because I should have probably had something to eat like a toast or something cuz I only have tea in me so I'm just I should have maybe read the directions first but it just says um yeah you know it's eight doses we recommend first-time users which I'm not allow 60 to nine minutes for 60 to 90 minutes for effect before another dose is considered well I just took the whole thing so let's try the 60 to 90 yeah that's that's it there maybe I'll get a lot of housework done in no time after it kicks in who knows anyways I'm going to finish drinking my tea and I have bedding to do today and some other things so I will come back when I have let you guys know when this kicks in what I'm feeling all the good stuff okay so um because I didn't think through my date properly and I reached out the edible I am walking to the Metro if I need to pick up some stuff and I cannot drive now and it can't drive so this is going to be the experience I [Music] feel something I just don't know what it is yet so you know Azusa kicks in I will turn this on and let you know okay way back hey um the [ __ ] has ever started to kick in and this is probably not the best idea but I'm like not far I'm not far to go I just need to get there get the [ __ ] but I don't know my eyes really feel like they're high okay so like I think I'm gonna probably call ahead just so I don't feel so um edgy I guess okay I get closer when I get to the match our Altos heart because they should this is not good okay I'm just gonna at the match room and I'm pretty worried this this [ __ ] here just keeps kicking in stronger lighter for Edie I'm gonna do that now and then I'll show you inside Metro okay leave the grocery store and I feel like everybody is looking I'm getting a little bit paranoid here it's just like I don't even have anybody quick wheeze though the struggle is real I don't know what to do and it's just a wave okay I'm just going to get the theme so they need to get it and then I will come back after I hurry up in here and get outside experience I just really need to make it home and it seems like it's so far away [Music] lazy like my arm is gonna bust before I make it that but stuff there that cooking green bastard style sent me it's given it I like you know I like it a little bit paranoid like with the whole grocery store thing but like now that I'm I'm home I'm okay I'm not feeling tired I'm feeling it's kind of relaxed and when I rolled up the joint so I'm gonna smoke that like you feel relaxed and you feel like does not let you feel lazy you just feel like doing easy tasks there's just seen Charlie he's like looking at something over there now what but you're a you just feel like not really doing much I don't know what's going on with this the the twisted extracts that jelly bomb it's good it smells like you know it's a cherry but I will be honest the taste is horrible it kicked in roughly like and like an hourish thanks what is that guy's name cooking that cooking is a cooking green bastard style [Music] so thanks cooking green bastard style I'm not feeling too hungry or anything like that like I kind of like this stuff would be good to do I like on a really nice fall day when there's lots of leaves all over the place and you're just like in the bush like in the trail or something like that like when you know how many people are around right like this stuff would be good I think you would like I would like it I'd like to go walk on a trail and when there's more leaves mmm that's what I learned to talk about okay well the leaf thing I just on my way home there was some like really nice red maple leaves that's we're on the sidewalk and I was like I just thought it was really pretty but in the Metro everybody was looking at me like everybody and by the time I got to the cash like the cashier I didn't even make eye contact with her I just saw debit and Jetley when she was I guess meaningful I wanted a bag I just kept my head down so yeah there's some paranoia with it and I'm just gonna finish this and get on with my day so it's like that's it that's all bye", "WMwvIJ4BUgI": "hi guys welcome back to my channel for those of you who are new welcome my name is Amanda and today I am reviewing the Jessie PD gummies this is my first time reviewing a CBD product and this is actually the first time that I've tried to CBD product so let's go ahead and get into it this video I wanted to cover why I was interested in testing on a CBD product and it's because I've experienced a lot of anxiety stress and I have a hard time sleeping sometimes sometimes it'll be hard for me to fall asleep and sometimes it'll just be hard for me to stay asleep I'll wake up multiple times throughout the night and so I just won't get that great of a sleep so I wanted to find a product that relaxed me so I turned to CBD just to try it out I basically just wanted to try to find a product that would help me relax and help me sleep better or feel less stressed a little bit about the just CBD product and brand I saw it on Instagram and so I decided to give it a try if you're interested in trying out just EVD I will leave my referral code or link down in the description box below the product that I got is the just CBD gummies and I got it in the rainbow ribbons they're basically like rainbow ribbon candy gummies with CBD in it I started out with the 250 milligrams size I believe this is a small size they offer but basically it contains about 20 pieces in here each piece is about 12.5 milligrams of CBD and you can tell that I just finished my container and that is why I wanted to do a review about it based on their website it's as adults typically take about 20 to 30 milligrams of CBD and you can up or lower the dosage as necessary so that would be about two pieces of this gummy ribbon but I think the suggested dosage or a recommendation maximum is about four pieces I honestly don't know too much about CBD but I know it does not get you high so you won't feel those types of side effects with this product it does say on the website that it'll take about 30 to 45 minutes to take effect so it just takes at a time once you take the gummy if you are interested in purchasing from the just CBD store or the brand I do want to note here about they do charge a foreign transaction fees so if you can try to use a credit card that with no foreign transaction fees just to avoid that moving on to my experience and my review this again was my first product that had CBD in it that I was testing out and so I didn't quite know what to expect and I started out very slow I started out with a dosage of just one gummy and then I moved on up to four gummies starting off with a taste I think it was pretty decent I love gummies so I was excited to try a gummy product with sweidy in it and it did taste kind of like gummy rainbow ribbons but I feel like sometimes I'm a little bit sensitive to taste so certain pieces I could taste more CBD taste than others if that makes sense it just tasted like something else other than a gummy candy as far as taste goes I feel like I would purchase this again based on the taste it tasted pretty good I could continue eating product like this in terms of how well the product worked however I think that's a little bit of a different story I did start out with one piece and then I gradually made my way up to four pieces as a single dosage I moved up in dosage because I didn't really notice I was getting any results from one piece or two pieces or three pieces so gradually I made my way up to four pieces and unfortunately at four pieces I wasn't sleeping any better it was still hard for me to sleep I still felt stressed I think sometimes when I would take the CBD gummies I would feel slightly more relaxed but I don't know if that was just with SIBO fact or if it was really helping me but overall it didn't really change or improve the quality of my sleep I was still very anxious and stressed out when I slept and didn't sleep any better that I noticed so based on the results that I got from the product I probably wouldn't purchase this again I might try a different product affairs or just taking CBD in a different form but I just want to share my experience with you just to let you know how well it worked for me or didn't work I'm excited to try different types in the future if you are interested in purchasing or trying this out again I will leave my referral and the description box below but I can't personally say that I would purchase this product again if this video helped you please give it a like and don't forget to subscribe for more videos like this I hope to see you in the next one thank you so much for watching bye",

two birds one stone right now I'm D carving after I made these tacos many titles they're delicious but yeah I'm getting reclaimed this is probably about like a grandma something like that also the

updated here's smoke well", "i3oUc6F0rUw": "[Music] hey guys this is Leon and you have reached the vibe tribe today we are gonna be making a Tincher with cannabis infused alcohol we have it right here this is called Everclear it is 190 proof and just to say how strong it is vodka is usually 80 proof and this is a hundred and ninety so it's very strong it is illegal in most places I believe in Canada the only place you can get it is Alberta but I will put a link in the description of where you can order from I've heard of people having success getting it that way so the first thing we have to do to make Tincher is we have to deke our VAR marijuana which I have done in a different video I will put it also in the description ok so after you have D carved your marijuana you're going to measure out 7 grams you just need to get a little scale like this you can get them from a 420 shop on the scale here it's 7.0 which I have already done for all of my jars so I have 3 separate jars here there is a lot of people that say different things on about how long you should have it sitting with the alcohol and the marijuana so I'm going to do a little experiment and we are gonna try out three different ones to see which ones are stronger they all are the same lead so let's begin so the first thing you're going to need to do after you like I said after you D carve your marijuana the first thing you're gonna do is break it up and put it in one of these jars you're just gonna break it up and smell their little pieces like this breaking up the weed before the tin sure helps release the trichomes faster which are the resin glands of the pot plant so that's where the THC and the CBD and all the other active cannabinoids are so you have to break it up to fine it's not going to be oxygen exposed for very long interesting fact tin sure actually dates back thousands of years and is in the Guinness Book of World Records ever clears and the the Book of World Records for being the strongest alcoholic drink in the world so that's pretty interesting [Music] so I'm not breaking this up very much just a little bit just to expose all the trichomes that are inside okay so this is a very effective way to extract the cannabinoids out of marijuana alcohol does really well with that so you're just an open up your every clear from the reading I've been doing supposedly you can't smell anything but I can smell things so I'm not going closer I'm not a big fan of alcohol myself but I do like the gummies made from this alcohol so you're gonna do it at 240 mils we're just gonna get close everything doesn't have to be perfect we're just gonna get it as close as we can that's good enough and you're just gonna pour that right in there [Music] I've already broken up all this weed that are in these bottles everybody is different with with alcohol and with with marijuana everybody reacts differently with it I personally get really sick when I drink alcohol but for some reason I can handle eating the gummy bears that I'm gonna make from this no problem so you're just gonna seal those and also if you can't get the Everclear you're not able to find you can always use Bacardi 151 proof which you should be able to find in your local almost or LCBO or wherever you go you're just gonna shake it so there has been people who think a couple hours is long enough to be able to get an effect from this Tincher and there's other people who think longer the better or longer the stronger so whatever and you want to do we're gonna do a little bit of our own experiment to try it out and we will see what happens there I really think my opinion longer the better because with even cooking oils if you let them sit for a little while not too long because they do go bad I find what the cooking oils but if you leave it in there for three months it is better than when you just make it so I guess we will see after this is all done so for now we will let you guys go and we'll be back in two weeks one eternity lay down alright guys we are back it has been two weeks and we have let our Tincher sit in a cool dark place I shook it three to four times a day as you can tell it looks very green it did get greener the longer it sat in there I noticed after a couple days it was not really too green but then it changed a lot darker as we got closer to the two weeks so you just gotta take off the lid and you can get one of these little strainers probably from likening the entire there's anywhere that sells kitchen stuff and some people use coffee you know coffee filters but i i've always used this for everything so i'm fine with this so you just put this little guy in here like this and you just pour it in so the reason why it turns green it's actually the chlorophyll which gives the plant to the green color it helps the plant out in a whole bunch of different ways but that was why the teacher turns green and chlorophyll is actually very good for you it has a lot of health benefits including like helps you with aging and increases red blood cells and it is a very good antioxidant so you just want to try to get out as much as you can [Music] okay and then I just want to take one of these little guys and just push it out so for me the alcohol smell is still very strong but I'm very sensitive to the smell of alcohol so that's probably why and if you do have any issues with alcohol if you've had an addiction with alcohol in the past I'd probably make gummy bears with coconut oil instead because you don't want to have a relapse and I will do another video about how to make it with coconut oil as well so just let that drip much you want even leave it sitting on there for a little bit make sure you get all of the teacher out of there and then all you have to do is put the lid on it and store it in a cool dark place until you want to use it and that's how simple making teacher is so I'm gonna make something out of this and I'm gonna come back to you guys and let you know how at two weeks it turned out and then I'm gonna come back with another one or four weeks let you guys know if there's a difference between the two and four weeks and then I'm gonna do another video on the six weeks to let you guys know if it does matter the longer you leave it so we will see okay we'll be back tomorrow I'll let you guys know how it went see you guys later eventually alright well I went ahead and I tried might intro and I have to say at two weeks it turned out really great I'm very happy with it so I'm really excited to see what the four and six weeks turn out like because if it's stronger I probably won't want to eat a whole gummy bear I found one gummy bear was fantastic which I will make a video about how to make gummy bears the best way to use Tincher is actually putting two to three drops underneath your tongue and just leave it under there for about 30 seconds and then swallow and then it goes directly into your bloodstream so it is the best way but you can actually put this in you know a couple drops in a cup of warm water you can put it on your food you can put it in gummy bears anything you really want you can use your drops for so I hope that helps you guys with any pain conditions or just if you want to relax but I'm very happy with it so I hope you guys enjoy the video and I hope that you have no problems making it if you do let me know and I will be more than happy to help you out so comment like and subscribe to the vibe tribe see you guys later peace", "zaml88FpweU": "all right what is up everybody Jacobs back with another video for you guys quarantine video I've been staying at home that's about it some exciting [ __ ] for you guys this time though we got some sour patch dummies right here 500 milligrams straight to the dome you know we're doing them so it's like I believe it's like 10:30 in the morning so I'm gonna be in candy in the morning but which I don't like but I feel like this is gonna be a really good high so I wanna like have it last the majority of the day instead of like taking it like later in the afternoon then falling asleep like halfway through the high or some [ __ ] I don't know got these for $25 from the not from like directly from a dispensary but from a friend of mine so yeah there's a pretty good price I think if you were to go to like a dispensary or something they usually charge $10 per hundred milligrams so kind of a good deal but yeah I'll show you these guys again know if you can see right down there 500 milligrams yeah 500 huh so yeah let's dig in so that's pretty cool just like I don't know little sour patch kids they don't look quite the same the sugar is kind of weird it looks wet and another thing it says on the back here five servings per container serving size one piece but there's like just way more than five pieces in that I don't know if you guys can see but we're taking doesn't taste like weed at all it's a lot better than that nerd rope I had that [ __ ] was like I don't think I like nerds I don't know but I did eat like a banana like I think an hour or 45 minutes ago just to sort of like activate my metabolite I don't know but oh yeah and something else I forgot like I figured like people would just figure did I do it that way but like I keep like I got a lot of comments on the last one I did like the nerd rope the nerd rope 400 milligram edible I think it was there were a lot of people that like just thought that video was like one video or like one time I think like I just got a bunch of like comments that were like you know edibles take longer than 10 minutes to hit and I was like well you really think I've like a weed Tube channel and I don't know the edibles don't hit immediately after you eat them so I mean I don't know I mean but just this isn't gonna be the whole video like I'm gonna check back in like an hour two hours whenever I start like really feeling high and that's gonna be me then later so alright cleared the whole bag we're out of these shits so I'm gonna check in and like last like an hour maybe two hours maybe three hours however long this takes to take effect yeah I'm gonna take one more head of this [Music] little baby hit but yeah I'll check back in with you guys about two hours or so so peace alright so check him back in guys it is now 2:30 so it's been about three or four hours and I am [ __ ] high I'm so high like I just feel like good and like cozy like I don't know in movies right now I'm on yes man with Jim Carrey shit's hilarious but yeah I just been chilling and I had two bowls of cereal but ya know how feelings [ __ ] good this is like holy [ __ ] this light that I have for the lighting like he's really [ __ ] bright yeah I would definitely recommend these who these things are [ __ ] dope they smacked me in the face cuz holy [ __ ] I'm I like him actually like I don't know I feel pretty good about him at least right now edible you know just kind of chill cuz yesterday I got like I drank so much like an I passed out I'm so tired and I threw up it was just like a horrible day so this just yeah it's a lot nicer everything like I don't know everything I look at like specifically focus on like looks very like clear and like clean but then everything else behind it is it like such an intense like a blur well yeah I'm just really chilling you know like this I like I said this is definitely a [ __ ] fire edible I [ __ ] with this i 100% recommend it but I'm other than that I have no idea what to talk about I kind of just want to know getting my [ __ ] back get in my bed and watch this movie so yeah I'll take one last rep I haven't been smoking too much we're hiding actually I had a couple reps of this like I think three hours in or so not too long ago he's dying but I did that because I was like kind of feeling the body high a little bit but I was just like nervous that it wasn't gonna be intense enough for whatever reason sometimes he sings some like a [ __ ] hit or miss but yeah so I smoked and then I like got really high and yeah I think I'm like getting maybe close to like the full effect I don't know how long this will last but I think usually the potent ones are the more potent the longer it lasts so maybe it's still building up but either way I'm just trying to chill out so I hope you guys are

today i'm going to show you how to make sugar-free gummy bears with coconut oil for these sugar-free gummy bears the ingredients you're going to need is your coconut oil the gelatin something to flavor your gummies so these are just those sugar-free flavoring packets that you put into your water these ones i have are kool-aid sour green apple and i'm also going to make some of them with some sugar-free crystal white lemonade so you can use these flavor packets of any kind that you like or you can also use these type of sugar-free water enhancers whatever you'd like to flavor it will work i have some citric acid because i want mine to be sour again you don't really need citric acid but if you do want to be sour this is how you'll do it if you don't have citric acid and you still want them to be sour you can crush up vitamin c tablets um which will really give the same effect i have some spray which i'm going to use for my molds and soy lechen which i have in capsules like this but you can use the liquid version that would be better so you can do soy election or you can do sunflower election um ideally you want to do the liquid one not the pills because i'm going to have to break these open to put them in um the liquid one on amazon was just like kind of expensive to deliver to canada so i just went with these so you need these to keep the coconut oil from separating um from the gelatin and water mixture and then if you don't want to store them in the fridge and you want to be shelf stable so you can just keep them in your drawer in your pocket or wherever and they can last for months you're going to need a preservative this is a potassium sorbate mixture it's very very simple to make i will post a link below on how to make this all right our first step is to bloom the gelatin so this is very important to make sure that your gummies have a proper texture um so we're going to do this first before we do anything else because we have to let the gelatin sit so we need half a cup of water so you're going to want a larger dish for this if you have it in a smaller dish the surface area of the water will be a lot smaller so it won't be as effective so you could use a pyrex dish or anything that's like a little bit bigger than the average bowl so we're going to put our half cup of water in here and then i'm going to sprinkle three packages of gelatin or if you're not using the packages you could use like two and a half tablespoons of gelatin so i'm trying them now after they've sat for a bit and i feel like because it's hot in here and it's summer and the last time i made these it was winter so it's a lot colder i think i would use a little bit more gelatin so maybe like add an extra package or um another tablespoon just in case it's hot where you live um so that it doesn't so that it stays like fully hard enough it still does look fine like this though but if it's really hot in here it might melt a bit so good so you just want to sprinkle these over the water so you're getting as much surface area as you can some of it will overlap and that's okay and we're just going to leave this to sit for about five minutes no stirring just leave it as is so while this is sitting and blooming we're going to add a couple more ingredients to it um we're just going to put them directly on top they don't need to be stirred in just yet we'll just get it prepared for when we're ready so the first thing is our potassium sorbate mixture we're going to do 1 8 of a teaspoon of this we're going to add some citric acid again this isn't necessary but if you want them sour this is what you'll use for your vitamin c tablets and i'm going to do about half a teaspoon because the mixture the flavor packets that i'm using these kool-aid ones and crystal light already have a lot of citric acid in it and i don't want to have too much or it will break the gummies down so we're just going to do half a teaspoon and then we're going to add in our legend if you have the liquid kind you can add in about half a teaspoon to a teaspoon in my coconut oil i already have legend mixed in so if you don't already have that in your coconut oil you're going to want to make sure you have it in here i am going to still add some tear just for safe measure as i don't have that much in my coconut oil oops so i'm going to do two um little capsules i'm just going to cut them open obviously i'm making a lot of a mess and not even really much of that got in there okay let's just do another one here and we can just leave this for now um there's no reason to stir it in we will stir it in when the gelatin has bloomed i do want to mention that these gummies because they're sugar-free and aren't using um sugar or corn syrup they're going to have a little bit of a different texture than a regular gummy bear so they're going to be a little bit more jello like but i mean to sacrifice it's a sacrifice i'm going to take for less calories if you are looking for a gummy that is more um like an actual gummy i have a video on that and i'll post in a link below now let's measure out our coconut oil we're going to use a quarter cup you can use a little bit more a little bit less depending on how strong you want them to be just don't go over half a cup i think that you would need quite a bit more gelatin if you're going to do that so i'm going to spray my measuring cup just so the coconut oil doesn't stick to here and we don't waste any of it now i'm just going to pour in a quarter cup and i did take this out of the fridge a while ago so that it would liquify that way it'd be easy to pour now that we have this measured out we can warm up our gelatin mixture so we'll just take this and kind of um solidify it into this little i don't know mushy thing so we can just take that whole thing and add it into our little saucepan and we can bring this to the stove okay now we can turn the stove on to medium heat and we will just let this melt while i'm waiting for this to melt i'm just going to spray my silicone mold so they're ready once everything is done okay it looks like this is melting a bit more now just wait till that's fully melted now we can add in the coconut oil so i'm just going to pour in my coconut oil and just i should have been whisking that at the same time actually so pour it in slowly and whisk while you're pouring it in that'll help emulsify it and make sure that the oil isn't separating from the gelatin mixture so let's make sure we scrape this all out so i'm just checking to make sure that the um oil and the gelatin has binded together and it looks like it did and i believe that's because of the soy legend if you don't use soy election it probably will not bind properly and you'll find that it will separate so the legend is an essential okay now i'll just wait this um for this to start bubbling a little bit we don't want it to boil but we do want a couple bubbles to form um and then it should be good to pour into our molds so while it did emulsify together i feel like it could be better so i'm going to use my immersion blender now i know not everybody has an immersion blender which is why i was going to try and avoid using it um so while this did separate a little tiny bit the gummies would still turn out fine um i mean it looks pretty good but because i have an immersion blender i am going to use that to combine it all a little bit better but that isn't necessary if you don't have one [Applause] so i can tell it's starting to heat up quite a bit um i can see the steam coming out so i'm just gonna lower the heat a little bit so i'm like medium low now all right so again the emulsifier is not required but if you have it it's a nice touch to just ensure that everything is evenly distributed that way for your dosing you can really tell how much coconut oil is in each gummy whereas if you don't have the immersion blender and you're just hand whisking it there might be a little bit more coconut oil and one gummy over another so i want this to heat up a bit more and get a little bit thicker so i'm going to turn the heat back up to medium and just a few more minutes until this thickens up a little bit more all right we can finally see those little bubbles starting to form i think that means that it's about ready so let's just stir that a couple times and then we're gonna turn off the heat so i just turned off the heat this should be good to go now i want my gummies to be two different flavors like i said i'm gonna do the sour cream apple and the lemonade but you don't have to do two flavors you can just do one so now that our mixture is done on the stove we can add the flavoring but because i'm doing two flavors i'm going to put it into two separate bowls if you were just doing one flavor you could mix it directly into the pot okay so i'm going to add my flavor in and you can add as much as or as little as you like you could also use like i said those little liquid water enhancers so in this one i'm going to do the kool-aid sour green apple oh my gosh it smells so good that color is so pretty just make sure we don't really have any chunks left in there we'll just kind of squish them up with our spoon you want to make sure you're doing this while it's still warm you kind of have to act fast because it does kind of like form a layer on the top so we have to act fast to avoid that if not we could just throw it in the microwave for like 20 seconds so i don't know i think one packet is enough but it's hard to tell i'm just gonna taste this and see okay so it tastes good with just one package but i think i want a little bit more you can kind of taste the coconut oil a little bit too much alright that color is even better it's so green now i'm going to flavor the other one with some lemonade no okay well i'll taste that that needs more lemonade i'm really glad i added that citric acid in there too because that sour taste is so nice i almost could have had more but i mean it's risky because you don't want to break down especially because lemonade is pretty much already all citric acid and of course if you want you can double this recipe it won't have any um effect negatively you can do it double tripled whatever works for you oh yeah that tastes so good now that we've got our flavors mixed in they're ready to put into the molds so i put my molds um on a tray so that it's easy once they're filled to pick it up and put it into the fridge um i've just learned that after a few times of having to try and pick these up when they have gelatin in them so i'm going to do swirls with my two colors um not necessary but just how i want to do it now that i filled them all up we're just going to put them in the fridge and we'll wait until they have solidified i think that's going to take about like 10-20 minutes my video just cut off but they are done so i'm just popping them out of their molds and then i'm going to put them up to dry so i'm just going gonna leave them under the hood fan and my microwave um for about 24-ish hours i just want them to kind of dry out and that way um all the extra excess moisture is gone and then i'll just put them into a little baggie and keep them in my drawer they look so cute don't they anyways i hope you guys enjoyed my video i hope you guys enjoyed my video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe i love hearing from you guys hope you have a wonderful day bye", "du95Chc11fE": "what's up everybody welcome to the channel so today i will be talking about the purpose of lecithin and also how to use lecithin in your edibles so let's get into it [Music] so lecithin is an emulsifier so what it does is bind all the ingredients together so according to research what lecithin does is increase the bioavailability of the cannabinoids so your body will metabolize more cannabinoids and terpenes which will have an effect on your edibles also lecithin will help improve the chef life of your product so remember lecithin help buying your ingredients together so without using lecithin your ingredients may separate so when should you use lecithin i use lecithin when i'm making cannabis capsules kennel butter and can oil all right guys so i got three different types of lecithin here to my far right we have the powder in the middle we have the granule and then we have our liquid all right now that you are informed on the purpose of lecithin and how to use lecithin let's go ahead and add our lecithin to our recipe so what i'm going to do i'm going to show you exactly step by step on how to use the thing so let's get into it all right guys so the first thing you need to do before adding the lecithin is to carve your cannabis so what i'm going to do now i'm going to put this in the oven for about 30 minutes 30 to 40 minutes and the oven temperature that i'm going to be using is 240 so let's get into it [Music] all right guys our cannabis is now the carb so now we're going to add our carrier oil so for your carrier oil you can use coconut oil butter hemp oil olive oil but you need some type of fat to bind with your um cannabis for this demonstration i'm going to be using coconut oil so while that's into it so now what we're going to do i'm going to add the coconut oil to the mason jar [Music] once you add your coconut oil to your mason jar add your vegetable so since i'm using less than two cups of coconut oil i'm only going to be using one teaspoon of that now i'm going to put our top on our mason jar [Music] and now i'm going to get ready to infuse our cannabis using the mason jar method turn your stove on low add your pot to the stove put your mason jar in the pot let your mason jar simmer for a minimum of two hours so the double boiling method is for anyone who doesn't have a mason jar add your pot to the stove once your water start boiling reduce the temperature and then add your bowl to the pot now add your coconut oil [Music] once your coconut oil is completely melted add your cannabis add one teaspoon of lecithin [Music] now i'm gonna let this simmer for a minimum of two hours alright guys so i've been two hours so now what we need to do is filter out the cannabis so i'm going to be using a cheesecloth to filter my cannabis so let's get into it so what i'm going to do is i'm going to put my coconut oil into a mason jar uh if you don't have a mason jar you can just put it in a bowl or or some type of container so we're going to cover the mason jar with the cheesecloth put my top on [Music] alright guys my cannabis coconut oil is now done so once again just remember always add your lecithin after you add your carrier oil to your cannabis so just keep that in mind guys thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe peace [Music] you", "g6A5U7nJ_a0": "looking for a way to make your own vegan cannabis-infused gummies at home in this video we will show you a quick easy vegan gummy alternative that sets up in minutes and only requires a few ingredients plus whatever cannabis distillate or infused oil that you'd like to use because this recipe is vegan and it's so simple these gummies do have a different consistency from traditional gummies but for those with dietary restrictions it's a great option this recipe is going to use a powder called agar agar or it can be simply shortened to agar this is a powder that you can buy online or from health food stores agar is derived from a type of algae so it's vegan friendly anyway let's get into the process first get all of your ingredients together you'll need one cup of fruit juice this will be the base of your vegan gummies you can use any flavor but in this video i used a tropical mango juice blend you can get creative and use any type of juice that you want and the type of juice you use will determine the flavor and color of your gummies two tablespoons of white sugar or agave syrup this will help to add sweetness 2 tablespoons of agar agar powder and this is what gives the gummies their gummy texture liquid or powder lecithin this is an emulsifier which will help to combine your oil-based cannabis concentrate and the juice which is water-based since water and oil don't mix on their own you probably need to use an emulsifier in order to make sure that everything gets mixed well you'll also need an activated cannabis concentrate you can use a cbd oil a thc distillate infused coconut oil just anything that's an activated cannabis concentrate here are the directions in a small saucepan whisk together the fruit juice with sweetener and agar agar powder bring this to a simmer while stirring constantly simmer for 3 minutes while whisking to avoid lumps remove the mixture from the heat and allow to cool slightly add in as much or as little cannabis oil as needed i'm adding about 100 milligrams of cbd to this batch and then you'll stir it well use a dropper that comes with your gummy molds to fill the molds with the liquid and place in the fridge for 30 minutes to an hour remove the candies from the molds and enjoy be sure to store remaining gummies in the fridge in an airtight container for up to two weeks discard them if any of the gummies show any signs of mold before two weeks this recipe is so easy anyone can do it if you have a hard time finding a gar powder or lecithin for this recipe we recommend checking with your local health food store or supplement store so there you have it infused vegan alternative gummies at home using just a few ingredients but this is just one way that you can pre-dose your cannabis oil into bite-size little bits and store them in the fridge so then you'll have them there ready for you whenever you want them let us know

stuff it's from those lol edibles companies 300 milligrams I thought this was cool it actually says the strain so ya know to pop these open and check them out I notice there's some stuff here that isn't filled out but I almost think this packaging is in preparation for next year when it when cannabis is actually legal so anyways we'll check him out that's a new strain for me I've never heard of that Pablo Escobar ROG so yeah we'll open these up and take a look okay so the first thing I noticed immediately after opening this is the smell he's just incredibly strong really smelled like weed it's not gummy it's like one one big whoa I thought it was one big piece okay so it's a bunch of little pieces my mom like they're really sweet with a little bit sour on them I don't even taste the herb just working to really smell it it's crazy that's what they look like and I will eat these and get back with you in an hour or so [Music] yeah died within an hour so once the party started and didn't let you know how they are someone be there okay so it's only been about 20 minutes in but so like I said I'll check back in with you here in an hour I just wanted to say that I can feel at least the start of those kicking in 2025 minutes after eating and that's pretty quick longer them than other people so we'll see goes on these I'm used to taking like 250 milligrams like taken for her dose and those said 300 so should be pretty close to what I'm used to stick let me get that in through the end a minute there's been a few okay so it's been a little more than an hour I was waiting to see if it was kicking and any more than I did so it seems like I don't know if just the strain doesn't do it for me or if the milligrams are incorrect or off I don't know but I felt a little bit of an effect at the beginning of eating those and and then nothing after that so I don't think I would buy those yeah cuz I've tried another animal at like 250 milligrams they work for me for may have something to do with the gummy the gummy stuff maybe maybe there's those double digest as well for me or it affect me as well but it seems like the baked goods that have butter and then really affect me whereas these gummy things with just the extract I don't really feel it where I don't metabolize so anyways just one of the way I know my take on those those sour gummies that had the Escobar og from lol lol animals wasn't wasn't one I would buy again but that's okay it was a freebie so it's good to learn now I rather than actually paying for one you don't like there you go thanks for watching hope you liked it", "ro8rNrOkLpQ": "hey what's up everybody just doing a real quick review on these little mini chiba chews from medical patients only um this is uh sativa caramel and i don't

my style ha who I really am Yatta Yatta you know facebook facebook page TAC chronicles Facebook page THC Chronicles Instagram and Twitter so looking up look up Scott session where THC Chronicles thanks a lot have a good day", "FYppuGvTvNU": "[Music] hey what's up YouTube but I just want to do a quick review of a local edible maker I asked my co-op where these came out of and again they did said the day how they I don't know they always say there's probably bad thing about living in the small town you do get a lot of stuff that is just kind of fancy name thrown on it and how we get our stuff from the bay when in reality they get right here in this area and they don't want to it's it's dumb but it's a justify 60 and 8 type stuff so anyways this is a group called candy care this is stuff was called sweet and sour this is 400 milligram these are gummy bears are not gummy bears but it's like you know like the sour patch kids that when I was a kid when my grandma or one of them I get a quarter or whatever I know I'm probably showing my age but why not get a quarter I'd run down to the penny candy store and to pick up sour patch kids or sweetest fish or you know that cost if I select the dots you know the ones that came on the piece of paper she could rip off that kind of stuff anyways this right here these DS of this little off they got the leg game warning on them but in the back it gives you the main ingredients so the way the ingredients work is the most ingredient that's in it is supposed to be number one ingredient so the number one ingredient is to sugar invert sugar which you know I'll look that up in my next review I'll explain it what that even is corn syrup which is well not good for you but high fructose is worse so this is the third ingredient so but probably to keep the sweetness in it and then the next is cannabis extract my friend corns probably tartaric acid citric acid by the natural and artificial flavoring yelling number six red number 14 number five number one so this is supposed to contain about 10 to 12 milligrams per candy and I was okay so I the most I've ever ate of these is five and it was a very good relaxing a few hours well if I probably ate more I couldn't even got more medicinal up I'm sure of course duh but as far as again as far as taste goes these are very sour which is awesome there's been a couple ones I've gotten in from larger companies who this this sour was there so much so that's why show you looking get it real close you could see it's got those crystals all over it so I'm sure that's why the sugar and the invert sugar if sure that's probably what the invert sugars but very sweet very sour and they also have you can vary in certain pieces you can really really taste the cannabis enema so this is for sure something that I've wanted to pass along if you're a cup if you can by chance get these than I would for sure get these because the medicinal effect is pretty good so this is something to check out for yourself the candy care sweet and sour 400 milligram candies please be sure share and subscribe and all that other good stuff love peace and chicken grease", "TLJAD3uMWTA": "what's up guys welcome to Austin blood is asking drugs ASMR edition alright what's up guys welcome to hospital bugs and dad today we got something new that I've never really tried I've only tried a little bit but never really got the full length experience but anyway what we're trying today some are [ __ ] edibles but bowel cancer so what we got today I never tried this before I'm using uh-oh so the reason one is so [ __ ] bright right here is because I have a little lamp and that has a connect to it that's why I clamped it onto my tripod and so I'm just using the edge of my camera right here I mean on my desk I'm using the edge of my desk to hold the tripod and I'm just blocking in my room cuz right now it's like 1:30 in the morning I'll get back to y'all in an hour [Music] [Applause] let me do some

I didn't want to spend money on something that I didn't know was gonna work on me or not because I have read some people there's some weird reason don't don't feel anything so they get no side effects or anything and I'm guessing what I'm one of those people cuz I didn't get any side effects I've I mean I've eat brownies before I know that I do get high off right homey brownies again I ate up

torment them I gave heroin like heroin I always tell don't go for a piss test cuz you never know what's it oh my god hey gave me a bottle of THC liquid that was a thousand milligrams because you could take another syringe when I saw the syringe for two minutes ago I'm gonna bring it just to petrify away I just yeah but I just chase him around I think he won't come back from it like he'll never come back from me coming in here with a bottle we go the therapist and tell her on your Friday all he can give you a shot he doesn't know no no no this wasn't even a needle of it this is just the thing

saw the dog I'm never coming back pack of cigarettes and never came back maybe right if it scares you I'm not gonna argue with you oh yeah I was like you know Lee's had enough in this life this is funny because nobody anymore like he knew about it and I was very surprised we were talking about matters I grew up in a generation and not hers uh-huh I spoke about it this week and a lot of states that I grew up at a time that have the light in New York you know when you press the light and it tells you like 14 uh-huh there was a time the light didn't tell you that really just yeah it just went to yellow and then [ __ ] red yeah but junkies would be at the light waiting across the street and they would not at the light and then they would like the whole wing oh my god they would go down on one knee and then get up I mean I grew up in a generation and others and I was telling him that one time a guy nada up we got witness jersey city was where you got methadone uh-huh so when we get on the bus to go to high school we get on the bus with mothers that took the bus like if you took method don't think it'd be like a free bus pass yeah yeah like last week you gave blood and they gave you a file of your certificate yeah because heat a cookie and the soda they give you file out it's the same thing when you go get the methadone if you went down there they give me like a bus pass and something else and this guy was our methadone sitting on the bus already done and he had a newspaper opened it was open and he was drooling and the drool was connected from his lip to the paper Greg Garcia and there was just a big circle and this [ __ ] was him you know how buses are yeah what his popping all around he wouldn't wake up and what's wrong and those days we shoot spitballs at you like we got on that bus and he want heroin we would torment you me and my boys art or mention these are the last five minutes of happiness the whole week spent almost fit balls that you and [ __ ] I go I got this and I blew a fart like one of those yoo-hoo cuz in those days I used to always have a butter roll and they you for breakfast and that goes right to your [ __ ] there's no cereal as though Bo in Jersey it's a butter you who just bread and you he'll never forgot that blew a fart and this guy was out out like he was like this this is exactly what his eyes did Greg guy seems like this one he looked around he's like man what the [ __ ] is wrong with you guys they got that shot like pulp fiction that they give to people in there when they're too too high on heroin either and they're going they run out of that shot you could probably bottle your farts what do you mean bottle your farts get it to the the the paramedics do the whole smelling salt industry is exactly it's so [ __ ] funny I have a friend who was a junkie dear friend we still talk every day's my brother he's my brother I've known since I was and he went through a rough period and whenever they would so when he was my roommate he was on heroin I was just starting comedy in New York and it's a job was every Thursday he went through the park that move a few rocks and they give him $140 and food stamps and he'd go to the city and Kretz rather than for heroin you know and they give him a bus pass but I wait to get on the heroin I clipped the bus pass every Thursday to come cuz I used to work in the city so for me to go until they City my friend's father drove the bus but even if I had to be at work at 10:00 I was so poor that I would have to get up at 6 o'clock bus because he would let me out for free uh-huh now I could sleep late so I would clip his bus pass then he'd get high on heroin he look at me goes I know you stole my bus pass a [ __ ] I used to call the pin cushion at the time he was my roommate and he would get he would go clean from Sunday to Thursday and then he'd pick up ten hundred and forty dollars I didn't get like a grandma call and whatever you could and was he sick from Sunday to Thursday he would sleep and he was yellow stripes Lee's at me I call me a loser and tell me I never be atomic and I loved them I know he what he was going through someone's time that I might give him ten bucks and tell him to go fix his [ __ ] uh-huh but once Thursday came he would go into his grandmother's room and start [ __ ] blasting and I mean when you went into that room they Greg Garcia there was blood on the walls you thought Sharon Tay Ninh gotten killed from him missing the horn like and he would have to spend his whole Monday wiping down the walls I mean he was losing a gallon of blood every [ __ ] weekend Aloha so me and my buddies used to call him the pin cushion we'd see him walking back over the bridge and we beep out and get in the car you thought it was now he's cleaning himself like nothing happened but she knows when people are lying like as soon as princes playing pulled over he called me and he goes Prince got about a week left I swear to my mother's grave really yeah he sees it like one time we went to do with the Artie Lange show and when we left he goes I don't know what the [ __ ] he's getting these high or yeah no he's not he's been sober free but this is no way that's so long yeah else so it was funny yesterday he calls me out of the blue and I'm with mercy and with my daughter watch the news and I pick up the phone when what's up

medical perspective to do that we're joined by dr. maria campos doctor thank you so much for being here ok so in terms of ingesting the cannabis in in in the form of an edible how is that different from smoking it or vaping it so the main distinction is in the way it is metabolized and it's psychoactive ingredients so we know that when cannabis is smoked or vaporized it is heated it is converted into Delta 9 THC which is the active ingredient that is transferred from the lungs to the bloodstream and into the brain within a matter of 10 minutes the effects will last about two to three hours whereas with edibles the ingested cannabis has to first be digested by our system and then it has to pass by the liver where it is converted into its active metabolite which is completely different it's called alpha hydroxy THC which is an a more potent and longer-lasting active metabolite so even though the entire process takes about one to two hours the effects are more stronger and they can actually last a - even 12 hours okay so those are the psychoactive effects what about the effects on our biology if it's going through a completely different part of our body in a completely different way what are the health effects of that so we know that for smoking for example there's the inhaled carcinogens the irritants and the carbon monoxide that can enter our lungs and lead to serious respiratory health effects or vaporize cannabis we know that there may be a less from less harmful alternative however we don't still understand its full health effects with edibles there's no carcinogenic effect so many consumers may prefer this method of ingesting it however the risk is more related to the overdosing of cannabis so that was one thing that I read a lot about in the Colorado experiment which was everything was seem to be humming along very very well and yet people didn't know how to how to dose themselves properly with the edibles at all so a lot of children were getting into it that's a separate conversation yes and that takes us back to the way it is metabolized which for people who might be first-time you in those couple first hours where they're not having any in effects they may be tempted to ingest more and then that leads to the more serious adverse effects like paranoia hallucinations psychosis that can last for prolonged periods of time lastly what do we need to know what else do we need to know about this new frontier in legal cannabis so one thing is like you said the public health concern that there is with accidental ingestion by children or even by our pets that you know poses a huge health risk to the population but also the fact that we shouldn't be consuming it with alcohol and that we if we have any other health issues that we shouldn't really be consuming cannabis all right well if you don't know now you know dr.

to do is use your syringe needle to get some tincture and put it into each of your gushers now if you measure out your tincture in advance you can know approximately how much is in each so if you do a tablespoon of tincture you can divide it by however many gushers you end up filling and that's how you can figure out how many milligrams is in each gusher i have not yet tried this with coconut oil

beers so in my last video I did the unboxing you know when the products came into the box and how they shipped them and you know etc etc but was in the box this is the actual review of this alright I got some other products but right now for this video I'm gonna be reviewing these the gummies so I got chill gummies sour beers and another package somewhere around there I don't know where these in it anyway I haven't tried these yet but I did try these and this is gonna be my honest review about these now let me tell you so I don't know what other people using for but I bought these solely for the purpose of sleeping as a sleeping eat as Eric you know good things that CBB gummies and stuff to help you sleep and so that's what I've been using these so this reviews in regards to how it's helped me as a sleeping aid and if it does work or not I haven't consumed these in the daytime or you know to hang out or to shell nothing like that I've just used it right before I sleep right so sometimes I get some serious back pains that won't help me sleep so I haven't had those yet thankfully because when I do I can't sleep I just toss and turn but really that was my main purpose for these but anyway I so I have it I'm not gonna review that part yet maybe in the future god forbid happens anytime soon cuz I hate it however so my review for this is just strictly like you know if you gotta wake up in eight hours and you're not feeling sleepy well let me tell you this stuff right here works now this is weird how it works so you know cuz it's weird because when you open it it's like you know all you see is a gummy worm and you just think like okay whatever it's candy like but you don't know what to expect right so my first day trying this it was me my girlfriend she tried it first and she knocked out almost instantly like maybe five minutes after consuming this she closed her eyes got mellow and I say no she's snoring and right after that you know I'm still I was I wasn't ready to sleep yet she had to wake up early in the morning so I was in the bed on my phone finally I'm like you know what I'm scanning a little late let me try one of these even though I wasn't sleepy yet you know on my own after five minutes so I think one of these five minutes after I consumed it I start getting this weird like relaxed euphoria and you know like sometimes when you're sleeping you watch TV and you start like dozing off that's what happened to me but the weird thing is is that it happened literally I went from being normal and five minutes after taking this it hit me like the sleeping has hit me the drowsiness and it was just so weird to me how it really hit instantly you know because I fought it off for another five minutes but after the 10 15 minute mark I like you know what I'm knocking out [ __ ] so I don't know it was so weird to me we woke up the next day like wow these actually work so we took it again the second night again it works like if this really works now let me tell you about a little side effect that you do have with these right so it's so unexpected but I realized it is a real side effect because we my girlfriend both experienced one oh you might wake up in the middle of the night like fully not not not like fully wide-awake but you'll realize that it's only been four five hours that you've been into sleep and you'll wake up a little thirsty you might want to you know drink a little bit of water and then maybe toss and turn for like another 5-10 minutes before you actually knock out again I've experienced that my whole three times that last night was my third national today I was gonna do my fourth night so doc that was my own personal experience that you know with the thirstiness but however me and my girlfriend have both woken up in the in the middle of the night you know so that's one side effect nothing serious still you go back to sleep you wake up feeling good the real real side effect that I have experienced with this believe it or not this gives you some weird dreams now in all cases that I've taken this each night that I slept with this I've actually had some sort of like nightmare Twilight Zone kind of Dreams after this like alright so let me give you a little funny story last night I took these and whatever I'm having this weird dream and in my dream I see the most beautiful paintings like I'm in the art gallery but the paintings are full of sorrow and sadness but I'm looking at them and the paintings start crying and it makes me want to cry and it makes me feel sad but at the same time the paintings are so beautiful I've never seen so like so nice paintings in my life so I wake up a little sad you know and then I realized I'm like those beautiful paintings that I saw in my dream those are actually my paintings because they're in my dream you know like it's just this weird shape and it's not it's not a bad nightmare it was just like trippy [ __ ] that I woke up feeling sad about you know now for people they like to analyze their dreams this is fun I guess you could call it that sorry I'm only kind of look rambling but that was just a little experience that I had with these dummies other than that let me see out of 10 stars I give them between seven and eight stars out of 10 as far as sleeping aid only because they don't have me macking out ready you know every land that I've consumed them I've woken up in the middle night and then gone back to sleep and the thirstiness and then for me I don't mind the nightmares or the weird dreams I kind of enjoy them you know I'm not a person that wakes up and you know sweats and stuff like that I didn't mind it but I'd say it's a side effect because it's happened to me in a row you know the V nights in a row today will be my port so other than that they do work it's weird how they they they work so instantly and so fast that just makes me think like wow man this is some like you can prepare to like medicine how it hits you so quickly like you know if you have ever if you've ever taken a sleeping pill or something but then again it's like since it's a component of marijuana or happens cetera and you know like when you should you know smoke a joint of marijuana or a block it also hits you is me so I guess in a sense it makes sense that that it does work right away anyway these are diamond CBD chill gummies thus our snakes 100x now I see some reviews online that they give you panic attacks or that they made from spikes listen I in mind you I haven't smoked marijuana in on four or five years you know so you know I don't enjoy getting high these did not give me none of that again like I said honestly I only used it before going to sleep I haven't chilled or try to hang out on these after taking these so you know to each his own I personally enjoy them I will be taking them to me again my girlfriend will also you know so that's my review of the diamond CBD children's hope you guys enjoyed it I'll be reviewing some other products like this the blue CBD oil I haven't taken it yet but I will soon and also I did order I don't know where it is right now a CBD cream for for pain let me tell you that's

four flavors of gummies and they do offer these in other potencies and other sizes as well okay next up we have the wild cbd beverages they have sparkling water beverages that's why this box is so

hundred milligrams THC they're just open I like the really like uh meanest like it's just perfectly go someone go and pull it out here and there's a roll I like that they have their logo in the gummy so that's really cool so we're gonna take this whole thing I know my buddy Manuel posted up his video of the squib challenge he did where you took the whole thing so I guess this is uh my answer to his squib challenge so the whole square this is cherry flavored they do come in different flavors cherry and grape for my two favorite I don't really like the yellow or the green one but this one or the gray point that are my favorites so here we go BHO one-hour milligram squid by lunchbox alchemy and there's the BHO well hell yeah they can't get away from that taste so uh it's really first of all it's super super fruity okay super cherry flavored it's really good flavor but at the very end you're gonna get that hard BHO flavor and it's really really really like it'll make you uh go yeah I can already and I still there no it's not going away feel it taste like I just put some dabs in my mouth that's potent so yeah check out the squid by lunchbox alchemy they make great edibles and they also have some pho and BHO available as well and I just seen also they have some live resin that's also a pretty killer so check it out we highly recommend it the squibs myself I probably give about three and a half stars close to four but three and a half and yeah that's the squid by lunchbox alchemy thank you for watching macdanne cannabis review please", "qZuRIBsn8yU": "but if I carry over

gonna focus but they say extra strength 300 milligrams 350 milligrams just starting packs Oh sour patch kids 350 milligrams usually just the packaging got these from the homie he said I can go ahead and have him up the plug when I had shot me these when I was picking me it looked just like a regular shower packs kits - the sour stuff you don't really look sour they kind of masked honestly they gross y'all gonna eat this you also have something to drink because you probably don't need it don't know if a so it tastes like dirt we are not even good we just won garbage it flavor like of three out of ten you come with a decent amount up in here still command like this meaningless just probably like 10 y'all about 10 of these left but it tastes super like tree it's not good after I finish these I'm gonna get back to y'all like an hour I'll let y'all know what it did if you did anything telling you right now they're nasty look I'm gonna go ahead and finish the recipes get back to y'all in like an hour let y'all know what it is if you did anything I have a high tolerance so sometimes edibles don't even do that honestly it's like 6:30 in the morning oh I'm talking low everybody's still sleep where these things are disgusting I'm gonna get back to you on the Alberto alright y'all so we back hour later and I feel nothing not high it was garbage wasting my time it tastes like we but no effects I don't know if my toddler and something cold but I feel nothing maybe my hair fell maybe my head feels heavy but I don't know that's just cuz I'm tired just looks early as [ __ ] in

negative reviews for me buddy negative reviews from me better just smoke some trizzie something I do don't fit around that something right now I'll see what time it is trade time on the road some get faded so yeah like I said edibles it's not the boom don't I am my review I got to get an F I'm not any higher than I was never buy those again please don't waste your money", "ZOEwJRlZG7s": "g'day welcome to the simple cooking Channel today I'm going to show you how to make homemade gummy bears before we get started you're gonna need some sort of mold like see what I've got now you can get this from an arts and crafts store basically this has got a little little bears in it now they're not easy to find so I will put a link to the place that I bought this from and and this cost me I think it was two dollars for one sheet now with a small saucepan just have it on the bench or somewhere put in 1/3 of a cup of water then add one satchel and these satchels vary the satchel I use has about 10 grams which i think is probably just a bit under a quarter of an ounce just slowly sprinkling there now this needs to be unflavored gelatin then you get your flavored gelatin and you want to use roughly 85 grams which is around 3 ounces now for this particular one I've chosen a strawberries and cream gelatin just pour it in slowly now once you've done this just leave this on the counter for roughly 10 minutes and it's about ready to put on the stove now put this on the stove we turn on to medium heat now we'll have this on here for roughly somewhere between 3 and 5 minutes and what we're gonna do is just give it a stir every now and then the idea is once this is dissolved it's ready okay that's ready to go let's do the next stage now just pour it into something that you can pour it out if it's got a little spent and just pull it into each mold leave that on the counter for I don't know five minutes a and then once it's just cooled a little bit and not for us to be able to transport it without it spilling anyway put the end of the freezer for about 10 to 15 minutes well they're ready to go now what I like to do is I like to get a teaspoon of plain flour and teaspoon of castor sugar and just mix it together in a little shot glass like this once this has come out of the fridge just sprinkle it sort of over it this will just help the the gummies not to stick together so just do that again spread across it like that so make sure that you do wipe the excess off this because you know what spilling all over the place um well I hope you like my homemade gummy bears got so many yeah let's give them a go oh oh come come Frogger TV hmm I'll see you next time for my next meal [Music]", "UdT2zhIWe1k": "anyway I said I'd come back and show you finished product they said in the fridge 20 minutes half an hour there we go see the ugly one it's got all the bubbles in it the rest are pretty good got twenty eighty milligrams so", "p3Xner4oP1k": "so you just like pinch and it opens and they come in little squares and they say they're 10 milligrams you get 10 100 milligram total for 20 bucks bomb it tastes super good", "b4tD1jFpTPo": "hello everybody and welcome back to kj steve i hope you guys are having yourselves a wonderful day enjoying ourselves all that wonderful magical good stuff and for today's episode we're doing another edible review since you guys like the sour patch one i went out and tried to find myself other edibles i think would be interesting for you guys and for today's episode we got we got the little trillium edibles edibles i don't know if you guys have seen these before if it'll focus yeah so they make all different types of making of the sour patch to make the little watermelon ones all kind of different ones but since my personal favorite candy is trolleys i went out the way and found these and yeah so from what i can tell these are 300 milligrams in each packaging thc obviously and from what i've heard this brand is really good it's really high quality hopefully it's better than the sour patch ones which i hope it is so yeah before we get into it guys please like subscribe comment all that wonderful magical good stuff and without further ado let's get into this [ __ ] so real quick just in case you guys are out here trying to get your own and all that stuff please be aware when it comes to edibles cards all sorts of [ __ ] packaging like this can easily be bought off ebay amazon off the internet and people can be you know [ __ ] with your [ __ ] but just as a little reference in order to know that these are real each little metal packaging will have like the certain color coordination on the dip part so if this trolley is going to have the blue and red if it's sour patch it's going to have the green and so and so and also where it says the thc part right there if you you guys probably see it'll focus for you there should be like a little very gray doctor symbol on the back so there's that too so yeah so let's open this [ __ ] and let's get it so it smells like you know what you would expect gummy worms to smell like but it has more of that gourmet kind of snow and you can still smell a little bit of the weed is not too crazy so you know you can have these out and it wouldn't be noticeable get these [ __ ] out this is pretty much what they look for they're nice big worms they're not like i thought they're going to be more like trolleys like the actual smaller ones but not either pretty solid big so because of that there's only there's six in each bag which isn't bad so normally for someone who has a lower tolerance i would say go for three but if you're like me someone who has a higher tolerance or just naturally prefers to be higher and likes being high i would say knock all sticks down the 300 milligrams it's a nice steady high well we'll find out soon so we like to send [ __ ] in this channel i'm gonna go ahead and eat all six we're gonna eat a little part just to do a little taste review see how it [Music] this is hit say and they do taste like what i would say gourmet gummy warmers would taste like like if you go to a dollar store or any grocery store and they normally got like you know they got the trolley brands and then they got like the market brands it tastes kind of like the market brands but of course it also has that hint of wheat on it and what i do like about these compared to the ones um compared to the sour patches i did earlier the weed taste on this is a lot more subtle than it was on the sour patch one yeah it doesn't hit you in the face like you're eating it you merely taste gummy worm not you know wait so that's a good part on edibles so does it take longer to eat or are you just going slow this is a big gummy worm the regular gummy worm colors the blue and orange green yellow and the [ __ ] red another one sorry they are solid if you do start throwing more in your mouth you are going to get a little bit more of the wee taste but of course that's because you put a lot but yeah tastes good packaging is good six in each thing it's not bad it's a nice solid high i would assume and i would hope it would take you know just an average 30 to an hour to hit and hopefully since these look good they taste good hopefully it'll be a nice long lasting high oh again guys please like subscribe all that good stuff and you guys have you know any specific edibles you guys would like to do review on any glass any cards anything specific and he's trying to weed please let me know down below and i'll try my best to get my hands on it [Applause] but yeah just finished eating this and i would assume it'll take 30 minutes to an hour so i'll check in with you guys in about an hour or so to see how these are pretty much hit me so i hope you guys enjoy eating edibles too or just smoking along i'll be back with you guys hello everybody welcome back and we are about what i would say two to four hours deep on these edibles so it took about an hour to hit you know normally able to take and they are doing their magic they're great it's a nice body and head high and you know yeah it's what i would say if you've experienced edibles before you know saying your first edible you know what a good edible high is this is a very good one i would highly recommend yourself to get a metals if you can but yeah aside from that it's a great thing if you can try to get your hands on them you can try them out i don't know if they're all the same i'm gonna try to get my hands on some sour patch ones or some different ones but until then we'll see so yeah i would rate it you know 10 out of 10. if you guys get your hands on it you should try it so yeah that'll be if you guys have any other edibles again please put it down below i'll try to get my best i'll try my best to get my hands on it and yeah like always guys please like subscribe all that wonderful [ __ ]", "whx9ytKios8": "oh hi i didn't see you there [Music] what is going on people my name is chillady back at you with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy you know it still has a lot of positive benefits as well though and so i'm thinking if you had seven likes on this video if we get seven likes okay you guys have been [ __ ] killing it bro look look you guys been killing it all right i appreciate all y'all for real we're getting more subscribers i'm trying to hit 50 by let's see what is it september i'm trying to hit 50 at least by the end of october hopefully yeah let's try to do that all right let's get 50 subs bro seven likes we will do a positive review because there are positive things about it i know that i've said that the negatives of it but that's from my personal experience from me trying man let's finish this [ __ ] joint holy [ __ ] [Music] so now i've looked and i found a lot of positive things so hit that seven uh hit that seven light goal boy and we will do another review yeah man that's all i got to say about it this joint is pissing me off much love y'all seven likes do it do it all right go to twitch.tv link will be in the description uh go to my twitter man i'm trying to get my twitter up as well

i'm so excited to be here expect to see videos from me regularly again now that i've moved in i have no excuse if you're not already subscribed make sure you subscribe right now so you can see all my new videos in your sub box but today isn't going to be my typical smoking video i'm going to do something a little different i have 500 milligrams of rso capsules in here there are 10 capsules and they're 50 milligrams each actually looking at this many pills is pretty intimidating i'm not gonna lie i'm pretty much just going to film the aftermath of this so i hope you guys enjoy that this is a little bit of a different video for me but i think this is going to be a lot of fun got a nice tough glass of water to wash these down here's number one here's number two here's number three number four this is the point in our return at this point i'm getting [ __ ] lit number five all right halfway there number six i'm so scared my body like didn't want to swallow that one it was like dude don't do it i'm gonna start a timer right now before i forget so we can tell how long it takes for this to actually kick in i've never actually consumed rso before so i have no idea and i'm stone sober right now so it's gonna hit me like a brick wall all right number seven number eight number nine and last but not least number ten the point of no return wish me luck you guys this is gonna be a long day well it has been an entire minute and i'm not high at all yet i can confirm that honestly i'm a little nervous i've read online that rso can take up to 15 hours to kick in i don't think it's gonna take me that long but that's some of my brief googling told me and before this kicks in i'll explain to you what rso is for those of you who don't know it stands for rick simpson oil it's a cannabis extract but it's not meant to be dabbed like most cannabis extracts let me reiterate please do not dab this it tastes like [ __ ] it is not a fun experience it's much better to be consumed orally like through a pill or through some food it really doesn't have a nice consistency to it or taste so honestly the pill form that i just did is the best way to consume it so you don't have any of that weird flavor rso offers a lot of medical benefits when you're doing what i'm doing not really but it actually does especially for people who can't smoke but as i said this was a super [ __ ] high dose so i'm really curious about what's gonna happen to me i'm really not a huge edible guy like i said even when i've done 150 and 250 milligrams i really just don't enjoy the high i get so i'm really curious what this 500 milligram high is going to be like all right guys we just passed the 45 minute mark and i'm still not high i feel like this is gonna take as long as an edible to kick in so within the next 45 minutes i'm expecting to feel pretty rocked i was just going through my snapchats and somebody messaged me though and said that it took four hours for theirs to kick in so i'm really hoping i don't have to sit here for four hours waiting for this to kick in straight up it has been over an hour and a half and i'm really not that high like i might feel a little something but i honestly think it's all in my own head ultimately i don't think i'm high yet i hope this isn't a fail because i'm gonna be really pissed if this bottle just does nothing to me there's the stats for you as you can see 500 milligrams pack of 10 thc terpenes all that all right let's kick it oh my god i feel like edibles here you're talking [ __ ] bro it's starting to kick in i can like start to feel it in my chest and in my head a little bit it hasn't hit me like a brick yet i just thought this is gonna hit me way harder it's definitely a gradual high i'm actually feeling now it straight up took two hours and 13 minutes for me to feel anything but i'm feeling pretty hopeful right now finally my eyes are getting pretty heavy my whole body's getting that like slow feeling that you get on edibles so i have a feeling it's about to kick in all right well i'm bored i'm gonna go play with my dog or something paper paper high piper you're a dog dog oh my god you're a dog oh my god come here i'm so high oh my god oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] i'm piper sit high five oh i'm too high yeah shake my hand good job piper you guys want to see something kind of funny my dog is an overbite i honestly feel like i'm just melting at this point like oh my god these edibles kicked in pretty strong my entire body just feels heavy i'm gonna try to catch a quick dub on fall guys let's see how this goes bruh i've never felt like i've been running this low in this game i think like time's been slower for me no bruh bruh right i got this i can do this i can do this i can do this oh yes i'm going to qualify let's [ __ ] go bro i'm in like the top three right now [ __ ] okay that [ __ ] me [ __ ] let's do it let's do it let's do it yeah [ __ ] i was gonna be the next one all right [ __ ] this game i need to just like listen to music it's kind of like vibe and [ __ ] [Music] [Applause] i need more water i'm so [ __ ] thirsty if you have the option to get crushed ice and you don't just don't text me back anymore because we're not friends that makes a [ __ ] mess all right let's hydrate before we die drink oh my god that was like the kiss of life all right as you can see we are approaching the four hour point and as you can see my eyes are very heavy i'm not gonna lie man i'm getting higher and higher and higher which is cool i guess but do you really want to pop some rso caps and have to be like still getting higher in four hours like maybe at like certain situations but ultimately dabbing and smoking weed are still my preferred ways to consume cannabis but yeah these aren't so cascade hidden i don't know what it is but i have like a little double vision right now i'm like super foggy it's a different type of high for sure it's definitely more like a foggier body high than like a typical dab high or a typical weed high which more focuses on like the head i feel like this is mainly the body and then like the head is secondary like the head high is there but the body height is so intense that you don't even really notice the head high almost but i think i need a nap like that's not out of their own possibility for me today i'm so [ __ ] high i was really worried like i was talking a lot of [ __ ] on these for a minute there like it was two and a half hours before i really felt anything and it's been another hour and a half and i'm so much higher than i was then so i'm curious when this is gonna like cap so it's gonna be a long day you guys i hope you're down for the ride i'm sorry if this video isn't interesting i know i'm typically smoking and [ __ ] more but i'm just riding this high out dude like this is [ __ ] nuts i low-key just want to keep smoking on top of this to see what happens kind of see if it evens out the head high with the body height a little bit but i don't know if that's the wisest idea but i'm not here to make wise decisions that's nice it's [ __ ] nice i just stabbed on some white widow from calypso big fan of their concentrates they're a little bit on the more expensive side but the terpene profile is just unreal that dab actually made me feel a little bit better i feel like the body height was just too intense now that i got a nice little head high there too i'm like all right all right i'm back in this how long has it been oh how about that 420 blazing four and a half hours in and i'm still feeling very [ __ ] good the cotton mouth is just not going away no matter how much water i drink it just will not stop she's gotta pee and then we're gonna make some wings in the airfryer popcorn turns to food porn the other side hope you are liking this [ __ ] high as [ __ ] home style vlog because this is what you're getting hope you missed me now we are going to turn the air dude do you hear me i'm so [ __ ] big we're gonna turn the airfryer on um boom if you smoke weed and do not have an air fryer i really hope that you can take one thing out of this video and go buy one because it will truly save your life especially when you're high and you want some fire food now we're just gonna drop them in and oh yeah those are done all right food porn is in full effect you guys i'm so [ __ ] high let's determine how one of these is that looks fire oh yeah i think these need some buffalo sauce all right my high i should not have used hot sauce because my dumbass spilled it all over my shirt but i found one that's pretty much the same color to keep the aesthetic piper's pissed off she didn't get any chicken wings saved a couple for later but i honestly think i hit the peak of this high you guys it's really not as bad as i thought it was gonna be for some reason i just thought it was gonna be super intense i've had a lot of 100 to 200 milligram doses before but this is the first time i ever had a 500 milligram dose and for some reason i just figured it was gonna be like two or three times the intensity but i honestly don't think it is i think there's like a peak high you get when you smoke and probably even with edibles and probably just with how much i consume cannabis right now my tolerance is so high that this just wasn't too intense for me like i definitely couldn't drive or anything and i definitely wouldn't recommend anyone try consuming this much you should definitely ask your doctor before consuming any amount of thc don't ask me and don't go off my uh experience probably should have said that earlier in the video but yeah i'm really just [ __ ] tired at this point i'm high as [ __ ] i feel like i've had like all the phases of the edible at this point i feel like i had the giggles i feel like i had the like just chill high part i feel like i had the munchies and now i'm just at the like chill slumped part of the edible like i'm exhausted that's really all i have to say right now i'm gonna have a good night's sleep i'm pretty sure i just confirmed you can't overdose on weed we've been doing this just under six hours and ten minutes it'll be six hours but you know the high only kicked in three and a half hours ago if i did my math right but still being high as [ __ ] three and a half hours later that's not too bad i still don't think that this is the way i would like to consume most of the time like i feel like this is really just for people that can't smoke or like really just don't want to for whatever reason but like this just isn't as fun for me because i hate waiting for the high i like it to just come pretty much instantly it probably will come out quicker if you have a low tolerance but that's not the situation for me you know you really just don't know what how you're gonna get and i'd rather like find out right away when i rip a bong if it like got me high or not then like find out four hours later if you got high or not you know i'm just kind of rambling at this point you guys but that's the video click like if you enjoyed thank you so much for watching i really appreciate it make sure you subscribe i got a lot more

"4lBu59N17Vs": "recreational marijuana edibles coming to a store near you as of now you can make them at home but it is illegal for anyone to buy and/or sell them to the public Canada's proposed edible pot regulations have been made public and the 60-day consultation process has come to an end under the proposed federal rules a single serving would be limited to 10 milligrams of THC the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis and each serving must be individually wrapped this is considered a low to moderate dose of THC this dosage limit is sugar than in Colorado Washington or California where multiple servings are allowed per package so for example in a chocolate bar each breakable square can contain 10 milligrams each for a total of 100 milligrams pot meant for ingestion cannot have alcohol have limited caffeine and come in a plain child-resistant package the draft regulations say the products must not be appealing to youth and the packaging can't advertise dessert or confectionery flavors so no gummies shaped like bears one of the problems which were legalizing edibles were kids so kids came into the kitchen saw this wonderful nicely colored marijuana edibles and as kids to try it out the proposed rules are an attempt to address one of the main issues with edibles making sure they don't cause risk to public health especially for those who are underage but some are worried the black market will continue to thrive which are strict regulations a major cannabis edibles manufacturing California says it's been difficult to navigate within the legal market because there's still so much competition in the illicit market people that are heavy consumers of cannabis and like to ingest it can ingest you know hundreds if not thousands of milligrams of THC in a day and so if they have products that are available in the illicit market that are much cheaper and have a much higher potency they're gonna tend to go towards that so a problem with edible marijuana is that people are not used to it with edibles the effects can later and the people's oh I have now done this edible marijuana and there feel nothing and they'd more and more to avoid putting people at risk it would be better to start with low dosage and once we have clear evidence the black market is still thriving then we can reevaluate Health Canada confirms they've received 7,000 responses from Canadians industry representatives the provinces and the public health community on the proposed draft regulations Health Canada says cannabis products will be permitted for legal sale no later than

case there are any large lumps that's annoying next we'll add 3/4 cups of water which I've already pre-measured here for this next part I recommend you pre grease your container with a little bit of vegetable oil spray that way the corn syrup won't stick to it and you'll get the correct measurement oh yeah got any grease yes I also recommend you do this with your spatula as well and your measuring tool I'm just gonna use this to make sure it's all coated okie dokie for this we're using a 1/3 measuring cup all of the tools have been sprayed with vegetable oil now we're going to measure out the light corn syrup we need 2/3 of a cup so we'll measure 1/3 of a cup twice you can see that the syrup is not sticking normally you have to fight for it to come out we're gonna do this again now that we've measured out our corn syrup we'll just add it to the rest of the ingredients and you can see how easily it comes out of the bowl now we're going to take this over to the stove this next part of the recipe is going to take some time so you want to make sure that you can really pay attention to the saucepan on the stove you want to watch what you're doing make sure you're not on the phone or distracted you don't necessarily have to attend to it in terms of storing or mixing it but you were going to be watching the temperature because we want to make sure that we get the right consistency for our Jolly wrenches it can go from soft candy to hard candy to burn candy the mixture can easily burn and then the taste is going to be really off you'll still be able to eat it but probably will not be enjoyable so make sure you have time to pay attention that way you won't have to start over from scratch and waste your batch you want to turn the stove on to a medium heat you're gonna stir your mixture until the sugar dissolves you can see that it's sticking a little bit so just put some elbow grease in it oh that's greasy that's really [ __ ] I said yeah it's greasy get in the corners because sometimes the sugar tends to clump up together on the bottom and then once you see the sugars pretty much dissolve you can just leave that alone we're gonna use our candy thermometer and you want to make sure that you don't put the bottom of the thermometer to the bottom of the saucepan because then they'll give you an inaccurate reading I put a little bit of water in here what you're gonna do is you're going to take your pastry brush and just dip it a little bit in the water and then I'm gonna wash down the stuck sugar crystals onto the mixture you don't want that to interfere with how the candy comes together you can see that the mixture is coming to a boil and that's perfectly fine we're waiting for it to reach 260 degrees so once the temperature of the candy reaches 260 degrees you're going to add your food coloring okay you can get this at any grocery store and we're actually gonna do the mint green color for the green apple flavor that we're doing today and that's just following the instructions on the box start with nine green drops and 3 yellow drops and then we'll see what that looks like and then adjust the color accordingly if we need you we just need about one or two more degrees some more and then we can add the food coloring one two three nine well once you've added the food coloring you're not going to mix it at all you're going to just let the boiling action mix it itself it looks like it's a nice bright green I added a little bit more yellow because it was just a little bit too much of a grass green than a green apple green I passed on grass all the time the minty green gives more of a green apple tone to it we've pulled the pan off the stove at 300 degrees we're gonna add green apple flavoring to this I'm adding a full tablespoon you want to keep all of the essential oil with in the saucepan and now we're gonna add our Keef as well now remember this has already been decart so we don't have to worry about that and we just need to get it off the paper there we go star very quickly you don't want the essential oils to evaporate completely this may smoke so I have my lid ready and because we're using Keith versus BHO you may not have the same uniformity but this came out really really good all right we're gonna lift the lid on and now you're gonna take your candy moles and spray them with vegetable so the color looks really good I try not to over pour it if you have someone that can help you they can kind of shimmy the candy tray so that all of the portions are pretty equal I've done this several times so I have a pretty good grasp on it the colors of these Jolly Ranchers look really really good they're really bright and green they have a uniform texture to it you can't see the keep at all I can't even see it in these when you pour these you want to have a very steady stream and a steady hand the higher you go the smaller the stream will be but just remember that the candy cools very quickly you just want to make sure that each one has about two-thirds full these green Apple Jolly Ranchers are for Bernadette price we'll be seeing her later in New York what would be filming a video for the new Sean price out and they have compressed show senator so they don't we'll put a link to it in the description I hope you like them you want a lot of these two completely cool for this recipe we made 200 pieces using five grams key so I use all silicone tools because as you can see the candy is all on it all up on it so I usually just run it under hot water along with the saucepan and any other tools and I find that it cleans very easily some of the mixture fell onto this silicone pad that I have here and that's actually completely cooled it cooled we're gonna stack the candy rolled trays just the silicone mat with confectioner sugar and then we can pop them out of the candy molds that will prevent them from sticking to each other I also have a container with the lid that also has confectioner sugar on the inside and then we can store them into the freezer [Music] by spraying the moles with vegetable spray it allows that the candies come out very easily you can see that there are really nice bright green the Keef is evenly distributed throughout the candy you really don't see very many speckles at all if any I like to sprinkle in between now let's go grab a sandwich bag and use it as a glue here we are green Apple Jolly Ranchers if you want to make these sour candies you can just add some citric acid to the bowl and shake it you want to make sure that all the powdered sugar is coated on each and every one of these so what I like to do at the end is put a bunch of powdered sugar on the top put the lid on and just shake it vigorously before I put it in to ensure that they're all individually coated this is episode 4 of mmm medical edibles please subscribe comment and give us a green thumbs up that was awesome [Music] I'm rolling up all your good and

it edible back from vegas and your whole arm and body just feel heavy and when you hearing [ __ ] in your ear don't ever underestimate don't ever ask me edible", "vu1RKWQtN-M": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today I have a very exciting video that's been highly requested and I'm sorry it was taking so long I'm going to be showing you guys how I make my extra strong green dragon picture this photo has one cup of liquid and 10 grams of wheat and then I reduced it to 1/3 of a cup meaning that now there is 5 tablespoons in 1/3 of a cup so every tablespoon is 2 grams of wheat you're gonna need the carbs wheat for this recipe and I'll post a link of how to do that below here's what you're gonna need alcohol that is 95% alcohol or higher some coffee filters or cheesecloth a funnel some mason jars and 10 grams of the carb to read the first step is to freeze your Dakkar bleed for at least 24 hours I have already done that and now that it's been over 24 hours I'm going to pour in 2/3 of a cup of vodka that has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours the instructions for this can still be followed even if you're not using the same amount of wheat that I am which is 10 grams all you have to do is pour enough vodka to fill just to the top of the weed now you're going to shake it aggressively for 5 minutes then you'll put it in the freezer for at least 2 hours I ended up leaving mine in the freezer for about 20 hours there's no need to leave it for long within 2 hours I did that simply because I ran at a time now I'm placing a funnel into my mason jar and I'm going to poke some holes into my coffee filter so that it flows through a little bit quicker if you don't have any coffee filters you can also use cheesecloth then place that into the funnel now you can take your weed and vodka mixture out of the freezer and shake it aggressively for another 5 minutes pour your mixture into the filter and try to avoid spilling it over the edge like I do here then wait for it to filter through this can take a while sometimes even up to a half an hour you can see how slowly it comes out of the bottom and then once almost all of the liquid has gone through I'll move the weed around to try and facilitate more of the liquid to be filtered through I put some gloves on because if your fingers are touching the weed and vodka it can absorb some of the THC and we obviously don't want that because that would be a waste now that all the vodka has gone through the filter I'm going to scoop back the weed into the jar you can see how much weed is left in the funnel because I spilled it when I poured it in so again try to avoid doing that if you can [Music] now I'm going to pour in 1/3 of a cup of vodka that again has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours and then I'm going to pour it into my jar weed that I had already filtered once now again if you're using different proportions just use enough to just cover the weed you can just pour it straight into the jar I'm just using the funnel so I can try and get some of that weed that's stuck to it the first time now once again I'm going to shake that jar aggressively for five minutes now using that same jar and same filter that I'd use the first time I am going to pour in the mixture that we had just shaken into the jar that we first used [Music] now this step is optional but I'm going to pour in a little bit of that very cold flash-frozen vodka to get the remnants out of my jar again you don't have to do this but I don't want to waste anything so every little scrap I can get I'm gonna take now once again we're going to let that filter through and it is going to take a long time just like the first round did [Music] once that's all dripped through we're going to place a clean funnel into a clean measuring cup or mason jar as well as a new clean coffee filter and we are not going to poke any holes now we're going to pour it in and we're going to wait for this to drip through this step is not necessary but I like mine very clear so I like to filter out any imperfections if you like you can do this step twice but it does take a long time so I only do it once and I find that the one time is sufficient to get it very pure and clean I'm also going to take the filter with the weed that has been filtered already and press it out as much as I can of course make sure you're wearing a rubber glove so that your skin is not absorbing at all yeah and just try and squish oh as much as you can and then that little bit of leftover that is on the parchment paper there I mean if you're just using this for yourself you could just lick it up I don't know if you don't want to waste it anything works yeah so just squeeze out as much as you possibly can it's been about a half an hour and almost everything has filtered through and we have a total of about a little bit under a cup of liquid because some of that vodka is lost in the extraction process [Music] now we need to reduce our tincture to a smaller amount and we're going to use that by using a double boiler thing which I don't have so I'm making my own version and I'm just using my instant pot so that I can do it in the living room where I have better lighting so I am wrapping some tinfoil around it so I can contain the heat as much as possible and I'm just going to put my measuring cup on to the side of it and then wrap the tinfoil kind of around it that way not too much water and heat is evaporating all you want to make sure is that your bottom of your mason jar or your measuring cup like I'm using is not touching the water so same concept as a double boiler so I both to put it in there but I just have to show off how beautiful it looks it's so clear so golden absolutely beautiful I hope you guys appreciate how wonderful it looks because a lot of my friends and family don't really feel the same way as I do so I just love being able to share this stuff with you guys online please make sure you do this any well-ventilated area so I have all windows and doors in my house opened as well as if your dreams on the stove have your hood fan on there is no smell at all so unfortunately my instant pot broke part way through I don't know what happened so I moved it to the kitchen and I made this sort of contraption thing because I could not put the measuring cup on the edge of the pot because I don't have anything deep enough where the bottom of the measuring cup wouldn't touch the water so I just put a metal strainer on top and then created some insulation with the tin foil kind of like how I did it the instant pot so while you're watching it when it's bubbling a lot like this that's a little bit too much so turn your heat down a little bit you do want a little bit of movement but not that aggressively now I reduced it down to one third of a cup and that took me about an hour and a half I believe you can reduce it more or reduce it less it just depends on how strong you want it to be now it's ready to pour into a jar to save you can use this with a dropper or you can put into your gummies or into your drinks there's so many different ways to use it hopefully you guys will check out some of my gummy videos and try it out in one of those recipes and here's the finished product which is absolutely beautiful thank you so much for watching with the measuring cup I didn't want to waste any possible tincture so I heard some iced coffee into there and now I'm drinking that so that's a good way to make sure you're not wasting anything if you guys enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe and please let me know if there's any videos you would like to see me record because I would be happy to do that thank you guys so much for watching have a great day [Music]", "qG-Ac48CyVU": "what's up friends welcome back today i will be showing you how to make infused pixie sticks the powder inside of these can also be used to dip your suckers into to eat by itself and if you add a lot of citric acid you can get it so sour that it's even more sour than warheads which is kind of how i like mine in this video i'm also going to be showing you guys how to infuse the sugar but if you already have infused sugar or don't need to know how to make it you can skip to six minutes in this video to get right to making the pixie sticks [Music] to make the infused sugar you're going to need half a cup of tincture and one and one quarter cup of granulated sugar start by pouring your sugar into a large dish and then pour your tincture on top and stir it all together i felt like mine was too liquidy so i added another quarter cup of sugar and then stirred that some more after i added the sugar the consistency was much better you could definitely still see the grains instead of it being mostly liquid like it was before um if you guys aren't sure about how much sugar to use if you find it's too liquidy just keep adding a few spoonfuls of sugar until you get a consistency closer to something like this then we need to evaporate all the alcohol off of this sugar so we're going to preheat our oven to the lowest temperature that it can go for me that's 170 degrees and we're going to place it into the oven leaving the oven door open and i'm also having a fan just to help with air circulation because you are having alcohol in the oven you have to be very very very careful to make sure to never close the oven door and to always have good airflow then i'm going to set the timer for about 10 minutes and every 10 or 15 minutes i'm going to come back and stir the mixture this is what mine is looking like after the first 10 minutes so i'm just going to stir it and try to kind of scrape down the sides and i'm gonna have to do this quite a few times like i said every 10 to 15 minutes just come and stir it so because i am making pixie sticks um i want to flavor my sugar so i want two different flavors so i'm just going to get another baking dish and pour part of this mixture into it and then i'm going to add a flavoring oil to each dish now we want to do this earlier in the process so we can help with the evaporation of the liquid but it doesn't really matter if you put it in the first 15 minutes the second 15 minutes or anything like that just try and put it while there's still liquid in there so that it can evaporate with the rest of the liquid then we'll just put it right back into the oven for another 10-15 minutes again we're going to have to repeat the process of in the oven for 10-15 minutes take it at a stir put it back in the oven for 10-15 minutes take it out to stir until it has returned to its original grainy sand consistency so at this point the sugar has been in the oven for about 45 minutes i think and is still a little bit too liquidy so again we're going to stir it and then put it back in the oven for a bit and continue to do this until we get a nice consistency so after about an hour and a half it was pretty much all good i did leave it sitting out um for a couple hours just to dry off any extra moisture and then here is what it looked like you can see it definitely made some clumps so we are going to break those up and each of these dishes are different flavors for me but um one is bubble gum and one is watermelon so i don't really mind if i'm using the same utensils because the flavors kind of go together but yeah so i'm just going to scrape all the sugar off the bottom of the dish and then we are going to put it in a blender to um make it nice and refined so i'm just pouring some of this sugar into my blender and we're going to try and grind it down into a finer texture unfortunately i don't know if it's because i put too much sugar that might be the problem um i it wouldn't really grind like the the blender wouldn't really get it to um like mix i don't know it just it wasn't working very well for me so i decided to use a food processor instead but i have a feeling if i did smaller amounts in the blender it probably would have worked a little bit better so using the food presser helped a ton it was coming out very very nicely you can see the texture is beautiful and i just continued to do this for all of my sugar until it was all ground down nicely i do want to mention that humidity plays a very important part in being able to make this sugar properly i luckily have air conditioning in my apartment so i set it really high so we could dry out the space as much as possible if it's too humid your sugar will clump so just try to avoid that if you can otherwise maybe just use extra sugar where i live in canada is not very humid at all so it's not something that i've really had to worry about but for those of you who do maybe you can leave some advice in the comments to help others out as well so at this point the sugar is pretty much done if you're going to use it for other purposes just store it in a airtight container um but for us we're going to be making pixie sticks so let's move on to what we need to make that our first and most important ingredient is the sugar that we just made we're also going to need some icing sugar some citric acid some kool-aid packets or some flavoring oils and some food coloring so this is 24 hours after i made the sugar and even though i did grind it down to a fine texture you can see it clumped up once again probably due to the moisture in the air i'm not sure um so we're just going to reprocess them i separated them into three bowls because i'm gonna do three separate colors and then we're going to start with the first one and place it into a food processor so i'm just pouring it in there and i'm going to grind it down first just to see how it's going to look and then we can add our other ingredients so it looks beautiful you can see it is so fine and not clumpy at all and then we're going to add our citric acid if you want to be sour just start out with um a teaspoon or so and blend it together see how it tastes and then add more as desired you can make it as sour as you like i'm also going to be adding some food coloring to mine i'm adding blue this is gel food coloring and i do have some issues using this as you will see as the video goes on at this point you can also add some kool-aid packages for your flavoring if desired i've already flavored mine with flavoring oils when i made the sugar but kool-aid packages work very well also and they have citric acid in them so if you don't have citric acid at home it'll help to get that sourness so you can see here my food coloring is not mixing at all it's just kind of clumping so i'm not sure why it's happening just yet but i have a suspicion that it's to do with lack of moisture so i'm just going to continue on with how i'd make these regularly and just see if maybe it binds so i'm just adding some icing sugar and this helps with the texture it kind of gives it like that baby bottle pop fine sugary texture that's really nice you don't need to use icing sugar um but it does help with the taste the texture and it also helps for people who live in more humid climates at this point the food coloring has still not properly mixed in so i decided it's due to the lack of moisture so i added my gel food coloring to a couple drops of water to create essentially liquid food coloring just a regular kind of kind you'd buy at a grocery store which i'm assuming most people that's what they would be using anyway so you probably shouldn't have this issue gel food coloring is just what i usually have on hand um but yeah adding a couple drops of water to the gel food coloring definitely really helped because clearly it looks very beautiful um and it mixed very nicely so i'm very happy with that now i'm just scraping the bottom to make sure everything is properly incorporated as well as adding some more citric acid so that it's extra sour and then i'm going to mix it a final time and then once that's done i'm going to pour it back into its bowl and set it aside until we have our other colors now i'm starting on my next one so same process adding the sugar adding some citric acid if you want to add your kool-aid packets you can do so now and then adding the food coloring for myself i am adding some water with my food coloring before i add it so like i said i'd let this sugar sit over 24 hours after i made it before i added um the food coloring and this whole process here today um but after i made my initial batch of sugar i did make some pink and i used my regular gel pink food coloring and i had absolutely no issues getting it to bind which is why i think it was because of the lack of water because the sugar still had a little bit of moisture in it yesterday but 24 hours from then which is now it was dried out more so that little bit of water added with the food coloring helps to restore that moisture now it looks like some of the food coloring got stuck on the bottom with the sugar so i'm just scraping it around to get everything mixed and then adding some powdered sugar the measurement is not really um well i didn't measure it i just kind of put spoonfuls into my taste but if you are looking for a measurement i would say use about half the amount of regular sugar for the powdered sugar so if you used one cup of regular sugar maybe use half a cup or less of powdered sugar but again it can be to taste or you don't even need to use powdered sugar if you don't want to [Music] now i'm just adding in a little bit of yellow food coloring just because i want to be a little bit more neon looking and then mixing it together you can see i have to scrape the bottom a little bit there um but yeah i think that the color turned out a little bit too green i kind of wanted to be more of a lighter green but that's okay anyway it still looks cool i was hoping i'd be able to lighten it by adding in some more sugar to dilute the color but it didn't really help that much and then that's done you can add in more citric acid or more sugar you can just adjust it to according to how you like it so then i'm just pouring that into its bowl and then i also have the blue one that i just made and then a pink one that i made yesterday and now it is time for the fun part which is filling up our pixie stix [Music] now we're going to prepare our pixie stick straws and we're going to seal the bottom of them using this bag sealer thing that i just bought i'm also going to show you guys later how to close them without one of these um i did just get this egg sealer thing but it works really well like look how great that straw looks um i think it was like 10 or 15 on amazon i'll post the link um but i am new to it like i literally just got it so you guys can probably see i will struggle a little bit but after the first few straws i got a hang of it better and then they were very easy to quickly seal now we're going to fill up the straws with their sour sugar powder dust whatever you call it um and i'm using this squeeze bottle to get it in there so i bought a tip that is slightly bigger than the size of my straw and i just put the straw in and hold it inside of that tip and then just shake it up and down and it comes out really nicely um the easiest way to do this would to just be buy bigger straws and then you can just use like a paper funnel to get it into the straw but if you already have these tools at home this works like the best it just it's not really worth it to go and buy it if you can just do bigger straws in a paper funnel then i just filled up all my straws using a variety of colors it was kind of annoying because i had to switch the tip every single time i did it if i want to change colors yeah just fill them up to however you like they can be all one color all different colors um and mine are flavored sour watermelon and bubble gum but they actually taste really good just with the sugar and citric acid like they don't even need flavoring okay now that all of my straws are done i'm just going to take my little sealer and close the tips of all of them now i'm going to show you guys how to seal the straws without a bake sealer so you're going to take an oven mitt or a folded dish cloth and then put a piece of tin foil on it put your hand inside of it sorry i didn't get this in the camera that well um put your hand inside of it and sort of shape it into like a little mitt like that with the dish cloth underneath to protect your hand now you're going to place the straw in your tin foil mitt hand and use a lighter to quickly light the other end then once it's lit you're going to quickly switch it over to the other side and squish it down holding it to seal it and then take it out see that looks pretty good so you definitely don't need to go and buy the sealer for this you could just use a lighter and some tinfoil and it seals very nicely the blue powder reminded me so much of baby bottle pops and it really like had that taste too i don't know i think it just because i used more powdered sugar in that one but i thought it would be really good dipped in or to dip suckers in there so i took these little bags and filled them up with some of each of the powders and then put a sucker in there these are just regular suckers because it's what i had on hand but if you really wanted to up them you could use a infused sucker and you can clearly see i'm thinking very hard about what color would go best i chose the dark one i hope that was the best color combination um i really like the way that the the red contrasts with the pink powder but yeah i think they all look adorable the green one's a little bit too green for me but i also really like all the colors mixed together so i did a mix of all the colors and then i'm just putting them into this little container because you don't need obviously those little bags to enjoy this you could also just put it into whatever you want and dip your sucker in there and i absolutely love how pretty all those colors look together once everything is done try to store it in a dry area so maybe keep them in a sealed bag or container to keep any excess moisture and they should last for quite a while i hope you guys enjoyed this video please let me know if you did and please leave a comment give us a thumbs up and subscribe thank you guys so much for watching have a wonderful day [Music]", "Oke0eNMVtrY": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today I'm just showing you how to make infused super sour candy spray is so good I'm so obsessed with it and I'm so excited to show you guys how to make this these turned out so amazing they're so delicious they literally my favorite thing ever my favorite thing I've made my everything empty so they're just like they're just so good so I'm doing a couple different versions including some sugar-free and so much sugar I thought this sugar-free one might not taste as good as well as sugar because of course it's sugar-free but I honestly cannot even tell it's like it literally tastes like real sugar which is weird might be because of all the sour in there it kind of like throws your tastebuds off or something but it's absolutely amazing and it has no calories except with coconut oil yes actually and I'm going to show you guys how to emulsify coconut oil into a spray and they stay like this they don't um separate now if you don't want to follow the instructions for the emulsification of the mixture you don't have to you could just do the flavoring with coconut oil um and just shake it every time you use it it'll still work but if you want to keep them so they look like this all the time I'll show you guys how in the video the texture is a little bit different for the one with the sugar versus the sugar free the sugar free one is more liquidy and the one with sugar is a little bit more like the kind you get in the store so it has more of a syrupy texture I mean that one extra sourdough made then I did use coconut oil in mine but you don't need to I just added to help with the absorption if you choose not to use coconut oil just try to use your spray when you're eating something fatty or take like a soy lecithin pill or something along those lines here's what you're going to need a variety of drink flavors or flavor oils some infuse coconut oil or regular coconut oil tincture if desired water granulated sugar citric acid potassium sorbate mixture exams and gum and some spray bottles start by taking your infused coconut oil and melt it in the microwave until it's liquid our first step is to make our base for our sprays so we do want to add some fat to our sprays but unfortunately oil and water do not mix so we're gonna make an emulsion using water exams and gum and infuse coconut oil you could also use regular coconut oil but if you can up the infusion for this I say why not so we have 1/3 of a cup of water and 1/4 TSP of exams and gum this is what the exams and gum and water mixture should look like after blending it now I'm gonna add in two tablespoons of my melted infused coconut oil and then we're gonna blend that together alright here's how it looks and it's too thick so I ended up having to add it some more water to this so I added 1/3 of a cup more water and left everything else the same so if I were to do this again I would do 1/3 of a cup of water 1/4 teaspoon of example gum or possibly maybe just 1/8 of a teaspoon but I would only do 1 tablespoon of coconut oil now that I added water it definitely looks a lot better I'm just gonna have quite a bit left over now I'm gonna add 1/4 teaspoon of potassium sorbate mixture which I will link how to make below and this is going to preserve your sprays so that they can last for months now I'm going to pour my mixture into my little spray bottles I believe they are 30 milliliters spray bottles and I'm gonna just fill them about less than half of the bottle I mean you can play around with how much you want of this it just kind of affects the texture but if you added more that would work as well the amount of mixture I have is enough for probably six or more bottles now we're going to start with our first spray which is the sour blue raspberry I want mine to be extra strong so I'm also going to be putting some tincture in here I put about 10 of these syringes I don't know but I think equals about a tablespoon you can add more you can add less you can add none it's up to you I could have added more but I didn't want to have too much of an alcohol taste now we're gonna add in our flavoring I'm gonna be using these kool-aid sugar-free flavor packages but you could use regular kool-aid or you could use a flavoring oil it's really up to whatever flavor you would like I'm just using one package but you could use more if you want a stronger taste now to add our citric acid which is going to make our mouth spray sour I'm only going to be adding in one teaspoon of citric acid because this drink mix already has citric acid in it you could use as much or as little citric acid as you like but I would recommend not using any more than three teaspoons of citric acid as I think that would be too sour even for somebody who really does like sour and as you can see I'm really struggling getting the citric acid to go through the funnel and that is because it is wet so I suggest either cleaning it and drying it before you pour anything through that's powdery or to put the citric acid into your containers before you use the funnel with any liquids now I'm just gonna fill the rest of my container up with some water and as you can see I over fill it so just keep a nice eye on how much water you're adding there to add less than have to add a little bit more after then you can shake it all up until everything is all mixed together and you can see it has perfectly emulsified oh never mind there's some clumps in there so with the clumps if you guys can see them on camera I tried to be able to get them but they weren't showing up very well if you get clumps in there it's because the flavor packet was not dissolving properly and that's likely because I use cold water so I just do this in the microwave for about 30 seconds with the lid off and as you can see it's perfect I have a very smooth nice texture now our next one which is the sour watermelon I'm going to be using this Jolly Rancher watermelon drink packet of course you can use a regular couid packet flavoring oil like I said you can really use anything that your heart desires now we're going to add our 1 teaspoon of strick acid as well as the flavoring packet then I'm just gonna give it a quick little mix and then I am going to add some more tincture to this again you don't have to add tincture this is just a personal choice to make my spray stronger now we're just going to fill the rest of the bottle up with some water this time I use warm water and then we're going to shake it up real nice and that's it this one is done and ready to use so now we've made our sugar free watermelon and our sugar free blue raspberry now we're gonna make one with sugar which is going to be our sour green apple spray the first step to making the sugar spray is to mix equal parts water and sugar so I have 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup sugar and I'm going to bring that to a boil and once it comes to a boil I am going to let it cook for another 2 minutes about and then I'm going to take it off the heat once it's off the heat I'm going to add in my flavoring and I am using a kool-aid package I didn't really know how much I was going to need so I just threw the whole pack in there you could use more you could use less again all down to taste but the 1 pack works well for this and of course you could also use a flavoring oil instead then we're just going to mix that all in until it's nice and smooth and evaporated absorbed I'm not sure this is all this the word that I'm looking for so you're going to stir this until all of the powder has been dissolved you can also add the citric acid in at this point I didn't I don't know why I just didn't but it would be easier if you added it in at this point then you can add in your sugar water kool-aid mixture into your jar with the base mixture of coconut oil water it sounds and gum so yeah just pour that right in and then we're going to add our teaspoon of citric acid and like I said it would have been easier had you just done this and while it was still in the pot but that's the really nice thing about making these sprays as they're very very very flexible the only thing you want to be a little bit careful with is making that emulsion mixture that is the base of each of them to bind that oil and water together now I'm just adding some tincture in here it is a unmeasured amount I'm just going for it here now we'll give it a nice little shake and mix it up until it is all finded this one you can already kind of tell when shaking and it has a bit of a different texture from that simple syrup sugar mixture speaking of which you could also use a few simple syrup in this recipe so you can see there's so many ways to do this so I tried it and it was super tasty but I felt like I wanted it more sour like I like it so sour that almost hurts my face so I added in a another teaspoon of citric acid and it turned out perfectly it's so sour and so delicious and the sugary taste of it is like even better than the other ones not gonna lie so I want to show you guys what they look like when they come out and the difference in texture between the sugar-free and the not sugar-free so this red one here is a sugar-free one and it tastes really good I was worried that the sugar-free ones were going to have a like meth taste because they were sugar-free but they were like really really good I almost wouldn't know they weren't sugar-free if no one had told me so but the sugar one has a very different texture and it's more like syrupy a reminds me of when you buy a sort of a candy sour spray from the store it kind of has that same mouthfeel but they're both very very good and I'm not gonna lie to you guys I have to suck this out of a paper towel after I just couldn't waste it thank you guys so much for watching I am so excited about these they're so good please tell me if you make them because I want to hear what flavor combinations and everything that he did and also thinking of doing a mint flavored one without sugar obviously it's better fruity and I don't know like maybe like a Mexican maybe like a spicy one I don't know what do you guys think what would you like to see it we got there so good I'm gonna dicted to this I named a green apple one of my favorite but I love a green apple thank you guys so so much for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave comment and subscribe thanks guys [Music]", "v6fgHX6u6K4": "[Music] and the fruit loop one [Music] how does it taste so much better now like that butter just adds a whole new new layer what's up guys welcome back for those of you who are new to this channel my name is elena welcome and for those of you who are already subscribed welcome back um we're going to be doing a video on how to infuse cereal so we're going to be doing it with both tincture and with butter this will work on pretty much any type of cereal i'm going to be showing you guys or like demonstrating it on these three these are just these props um but yeah it'll work it'll work on all of them so let's start with the tincture um because that one is a little bit more simple so i just have a pan here with some parchment paper or wax paper parchment i guess and let's do some of the cinnamon toast crunch [Music] i'm just gonna do a little bit because i already have some of these made and it's not difficult to make more as i need it [Music] and then let's also use this one [Music] which we never had this in canada for the longest time it was only in the states and then we got here and i honestly wanted to try so bad i was so excited for it before it came to canada and when i tried it i'm just like it's not that exciting like [Music] the crunchies don't taste different like so the berries don't taste different than the cap'n crunch crunches dude you know what i mean like it just like tastes the same i really want to try the cotton candy one how is that one we definitely don't have that here i remember in the states you guys had cotton candy oreos back in 2015 because i was there and i bought some of them and they were like the best oreos i've ever had hopefully they'll come back one day okay so starting with the tincture we have our um captain crunch and our cinnamon toast crunch and this would all be easier being done in something like this because partly through this we're going to need to like turn it over and it helps having in here because you can kind of just like shake it and move it around um but the problem is that i personally only have this type of size of one and i want to keep them um like as spacious as possible so i can get um as much airflow so if you have a bigger one of these that would work well or if you're just doing a small batch okay so um so i already put some of my tincture in a little spray bottle i ordered these on amazon um i'll put a link for something similar but you can use this i'm just like one from the dollar store any type of spray bottle or even those little um like ones that are made for olive oil that kind of mist when you repetitively press them um i've used those as well but kind of like this better surprisingly um yeah so i just poured my tincture into a bottle now i'm gonna spray my cereal with my tincture and then see and this is where it's tricky because you have to flip it around and like you can do it one by one which is really easy for the cinnamon toast crunches especially because they're easy to just grab and turn around but that's a lot of work for doing like larger batches but yeah you could just like shake it flip it with a [Music] flippy a cookie a spatula and then i'm just going to turn these over like this [Music] okay so i think it's actually best to spray them close together so that nothing goes on the paper and it mostly goes on the cereal so then we'll now that we've turned them we're going to spray them some more and you can use as much or as little as you want i mean if you're going to add a lot a lot i would definitely um let them dry in between so we're gonna do that anyway so now that like we have them sprayed i'm gonna spread them out so they have good airflow and then we're going to let this dry um and the alcohol will dry pretty fast especially if you have um moving air wherever you are don't put in the fridge something you want to leave it's an open area so the alcohol can evaporate so then we're just going to leave this until they are pretty dry and then we can spray them some more so we can keep repeating this step until i mean you can repeat as much as you want um it's really that easy no need to put them in like the oven or anything like that so that's how you make them a tincture now we're gonna make them with some butter so we're gonna start by melting some butter i am going to be using a microwave you don't have to you can use a double boiler because every time i use a microwave in my videos i get a million people saying not to use a microwave and i just shouldn't use a microwave but i like using the microwave and i've still had good results like yeah maybe if i use the microwave and everything turns out really weak then maybe i wouldn't use it but then maybe i'm wrong maybe using the microwave um is making them weaker and maybe stronger if i didn't use it uh but i don't really see how the microwave would make a difference i don't see heating it up using the microwave versus anadele boiler would make a difference like i don't really i don't get it so somebody wants to explain to me in the comments and give me like actually the proper explanation and not just like this is what i heard and this is why but like i don't know i'm not flipped it i just like i'm lazy [Music] so i like the microwave but i'm open to listening it's just i need some more solid proof before i change my lazy ways you know okay so i'm just cutting up some um these are this is the butter that i have in um they're in half a cup blocks and i don't want too much right now so i'm just cutting um one of mine into like [Music] so i'm going to go and take this maybe i do want a little bit more let's see how much cereal we're going to do so i'm going to be doing this one oh wait no i'm doing this one i'm gonna be mixing it in here and let's start with let's give the cinnamon toast crunch last because i think the cinnamon um coating is gonna get into the butter and we'll transfer onto the other cereal so let's do fruit loops first the colors on these are not as nice to me i feel like it's probably because they're like colored with like natural colors now or something yeah no artificial flavors of colors does it like that mistakes i feel like canada is like more strict with their regular food regulations just like a lot of stuff tastes better in the states [Music] so let's do it cheerios and then we'll do this one next but i'm gonna i'm gonna go microwave this microwave i'll be right back i'm just gonna sneak back in here and add this other half because i feel like we're gonna need it and i like my stuffed buttery okay so i melted it for about i don't know 40 seconds there's still a couple little chunks i'm just waiting for them to melt with the remaining heat in the butter and so i have my um fruit loops [Music] i'm just gonna pour some of this over and i'm gonna take some of my butter and just drizzle it over not all of it you can always add more right and i'm going to put a lid on this and shake it up sounds a little broken but i don't think they are so we put a little bit in there and we shook it up and i feel like we can add a little bit more so let's just drizzle a little more in there [Music] and shake it up again [Music] oh yeah that looks perfect [Music] sorry i just had a little photo shoot here for the thumbnail um uh yeah so i shut up my butter and um [Music] and those are all shaken up and good and actually this the butter kind of hardens a bit probably because i have the air conditioner on so well i'll show you so i have this tyrex container and i had already treated the oven to about 220 degrees i've done this at 200 degrees i've done it at 250 um i kind of just the results are pretty similar either way so then i'm going to pour that into my baking dish and you can see that the butter kind of hardened in here i'll show you [Music] like that so i'm gonna actually put this whole thing in the microwave just to melt kind of that so that i don't have to like scrape and eat it with the spoon by myself after because i don't want to waste it so yeah i'll just melt that down a bit okay so i melted a little bit of butter and now we're gonna do cinnamon toast crunch which is my favorite actually it's not my favorite i love lots of cereals [Music] and then we're going to pour some butter over it yeah see i did make a little bit too much butter but not that much maybe i'll make some popcorn after and pour that on okay and then i'm just gonna um i don't know well let me zoom in okay so i have my uh slimming tools crunch and my butter oh i'm probably screaming into the camera right now um and i'm just gonna pour that over just a little bit to start with and we're gonna shake that oh my god that was so close to spilling that i can't believe i actually saved that okay see you do this in a plastic bag whatever okay uh [Music] i feel oh this one's gonna taste so good with the butter i can already imagine i'm gonna add a little bit more just a little bit i can you guys know like what am i trying to say like have you ever had that chex mix type thing that's made with um butter in the oven and then it just has that i can't even explain how delicious this is going to be this city into a french one it's like this is what it's about like buttered bread buttered cinnamon bread okay so that's how it looks the lighting is kind of weird uh maybe i'll zoom in when it's on the in the pan i'm just gonna put that in there don't worry it's just me eating this getting my little raccoon fingers all over everything now see what should we use this for cause this is like a mix of like cinnamon sugar and butter i feel like this probably tastes good by itself yes that tastes good by itself oh that is tasty it kind of tastes like frosting but anyways we have our butter coated cereal and it kind of has like a uh textures like i don't know how you explain that let's see uh like a butter texture essentially um so i preheat the oven to [Music] 220 degrees like i said and i'm going to put this in there and we're gonna let it cook for about 10-15 minutes so let's go bring that with us from the kitchen [Music] so i'll turn the lights on and what do we have 220 [Music] and we're gonna put this in i'm going to set a timer for about 10 minutes and we're going to come back and flip so it looks like these have dried a bit but not fully um if you're more patient you can just do this for the day and just come back to it every like hour or so and just spray and then um let it dry and then just do that every hour so you can really layer it up but for the purpose of this video i'm just gonna spray it again here and like i said before you can repeat this process as many times as you like i'm just this is gonna be the last time i'm doing it just because um for the video [Music] although like probably off camera i'll probably spray some more but it just depends on how strong you want to be and this isn't a perfect dosing um method like this isn't like some fancy like exact dosage and like it's not guaranteed the same results every time um but it's just a nice way to kind of just have the little snacks on hand so we're just gonna leave this out to dry we're gonna do that so we can get some better air on it and then that is pretty much good to go once it's fully um crunchy again [Music] okay so 10 minute timer went off and bear with me because i have uh i'm doing this one hand here so i'm just gonna pull this out looking good smells good oh very cinnamony um okay and i'm just gonna like if you just had one flavor in here you could uh how do i say this like [Music] flip it you know what i mean but because i have two i want to keep them separated and this would work better if you had it in a bigger dish so that the heat could get to the more evenly these look like halloween colors that's not what fruit loops used to look like like where's the red ones is it isn't it because red food coloring is supposed to be really bad or it comes from like cockroaches or something i don't know it's like why are you bothered by eating a cockroach when people eat like meat they're just like what's the difference so put that back in and let's do another 10 minutes [Music] and then we will come see actually let's do 15 minutes again like it doesn't really matter usually i put this in the oven between anywhere between like 20 and 45 minutes um and just flip it every like 10 or 15 or so um just just try different types and see how you like it it tastes maybe a little bit different if you cook it for you know half an hour instead of 45 minutes or 20 minutes instead of 45 but you could just take um some out at 20 minutes and then takes about a half an hour and kind of just taste each one and see how you like it the best and you can kind of figure out what your favorite way to do it is um from just one round essentially okay 15 minutes is up so it's been there for a total of 25 minutes oh my god that smells so good like i'm pretty sure it's just the cinnamon stuff it smells good but it literally smells like pie something like that i don't know it's really good oh sorry camera i put that can i put that there so yeah we're just mixing that up i think maybe like 10 or a minute should be good so just throw that back in [Music] and then 10 more minutes [Music] okay now our 15 minutes is over i'm going to turn off the oven and pull these out i think these are good to go let's just bring them over i am just going to lay them out on the parchment paper just to dry i mean i'm sure they could dry in the dish as well but i feel like they'll dry a little bit better here yeah so you kind of have them mixed together [Music] the rest of that here so we're just gonna leave these out to dry i'm just gonna separate the pieces that shouldn't be in the piles there kind of annoying um yeah see there they're not like they're not fully dry but they're just about dry it's all ready oh let's try the fruit [Music] lips sorry yeah so just leave that to dry and then i don't know i think it'll be good in like half an hour and then you can pack them all up once they're fully dry and they are ready to use whether you eat them by themselves or were you for milkover obviously i'm interested in eating them by themselves they're really good but thank you guys so much for watching i hope you guys enjoyed this video please let me know if you did um i feel like i need to get a new ending because i feel like i say the exact same thing every time i hope you guys like this video and [Music] thank you guys so much for watching i hope you like this video please let me know if you did don't forget to give it a thumbs up leave a comment tell me what your favorite cereal is and subscribe thank you guys so much i hope you have a wonderful day see you guys next time i'm back because i forgot to taste the tincture ones i guess because they're not fully dry but or are they okay they're pretty much dry they can dry out for a little bit longer um honestly like not as good as the butter because well you can still taste the alcohol in a little bit like it mostly evaporates but you can still taste it a little bit and butter is there anything you can add butter to that doesn't taste good like obviously not dumplings like adding butter fruits actually you know why adding butter to fruit like in the oven is good it's like apple crisp you know but the better one's better and crunchier and buddier okay that's all it tastes kind of like reminds me of pie [Music] because the butter [Music] and the frugal ones how does it taste so much better now like that butter just adds a whole new [Music] layer", "LuuKvfonSis": "Angell Tiger is a speaker and activist and an entrepreneur she works with the LA cannabis medical task force and runs her own cannabis edibles company known as Ruby doobie and we've got a lot of Ruby dooby goodies in front of us right now angel thanks for thanks for joining me thank you for inviting me Dave yeah I'm very excited to talk to you because I've wanted to do something a little more in-depth on pot for a long time and and you brought pot cookies brownies let's get into this stuff first okay and then we'll talk about the history at legalization what do we got in front of us these are some of the things that I make sweet dreams brownie it's a dusted with a little bit of sea salt on top it's about 57 milligrams here so 37 milligrams of THC what does that mean so you you ate that how do you feel after well I personally would not eat a whole brownie right I would have half and that's plenty for me but it really depends on your own metabolism and your your how experienced you are and it can differ on depending on the day and on how much you've eaten that day right and doshas dosage guidelines very you know I've seen recommended dosages between 5 and 15 milligrams for people or some who want between 20 and 30 and this is all sort of unchartered territory for a lot of people because for a long time you know I think I said once on the show when I got my weed card I went in there and I said you know they showed me wax they showed me oil they showed me edibles I said well do you have any just weed you know green buds like old fashioned weed and that made me feel like old I got a guy wants a smoked weed but this is sort of the new thing right well you I think not as many people are familiar with edibles but it's been around and it's a great way to make use of the whole plant because really what when you smoke you're smoking the flowers the buds mmm but you still have all of the leaves and the trim and the small buds and all of that has a you know active ingredients in it too and that's primarily what I used to make my goodies and here's a peanut butter brownie ginger cookie the crew is very excited by the way I'm happy ginger cookies credible cookies and chocolate chip cookies and I make cakes and other things too lemon bars yeah so you make all this stuff and this is for people that may want the medicinal benefits this is for people that may want the recreational benefits it doesn't matter to you right like you're selling it then and yeah it's nice of someone alleviates some pain but right well I work with the dispensaries I work with a handful of dispensaries in my area so I am a member that's that's providing edibles for my fellow members sure and you know you can't really you you can't in California you still have to get a doctor's recommendation to even go to those dispensaries right so my sacha hard it's not it isn't right and and it's tough to make the distinction between what's recreative to distinguish between recreational and medicinal because if it's if you're using it to relax at the end of the day and to de-stress hmm that's me that's it isn't it in some ways yeah all right so let's get a little bit into your story and then we'll talk about business and legalization and all that chef so you got into weed basically I think you were smoking it recreationally but the reason you really got into this was because you were having migraines and pretty much the Western medicine that you were trying just wasn't anything right yes but I think there were two forces that kind of both intersected and and drove me into cannabis definitely my migraines I I've had migraines for many many years and about ten years ago they started getting a lot worse and more frequent and I was trying all kinds of different medications I had a steroids injected into my neck to try to get rid of them I had some prescriptions that were so strong that they require that the triplicate prescription you know and nothing helped me I mean lots of times that the drugs would irritate my stomach so much that I would feel worse sometimes they would just knock me out and that's how I was survived my migraines no and cannabis is really what allowed me to to continue living and manage them without having to check out for weeks at a time or days at a time so that definitely treating my migraines was one forest and also a desire to simplify my life you know I am I was working at the XPrize Foundation I was a chief of staff there and you know very rewarding challenging position but I just felt that there was something missing you know I I wasn't spending very much time with my son who was two years old at the time I would have to travel a lot and I just wanted to create a change in my life where where I would not be so dependent on on a check grow growth my own food and cook my own meals and and rather than pay someone to do this and that I wanted to do those things I wanted to be the one with with my family right so that's really interesting so it wasn't just I want to get stoned and have a good time you got into the edible garden thing which it was nice you were growing weed but you were also growing stuff to actually eat and to lead to feed your child we were growing in at one point we were going enough food in our garden that it was too much for us to even eat I mean neighbors would come and we encouraged our neighbors to come and tomatoes artichokes peppers eggplants collard greens charred kale I mean we still have you know lemon trees apple trees nectarines oranges it's a beautiful thing to just go outside and pick your food and you know you don't have to get in your car yeah yes you can't get anything fresher than that yeah it's funny I have I mean I live in LA - and you know I have a little outdoor space with a little garden and even if I'm just plucking tomatoes or something I find that very therapeutic oh it is so just that action of doing of growing something for yourself whether it's marijuana or a tomato or a pepper or something even right there connecting with nature this is all intertwined with ultimately you going into this business I believe so I mean it's wanting to simplify wanting to be more in touch with nature you know it's so easy to get disconnected from food and to know what food looks like when it's actually growing I mean when I when we first planted our garden it was with the help of a nonprofit called la green grounds and we had 50 volunteers come out and help us plant our front yard and our parkways and I was intimidated because I had never tried to grow food before and I didn't know how it all worked and it's I'd never put my hands in the dirt and planted anything and to watch things grow and to be able to feed my family that way and and help you know feed the neighborhood it was an amazing experience and food food is medicine you know cannabis is medicine I mean I really don't see much of a difference right so you see this green thing that grows naturally from the earth like all this other stuff that we eat you see that just sort of as an extension of every other thing but the city wasn't that thrilled right with your your garden so here you are a person that sort of takes life into your own hands on your own property and the city of Los Angeles what did they do well okay going back a little while I what got me inspired to plant the garden as I watched a TED talk by Ron Finley I don't know if you've heard of him the gorillas garden against gangster garden oh okay yeah so um the whole idea of that he presented growing your own food is like printing your own money I mean there were some things that just resonated so deeply with me that immediately after I saw the talk I I got in touch with la green grounds and said I I need to learn how to do this how can I volunteer and it turns out they were actually looking for an LA resident to plant a garden and the timing was perfect so we planted we were selected and that's how we got our garden so yeah the city though didn't want you to do it it's something all right so Ron when he when he did his TED talk he had planted an edible garden a few years before mine and was sighted and went to City Council and made the case that you know it doesn't make sense you should allow people to grow food on their on their parkways and the City Council at that time agreed and said that they would work to change the laws in fast forward two years later I plant you know we plant our garden and I was operating under the assumption that it was all good right the the changes were in the works but a few months after this we were cited I mean a guy came to my house and kind of aggressively said you know all of this has to come out and you have 48 hours to put it all back to the way it was and so this had nothing to do with weed just to me know this is known squash yeah oh yes eggplants oh yeah things like that so that because we had the support of a lot of you know la green grounds and Ron and it was easy to to get attention drawn to the to the issue it had been going on for some time Lopez from the LA Times came out and and wrote an article about our garden and it it helped bring the City Council's attention back to this issue and not long after that they did change the laws so you anyone in LA can can grow fruits and vegetables on their on their Parkway before you had to there was only a short list of approved things you could grow right and if you wanted to deviate from that you had to I think filed a request and I think was like $400 to even ask just to ask to use your own property yeah your own yeah and then you know you might not get the approval yeah so now I think the way the law reads is you can grow whatever you want except for some some fruit trees are not allowed to be on the Parkway but it was it's a huge step right right now as long as you have a medical marijuana license you can also grow eat I'm guessing you can't do that in the front of your house though I don't think it was it would be such a good idea probably not a great idea all right well I don't want to get too into the weeds on that one antenna but I thought it was an interesting way to start because it shows how marijuana and legalization and medicinal uses and all that are so tied into our legal system and then we can get into some of that stuff so alright so you have the migraines you start saying all right I'm going to smoke weed to make myself feel better how long did it take to figure out what worked for you what actually was the right strain and can you talk about strains a little bit well you know I I know with some conditions people look for particular strains you know I think okay so there there yeah let's do let's do one away yeah when you talk about cannabis there there's cannabis indica and sativa right I sit there they look different physically like sativa plants are usually taller and leaner thinner branches and grow better in warmer climates kazar kind of shorter and bushier and hard ear besides that indicas are usually they help to relax you most people will use them at night too as a sleep aid or and sativas generally will give you more energy let you keep more focus so more people will use sativas during the day because you can still function all my comedian friends that get stoned on sativas and write all day yeah exactly right and then within okay so you have strains that are either indica or sativa or they can be a hybrid and then each particular strain has its own profile how much THC is in there how much CBD is in there yeah and so let's unpack that a little bit so THC is the psychoactive are correct and CBD is is it's the medicinal part is there to describe that THC also has medicinal properties but it is the psychoactive a element CBD is is cannabidiol it's another cannabinoid those aren't the only two I mean there there are others and but CBD does seem to have most of the medicinal value I mean it can it can it's been shown to stop some tumor growth it's you know it's great for pain relief its reduces inflammation you know it's I mean I have a friend that takes CBD well for anxiety right and she told me all she does literally is it she's a little dropper in the morning she drops like two drops of every time that's it it doesn't have the diarrhea and vomiting and thoughts of suicide and restless leg syndrome and all the other crazy things that come with all the commercials that you see on TV for all these other antidepressant it's it's there it's so gentle I mean it has so many benefits and has never killed anyone um mentioned that at the top I've never murdered in yeah yet to happen but it's it still boggles my mind that a plant first of all that has so many medicinal properties so and besides medicine I mean what about you know renewable energy and you know paper you know I mean it's it's strong it's a strong fiber I mean replace so many things the fact that we look at it is such an evil thing I don't understand yeah how can I can tell it it truly boggles the mind yes yeah yes all right so we have THC CBD and then you have the indica and sativa and the hybrids of that so for the medicinal stuff let's just do that first people if you didn't want to get stoned but you just wanted medicinal benefits that's where you would use just the CBD is that right um okay CBD yes you you want that but there's been a lot of research research that shows that CBD alone is not as effective as when you mix it with THC meaning that it's the whole plant that you want to treat you with not just taking a one piece of it um I think it it's referred to as the entourage effect because there's so many elements and they all kind of work together so people who are looking for CBD are usually looking for CBD rich strains or in some cases you know like the concentrates and things like that but I think for the most part you'll find that they're more effective when when there is a little THC in there yeah so when you found the right one for you well first up how long did it take for you to find weed that was like oh these migraines are dying you know I didn't even think about weed as a treatment for my migraines because when I get bad migraines I would get very nauseous dizzy a smoking pot was the last thing I thought would help me really but then I I did read that it helps and for me it's it it relaxes me enough that I mean it it helps the nausea and also it helps me control the anxiety that comes along with with the onset of a migraine I don't know if it's like two things attacking you at once if the migraine but then knowing it's coming now you're said oh my gosh about that yes and the need to try to hit both it treats both of those things yeah yeah yeah um all right so then you started doing that it was working when did you say all right I could make a business out of this or I got it I gotta tell people what's going on here well you know a friend of mine was baking and I was fascinated by it and so I would look up recipes and send them to me you should try this you should try that and he's finally he got to the point where he said you know what angel you should try it so I started experimenting and that's how I got introduced to making edibles and then I started trying them because well honestly I tried a few edibles and hated them I mean this is going back to like 2008 or something I mean before they had perfected right the brownies in the cook exactly I mean at that time you'd go to a dispensary and you'd see stuff that was just in like Ziploc bags and you know totally unappetizing to look at and oftentimes didn't taste very good and I mean I found myself in those early days just sort of like you know eating it real quick and just hoping for the best when now it's like literally it's like going into a great Baker oh you can get any anything pizzas sauces so chocolate bars can be any I can think of yeah you", "9eUIhvGKKiI": "Hey there! Welcome to Life Noggin! Oh there's a fog rolling in! Wait a minute! [Blocko Sniffs] That's not fog! People have been using cannabis as a sleep\naid for decades, mainly due to the feeling of relaxation and calm it\u2019s commonly associated\nwith. And many believe that it can even help with\nsleep disorders. Studies evaluating the effect of cannabis\non sleep go back to the 70\u2019s, but, because marijuana use has been illegal in the United\nStates since the 30s, research in this field has been largely restricted, and we are still\nlacking verifiable evidence of its effects on health. But scientists have been studying its main\nchemical components for the treatment of many medical issues, like the nausea caused by\ncancer treatments, seizures in children, pain and different sleep disorders. Before we get into how it affects your sleep,\nwe should probably talk about how it all works. What we call weed, pot, or marijuana is actually\na mixture of the dried flowers of the Cannabis sativa plant. It can be smoked, vaped, brewed in teas, made\ninto foods, or concentrated into resins and oils. No matter how you take it, the chemicals in\nthe plant will make their way into your bloodstream, travel throughout your body, and end up in\nyour brain. How fast you feel the effects and how strong\nthey are depends on the method of ingestion. And your experiences can range from relaxation\nand euphoria, to anxiety, fear and panic depending on how much you take and the potency\nof the drug\u2019s active chemicals., Some who have taken large doses have even experienced\na temporary psychosis, including hallucinations and delusions. So it\u2019s really, really important to be careful\nwith how much you\u2019re taking and how. And cannabis use has been associated with\nharmful side effects on brain development and the lungs, and can even result in addiction. The main chemical in cannabis is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol\n- but you can call it THC. THC is a psychoactive chemical, which means\nthat it can alter your mind. It does this by attaching to neurons in your\nbrain and activating them. This disrupts normal mental and physical functions,\ncausing the sensations typically associated a \u201chigh\u201d. Cannabis also contains another chemical that\nis not psychoactive, called cannabidiol, or CBD. Older studies looking at the effect of the\nwhole cannabis plant on sleep had mixed findings, with some indicating that it can help you\nfall asleep faster and stay asleep, and others showing it can decrease REM sleep,, - which\nis thought to be involved with storing memories, learning, and regulating your mood. More recent studies focus on these major chemicals\nin cannabis, THC and CBD. They found that THC may only have a short-term\nbenefit, with continuous use causing a habit or dependency, as withdrawal from the drug\ncan cause difficulties sleeping.,, Studies also found that THC caused daytime\nsleepiness and bad moods, increased the time to fall asleep, and reduced the body\u2019s circadian\nrhythm - which is needed to regulate your sleep/wake cycle. However, medicines made from it could help\nwith certain sleep disorders like nightmares associated with post-traumatic stress disorder\nand obstructive sleep apnea. It\u2019s clear that more research needs to be\ndone before any definitive conclusions can be made. But, until then, it may be better to stick\nto natural sleep methods like avoiding caffeine, exercising, and keeping a regular sleep schedule.", "vvOrD3iny_8": "[Music] so [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another delta 8 video uh this is another delta 8 hemp video i actually completely forgot i still had tincture i still had another one of these products to make a video on and uh what better way to have some apple juice but these are tinctures and with tinctures they actually are droppers or like you basically put it underneath the tongue and let it absorb into your system but i've seen people put it in drinks as well and i'm very fortunate enough to have the pineapple express one if you can tell from the intro uh it also says the amount per serving is 30 30 drop wait serving size 30 drops wait serving per container 30. okay so those 900 drops is what they're saying and then one serving which is 30 drops is 33 milligrams of delta athc so yeah let's see this i've only tried a few tinctures and they're mostly very i would say it's a very alcoholic taste because i believe there's like i don't know was it glycerin i don't even know what it was in there but i'm sure there was alcohol in the last tincture i tried definitely was not good at all so we're just gonna open this oh it shows okay so this is at about 75 milligrams i'm smelling it smells really nice so 75 one milliliter is 30 drops so we're at 75 so that should be about should be about 22.5 milligrams all right 22.5 milligrams here we go kind of tasted like bubblegum it's a very minimal taste at best but since it's the only thing i put in my mouth like i can taste it but like if i were to put it in this i feel like i wouldn't taste it but we're gonna do that um but no not bad i was honestly expecting a much worse taste so let's do another let's do another 75 in here so obviously the effects aren't gonna [ __ ] just immediately take over you know so i will be filming again in about an hour or so uh but yes i wanted to get a shot of me pouring this in here how many shots let's see seventy-five another 75 [ __ ] it we'll do another 75 all right so how many was that so that's about 70 milligrams of delta eight thc in there i think i did over 100 plus milligrams on this stuff so i'm excited to see oh [ __ ] you can see it's just is that chill in there what the [ __ ] so just like that's crazy there's like a layer on top yeah i drink mostly it well that tastes like pineapple and apple now pineapple and apple juice that's crazy good so i'm gonna get back to you in about 30 or 45 minutes to an hour i do have a fast metabolism so it might be a little bit quicker than that but overall you know another good way to take delta athc you know there's gummies there's actually dabbing it there's cartridges and now there's tinctures as well and for those of you who you know i think i feel like like some people don't like to um medicate you like normally you know smoking flower or vaping or dabbing or anything and they want more of a i wouldn't say a better way but a more i don't know how to say it but it's just you know you just put it underneath the tongue and you go about your day that's about it you know what i'm saying and uh you you set it in your mouth and you forget it basically but other than that yes i will be filming or i will get back to you in about an hour or so so [Music] all right guys so i am back uh it's been about 45 minutes i mean i do feel somewhat of a buzz but i honestly feel like what i take like 100 milligrams i think my tolerance is a little bit higher than that but i definitely do feel it i definitely feel it around the eyes and everything um as far as like the drink goes i drank most of it because it tastes like just apple juice now and uh as you've seen from the earlier clip it was just sitting on top i mean yeah it's still it just tastes like apple juice but you can still put some of this in here [ __ ] it so we're gonna end it off i'm gonna take some more but i definitely do feel it and for how little i took you know i didn't take that much i took like what 80 milligrams or something or so [Music] okay i'm gonna take some more real quick before i end it off but i definitely do feel a head change oh but yes uh definitely i would i would definitely recommend it for the people that um don't want to smoke or vape or dab or eat edibles because you know that's a lot of uh sugar you know all those gummies like that one video i did recently there's a lot of a lot of [ __ ] sugar especially in the morning but this is a more subtle way of dosing and uh and yeah it's just a great way to to get some delta into your system and it's legal link will be in the comments below if you're interested but other than that hopefully you did enjoy this video cheers to some regular apple juice i mean there's a slight pineapple but not as strong as it was when i just put it in there but yeah hopefully you did enjoy the video peace out [Music] do [Music] you"}
