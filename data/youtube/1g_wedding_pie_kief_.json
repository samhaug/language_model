"D4n4jB6ZvsQ": "what up and welcome to another edition of canopy where we are bringing to you honest and unbiased cannabis strain review so today we are going to be reviewing wedding pie by our friends over at true infusion you guys now wedding pie is an indica dominant hybrid that is a cross between one of my favorite strains of all time wedding cake and cherry pie so this is going to be the very first time we are reviewing wedding pie on this channel so i am excited to try this out but before we get into it i'm going to bring it up on the screen so you guys can check it out and then we're going to take a look at it together all right so what did you guys think of this stuff honestly i think it looks amazing amazing great job on the bag appeal over there true infusion guys really impressed with this stuff so let's pop the top and take a look at this stuff so you guys one thing that i love about true infusion is they are all about transparency this ganja is testing out at 24.84 percent total cannabinoids and then twenty one point three three percent active cannabis uh thc in this so this anything that's testing out at over twenty percent active thc is definitely strong definitely potent so i am excited to try this out you guys so it's got that quintessential cake flavor you guys like that is the very first thing that i am smelling is just that sweet not overly sweet smell it's not citrusy either or anything like that you guys so gosh look at this nug this was the nug that was the center one in the picture that you guys were looking at and it's like so colorful you guys this stuff is beautiful beautiful beautiful it's actually it's kind of on the darker side but it's got these light lime green notes like coming from underneath the bud along with these purple hues as well and it's like it just makes for a very interesting looking ganja i mean it's almost yellowy but it's not yellowy it's kind of a lime green underneath um and this stuff is fairly fresh still so this stuff was harvested oh god i love that smell this stuff was harvested on june the 19th you guys so being that it was harvested on june 19th today right now i'm filming this on the 29th of july so it's really only about a month or so old a month and a week old which is about the time you want to be getting it probably about after a month is really when you want to get it so there was still some malleability to this bud it was definitely still like you could press on it and still feel there was still some moisture in the bud which is great because after i throw my boveda packet in here it'll maintain that humidity at a perfect 62 percent so yeah from a smell perspective guys this has the smell now it's not like filling up the room and it's crazy aromatic but it is that sweet cake smell i'm not really getting much of the cherry pie but like you know it definitely is not like the regular cake there's a little something to it and that's probably the cherry pie um i will tell you guys when i broke this stuff up in the grinder oh my gosh the aroma was so juicy so good i was literally like oh my god i want to get this review started right now so that's exactly what we are going to do is get this party jumping so today i'm going to be enjoying this wedding pie out of my air riser extreme q desktop vape i've got this bad boy set to 375 degrees and look at all that access shake there clean this thing off come on what a nerd you guys so and you know i like to keep my stuff clean that's why i'm seeing all this like oh no it doesn't work for me and then i'm feeding the vape into my you know it triple filtered scientific inhalations piece and no we are not sponsored by the um desktop vape company here um or are we sponsored by scientific inhalations but i still give props where props are due and i want to tell you guys how i'm ingesting my medicine so first chamber here is where carbon goes that actually goes right there we've left that empty because there's no ash that will be getting in the second chamber i've got some brand new purified water you guys see this piece is crystal clear because i just cleaned it out to ensure that i get all of the correct terps here in that last chamber i've just got a brand new organic cotton filter to filter out any remaining impurities that might not have been purged out in the growing process here but i know the guys do a true infusion make the quality medicine so there is not anything i am guessing that has been left in this ganja so without further ado why don't we go ahead and get this review started even the dogs are excited you guys that means i'm excited so it is time to start your engines get your pieces ready fire him up and let's try out some of this wedding pie by true infusion all right so you guys i literally this is crazy because i know that wasn't huge but it wasn't small either and i didn't even feel like i was getting anything so when i blew that out and actually have some of that sweet taste on my tongue like oh my gosh that's actually shocking i'm diving back in because i want to see if these sweet notes develop anymore as i'm sure they're going to i'm so excited oh wow what a pull oh man that was a lot bigger rip than i thought i was gonna get you guys see my face is all flush i'm getting red ah you guys that was actually really enjoyable like it was not only was the vapor extremely extremely smooth it's left my mouth with this just subtle sweetness now it's not overwhelmingly sweet but i definitely taste that cake flavor in there again not too much of the cherry pie like maybe just a tiny tiny bit the cake is more of the dominant and pronounced terpenes that i'm getting from this so just that nice sweetness um you know so i really gotta be honest i really really like that and i can't wait to finish up trying out this wedding pie but while i am doing that i'm gonna bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out under a 25 times magnification lens so you can get a little bit of a better up close and personal view of it so here it comes nah so here is the wedding pie by true infusion you guys i feel like i'm looking into a rainbow right now this has got light green it's got dark green it's got some purple mixed in there those bright orange hairs interwoven perfectly throughout the bud you guys can see that leaf material was trimmed right up to the bud no auto trimmer for this stuff just absolutely frosty as it comes you guys i mean what a great proportion of crystals to hair on this wedding pie by true infusions wow all right so you guys tell me that wasn't crazy looking stuff like it's really interesting i mean we haven't really seen bud that kind of looks quite like this before it's very very unique but i'm so excited to talk about this stuff you guys no joke this wedding pie from true infusion is so legit like so legit you guys like i literally like more towards the end of the bowl and kind of just like finding myself getting caught in thought and just like just daydreaming and like it's super cerebral and it's totally an indica hybrid because i'm feeling way chilled out but my mind is in a good good space i mean i probably wouldn't go to work and be puffing this stuff like this is the end of the night stuff and the flavor you guys the flavor is on point all of that kush or you guys said all of that cake flavor like is just running rampant through this bud it was so smooth and such an enjoyable process to um to puff this stuff you guys the terps weren't like the loudest i've ever had but like these cake ones aren't they're kind of subtle you know that's what like a cake or a pie strain is going to be a little bit more subtle it's not like the citrusy ones that are like boom like that orange cush that we just tried from them and where it's like so in your face you know this is just nice and just mellow and i love it you guys so here's the deal i want to give you guys the rundown on this stuff but before i do that i'm going to bring it up on the screen one more time for you guys to check out so i can actually give you guys my rating in each of the four different categories but i want you to see it first and we'll start with the actual visual category so we'll go from there but here it comes one final time this is the wedding pie okay so you guys have seen this stuff multiple times here is the deal when it comes to the look of this stuff it's just crazy it's so funky you guys like i mean it's like it's light green it's dark green um it's got these purple purple leaves on it um and gosh here's a pocket where you know maybe a piece of blood fell off of this uh nug i'm sure that's exactly what happened here and the inside of this this little pocket right there there it is you guys see it right there these crystals are huge you guys and even as i pull this stuff out like god i love this smell i love the smell and it's not like again filling up the room or anything but it is so good but from a looks perspective you guys to me i'm gonna give it a two not a 2.5 so here's how the rating scale goes for those of you who have never been to the channel before i want to tell you guys about how we break down these reviews okay so i give all of the strains you know a rating from 0 to 10 overall i break those down into four different categories each of those categories is assigned 2.5 points out of the 10. so the four categories that i break this down is the look or the visual the smell the taste and the actual smoke process or vape process and the potency or how effective the medicine is so those are the four different categories in looks department you guys i'm going to give this stuff it's funny i'm kind of been going back and forth because like it looks amazing don't get me wrong you guys i mean i think it's a 9 out of 10. like i've seen bud that i think looks better but this is really cool so it's like it's so unique that it's like i almost want to give it a 2.5 that's what i'm going to do honestly you guys i'm going to give this a 2.5 in the looks department because the leafs are trimmed all those purple leaves there are trimmed right up to the bud so i'm going to give this a full 2.5 out of 2.5 in the looks and visual bag appeal standpoint now the smell to me you guys i think it's a two a solid two it's not stinking up the room and super super aromatic honestly i bet you they vacuum sealed these packages no joke that problem would go away this stuff would absolutely reek and it would still be just as fresh as the day that they packaged it from the taste department i'm going to give it a 2 as well so you know not a 2.5 but a two it tastes so so good not quite as like strong of terps as i would have liked but that's not to say anything bad this stuff was amazing amazing so a two in the taste category and then the potency or how effective this medicine is you guys it's a 2.5 this stuff is banging on all cylinders no joke i think it's the most potent and best stuff that we've had from them and it's not even the highest rating in thc which is crazy or like it's just affecting me the best the uh cannabinoids in this ganja so let's break it down again we're going to go with a 2.5 in the looks category a 2.5 in the potency category they're already up to five points you guys a perfect five for the first two categories the tastes category it's gonna be a two and then in the smell category it's gonna be a two so that's another four it's a nine for the wedding pie for me you guys honestly i think this stuff deserves an a they worked hard to grow this stuff i know that team is just putting out amazing medicine this is a good good product i would absolutely pick this stuff up if you guys see it the wedding pie is the thumbs up it's a dank absolutely grabbed for it that jar you don't want to miss so that's going to do it for today you guys but definitely let me know if you guys have tried out this wedding pie by true infusion and let me know what you guys think of it in the comments below and then if there is any strains or any strains that you guys want to see reviewed or can recommend to me we are looking for the tens you guys nines are great nine point fives are even better but tens are what we're looking for the elusive tens we haven't reviewed one yet you guys who's gonna throw me that ten bone i wanna see it so leave your comments below you guys but still nine out of ten for the wedding pie buy true infusion keep up the great work you guys love it and until the next one you guys take good care of yourselves and enough one another and i will see you guys soon [Music] peace", "-Ow97uDqoZI": "okay cool so today in the name of what's in my pre-roll we've got this 2g double pack of strawberry wedding cake from sf roots via ease uh he's dropped some money into my account so i was like all right let me just take advantage of this let me just buy a bunch of joints from places that i haven't heard of before i've seen these guys on ease i don't know if i've seen them in a shop but i was curious so i figured hey why not let's check it out together so here we go we've got sf roots we've got whole flower premium pre-roll so that's what we're looking at here and it is infused i don't know if i said that earlier but here is the deets if i can zoom in on this little area here hold on there we go all right so this is coming out the total cannabinoids of 22.93 thc at 20.28 zero cbd and this was packaged back on july 25th we are mid-november now so that is a few months about four months ago this expires i guess next year according to this there's the batch info etc i think that's all the information keef infused light pre-roll whoops keep infused instructions light inhale enjoy all right cool that's that so this is a double pack of 1g joints inside supposedly let's see what other info we got on here strawberry wedding cake government warning watch out they're always watching some distributor yeah and that looks to be it so all right i just didn't want to miss anything there so my haste to get this done before my phone potentially overheats because it does that on these longer videos so here we go so this was 20 bucks pre-tax i believe so for two 1g joints that are infused that's not too bad depending on the material inside it says whole flower premium come on guys come on out pre-rolls there we go whole flower premium so i don't know what that's supposed to be i guess i'll save one of these to smoke and i'll try to smoke it and talk live about it on my patreon maybe i'll do a live or something but this one's going back coffee's working right now let's see all right so this is what we got so you can see a little bit came out already just was hanging out in the tube i guess maybe made its way out of these js it's a little heavily packed at the top but the crutch doesn't appear to be too weak the bend is happening up further so that's not too bad decent crutch let me get a dry pool it's got a floral sweetness to it it does not taste bad at all i think that's that wedding cakey kind of sweetness in there so that's cool it's not tasting too bad it's not super pronounced though i'm not trying to mislead you nothing on the outside so i'm guessing there's going to be extra keefe basically on the inside and now you know i'm not one two oops let me get in focus there i'm not one to be all about the thc percentages that's not me man let me zoom in i'm so far away you guys are just seeing my hand basically you're not seeing this masterful twist this masterful spiral cut that i'm doing that's totally intentional all right yeah it's having a hard one today the coffee is running thick there we go all right so this is supposed to be a full g i guess it's a g with the floral material our plant material is probably would be more commonly said and the keef but we're going to find out what else is in here it's looking a little dark it did say it was premium but it didn't make any claims i don't believe of being indoor yeah nothing left in there all right so there's what came out there's a little bit better of a view on it so yeah it doesn't make any claims on the tube here it just says whole flower premium pre-roll but it doesn't say it's indoor or anything like that so no promises made it's looking like it's greenhouse to me uh just from the color alone but hey that could just be the color of the nug maybe i'm wrong on that sf roots feel free to chime in so it does seem that has these chunks here of uh of keefe so it's infused i guess but it's kind of chunked up together there in little bits let's see if we can find any unwanted passengers in here the material is just looking fairly ground i guess this is probably a big chunk of keefe there we go fairly ground down um not atypical for pre-rolls in general but i'm thinking that if there were there's a big chunk key right there uh if there were any passengers that they would have been finely ground two little bits and looking something like that so like there's just a little tiny evident i mean you know this i don't know the quality of the flower that went into this i can't say it says premium this is a little piece of a seed pod right here what's this guy i don't know chime in what do you guys think what that is it looks it's too small it's just all ground up it's too hard to tell it could just be a little piece of one of those like tiny premature seed pods here's a bigger piece of lumber so so yeah it looks evident that this was just kind of ground up i'm sure they used some kind of fruit futuro machine or some other mask grinder and they're mass packing it but the material itself didn't taste too bad on the dry pool let me get a sniff on this you guys take a look in there but yeah you know i mean this is two 1g joints in one tube so what can you expect for that but yeah not smelling anything fantastic just a little minty a little musty just plant like you know overall plant that's what i'm getting off of this so so yeah the taste was a little better than the smell but let's go ahead and get a weight on this get the scale kicking over here you guys just admire those little piles of keefe and i'll smoke the other one and we'll see how it goes why not you know it's not like i'm not super turned off by this material but it's just you know it seems like it's fairly evident that this is not indoor especially by the smell too but but i mean the color was my first my first um indication i guess but all right let me zoom way out here here we go getting the way on let's tear this bad boy out all righty teared you guys can see that perfect so if this comes out to 0.9 or more just because i like to give that a little bit of leeway with my scale 0.9 or higher then we are good to go gets a pass you know i mean it's like i'm not again super stoked coming up to 0.8 let me re-weigh got a little bit of dust here there we go retail i'll just do it again for safety's sake but let's see it might come up if it comes up 0.8 maybe it is a little shy maybe the other one is 1.1 because it is two and one tube you can't say there's not much okay there's point nine so all right let's give it to him it's a pass it's a technical path um not an s rank i would say it's kind of like a i'll give this like a b or a c i don't know it depends on how much i like this student how much i want them out of my class but that's what you're getting 20 bucks plus tax for two of these that's just the contents of one so you have the knowledge now use it to your discretion if you want it if you find it for a price you like go for it", "wGz0luSndiQ": "[Music] what's good with you i'mma kill the real deal with zeal and mass

wedding cake hybrid flower thank you so much i want to shout out jameson and vanessa who came through and dropped it off of me and i'm looking forward to smoking this partially because i haven't smoked today but also because of the dank scent the thc percentage is 27 and the dank scent that i talked about that awesome fire comes from all the limonene which gives it a citrus aroma limonene it can also boost the mood and there's also awesome in here which you can definitely smell in the refreshing herbal essence and wedding cake is a hybrid strain it's come from it comes from cherry pie and

that's pretty good zoom well there you go guys enjoy once again please like subscribe comment on my channel that would be great awesome check out some of my other videos I got a bunch coming great thanks guys", "qFQ0ICv5yPA": "hey everybody how's it going today well you're in for a treat here i'm pressing an ounce of wedding cake and this stuff i i pressed a quarter of it yesterday it came out amazing uh so i had to go back and get more so right on here we got two nut smasher 120 micron 14 gram bags and we're pressing this at 200 degrees on my crd 20 ton drip tech rosin press and if we're lucky we're going to get a chance to show you how it tilts and how it how it drips it right off the plates so here we go hope everybody is having a great thanksgiving hope you're staying safe staying medicated being good to each other out there it was a very low-key day just myself my wife and our and our kitty zina warrior today and watched a little football watched a little movies and now it's time to make a little video that's what we're doing today i hope everybody got some really good flowers some good concentrates whatever it is that you'd like to do with cannabis as far as medicating i hope that you found something that that works for you uh i definitely have this stuff is an indica heavy hybrid very endicoline and it is incredibly incredibly body heavy uh it will pouch-lock you so let's see here just let that heat start to work a little bit before i go up to full pressure let me know what you guys are hitting on in the comments please uh subscribe and and hit the thumbs up if you like this video and the videos that i put out uh bring this pressure up a little bit now see if we can get him to start sweating a little bit gotta keep adjusting the lighting as it as those plates come together it gets harder and harder to give you a good view of things so please bear with me as i readjust things a little bit here to ensure that you're still seeing what's going on now let's start with sweat already you see that the very front edge at the top of the left hand bag and right down at the bottom in the front edge of the right i'm bringing the pressure up gently don't want to risk a blowout at that medicine i'm going to bring it in a little closer for you see that look at that all right let's bring her up to pressure look at that material move look at it move as i add pressure to it look at that beautiful beautiful medicine continuing to bring it up that material still moving once i get where i feel is full pressure on this i will tilt this thing forward and we will see if any of it wants to drip i think we're good right there so bear with me here as i back out of this i'm gonna move the camera a little bit here so you can see what is going on lighting the face down here okay so here we go tilt it and see if it gives us anything there we go all right let's see if i'll get that a little bit better for you look at that medicine [Music] look at that that's what i'm talking about [Music] youth you know a lot of people say they don't like flower raws and they prefer hash rosin or whatever you know what that's fine but quite honestly i get really good clarity really good purity from pressing high quality high thc flower and i swear by it and it isn't just because i know that hash rosin is supposedly better but it's it's also a lot easier to produce i mean once you've made it into bubble hash pressing that into rosin is not all together that difficult and you get amazing yields because you're already pressing the concentrate however you press flower that takes some skill and take some serious skill to get right to get get it so you're not having contamination to get the kind of clarity and quality that that i am getting off this this is a real serious serious thing that i do uh and i specialize in pressing flower rosin i don't have access to enough material to do hash pa it is what it is you know but i make real real decent flower rods this is garbage in garbage out the better the material i get the better the rosins bigger the yields every time okay so let's tilt this back up now readjust our our shot back out we're gonna put this back over here get our lighting right back where it needs to be let's bear with me a moment now you seeing this are you watch this [Music] oh baby look at all that beautiful medicine tell me that isn't just amazing the smell is incredible so pull it off of here again bear with me as i readjust lighting and move things around here me uh get back down to what you need to see now okay so there we go oh yeah pucks came out perfectly no blowouts everything went where it was supposed to go that's what i'm talking about so we have that and in that so i am going to just kind of give you two times look yeah that's a good good shot right there let's see what's going on and there we go got a nice glass jar here i'm gonna tear it on the scale so i know [Music] 26.6 okay so this is my favorite tool this is a skillet skillet tools um you can get them in kits you can get them singly i prefer these i think that they uh they hold up well uh they work well for me and just look at that beautiful stable gorgeous rosin that just gathers up real nice real easy indication of quality right there oh my look at that wedding cake oh yeah get you some of that look at that now if you are a pittsburgh area medical marijuana patient with a card and you bring me dispensary flower the higher the thc the better uh i will for free do this press it into google for you turning green into golden think of a lot worse ways to spend my time to tell you the truth this is therapeutic for me i love extracting it especially like medicated this is a lot of medicine right here picks right up hope i get it all in the jar i can tell you after pressing it yesterday waxes up beautifully overnight just at room temp room temperature cure in the jar waxes up amazingly excellent flavor immediate body effects from this strain for me okay your mileage may vary but quite honestly i am very very pleased with the results i'm getting from wedding cake and as long as it's around i will continue to get it just keeps producing okay look at that look at those highlights as you pull it across it's all gold copper and we got those and dripped off those two little jewels will just sit right there as we figure out what our yield was from this ounce all right quick calculation here okay here's here's the yield 32.81 32. minus the tare value of the container which is 26.6 6. and that gives us a yield of 6.2 grams and let's see i'll have to get back with you on the yield percentage because i shoot this video with my phone and unfortunately my calculator is on there too so we got 6.2 gram yield from 28 grams of wedding cake processed to 200 degrees through a 120 mesh micron screen thank you very much for joining me i want to thank crd for making excellent rosin presses at some of the best prices in the industry everybody's have a great thanksgiving stay safe stay medicated be good to each other look at those meds", "o-9nPcTithM": "okay cool so today in the name of what's in my pre-roll we've got this one gram birthday cake joint from circles so this is part of my e's joint grab they put some money in my account after a while that's what happens with these if you don't order they throw like 20 bucks in there trying to tempt you back so i made the best use of it that i could and just bought a bunch of js so this is one of them and this is the ease house brand as far as i can tell anyway um a little while ago a bunch of this circle stuff just started popping up on ease never seen it anywhere else so i assume it's their one of their house offerings but uh yeah let's go ahead and just jump into this and see what's good so we've got circles there indica and it looks like this down here is gonna be the testing information so let's take a look alright so yeah something i did notice i didn't see it here before but uh circles dash loud pack so this is another loud pack uh effort uh they are it's like they've had their tentacles and everything you can buy different products with different names and then you look closer and you'll see powered by lab pack on there so um let's see so that's just i thought that was the testing info but i guess not so let's take a look around here so there's birthday cake here's some cultivation info 523 so a little older at this point um this is nine dollars out the no not out the door pre-tax so this is nine dollars pre-tax just skating in under uh under that ten dollar mark but not after tax unfortunately and the batch they're easy so kind of makes me feel like that that this is an ease effort a an ease loud pack effort because as you can see they're powered by loud pack birthday cake and so at this point we're looking at about seven months old well a little bit before that six to seven six and a half months more or less so yeah not too great there's the government warning they're always watching so we'll see how this holds up this is on the cheaper side 1g as you can see there um but yeah i'm not exactly sure what to expect oh there's the thc info testing out at 13.345 they went for that extra decimal place instead of just putting 13.35 on there but um yeah that's i mean that's low thc doesn't mean everything but it does mean something a little bit of cbd in there too so so yeah i assume this is probably greenhouse at best maybe outdoor so let's check it out together and see what's good here with the circles so yeah i think this is supposed to be a more affordable j for for the ease customer so i believe they're trying to get into the whole vertical integration thing um you know or get that going so good luck to them if that is the case this that i was just smelling the tube it smells like i don't know it smells like stew kind of like beef stew that's weird i never really smelled the tubes though so i won't comment on that let's do a quick crutch check here and see what's good uh so i can already see before i mess with this that there is some kind of wrinkle here so i'm guessing you guys go you can see it that probably that's the point where the crutch is weak and it looks like yeah pretty much the case so i'm guessing these are all machine packed and it's probably very tight fairly tight up here and looser as you go down so yeah i'm not sure what the tech used is probably just a knock box or something like that but whatever it was they didn't take care to pack the bottom first and then you know drop in the rest because yeah it's hard when you're mass filling j's you got to go with that it's like time is of the essence you know and this is probably fairly cheap material so yeah i mean it's to be expected with something in the said subtitle or price point i'm not trying to hate and here we go clipping our way down to the crutch taking a moment of zen a deep breath exhale and that's the end of the j and there we go so that's the material inside yeah not looking stellar i mean nothing out of the ordinary though for a sub 10 j pre-tax um i mean right off the bat i can say i wouldn't be like stoked and there's it seems kind of sloppy too because you can see there's [ __ ] in the crutch there some i don't know yeah it's again i can't be too critical because it is very cheap or it's attempting to be cheap it's not that cheap considering that you could go to jungle boys you'd have to drive there you couldn't get it delivered and if you have your medical card you get a j that's usually over packed and weigh generally or generously for uh like 16 bucks out the door so for six more dollars you could be getting you know like a g and a half of nice indoor not guaranteed you'd still get a g guaranteed but uh but yeah just from what i've seen so anyway enough about that let's talk about this joint as you can see there's already a passenger hanging out there plain as day don't even have to go dig in trying to get a zoom in there on it there we go so yeah there he is didn't even have to get my pickaxe out didn't have to [ __ ] spend a lot of time we already find a fairly major first offender but again this is probably greenhouse at best so imagine that it's filled with that and that's probably just a bigger piece but you know this stuff looks really ground down not as finely ground is a lot of other stuff so i guess i can't hate but as i run my fingers through you can definitely pick up here's another one right there pick up on a few stems here and there my fingers are fairly keefed up though so maybe the material wasn't too bad um i'm gonna go ahead and set this back down you guys can take a look see if you see anything while i get a sniff on these grinds and then we'll go for the way and see what's up does have like a kind of pleasant freshness of mint i would say there but uh not really picking up on a lot of other smells i didn't do a dry pool my bad i should have but yeah that's pretty much it's like a musty mint but more minty than must maybe a slight hint of sweetness in there but nothing fantastic not super gross uh it doesn't look as bad as i would say the material looks but nothing really potent nothing to write home about basically par for the course when you're looking at a j of this uh price range so anyway let's go ahead and get this scale going kind of clean up this area so we can do that all right turn this bad boy on i got stickers all over the place now there's one stuck to my freaking hand all right let me get that off there all right so here we go moving you guys over to the scale so you can get a better view on that there it is all right can you see it not exactly let me adjust here there we go let's zoom out just a little bit here and there is a good view on it so let's go ahead and get this going zero that out still not zeroed there we go and i'll put my sticker there just for fun and here we go let's see so if this comes up to point nine or more it's accurate on the way material is not super stellar but whatever you know it is what it is when you're playing in that sub 10 range coming out to a g exactly 0.9 rolling back so yeah it's a g i mean there's a little dust left on the paper but i'm gonna give it to him whatever it's uh it is what it is so i mean if you come across this and you like it you know for the price point then fine go for it i've probably saved my pennies i may go to jungle boys like i was saying earlier or just find another j that's of a little higher quality for sure indoor i mean even at catalyst like fresh baked js or 18 bucks so it's like you're not really saving a whole lot when you consider tax what you are saving is a trip to the store though so maybe that's worth the convenience but that's what's inside circles you get a technical pass but i would say i'd give this if i had to letter grade it which i've been doing weirdly on the japanese grading scale this gets like a b maybe um definitely nowhere near s rank but it passes so there you go", "0peKkiKvhH4": "[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's the big trip guys this is

Lego shovel I guess and this is a wow this is much more heavy-duty where's their caption really cozy vibes here's a better look at it there you go this is 13 yeah $13.99 what the [ __ ] am I saying guys I have used the craziest [ __ ] to grab Keef before so it's just nice that I'm finally gonna have something real so what do you give you guys a better demonstration of the Keifer scraper because I understand I use a tiny bowl primarily so I wanted to go to another one we've got all that Keef we've saved up actually almost sent some flying but the main point of the keeper scraper that I wanted to show is instead of having two mission impossible myself some Keef via a piece of paper I'm able to grab this big ol thing I'm gonna go over it and the rounded edge allows me to just knock this entire oh my god yeah I'm glad I did it over the grinder oh my God look at that so ladies and gents oh man I'm not about to film this for no reason oh man this is gonna wind up put another night Naomi I show you what we're working with here look at that man hmm oh let's hit this but I mean just place that in that tank Wow ain't that something first for you a first for me we're in this together

hell is happening if this goes again I can't even talk I don't think I've ever been this hot I wanted to also point out the did you get it must smell good whatever it is alright as we were um gang look at that delicious mag landrace that without getting your boys fingers all meddled up I can put this and how dumb is that sound I can put this in here gang pretty much what I'm getting at is it's gonna be nice to not have to get my fingers key fee when I can literally just put that in there see how we're doing you can tell man this keeper scraper I've been using it look at that that's all crusted in there look at that ah that's fantastic sorry I got the shakes but honestly all this is a fantastic tool these these edges on it are what makes this different from anything else I've used I'm not gonna sit here and like with a paperclip just load this bowl you know one by one with some sand like a construction project I'm not exactly sure where I should hold this boom let's do this [Music] [Music] [Music] okay I'm so [ __ ] hot I'm so high I can't even [ __ ] see right now oh my god yo let's just say that attempt at that very large Keef he hit it didn't go well I have not been beaten I have not been overcome my hit like that in quite some time I was damn near nauseous so I had somebody comment or DME saying I should take you know some apocalyptic hits again here you go the key for scraper did its job like I haven't been able to have an experience like that and quite some time so I'm kind of I'm gonna go ahead and give it a two thumbs up recommendation if you want to get

talk about that today but if you guys want to check out some of our other weed reviews we do have a playlist with all of our reviews and you can find that in the description and on the screen right now Dave I got to ask you though wedding cake so wedding cake is also known as pink cookies and it is a cross between cherry pie and Girl Scout cookie and it's known for having a sweet aroma and having a very nice flavor profile with some peppery and piney notes in there as well it's also remarkably high in THC testing in the high 20s very consistently alright and right away wedding cake is exactly what I look for in weeds it's very dense so when you grind it up you're gonna be surprised on the yield the smell is also very sweet-smelling but not none of the berry notes that you would find in other sweet strains wedding cake for me is just something that I love smoking and for Dave and I we actually chose a steamroller so steam roller kind of a cross between a bong in a bowl and definitely gives you that giant hit and very flavorful as well to go along with the amazing flavor and aroma of this weed it is remarkably medicinal it's fantastic if you have stress and depression and if you need a little bit of mood enhancement in your day this is gonna be the strain for you all right Dave so a strain that is both dense flavorful the aroma is there I'm assuming this is gonna be on the higher end of the spectrum but Dave I gotta ask you today Bama rating for wedding cake we really hit all the high points on this weed I really enjoy the fact that it doesn't give you too much cottonmouth and it really doesn't make your eyes too dry and all of that in company together with the flavor and the density I really have to give this a 4.5 out of 5 which makes it tied for first place on our channel alright guys so there you go if you're looking for a flavorful hybrid I think wedding cake is a pretty good choice from us guys if you want to check out some of our other reviews we do have a we'd review playlist on the description let us know how we're doing here on Bammer TV and for everything else weed and weed related keep it here on Bammer TV [Music]", "Eu2t0GjulCA": "up next we got acreage farms all cush this is one gram and it's fourteen point two seven percent THC or one hundred forty two point seven milligrams I've never tried acreage farms before so I'm excited to try that hey this was packaged August 30th so that's that's a while back cuz today is February anyways that's oh wait first I got a check and make sure to scale so I'll calibrate here so I'm gonna check make sure you got one hundred point 0 gram weight gonna check that looks good alright I'm gonna put this on here and zero day with the tear okay here we go [Music] acreage farms all crush recently I tried the seven acres and that was pretty cool I was get that confused with this one seven acres and acreage firms I don't why but I find them confused the two of them khadeem it these little one grand pegs are the worst okay well see inside there it looks okay you give it a little smell here it is a very very very mild very faint mild scent smell of I have no idea what it is mint maybe almost heroes dump this shit in here and see come on dig in G make a G yeah look at that fuck that's awesome actually got the correct weight look at this thing this pancake ass but look at this seeing a fucking flattened it's hilarious so - a little bit of a little bit of stuff right there this is what they gave me for the buds and we're gonna take a look at these up close with the microscope now see what it looks like so this is the outside of that flattened bud and it's got quite a lot of trichomes on it there's a this quite a lot it looks a lot like well they've obviously been smushed they squish down there but they're there you can see I have to do a real close-up zoom on that to get a good idea we're just taking a quick peek here though a little quick peek everything's looking decent here so far see a wood sign once again a different bud the other side's usually that the part that gets beat up the most right so just taking a look here look at this little blob right on the tip right there it's hilarious looking anyways that looks cool let's go for a super close-up so I'm gonna super close up this section to see if I'm gay woohoo hey we're all little trico gates they're missing the some there but some of their missing they got busted off there's one holding on for dear life sliding down this pole like a firefighter yeah yeah they're in there though you can see not so bad this is the outside still actually we're peering inside there maybe I should back off a bit on that I want to get to close up in there this is the tiniest bud they gave me I just thought I would stick it because I can hold this thing vertically and zoom right in on this shit good look kind of anyways I'm gonna break open one of these maybe we'll do we'll save this one I'll break open this guy here this one here I'm gonna take a look inside and we'll see what's happening inside here's a look inside look at this stuff it looks kind of old it has that really old look it's all kind of golden right but the it does have a bit of an old look to it and it was packaged you know August so who knows how long it was before was packaged great because I mean you don't package it right away you've got a drying and cure it etc looks all right though look all that stuff there's a lot of stuff there there it is even closer we look so much better like this yeah that looks okay yeah I guess so I don't know I'm gonna go try it out look at this section it's glimmering it's glimmering and shimmering okay it's I'm gonna try this I'll be back all right so I just got back in from trying this all cush way Anchorage firms and it's pretty unimpressive very disappointing the taste is if there's almost no taste to it but you get like a slight little taste of dirt for a second kind of like that tweed garbage it's horrible as for the smell there's almost no smell to it very a light almost like basic like a little bit of a mint maybe but yeah it's not very good the high from this is very disappointing too it's like a very low sort of was like a low tier bargain bin stuff right here and it's so dry too it actually turns into like a dust see yeah so I don't know this is very disappointing I think this goes for like I got this one gram here for 10 dollars and 15 cents and very disappointing I don't think I will buy that again I haven't given up on acreage farms yet I'll give them another chance you know maybe this stuff might have been better when it was fresh but it's fucking old and I don't know look at it it's like flat and even like what all the really doing with this well that's some acreage Farms very disappointing it's a bargain bin overpriced trash on the OCS as far as this all cush stuff goes here very unimpressive and I would definitely not buy it but anyways make sure you subscribe if you want to get notifications of new videos and all that I get more stuff here I'm gonna go get some more stuff soon so we'll see you later have a good one", "2nHNLRhBKc0": "[Music] what's going on dickweeds I got back an abysmal order today hey I haven't smoked any weeds yet so I got to get into this [ __ ] thing because I need some [ __ ]

trick mm-hmm happy birthday to me there you go happy birthday to you anyway well you're puffing on that I'm gonna show them it's hey it's it's smooth either that or something that happens when you turn 41 he don't cough or maybe you just haven't had good weed in a few days and that could be that could be what it is anyway she's getting taller hey she's almost as tall as Donna pretty soon Donna's gonna be getting jealous because she's gonna get taller than Donna anyway yesterday we tried to put that inside of the glass skull over there right there and I didn't charge it enough so early this morning I put my plant my which imma call it here my pot plant over there like I do every morning and I bring it along here with the Sun and well it's been out here for I don't know it's been out here for a boat maybe six hours now five or six hours I guess something like that and there's still lots of hours left of the day so yeah it should work tonight we'll give it a try tonight and if it doesn't work I don't know I don't [ __ ] know hey I don't know anyway back to Donna and her joint her birthday joint first joint of the day oh let me Street man there we go anything to say on your birthday how do you feel old you're wise oh [ __ ] sakes why is old Donna she's like an owl I will say you're wise old owl okay make it sound like I'm 80 [ __ ] hmm I will say do you find in your forties that you like you just you're just done with stupid people I was done with stupid people on the first day I was born that's what forties is so far for me you're done with stupid people yeah well it's time for us to pack her up and move the [ __ ] over Timmons n you gotta let them know what you're thinking yeah you got to tell them how stupid they really sound or look or R or whatever it is you just want to tell somebody about all about their stupidness gets in front of you because that happens to me lots you need to tell them you get that was here get the [ __ ] out of my way that's what 41 feels like what might be short but I'll kick the buckle you hang no because you're kind of worried about your bones at this age - like there's a video for you short and worried about your bones Oh old short and worried about your bones like you feel like you still love it yeah but I mean it's probably like a one-time deal and you're saving that for the one time you need it your one last time yep but that's what Balboa said in like part two or three anyway there I think mine's never like that these guys are pros Donna they should they should fly us there maybe the guys I can't abismo should make how to roll [ __ ] joint yeah video and I send it to you I know I just want to know this part the filter part there's some tough cardboard maybe it already maybe is this like a thing itself this thing I was like do they roll that I would imagine that they roll it but I mean I wasn't there so I don't know you might be able to I do not know there's something for you to Google later type it into YouTube maybe somebody will show you how to make one if anybody knows where she can learn that leave a comment Hey real easy steps I don't want you know 15 minutes I put the cardboard right five you know five minutes you can't be all like cheesy there when you know somebody's trying to teach you something they take it may take a little longer than five five minutes don't think so it may take 20 minutes well then I'm not gonna use that way then and then you're gonna not have good joints for the rest of your [ __ ] life I will make something huh so you almost done that thing yeah I would I will end up gluing a piece of cardboard inside the paper and then as I rule [ __ ] inhale glue everybody say y'all it dawns on blue [Music] she's not allowed to [ __ ] weed it's because she's on blue you still [ __ ] sucking in the fumes heating up the fumes and inhaling them I get that would blue isn't it would blue oh thanks so I think it's like an all-purpose you know that oh maybe you know the glue that some of the kids used to [ __ ] eat when it was all hard at the top of the little slit that's probably something that happened back in Killarney where you're from I don't remember anybody in blue but you know where you're from you guys look like a bunch of glue eaters I remember round tables but yeah I don't remember eating glue or having people eat glue but there might have been glue eaters picking off and they chew on it yeah it's pretty [ __ ] I never did that I don't know why somebody would do that maybe they couldn't afford the Bubblegum's glue glue breath some kids they did it they didn't die I don't think anybody wants to hear your damn glue eating story anything else to talk about it's your birthday and the biggest thing you got to talk about is [ __ ] people you remember eating glue talking about the joint I know but your faith you know mm-hmm you might have a birthday memory or something instead you have you know memories of your friends eating glue mm-hmm No you almost done that joint just about like two puffs yeah and then you can lead the way and we'll show everybody the stakes you're gonna have for supper they're marinating oh well then maybe we'll await this okay well Donna wants to show them anyways where are we going right now oh we're going to Donna's giant ashtray and the giant ashtray how many you got in there can't

okay let's go to the steaks lead the way here is Charlie hey so Donna's feel lazy that's perfect birthday [ __ ] weeds so you gotta wash your hand she's gotta wash her hands so it smells like weed well I don't think anything the [ __ ] show right now I got some [ __ ] brownies here that Donna brought if anybody cares mm-hmm she brought some brownies Lakes went on it looks like that right now it'll look better once it's cooked steak and that's what you wanted for your birthday yeah steak and salad steak and salad or something I mean well uh I don't know we'll be back I guess later on when we got the barbecue lit up and we'll whip those bad boys on hey good Donna wave the barbecues all lit Donna threw some potatoes on because well they need a head start a you know how it is anyway there goes the steak there's one stake to stake and yeah close her up Donna [Music] [Music] ah I almost had him I should have leaped on his back hey I said jumped on him like it was a horse hmm okay are they done come on come on let's go coming uh whatever welcome welcome anyway oh there he is he was just being testy hey or something Charlie gets like that sometimes it might be a little bit dim in here but Donna has everything closed up because of the heat and I don't even find it that hard anymore but it's her birthday well let her have control of the window today hey anyways I got some steak sauce to go with my steak Donna's just getting stuff ready over there I guess what she's doing that I should do my supper Tok hey it's nice to have good weeds for my supper table today hey rock star gilli it really gives me the munchies that was dawn and putting my plate here if you guys were wondering maybe a scene I don't know anyway I was gonna [ __ ] make the steak myself for Donna for her birthday but Donna's one of those people when there's cooking involved she has to take over she just won't [ __ ] leave it be so don't say to me why didn't you make Donna's supper I tried it doesn't work around here hmm anyway here's what we got steak baked potato some cheese some cucumber and some tomato Donna I hope that cucumber was only used for eating now anyway yeah that's where anything and I'm gonna wash it down with a cold can of coca-cola I would face the camera at daughter but she doesn't like to be on screen when she's eating she's one of them me I don't give a [ __ ] hey I don't go you gotta have some steak sauce with your steak you just God you want any Donna Donna doesn't like steak sauce hey let's cut some steak hey Charlie he's like right up against my leg Johnny he wants some steak he's almost humping my leg Charlie's trying to hump my leg Hey on my flock that's a tasty [ __ ] steak I like the steak Donna really outdid herself on her birthday hey Donna really showed herself that she loves herself mm-hmm by making a good steak you made yourself a big steak I was supposed to make it for you you might as well be buying your own gifts yeah anyway where was I you gotta have lots of butter on your potatoes a on your baked potato [Music] and move the to pot plants underneath that lip right there because it's supposed to pour and we don't want to have our plants destroyed Hey and the little solar light that was in there that we were gonna put in the skull I took it out and brought it in the house with the skull because it's gonna pour and we'll try it in the house hey let's see how it works we'll try it out right now there's Donna doing bong toks getting all [ __ ] up on the rock star hey hey so I got the skull on and I'm gonna turn the weight off and that's what it looks like not too bad we're trying to find some more old solar lights and stick them in there too but for now it's not too bad that idea came from Corey 87 91 and yeah that's how it looks in the dark we look at it another time outside but it's supposed to pour and I'm not gonna show you guys out in the [ __ ] rain because that's [ __ ] eh anyway hopefully I'm in the middle

the end of the night we're gonna watch some YouTube videos and still be smoking weed Hey so till tomorrow like subscribe and [ __ ] off hey", "thAOblDIouk": "i actually did it's first time quite a while that i did the entire thing and correctly but i did it so today we are doing a 300 wheat haul video i actually think it's 400 read hopefully a video i'm not i can't remember um i have the receipts here i will get them out but i went to two different dispensaries yesterday purely because nature's medicine didn't have any concentrate they are completely out of their own concentrate i guess there was an incident at the lab and that is about as far as we're gonna go into that one so there's an issue with the lab they have no concentrate and we don't know when it will be there so um we went to um on a ponderosa relief um in glendale arizona so so let's see what we got um with the nature's best first thinking uh we've always gotten really good stuff there they always had great deals on chatter and um with me going into surgery in the next couple of weeks we were trying to you know save a little money but that didn't work out so well but they had other things so um let's start out with the wonderful little jab mats that we got from them which are amazing um these were freebies he doesn't say said smoking accessory it doesn't say how much but we have two dab mats um this one seems to be more of that fabric type of a dab matte is kind of a it's definitely a silicone but it's more like a silicone stretchable rubber type of feeling to it it's actually kind of cool and really pretty outside of the shatter it's really pretty so and then we got another nature's best because you know you just can never have too many batman so look at that so we have fresh new dab mats beautiful i love it when we get those so and then we got a quarter ounce oh no a half ounce of pre-packed cannabis in one of their larger pre-packed cannabis containers um here's one of the older containers one of the short ones so you can kind of see the difference so it's pretty cool the buds are just absolutely beautiful did you guys have a good look see there this is some ground up that we had from earlier this month yummy yummy so that was this these prices on a half ounce with this container i believe big prices around here 89.95 so a half ounce of their pre-packed in the jar is 90 bucks so that's not bad and this is x trophy white to exit trophy wife so it is an indica hybrid um we got this at the northwest grand avenue location yesterday so i'll kind of give you a seat of this receipt just you can see i'll let you guys pause it and see what you want to see from there [Music] um and then we have and i did not quote the comments yet so let's now for the the ponderosa relief bag ea i love it so we have a lot of different concentrates obviously if you guys know ponderosa which we all do you guys know that they are the home of the animal it um concentrates and you know we love camo and that isn't good so we have some good amount of of shatter and stuff here but we're just going to go ahead and open one up on random we're going to grab this one for a little bit we're going to go ahead and heat this bad boy up have a nice good looksie and then we will go through the concentration my favorite part that's okay so as always guys you know what to do hit those thumbs up button hit the subscribe button to join the channel here on youtube i am trying to be here monday through friday um especially over the next couple of weeks from now until my surgeries so that we kind of get more of a vlogging going on with what's going on with the surgery if we get pushed again but the ors have been closed down to where they are not taking as many people as what they normally would take so it pushed a bunch of us off all of our surgery a lot of our surgeries have been postponed yet again um for chronovirus which kind of sucks but especially for some of us that if we have not gotten coronavirus we have been you know saved enough to where we haven't gotten it and we run we run the risk of getting it we run a higher risk of getting it you know um we don't get through surgery and get it taken care of especially now because i'm a nemesis and all these other things so we have to get on the ball and get those done with so this is kush mint from camo this is what she looks like beautiful box i absolutely love their branding their branding is absolutely gorgeous to me definitely took a good amount of time and perfected it so as always guys [ __ ] cancer [ __ ] anxiety [ __ ] depression in with the good and the bad that's got some really good flavor to it i can't wait to get back outside and get the reviews done um because it won't be as smoky and it'll you'll be able to see a little bit better but we're getting there so these each one of these are one gram and then the prices are different throughout so i'll go over the prices with you as we go through so this is tropical heat and because it's in these containers and you can't really see it i'm going to open them up so this one had been leaning over so you can see um and that is the full ground because we haven't smoked any of these yet this today was the first time on it and then we have just gonna stand here make easy we have topanga og we have sophie's punch as you guys can see flip them around you guys can see oh another sophie's punch [Music] purple punch joel's lemonade joel's lemonade high school sweethearts platinum dosi and another platinum dosi so we were able to pick up i believe isn't 11 grams 11 over 11 grams of wax however there is one more thing of wax that i am not sure exactly where it went these are all of the reviews i still have left to do so uh there was one last thing on the review and that was some cbd distillate which was beautiful white cbd i had it because i wrote it up last night and i looked at it took pictures of it and now i can't remember where i put it in the bag oh well that is how it goes every now and again as soon as i get that i will show you guys it is actually really really pretty white stable uh cbd crystals um you can actually take those cbd crystals sprinkle them in some water um and get their dosing of that way because it is also live resin here is the receipt it's so weird i don't mind it um so the way that this kind of broke down was all of the sugar are all not sure why all of the shatter was 23.13 um this was 32.38 this was 27.75 and the cbd white crystal distillate was um twelve dollars um i wrote that on here today because i didn't actually have that previously so that is how it is what we got however i have lost white display as soon as i find it i will get back to you guys and show it to you i am going to do a full review of it i think it is really cool um hopefully i'll find it here soon so let's go ahead and spark up some jewels of lemonade and then we are out of here for the day i hope you guys are having a beautiful wednesday look at that look how pretty so let's heat this up and let's go so i have decided that we're going to add in um really cringy hospital stories or doctor's office stories that i've been through in my lifetime so for this days i decided to go way way back way before i ever had kids way before i was actually well no i guess it was just mary um and i ended up in the hospital with a miscarriage and cancer and had to go see the cancer doctor for the first time it was really it was a very scary very weird appointment um but my mom was there um my husband was there i think it was just the three of us but then we had the doctor and then the nurses that were in the room with us during the examination and talking to the doctor well one of the nurses during the entire time i actually had to stop everything and and to ask this poor lady what she was doing um and it was basically she was cleaning out i guess i had some lint in my belly button my blader as i call it um and she was trying to get it out and i'm sitting here going um it was very uncomfortable it's very cringy it was really weird and it was like um really she's like oh my god i'm so sorry i guess the poor nurse was just waiting for the doctor to get done what she was supposed to be doing so the nurse could do the rest of what she had to do and she had spaced off and she'd spaced off while she was getting the lint out of my belly button and it was just so strange and weird and i mean the whole thing ended up breaking up the the doctor's appointment by like 10 minutes because we were all stopping and laughing and it was just it was so cringy and was so weird um but that was the first one and i i had to have been 20 maybe i wouldn't think i was old enough to drink yet um but yeah it was it was it was quite a comical thing and the doctor was even like really and it was just it was it was quite it was very funny it was really cringy um but i mean this poor nurse she was just i mean she was off in in her mind going through what she needed to do i guess and that's what ended up happening so guys if you're out there and you're with a patient make sure you focus on what you're doing because it becomes very uncomfortable when you're digging in somebody's blinker so as always guys [ __ ] cancer [ __ ] anxiety [ __ ] depression in with the good and out with the bad oh it tastes so good there's so much flavor in that it is so yummy it's all good oh yeah it has been one of those mornings obviously it's going to be that way for a little while oh goodness me so there you have it um panderosa relief nature's medicine great job love it oh i can't wait to start breaking into this half ounce oh it is so so yummy i hope you guys have a beautiful day i will see you guys

know you called it [Music] right yep we're trying to have a different story for each block the first story was actually the first time I ever told my parents Dan catch me anything but this is like my was like 19 and I was working at a Men's Warehouse and my sleep schedule listed the year I took off school oh I'm gonna try something else this video where was my friend of mine told me that uh I'm gonna try something else video I'm not gonna like cut or headed that much I was gonna be a whole small session it's basically just what I do that was never recorded looks except all the talking I don't they talked to myself I mean there's no high [Music] I always have work from like 8:00 like one a my sleep schedule was [ __ ] like I just could never fall asleep so I would stay up to like 670 mornings I could never fall asleep like staring at my phone stare at the wall and I was always dead [ __ ] tired and I had a friend of mine he had this guy's one of the reasons why I started sleeping - he worked at a job with me and he always had buzz stuff I think you saw I'm not really sure but had some bud and I bought an eighth oven and a minute of being friends it's me enough like he rolled everything flaming so I could I roll back then bro I was mad people in that part so yeah I had like the eighth and I had seven pre-roll like point five gigs one for every day of the week so I was gonna smoke one at night before I went to sleep I bought it off him and then like on the way home I had it in the men's wearhouse bag like I was in bed his hat man and I was like thinking about how I'm gonna tell him like I have to tell him like the ads like is based like a sales pitch like I need this to fall asleep so I couldn't perform better at work or some [ __ ] like it's like never fall asleep it I was always tired [Music] so get in the house waste no time go straight to the room and I'm like yep yeah and they like tell you guys on the road I'm like struggling over here I'm like dying every morning at work I need like like and when I when I would smoke like I had AG like I would fall asleep pretty easily but I wouldn't like smoke all the time because I didn't want me to smell anything or nobody one of the room and I was like yo this is my problem I can't ever fall asleep I'm always tired when I go in the work like I'm gonna try something and they're like what I'm gonna try marijuana and there's like what is it I was hoping they know what that means so they could be like yeah and they were like what I was like weak like oh you're trying huh my dad was like so pissed I hit he was like he let me do it he was like oh you're just gonna smoke weed huh okay let's see how that goes he was so busy let me do it they didn't make sense just like you're like trying to rub it in my face but I took it anyway now at first I'm not gonna lie can't really work that well because like I would smoke at night but instead of just going straight to sleep I would just watch TV and [ __ ] and I watch movie so at first didn't work out but eventually I got was smoke and then my sleep schedule started getting back to normal because eventually I would come back home from work tired of [ __ ] and then I would smoke and then I'll just like pass the [ __ ] out it was good like that for a walk but until I went back to school I didn't have but all the time in school I didn't have money so I didn't have a job that's the first time I told them and they wanted to happy they got pissed all the time when I came back in the cribs I smell like [ __ ] but yeah it worked out [Music] eventually I got tired of [ __ ] like smoke it outside it was like like I could just coking hair blow out the window so for a little while all I had was a [ __ ] one in it now did blow that [ __ ] out the window they still smelled it though but I just didn't feel like the one outside eventually I would have to go outside walk around the block and do that just let one get pissed at me but yeah that's the first time ever told my parents that I smell shits hidden you gladder guys at Eva last night honestly before I did I had a jet fuel one and that [ __ ] put me on my [ __ ] ass bro like I had a jacket on inside the window open first five hits I was plugging my whole body was moving [ __ ] like I was overheating [Music] I already know the story I'm gonna tell another video meet him the other for the other J Brooke so I might have a little bit left so I'm gonna just tell a little backstory now I've heard like I'm not from America I wasn't from like Oh Peggy I was born there and when I came here like I wasn't like the biggest kid but I got gradually bigger as I got more and I played soccer I got moved when I was like 5 I was like a pretty small kid but as I grew older I got bigger and bigger and I like playing soccer but I got bingo where I couldn't play soccer but I could play like a line and all like the football coaches and stuff like soon as they saw me like I wasn't like this is one of the biggest regrets I had I want to say I should never play football so I wasn't really a football player I wasn't that great at football honestly like people they had me at line that was pretty like scared of concept not gonna lie but and I just do what I had to do I play left tackle have I started my senior year of high school only I ever started I played left tackle ok yeah that was a fun year this year but I will tell you I'm gonna take it back all the way for the first time we going the first time I ever played football with 7th grade first year in middle school never play football ever like never even put any equipment Brooke there was some big-ass [ __ ] duty at middle school probably like one dude named Justin I he was big as [ __ ] like there was this one girl that we had it was called bullying the ring everybody would circle around us like the whole team will circle around us we had all like passing [ __ ] on and one guy was stay in the middle and he would just like shuffle his feet and like the the coach would walk around no no no I've got this part I think the coach would like say a number and whoever's number that was would run full-speed into the guy in the middle and the guy in the middle half like be quick on his feet and see who it is and just try to take that hit bro we were in that drill and it was a dude named Donovan right before me he was like a friend of mine same grade and Hills his turn and my in a coach like he was doing he was getting hit and [ __ ] like he was like he was doing good and my coach called Justin the huge guy bro the first time I think he like ducked out of the way and then the second time he like cuz he made him do it again Brooke he hit him my boy flew back like 5 feet and I saw that oh it was my turn to go in there bro I'm not even gonna lie I saw his big ass coming towards me good the first couple hits like kind of [ __ ] me up but I was like big though so like I still got [ __ ] up but it look like it cuz I was just like hey like I just had a big-ass bucket gonna have a bigger body than Justin though so when he came through I thought about hitting him last second pulled out the way I mean the first time I even saw what like a cup was I was like I'm not putting that on me bro the thought that bra I played [ __ ] this is like seventh grade so I had like how just basically put me on both sides of the line bro I played like D like defensive tackle and a [ __ ] the guard cut me and his shoulder pad went right into my nuts oh my god I was on the floor for a little bit I didn't want anybody to know what happened so I could like get up like kind of fast but yeah I wasn't so much pain bro after that game before you play that game I got [ __ ] up that game always work up after that [Music] it's about it on this one [Music] lay down that year at 7th grade that was a play in a game if we would have won that game apparently we wonder whether the playoff well I'm a Sparta's guy up first this is already all past wanted to see what a good fight but okay so seventh grade I did not start the whole year didn't start the whole year then I forgot like they would just put me in on some plays like on defend stuff and this wasn't the one game they like it was towards the end of the game and I think we were down by a touchdown my name is replay was Frances British it was so funny I was so mad when this happened this is like embarrassing but you know you got this thing started I never tried one of these before my friends have they said it's pretty good [Music] - it was like those things are like 60 bucks this is like 40 or 50 I think I'm not sure yet either forgot that that's a back one but that's why it was like pretty harsh as soon as I hit this one he was like so much cleaner I still loved back was the ocean [Music] so it was our last play of the game and it was a kickoff return and no football like there's five people that I think four than the rest I was the guy in the front row all the way on the right so I was like close to their sideline the other team my first time ever playing specialty it was so embarrassing but it's funny as [ __ ] I was like I don't even care at this point they kick the ball off and I freeze like everybody like I'm supposed to like run back until they catch the ball and then run back and block somebody I freeze I'm just like looking back and forth and the guy that's like running towards me like to tackle my play like they got the other side runs into me like trucks take stuff [ __ ] like I still remember that hit big suck my [ __ ] up I got up and apparently I don't remember this but I remember like the guy who is running the guy who was running it back apparently he had a big-ass hole to run her and when I got up and being knocked down I blocked that hole and he ran into me and he fell Brooke it looked like I tackled him apparently that she was so [ __ ] funny bra and she was so funny everybody was pissed off but they were laugh-in finals they were pissed like the guy ran back was pissed as [ __ ] but like once we got back in school and like you let it go he was just like you really tackled me like bro I swear I didn't act will you brag I [ __ ] up and I got up and you ran into me and he felt and I think I felt too but I was like the most embarrassing thing that ever had to me a football that she was so funny she was so funny and then in high school I didn't play like my ninth grade year I'm pretty glad when I hear actually because I remember the team that my school had that year like that team was like hilarious like I knew most of the guys but that team was really bad he's never had any chemistry there was a whole bunch of like really good players that they just definitely like I don't know why they were popular in the next year the coach I had for JV this guy should have been a folk varsity coach this guy look like a like a personal trainer he was like a science teacher we go he was serious [ __ ] football I was like bees here to [ __ ] up because I knew I'd better get [ __ ] he wants every time we do film study I knew I [ __ ] up like at least once or twice in every game and I was like dreading the moment that we got some my part I [Music] already do that that crazy in JV and varsity I didn't start 11th grade I wasn't really that good the players we had 11 my living for a year like on both sides of the ball were actually really good we had some really good [ __ ] tackles and defensively like defensive as a defensive tackles my senior year though is when I started playing like the line I always wanted to play defense but that's why I wanted to I wanted to hit people but I didn't like like playing some like line cuz I was gonna get hit every single play but I didn't mind hitting other people every single play that wasn't the best Guardian I let a few sacks through one game see you here actually we were playing this team of the Falcons the linemen that was lined up against me it was weird so when I was younger I had a friend from like elementary school and he we were always ghost like the cooler game in the summer and yet another friend that he would bring with him he played football - that guy was the guy that I was playing against I didn't realize until after the game I heard him like say something I was like y'all Payton I think you look back I was like yo that's actually him but it had been awhile ago I don't think you remember who I was he got me a lot negative what wasn't the worst tackle like my pretty much my plan was to like instead of like just going head-on I would just let them try to come outside and just push them up field most the time to work because the QB are running back with just like go up the middle and get it off pretty fast it's like 3 o'clock I think like 3 o'clock oh no I'm gonna do the rest of the day right from at the head of this well minimally edit upload this [ __ ] I don't know you guys like in this video

california and also if you like like this one yo thanks for following us and stay lit [Music]", "7OkhVpx9S-A": "[Music] well guys welcome to the CCC I'm Shane I'm Danny and we're back for another concentrate review this time I know a lot of you guys have been requesting that we take some more dabs on the show how we've been sticking to the weed reviews heavily but we definitely like to get our dab on every now and then we'd have all day whatever on the clock if you remember f9k dabs all day in the bay and he doesn't smoke a too often anyway we are yeah a nice batch of some rosin here this is a collaboration between alien labs and field I don't know if we reviewed field before on the show but I know we've smoked them a couple of times more recently I don't know if I've tried the rosin yet but I've tried some of their sauce and was pretty impressed I think this is the first rosin collab that alien labs has done with any other flower like on the legal market yeah so I don't know I don't think I've actually dabbed in the alien labs yet but I have dab field and they're bomb both companies are reputable and wow this stuff is um dank this stuff looks good smell is amazing so this the strain on this one is baklava now I've seen some different things online I'm pretty sure that sure this baklava is kosher and gelato 41 um there I think the plug seeds sells seeds of baklava online that's like wedding cake in gelato so people's gonna wanna you're gonna see different things whether it's wedding cake gelato or kosher gelato but to me I'm definitely getting more of like a kosher thing I feel like you know I mean this girl uh keeping that dab on there for the next two minutes until your nails cool down this stuff is super loud haven't tasted it yet waiting for my nail to cool down here but the appearance and the smell so far are tens I ain't gonna lie this I mean like you said we're coming around on rosin a little bit lately and this far yeah I know we might have given a I've been hating on it but maybe not necessarily given rosin it to do when we've talked about it in past videos just cuz we've never been the biggest rosin guys when I'm gonna dab I've always been a little bit more into the hydrocarbons for whatever reason yeah I think it's just like it's one of those things where like rosin has to be like like I love the upper like 1% of the upper 1% of rosin you know I'm saying like the best of the best rosin is about as good as anything excited for this well a lot of it overall especially a lot of the hash rosin a lot of this bubble rosin unless it is like I said the best of the best of the best it ends up kind of just tasting like generics bubble hash I feel like a lot of times I know you know there's obviously the rosin boys out there that are gonna give me some pay for this one but I feel like a lot of times we're gonna get more distinct terpene profiles with like I said hyper thought of an extract rather than Rosalyn but like you made the point earlier we've been coming across some rosin lately that have you know you had it on a pretty big one there pretty big well obviously it didn't kill me like I was expecting damn pretty expansive expansive the flavor it's definitely fishy you're right it's definitely leaning more towards the kosher we still have to be I guess watch the last five cast I went to hit it on the podcast but dab is some fire come my present really really wanted to try off of the pink of with my last stab of it on there and [ __ ] atomizers out so well kind of sucks I'm only got one week for this video makes things a little bit difficult but hopefully all the next concentrate review will have to keep looking as well well it's kind of nice to do like the dab when you compare that to what it's like a very nice nothing like a good old dad with a smoke smell no damn good old dad gets it sweatin I'll tell you what rest up spoken man it got me really high it only said it's like 70 something like that potency wise it's on there you gotta breathe you know yeah we're seventy four point five eight percent THC right yeah but holy [ __ ] it packs a punch Dione care what that says cuz I am high he got me like the full like you know I'm not sweating but it gave it away gave me a little preparation is that perspiration yeah really I feel like this yeah I did a couple of days of this yesterday but not a true first impression review for me but I noticed the same thing you're talking about it settles in quick yeah like you feel it immediately but for me especially dabs I feeling way more in the head as far as like the body effects go and then it settles down slowly but this [ __ ] I feel like it kind of just moved its way through your body quick oh nice body high on the [ __ ] for sure all right now I'm loaded yeah the effect is definitely the best 10 this is a 10 dude what about the flavor which if you had to guess we talked about oh you think it's the kosher you think it's the wedding cake based off the flavor what would you get it was pretty cushy I don't know I'm gonna think I'm gonna go with the kosher in the gelato 41 but my guess is just good as anybody else's there's probably somebody out there that's like no it's [ __ ] wedding cake dumbass but I don't know the flavor is amazing I honestly give it tens across the board I'm super high I'm super Spacey right now oh my god eyes are low I'm trying to hold back his cough I'm [ __ ] up ten and and overall and this is some of the back this is like the best should I've dad since that GMO for that I got it [ __ ] all flour and it was poppin bumper select something like that what do you think yeah I got the instance wet gift and I don't know if it's from these lights and my mates that [ __ ] was about gonna just exhale that dab man yeah flavor is very true to the smell I definitely get I'm getting a little bit I definitely for me this is more of a kosher thing I don't know maybe sometimes I get something gassing this from the wedding cake - yeah but I'm getting super gas and I'm it's on this when I smell it like if you just smell the jar it's definitely a heavy on the gas but the flavor I'm definitely kind of getting more of that gelato thing and I know we're beating a dead horse here with you know gelato and how it's kind of played out right now and it's like when you hate all the people like oh you don't like gelato a lot of farts oh yeah good gelato is fire good week but they're not every single new strain that needs to at the market for the next three or four years needs to be gonna blow across I think we need to you know now that we've got legal weed and we've got different states and your charter breeders and we've got you know now that this [ __ ] is opening up let's uh let's try to get some more variety in the mark Dave you don't need to have these five ten-year runs like we have in the past purpura and cooker runs not that we did above them yeah blue dream [ __ ] let's bring them all the time just not bring but let's not do the gelato thing for 12 years you know what I'm saying I'm ready let's move on the next thing we're talking to all you hi boys and all the people out there that push yeah that that area of this industry though in my boss dreams the exotics as we like to call them and usually usually we move on by crossing the staple with new so start crossing and I know gelato is getting poured out make me miss it what's fine site and new let's get some new heat out here and then bring back a couple new gelato crosses in five or 10 years and they'll be nostalgic will long for them but I'm really not longing for any gelato at this point that being said it does taste this is a [ __ ] fire dude I like gelato I smoked it a lot it's in my jar over there right now it's in this jar right here at least it's crossed in this jar and that little gelato ramp doesn't necessarily apply so much to this other than it's technically part of the genetics or whatever but this is definitely some some more interesting smoke for me and I'm saying this is Turkey this is flavorful I definitely like this it's so blonde it's so pretty the consistency is perfect to me and 10 like why you didn't break it down right it's ten Cayenne flavor buzz 10 super hard put this up in a tree hm shoutout to atrium yeah saving your boy some of the fire every time I go down there I always know they're gonna have some heat for me in this stuff pricey but you know if somebody who's gonna come out here and pay top dollar and try to get the best thing they could get I would not feel bad recommending this to them or sending them home with that you know either because you take one job and you're like whoa yeah man shoutout to field like I said first time trying to Ross and definitely impressed hopeful and you know we like a lot of alien labs flowers so hopefully they keep doing called more collaborations and doing more extracts is definitely enjoyed this one smoking more earth let

definitely would be buying again highly recommend it so the effects were really good on the gelato the taste was great um it was super smooth the only issue i think i have with it was if i had if i had to pick one was the um the burn on it was was not great it was good um but it could have been a little bit better and the ash the ash wasn't it wasn't dark or anything but it wasn't super light either so the ash could have been um a little bit better on it but it still was very clean and smooth um so yeah like i said very impressed by it definitely will be getting again so i'm going to rate this one a 9.1 out of 10. until next time guys", "TyuAC616qCM": "[Music] how's it going YouTube I'm always placing here back with another video today is going to be a strain review and for review today we actually have some wedding cake so without further ado as you guys can see I'm in nature here actually just in a little forest near my house so hopefully you guys enjoyed the scenery today but anyways let's get right into the review it is wedding cake so obviously we're gonna give you the genetics of wedding cake which is Girl Scout cookies crossed with a cherry pie so that's what makes a wedding cake and let's jump right into this review basically wedding cake was bred by cookie fam genetics they bred all those famous hype strains like Girl Scout cookies gelato and a bunch of other stuff so yeah without further ado I can't give you guys the looks of these buds because I don't have a nut I will show a lot of pictures at the end of the video so I'll give you the smell of this wedding cake which is something very very unique it has like a very just dank doughy vanilla cookie scent in my opinion it's like really really really good it's very hard to describe when you crack open the jar it's kind of like a doughy vanilla just dank muskiness that just hits your nose it almost smells like when you're baking cookies or like croissants or something like it's really crazy but yeah so I'm gonna give you guys basically the looks on the looks of these buds were just dense frosty just rock-hard just amazing beautiful nugs I'm gonna show you guys all the screen shot at the end of the video a quick tip for you guys if you guys want to learn how to light a joint properly this is my way of doing it you obviously want to get the end lit get a cherry going and then just spark it up all right so as you guys can see this joint is burning nice and white the ash this cannabis was flushed very well the grower is actually fat farm craft cannabis Co I'll put the link in the description and you guys can check out his Instagram an amazing amazing grower he actually grew this zombie curse that I reviewed not too long ago but let's get back to the review for the wedding cake so as soon as you pull this it has like thick dense milky smoke but the flavor is like I said it's a doughy vanilla kind of cushiness like it's it's very unique I've never had a strain that tastes like this or smells like this it almost has like like a baked goods kind of reminiscent taste that just coats your mouth like I said very vanilla a very musky dankey cookie just overall an amazing amazing strain another thing I want to let you guys know as you guys can see I'm wearing my portugal jersey let me know who you guys are going for in the World Cup it's been an amazing tournament so far and I can't wait to see who wins I have a feeling it's gonna be an underdog team but we'll see but yeah good luck to your team in World Cup as well let me know who you guys are cheering for in the comments as you guys can see nice white ash beautiful color nice resin ring going right around the joint it won't be able to focus sorry guys I'm using the front-facing camera I actually have my phone lodged on a like a broken tree branch right now so that's how I'm filming this going woo but for the effects of wedding-cake it is a very very very nice hybrid strain it's an indica dominant hybrid I would probably say an 80/20 75 15 or 75 25 kind of like something like that very very heavy just hit you right behind the eyes you just start getting very relaxed and mellow and just stress-free and it's just an amazing amazing full body relaxation no pain in your body like I said if you had any depression or anxiety it would just completely wipe it away and just coat you with an amazing feeling of just being uplifted and happy and just in a good mood and like you know an overall good enjoyable high but at the same time like you're stoned - it's really nice Wow another person's walking by right now so just might see a dog or something in the video yeah I'm kind of in like it's kind of like a ravine kind of path or bike path kind of thing it's not really like a forest or like a park it's kind of a weird area but either way who gives a [ __ ] I'm just smoking a joint anyways if you guys didn't know kind of Canada actually legalized cannabis and it's going to be coming October 17 2018 so go canada baby so I'm gonna get into the ratings out of ten for this wedding cake for the looks out of ten this is a very very nice-looking bud big frosty dense nugs I would have to say out of ten I would say in 8.5 out of 10 very beautiful nugs frosty dense smelly sticky so that's for the looks the smell the smell is also an eight and a half out of ten it's not the best smelling strain in the world but it's very unique and it's almost kind of like one of those dessert kind of strains that you smoke after dinner right before you hit bed or you know just when you're chilling watching a movie it's kind of like a treat when you smoke a joint of wedding cake like how it makes you feel it's so amazing so that's for the looks for the smell is also an 8.5 out of 10 look smell taste the taste comes through exactly like the smell it has that vanilla doughy cushion muskiness that just coats your mouth and just sits there I would have to say it's pretty unique there's not a lot of strains that taste like this there's a few maybe cookie strains that might have that dough anus in there so for the taste I would also have to give it an 8.5 out of 10 what else can I say look smell taste the effects the effects of wedding cake are in my opinion really really really good for an indica dominant hybrid it's exactly what I want I'm clear-headed I'm able to speak properly without stuttering without feeling foggy but at the same time I'm very relaxed and like very stoned and you know very mellow right so it's an amazing feeling I don't think you can really get better than that for indica hybrid effects in my opinion a great daytime smoke and nighttime smoke whenever you want you can even wake and bake if you actually want to I won't really put you right to bed but yeah overall for wedding cake I'm gonna have to give it a solid 8.5 out of 10 it's just that a really well-balanced strain it hits all the marks looks smell tasting effects it's really dank you know the Terps are there so in my opinion it's a very solid strain make sure you guys can get a verified cut of wedding cake if you guys are looking to pick this up so yeah this has been I'm always blazing's review of wedding cake hopefully you guys enjoyed it and I'll see you guys in the next video have a bake day guys [Music] [Music]", "SDz0omE35Es": "[Music] yo what up youtube welcome back smoking with

see you all and then that goes with you ciao for now see", "z_wm2gjJX4k": "as you can see it has very nice looking green hairs i mean orange hairs it's a very nice looking light green with bright orange hairs hey you welcome to my quiz review a juvenile spells this is what i do smoke push hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them off for you if you like rap you will like my news now let's get a show thank you for the view yo what's up my stoners welcome to juvenile styles today we are going to be doing wedding cake sunday driver hybrid so check it out on my channel we've already done boom wedding cake white wedding and now we're doing wedding cake sunday driver hybrid it looks very delicious wedding cake was very delicious white wedding was very delicious and this one it smells looks and i guarantee it's going to taste very delicious so let's light this butt up and pull out the bud take a nice look at it and have a nice thorough review of it and have a good time and relax like always this one actually has like a very very sweet taste to it it's actually a very strong taste but it does taste very very sweet it's almost kind of like i don't know what to like kind of like honey a little bit like it's very sweet tasting and it is a very strong flavor as well so these buds are a lot more packed than the last one we did which was campfire og that one was a nice packed bud too but these ones are even more so compressed i think it's because they're a little juicy and sticky too so check them out so it does it is a lighter green too it's a lot lighter green i'm trying to make it so you can have a good look at it it is a very nice looking bud it isn't the biggest but if you can see it has a lot of crystal on it so i'm trying to get it so you can have a closer look because it is a very covered up and crystal is a very nice looking bud so it has this one and this one i already rolled the rest of it so i already rolled the rest of it up in this joint so like the uh campfire oh geez i think i said in the last video i got three of the chem fire og and i got three of the wedding cakes sunday driver the wedding wedding cake sunday driver was only was five bucks more it's not a big deal but the campfire og it was 25 and the wedding cake sunday driver was 30 for three so from my experience you always get what you pay for when you pay a little bit extra you always get a little bit better i mean they're both fire though i mean the chem dog or campfire og was also a very good strain and here i'll put this up right now so you can see that was the bud from the that was the campfire oh gee but if you didn't check see that video that one was just posted so you can go back and check that one out so i gave that one a 3.5 to a 4 out of 5 for overall rating in this one i think i'm going to give it a little bit more it's kind it's a really top-notch bud sorry we had a little issue so i gave the campfire og on the last video i gave that a rating a 3.5 out of four and this one the wedding cake sunday driver has a little bit more stronger of a flavor it seemed to come a little bit less account or not really less account but more compressed buds so i'd say you'd probably be able to get a little bit more out of the kemphar og but the taste and everything else it seems to be a higher amount of thc in the wedding cake sunday driver i believe that kemp iog was 28-ish and the wedding cake sunday driver was 30 32-ish something like that i don't remember i should have wrote it down but it didn't and what the i'll give at least a four for a four to a 4.5 for taste because it is a very delicious strain i am loving the flavor is a very delicious strain and the smell it has a very strong smell it's like kind of like a sweet like it does kind of have like a bit of a honey smell but it has a little bit of a lemony smell but not very much it's not overwhelming like some flavors are but it is very delicious and i'll give i guess i'll just give an overall rating of i'll say at least a 4 to a 4.5 out of a 5 for the wedding cake sunday driver it has a very delicious taste very nice smell to it it's good to count and it's like covered in crystals nice and sticky as hell when you're trying to bust it up so with that i'll leave it there and i hope you all are doing really good in your lives and have some very good [ __ ] to smoke y'all have a good night now peace time to end the show i'll be back but i have to go now that we're all getting stoned but i got lots more videos so you can stay for show so bust up some more crystal and watch another show", "45JqjOwpCtA": "banning then wrong smoking weed weed is from the earth God put this here for me and you take advantage man use medical marijuana purposes only on

THC in this is new shoes I look down at the bottom like where's the weed it's just like five six compact little buds so it's definitely a dense strain it was dark through salad and uh does not look pretty serious though so yeah they're uh it's a smaller heat because again the logs are solid and heavy but thank you squeezing the [ __ ] sheet it's rock hard I look kind of sticky okay little sticky yeah cool I'm gonna call it sticky icky gonna call it sticky icky ish I guess de Guiche again this is a wedding cake I didn't me do a smell test [ __ ] hold on nope I'm sorry hey any of them uh

rosin I can't remember but we did rise this for a while then they stopped that I'm assuming obviously because takes a lot of product to make it but it was nice to have this for a while and then I even had some bubble hash for a small period of time so when we do is I'm gonna take out I needed two balls I take this piece right here don't break off this little corner piece this guy right here so I'm

cartridges from bright labs one of them is purple elephants and the other one is Gorilla Glue now I think the purple elephant is the one yeah it's the 65 and a half percent THC a which is excellent I mean it just killed my pain and that's good cuz I've got like three crush disks um and CBD a four and a half percent that's awesome um it's important to me because I am an epileptic um so that's awesome um co2 extracted um and that's awesome because everybody knows butane extracted is not healthy so co2 is great um tasty now you know okay there's this trend these days it's like delta-9 cartridges with flavoring added banana spearmint all that crap uh I even understand they won't like the cannabis cup with this crap I don't get it it you know I like the play the flavor cannabis I want to taste the strains personally it's kind of my thing so you know bright labs is my deal with that um they serve kind of a raw medicine you can taste it it really comes through you can taste the flowers so for me it's the perfect medicine it's very potent they don't waste money on packaging as you can tell however and you know it's important to me also as I've been buying their products for a little while and they're kind of a new company their cartridge they uh they got rid of the cheap cartridges is that they were using at first um which is good I like these new metal ones that they're using um but you know I don't even take my word for it if you go to their website you can just join us send em your recommendation and they'll send you a battery they'll send you a charger and they'll sing you some of their sample of their co2 oil give it a try on there's really nothing to lose I mean just give him a try I don't know you know Cheers and uh I tell you right now this is uh literally one of the strongest medicines I've ever had um it tastes delicious give me a second let me load the other one up I really want to try the gorilla glue um the purple elephant tastes delicious let me load the gorilla glue up let's let's try this one real quick and let's see what it tastes like my cameraman is getting a little impatient back there but uh give me a second before I give her a break notice uh like I said very very cheap sticker obviously I'm not being paid by the company you can tell cheats taker I'm not gonna give many props for that cheap packaging but but as I've shown you it is lab tested every every batch is lab tested so you know what you're getting cheap cardboard container again they're not spending any money to impress you with that which is cool like I said my money goes for the medicine not the container that I'm throwing in the trash when I get the medicine so I can really care less about that I like fitness lab tests and I like that I know what I'm getting every time and I like the flavor of the cannabis so honestly I'm not being paid by Brite labs and I like what they're offering so let me put this really glue on let me stop babbling let me have a taste of this and I also have some wax by them um that's how I started their bright labs honestly uh I honestly thought it would suck it was so cheap um so I gave it a try and it blew me away the quality for that price I think I paid $30 for it for a grant no less normally you can't pick up a half a gram for that price of quality wax no your honor I mean you and my grandma crabby waxford 25 bucks all day long but anyway let me get a try nice good pull off um yeah so these these batteries give you a nice good pull the cartridge is wow that tastes good um I can already feel it kicking in um and I've got a tolerance like you people wouldn't believe literally I smoked about a half ounce a week of about 27% THD so uh my tolerance through the roof anyway that's good about wrap it up it's tasty it's delicious its potent its healthy because we already know it's a good clean medicine we know it's extracted well I can't say enough I really can't bright labs uh it's the way to go he really is you're gonna see more of them", "INSqIJDiBFI": "welcome to episode 3 of mmm medical edibles my name is chef Tania Nicol chef and culinary nutritionist well no [ __ ] today we'll meet my favorite Chocolate Chunk cookies yes I'd like a chocolate chip cookie those little chocolate chips just won't do so I like to make it chunky me today's episode is sponsored by backbone and also the marijuana crime drama a sea of green check it out fully loaded on our YouTube channel you can also get it on DVD shut up and take my money now if you're like me chocolate Aulick I like to use chocolate chucks I like my chocolate today's recipe will be infused with Keith's very commonly on hand for most smokers usually collected at the bottom of your grinder you want to keep it in an airtight container I keep mine in a mason jar and keep it away from the light I like to go to the light no keep is one of the easiest ways to get THC into your edible if you're like me you probably have a lot you want to decarboxylate the Keith I am so confused right now it's just THC a and you need the heat to activate it just like you would when you're rolling your weed in the joint and you light that first hit got a big enough joint there right you need the heat to get high and we want to get high want to pre-heat your oven to 300 degrees so in order to decarboxylate the key you're going to use an oven safe Bowl we're going to use some parchment paper it's contained in the parchment paper which makes it easier and I've already pre-measured my two grams of Keith and I'm just gonna put it right in here with this piece of paper and you want to spread it as evenly as you possibly can to put it in the middle right you want to set the timer for seven minutes you want to allow your Keef to completely cool before adding it to any of your recipes a good rule of thumb is D carb your Keith before gathering your ingredients that way it'll have enough time to cool by the time you need it mmm smells delicious for this recipe we're going to use two cans of Keith two and a quarter cups of all-purpose flour a teaspoon of salt a teaspoon of baking soda three quarter cups of granulated sugar 3/4 cups of PAP dark brown sugar one teaspoon of vanilla extract two sticks of unsalted butter softened and two eight now let's get to baking in order to make the cookies you want to pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees we're gonna add the softened butter the granulated sugar the dark brown sugar and the vanilla extract along with the key in the mixing bowl carbs wise it's gonna set me back don't even give a [ __ ] we're gonna add a teaspoon of kosher salt you spilled the salt and a teaspoon of baking soda and then you just want to gently mix it we're gonna take the butter and put it right in the mixing bowl now we're gonna add 3/4 cup of granulated sugar mm-hmm that must be the sugar oh gold that's gold the dark brown sugar you'll probably need a spatula for this one since it's tightly packed yes and a teaspoon of vanilla extract [Music] hold your parchment paper and add the kief to the mix the great thing about parchment paper is that the kief doesn't stick to it now we're gonna cream the butter the sugar the vanilla extract and the keith's in our stand mixer or you want to touch the mixing bowl to the stand make sure it locks in place and you're gonna use your whisk attachment to make the cookies you want to blend the ingredients well until it forms a nice creamy mixture turn it off halfway and make sure you scrape the sides of the bowl we don't want to lose any of that swipe swipe swipe swipe swipe swish [Music] now we're gonna add the eggs one by one if you recall from the brownie episode we do it one by one in case there was a bad egg then we don't ruin the whole mix she was a bad egg [Music] you also want to make sure you scrape all of this down when you add the eggs to make sure everything gets well combined add the mixture with the flour baking soda and salt after that comes the chocolate chucks hmm you know what I need a little chocolate pick-me-up make sure you lower the bowl when you add the flour you want to start the mixer off slow so that the flour doesn't go flying everywhere [Music] scrape the sides of the bowl so you make sure you get all the flour into the mixture now it's time to add the chocolate chunks [Applause] waiting for cookies now it's time to portion the cookies make sure you clean off the whisk we don't want to lose any of this yummy goodness you can eat that you can use a small scooper or a table spoon whatever you have at home you want to use an ungreased cookie sheet or baking sheet or like I use parchment paper you want to have enough space around the edges for the cookie to spread please I'm gonna need you to spread I'm gonna try to get a good amount of the chocolate chunks along with the cookie mixture that way you ensure that all the cookies have chocolate chunks in them and the last ones aren't just sugar cookies once you've portioned out all your cookies depending on how small or how large you make them you can figure out how much THC is in each serving plugging that back in he takes the derivative and he solves the equation crowd goes wild it's also secondary Tomich THC percentages in your Keef again if you smoke high grade weed your THC should be at higher levels and if you smoke that schwag who does that then you're probably closer to the 20% mark we have a thousand milligrams of THC in this recipe we've made 43 cookies with two grams of keith's giving us a total of 23 milligrams of THC per cookie I have five numbers sitting all around me here we'll put these in that 375 degree oven for nine to eleven minutes until they're golden brown once they're golden brown will allow them to cool for two minutes on the stove and then move them over to a baking cooling rack cookies it's not that sniffing it's not for you let them cool on the stovetop for two minutes and then move them to a wire rack to

I really can't say nothing about the expansion rate because just air is making me coffee but I will say something about that sweet taste there is not I haven't wedding cake is like on the same levels taste wise and Sour Diesel like I said I'm older head so Sour Diesel you can never ever ever go wrong with Sour Diesel everybody that smokes knows that [ __ ] never go wrong with it but this is bottle the same level taste wise now I can't really say nothing about the high yet but it's getting there it's kind of hard to get hot when you got a cold I don't know why maybe it's psychological but we're gonna figure it out I'm gonna fight the smoke the whole damn thing we don't get hot is more than trust Emily baby that cars that coffee was pretty awesome though they said it was a motorcycle accident the cars and coffee I must have missed that one not that I want to see anybody in an accident and I hope those people that were in the accident I hope they're okay I hope everything's cool I hope your

say that that could be a a psychological issue or it could be um he's in pain or whatever it could be a whole bunch of different stuff you know google this but what it does is when they keep constantly licking their paws you can imagine if your paws stay wet 24 hours a day imagine what kind of viruses and [ __ ] that's inviting that's inviting the whole bunch of [ __ ] so I looked at its

what i'm saying sweet earthy gassy a little bit of lemony aromas coming off the off you know when you smell it but you mainly get that sweet and that gassy taste off the eggshell the smoke now i'm saying whether you're smoking a bun a bong or a joint you're going to get that fruity in that gas you taste this that's just something about the you know i'm saying the wedding pie and the grape pie too it's like no matter what you roll that [ __ ] up and you're still gonna get that fruity and you're still gonna get that gassy taste you know i'm saying that lemony taste might just dissolve right away but you know that fruity and that gassy taste you're gonna get that you know i'm saying it if you don't then bring it back bring it back bring it okay bring it bring that [ __ ] back i'm telling

room a actually which is the kind led we have two XL 1000s here and of course we are running the wedding kicks train which is 11 wedding kicks trains and 5 gallon pots aerated pots of course running the cocoa nutrients so here we are you guys this is finally the day that we've been wanting on harvest day overall I'd say things came out pretty good nog sizes are pretty decent and of course as always quality's on point we've got a little bit of light nice and say light well light bleaching let's finish that sentence yup I got like bleaching of course that's a courteous of kind LED like I said we got two of them here you know kind led of course even though these plants are you know of course well over 18 inches or more of course still light reaching so they need more maybe I should probably over like 23 24 inches so we'll see how the next run goes but aside from that of course we have some hewing going on with with the purple of course it looks pretty definitely looks pretty temps have been dropping here so it's kind of giving it this beautiful look but here we are you guys this is it overall I'd say things are looking really nice I wanted to challenge myself this round why because well last run so here we have one one light basically that's the doing of one light and then if I go ahead and come to this side where you kind of see the doing of this light and then a little bit of cross lighting happening right here so what I wanted to do you guys was challenged myself why because last run I had 15 or 16 I can't remember of course you guys can go back and see I had 15 or 16 of these plants in these 5 gallon pots and I had a third light right there and the results came out to you know the bright around two and a half pounds very disappointing even though you know it's not bad by any means I certainly could have been a lot worse however about two and a half pounds I mean I'm expecting a minimum of a pound per light so what I wanted to do this round was to kind of see you know these lights these kinds they have their pluses they have their minuses I'm gonna make a video on these later on however for now hey guys I think I did it I think I'm gonna be able to at least get about the same if not maybe more maybe a little bit less it's hard to tell I can never I'm always a little bit more optimistic than I should be I think but you know it is what it is I'm happy about this I'm happy with the overall results with 4 2 lights I think that's gonna you know be pretty good as far as grams per watt and I'm gonna actually try to keep you guys more in the loop as far as like final bugs what they look like the smell I want to try out a whole dry trim versus wet trim video I'm gonna make of that here in the next couple days too so overall I'm gonna try to make sure that these plants you know get the best treatment as far as curing so we can get the most out of them but giving the stage that they're in right now things are looking really nice cocoa of course as being the medium that's gonna of course help us make make things a little bit faster you know hydroponics that's controversial but I like to think it does overall you guys things are really really good though oh very happy so what do you guys think post it in the comment below of course I'm gonna make a video to update you guys all on this but overall what do you guys think is the final wait let me do this a little hand this with for you guys two lights kinda led you know in the video it actually looks a good decent amount of blood oh goodness what will it be what will it be look at that beauty though fire that is some failure let's go whoo all right you guys I'm gonna go ahead and get into this I'm excited I'll keep you guys updated as we move forward and we'll see how things go post comments in the bullet and the in the below I in the comment section below let me know what you guys think is gonna be the final wait for this to lights 11 plants wedding cake string cannon nutrients KOCO 5 gallon aerated pots you know beneficial bacteria a little bit of co2 let's go captain rigs out to the next one guys peace", "MCkS8komH0U": "[Music] or what is up wonderful and amazing human beings smokers Kroger's divers anybody watching this video i hope you are having a wonderful day my name is terrance i'm with highly active farms and today i'm bringing you guys the wedding cakes training review now a wedding cake was bred by sea junkies genetics she is a cross of triangle cush and animal cookies cordon ivan from jungle boys and this is the PCG or the purple sydney genetics country so that's where we got her but we grew her ourselves so this is the highly active farms wedding cake or the highly active wedding cake if you go that's a we like to call it and we grew it ourselves in organic living soil if you want to see the exact process you can go back and look on our videos we've got the weekly updates showing you exactly how this was grown and yeah enough with the small talk let's get into the review itself so yeah like I said this is wedding cake positive triangle cush animal cookies grown in a hundred percent organic living soil by myself I react to farms and as far as the appearance you could look at the close-ups that we're going to go ahead and put on the screen and you can see that she's pretty a pretty nice-looking plant man she's got a real dense punch structure super tight super frosty unbelievably cakes out with trichomes and pretty much a ten out of ten as far as the looks go even in the garden growing her she was a pretty good yogurt pretty nice big old fence but nothing to complain about as far as the visual appearance she's not the most colorful strain often but really is no problem because she is so caked out up in frost that there is nothing in my opinion to complain about looks wise as far as the smell test you get into that right now [Music] oh yeah she really a really does smell like wedding cake sort of a gassy a little bit of a gassy koshish flavor mixed with cookies but it really does come out smelling just like a yellow cake sort of really rich really rich really dank smelling but yeah it smelled like a really rich yellow cake almost like edible or something thank you is he definitely get that we do small to you but anyway as far as this smell goes smells I mean almond honestly a lot like wedding cake and you buried all the other I also heard that the way she got her name wedding cake was a she was just put up in the shop with the original crash that the TK push could be animal cookies and everybody who was coming in was like man a small egg wedding cake so uh considering that the story for how she got her name not too surprising as she smells a lot like wedding cake but enough about the smell in the looks how does she taste let's find out without further ado let's get sued now really rich taste definitely sort of a hashey taste um probably because I how much how many trichomes are just covering this plant or these buds but that that hashey taste definitely is wedding cake flavor dominate yeah I definitely definitely cakey flavor tastes a lot like she smells but uh so so resinous that that wedding cake flavor becomes sort of a hashing flavor as all those trichomes stacked on there kind of a genetic overall though delicious delicious the smell too is really phenomenal it's not a definitely not a common smell for cannabis but it's super delightful like I mean really does smell like wedding cake they're not a I'm gonna say that [Music] and the flavor t was really good nice clean burn I always want to see the white ash yeah overall as far as the looks smell and flavor she's really a kick-ass train I gotta say she's one of those really unique kind of Golden Tickets trains where you could tell that pretty sure she was Fino haunted if I'm not mistaken but I could be wrong about that I know you can still buy seeds too but regardless this train is just really a ting all the notes the way that the flavor and the smell is so unique along with that really beautiful budget gesture and the fact that it really kind of tells like there's a lot of pastry strains out there but this one really does taste like cake no joke about that no denying that fact I even uh I opened this up to let my girlfriend smell without telling her but it was right when she took the first with the first thing she said was wow that smells just like cake batter which would also be a good name for straight but anyway just goes to show how like that that cakey smell really is hard to miss yeah the KQ flavor is impossible in this too oh yes service at my wedding fana super super delightful flavors and smells coming off of her and I gotta attribute a lot of that I mean obviously the genetics are what make the flavor profile but how pungent it is I love going in living organic soil to really bring out the full flavor potential or whatever genetics I'm growing as far as this wedding gig man just delicious when grown in living soil and um delicious otherwise too but just a little bit extra delicious you know what yeah so uh the effects are definitely starting to kick in [Music] definitely a very euphoric strain it's you right behind the eyes first and then studs to go down get that full body feel getting a very dreamy being stay kind of vibe you know what I mean where everything starts to really look all dreamy which I really again only associated normally with kind of a first-time high but this wedding cake especially going to living soil really brings back that first a kind of experience it was very positive very euphoric I mean yeah overall nothing really to complain about as far as this wedding cake goes again I'd have to give her a ten out of ten whatever we're using to measure she hits all the notes and she is wonderful an absolute pleasure as far as growing here goes now that I'm all stoned I might as well babble about growing her I think I mentioned a little earlier she was a pretty fast venture really good better pretty resilient client I don't that's the right word but a party her grew very fast I'm not good with words here because she's actually got me so high that I'm very Spacey but a quick vegging vigorous growing plant and honestly really good yields and flour a lot of these a lot of these really good newer strains that were mostly cookies grasses I'm seeing a lot smaller buds but this wedding cake did pretty much come through honestly with the yield pretty good size and the hugs and on top of that they're really dense some of the densest nugs that have in the garden if not probably actually be dentist snugs this run in the garden so yeah as far as everything that I could think of for growing I would definitely grow her again wonderful to grow wonderful to smoke here at Mercy wedding cake either in flower or phone form definitely pick her up you definitely want to grow her and you definitely want to smoke her so again 10 out of 10 plants I don't know what we're using the measure I'm really high but this wedding cake is wonderful and I will definitely be on the lookout for another clone of her that I will not let go this time should have cloned her but I got the bedroom full as he saw on the last video probably but not the bedroom full so I didn't have any room for clones of these guys but I would definitely grab her again if I get the chance and as for you thank you so much for watching this video I really appreciate the support go ahead and click that subscribe if you want to follow

blast this alright everybody we're outside we're ready to\nblast this Keef and just remember everyone this is not like blasting bud\nit's gonna be a lot more pressure in this - so we're gonna activate

some sort of herb  ok guys", "gMSH2m_JG0c": "hi I'm Donald with Green Magi Labs and Ally you have a whole bunch of trim or probably wondering what to do with it right now so I'm going to show you how easy it is to keep your trim so that you can either have activated Keef or just be topping their bulbs with it and so a lot of people will just use these silk screens which are for making t-shirts and you want to have a container that fits up around that pretty good now it's actually as easy as just taking a bunch of your friends and I'll show you this you're gonna take love it around a little bit make sure it's all broke up you're willing to work a lot of it through but don't be so aggressive that you're working climate irreal through because it's gonna cut down on the amount of time you actually spend cleaning up the trend because like things random contaminants might be pushed through and so you kind of just go like this a little bit you can see there's a whole lot of trim up on here some of its leaf matter that's not gonna matter the t-shirt screen actually is gonna keep most of it from going through and so what you should end up with is a nice little layer pretty quickly of your key and so as you can tell down here right now off the bat the whole bottom is starting to be covered in key that gets scraped up and that allows you to do what you want with it whether it's making butter making activated to decarboxylated teeth or just copying a bunch of bowls with it I hope this helps you out peace very best wishes make sure to subscribe and like", "IRdl-b1SFHg": "what up what up what up what up YouTube world this is captain Riggs hope everybody is doing well it has been a long time since I've made a video and I wanted to just make a quick little update and let you guys know that I am back full swing growing getting things going and wanting to make YouTube videos for you guys because man I did not expect to get the amount of love and feedback that I did on that last video with the Gorilla Glue that was frickin awesome and you know to be honest what happened is I got in these new positions at work required me to be in two places at once at all times for the most part and new people hired in and all kinds of stuff like that which made me you know not necessarily putting in all the love and you know hard work that I could have put in with the last harvest and hence the reason why I kind of just wanted to take a break because I like to you know go balls to the wall all in everything that I do and I just wasn't able to do that the last girl you know even though it looked nice really really nice buds great quality as far as yield and weight just was not what I was expecting it actually ended up being right around two-and-a-half pounds of dried nice bud I had a lot of [ __ ] popcorn nuts on the bottom that I didn't even mess with just because it just was too time consuming but for the most part the bulk of it was writing around two and a half pounds if that even not necessarily what I was expecting but I know the lights had nothing to do with it nutrients had nothing to do with it had everything to do with how much I was utilizing the opportunity and the given space and obviously the plants capabilities and I certainly wasn't doing that by any means however now I have more of a balanced lifestyle going on right now I've been growing these these are all wedding cakes by the way I have 16 wedding cakes in here they're all in five gallon pots aerated pots running with coco nutrients I'm sorry cocoa medium and the nutrients are actually canna nutrients but other than that this is exciting and the reason why I'm excited is because one I have some subscribers now to the channel which lets me know that there's some people that want some information and and you know want to support and I really really appreciate that so to all you guys that have subscribed thank you so much I really appreciate it that's very encouraging just because I'm not out here making YouTube videos for money or anything but I just wanted to see that what people actually liked the content and you know it seems like that's going to be the case so I'm gonna make these a little bit more regularly and I want to support any you know project you guys are doing so if you have any questions information that you may need if anything I can help you with you know shoot me a message or leave a comment or anything along those lines and I'll do my best to get to you guys with some information and point you in the right direction if I can but anyways guys so this is the last day that these plants are going to be in this obviously life cycle they are on 18 6 veg like cycle we're going on I've turned this spectrum in a way with the lights so that we can obviously see I feel like it's more pleasing to the eye obviously if you can see the actual color of the plants and how they're doing as opposed to the red and purple hue that they always generate which is nice about the kind leds which you can adjust all that stuff which is really cool so like right now a which is all the reds out of 100 it's all as zeros but I can go ahead and crank it on and you can see right away you know the Reds come on which I had somebody asked me actually in the last video you know they have some kinds and they were asking about what kind of percentages I do during veg and flowers so I'll go ahead and go over that right now as far as the the Reds which is what the A's are you know they're in a vegetative state they don't need that much red so if anything at all it's more of the blues that they need and the other ultraviolet and UV lights that they need as well so I know the Reds down to actually about 25% when I'm in veg so that's how I have a set up right now and then as far as the the bees which is the blues I have those at a hundred and C which is everything else I have that at 100 as well so that's how I set it up for veg and then for flower aids obviously but that's when they're gonna utilize the Reds that's when I crank that up to 100 so everything is 101 100 during flower and then obviously at 12:12 light schedule pretty simple stuff but hey this is cool actually look you can kind of see what one light does as opposed to another and like the coverage that it provides I think it's pretty decent yeah about five by five is what you know kind claims and you know it's about their I'd say maybe a little bit less we'll see the goal is 1.5 pounds that's what I've been aiming for and by going ahead and stretching and manipulating these plants so that I can get an even canopy going on as much as possible you know those ones in the back of kind of stretched a little bit more but it is what it is but at this point I think I think I'm in good shape flip them flower maybe put another layer of netting in for further support because they're definitely going to be stretching quite a bit and and see how it goes you know I got some clones going on I absolutely love these cloners these are so simple you guys if you are like me in the past you know I used to struggle all the time with cloning it was so hard not much luck but look I literally just planted these in here just pure water right for my faucet I didn't even pH the water I just poured it in here turned on the pump took the cuttings and shoved them in there man no deficiencies they all rooted in 11 days isn't that insane make your life easy you know grab one of those I don't know they're on Amazon I think I got that one for like 60 bucks pretty simple stuff but yeah we're back you guys thank you for the support show some love drop a like a comment anything you guys may you know questions you may have I'll go ahead and answer if I can and we'll go from there I'm gonna go ahead and make these videos as regular as possible taking you through the steps of what I've done to achieve this type of canopy and overall you know just keeping you guys updated and document this whole grow so in the meantime you guys have a wonderful day take care I'll make another video soon til next time captain Riggs out peace", "WlxAbUSVNcs": "what's good guys this video is intended for people over the age of 18 so if you're not over 18 just do me a solid head out for me and if you are over 18 do not try this at home houses may be a little more it's good right there alright what's going on everybody welcome to the video today didn't plan on making this video but I kind of decided you know what I got some good some good we can I can give out to people that you know may not know about where for people that don't really know about Keith and stuff like that so before we [ __ ] continuing further you guys get that too it's like the first time you smoke during the day Sydney water so the topic of this video is the best way to use your keys so for those of you that don't know basically what Keef is is Keef is the part of your bud that gets you high it's after you grind it up all the trichomes and [ __ ] and most grinders is a little men and under that little net there's like a third compartment and in that is key it's the good stuff but the stuff you want so people what they normally do is they [ __ ] take the grinder and grind up the bunch of [ __ ] bud after weeks and weeks or however long you want to wait at the bottom you accumulate Keef and you could put it in a bowl you can put it in whatever the [ __ ] you want and that's just pure like [ __ ] gay pie powder and this is just my opinion right people other people could have other opinions and stuff like that but you know that's them I'm telling you the best way I think it is to use your keys and the honestly it's with your but that's plain and simple what you want to do so we're gonna go ahead and take another bowl of both can you see that this is a good video put a better one on the screen but this is what you want bro all that brown stuff on the brown little sugar at the top that's the [ __ ] good stuff right there I thought I was gonna hold it way too soon I see a lot of people like to pull their [ __ ] bowls through like you're sucking right through and like oh [ __ ] and like I get it but like all I think it really does is just dirty your piece so I really I don't like to pull it through I kind of like loading in all at the bottom when I [ __ ] head and just take it yeah I think the best way to use your [ __ ] Keef is with your book so let's say that you wanted to smoke a bowl alright just like a regular [ __ ] Keef bowl that [ __ ] like it's so powdery that you get high for sure you definitely don't need a lot to get high with Keith but you [ __ ] pack the bowl and it would just snap right through it's literally one pull and you're done you couldn't pass that around everything just cuz it's so cautery so when you use the bud the Keith sticks to the bud rather than just the [ __ ] Keith being by itself and getting sucked through um also I heard a really good [ __ ] well what's something similar to like it's not like a metaphor again analogy boom let's say you have your favorite [ __ ] dish right your favorite meal of all time are you gonna save the best part of that food later like in six months and when there's like a little bit left and you might have some left after it's been like left out and [ __ ] like that now it's just like bro tax then I stopped grinding with the [ __ ] keep catcher and have I noticed a difference am I getting a lot more high no I don't know but I mean a taste good you know I'm saying just flour alright this should be alright you know we got the Christmas lights and the ladder in the back just I'm trying to get the whole bong in this one off it's just flour in this bowl I don't have that much Keith and I'll tell you why after I hit this but man hopefully it looks good it's [ __ ] ass try that again don't [ __ ] this employ [Music] there you go for all you [ __ ] Bowl snappers it has this little [ __ ] dick and it's perfect because you can take your bowl and there's nothing in it now but you can just [ __ ] in and my bowl is black alright it's not dirty actually it is pretty [ __ ] dirty right here is supposed to be clear so I got this [ __ ] downstem right it's from our Bowl and downstem I wanted a black downstem and Bowl to begin with because you couldn't tell if it was dirty and it looks nothing black looks cool but mainly cuz you couldn't it wouldn't look dirty it gets a little ball at the bottom with little slits but when you have the little slits it doesn't really think hole in milk it'll milk up nice and you go to clear and duh it's like sucking through like a strong muffling the [ __ ] your error from bong to your mouth so I tried cutting it making this little bit bigger and I broke in half just been like this like [ __ ] half moon thing but it works alright so my camera better be [ __ ] done real quick but we're back I charge us a little bit we still got a little bit all nice and [ __ ] weird cuz it's like a half moon thing so like I'll try to get it closer bro I don't even know if I knew these are working [Music] [Music] that's another good thing to mix it with your buns just add like another it's like the spice bro it adds another layer of flavor a bad idea I don't know why I did that it's cold here like um like here in Florida it's [ __ ] it's not cold but it's Florida cold like I know there's people every time I say this we were like but I live in [ __ ] I live in Antarctica do as a negative 109 here well you don't know cold I'm just like all right yeah I feel you but like relativity man you're used to that [ __ ] boat tomorrow right now it's like 55 tomorrow it's gonna be like 82 [ __ ] hated hey the [ __ ] humidity bro just [ __ ] sweat and it's just icky you should walk through so you can like feel your self walking it's gross but when people ask me they're like do you prefer the hot of the cold I'd be like bro honestly we're not talking about extremes either like I'm not trying to say like [ __ ] 10 degrees outside there's some crazy [ __ ] like that like honestly I prefer it to be colder because my thing is that you can dress to be cold you can dress for the cold to be warm you can like put layers on and [ __ ] when it's hot us is lucky it doesn't matter if your butt ass naked you are hot as [ __ ] you're sweating it doesn't matter don't try to tell me [ __ ] cuz you know I'm right I'm warm this high so I saying this is gonna be it oh let me get a good better angle appreciate you guys for watching the video like subscribe the whole thing see you guys the next one probably in a week on Wednesday this is how to [ __ ] alright Cheers [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "nRmfYz4YHGA": "alrighty the uh the last time i got this i just opened it right up and consumed it so i thought i'd open up some and see what it looks like on camera here this is some keef uh indica and it's a little lower in the percentage than i would like it's around 30 and uh geez talk about not focusing there we go so uh this is a pretty cool product you know i add it to every bowl every joint when i have it yeah so without further ado let's just go ahead and open it up take a look at it see what we get never going to make out any of that detail but uh make sure i don't lose any oh yeah comes fairly uh fairly full let me see if i get my tool here let's take a look at this just a little bit all right anyhow let's see what it weighs they don't always have this so i just buy as much as i can get i usually get you know two because they've been limiting it well that doesn't look like quite a half a gram being only 30 percent you know and it's a the limit on what you should buy they really should have this on point more so let's uh go ahead and dump that back in there and just see what my piece of paper weighs just to double check there we go a couple few points under um i don't really bother to complain because i always get a delivery anyways but uh that's always a little disappointing but i'll go ahead and uh pack a bowl and throw some of this on top and leave my thoughts in the description thanks a lot", "E484Wa-8P_0": "what up YouTube welcome back welcome back today we got some papaya cake for you guys we want a true leaf I'm real excited for this one real excited um 25 percent THC some of the

in flower we have eight plants they're in the five gallon smart pots guess we'll start right here we have four wedding cake from ilgm now these are clones from our mother plant don't know if she's gonna be called cracks cut yet of wedding cake we'll see how this run turn out if not we're gonna pop some more wedding cake seeds from ilgm coming up soon so what i do like about this phenotype though you see how this one right here that we're viewing it's just standing straight up even in flower now she's gonna stretch about another foot and uh even when they put on their weight you don't have to do much tying up so that's always a plus as you all know we have to tie up all of our plants most of the time that we're growing out when we let them stretch out and they come up so high and we have to just get out the twisty ties and bring them up therefore they don't snap and things like that but yeah these plants are all at day 10 in flower and they're looking good to me just took in the highest dose of nutrients that they're going to be getting which is going to be around 850. check them out what do you all think i'm very excited to be running them again the first run didn't turn out right i didn't like the job i did on them we're just gonna start again with another fresh batch make sure we're on our a game with this run also all right we also have the cherry pie here at day 10 in flower poor clones as well we grew this one out we did pretty well in several of the gardens growing out this cherry pie however this cut is not indica dominant at all it's it's definitely a good daytime buzz medicaid you know good medication for the daytime if you're trying to do anything stay functional ain't gonna happen yep so everything's looking good on this side as well as you can see i did go in here and do some super cropping this time around [Music] yep these plants are also at 850 parts per million does not require a lot of nutrients at all that's probably pushing it right there but we're going to keep them there until she show us tip burn look like she's trying to a little bit right there but that's not that bad at all all right so that's just your quick video for today this will not be a very long video i did just want to shoot this video and let you all take a look at them i know i did shoot a video of her when they were stealing of these plants when they

pk week a okay", "oIgn1oCCSn4": "what's up guys it's groomer e4 here battling on their episode and I want to show you an easy way that you can extract trichomes from plant matter and this video is inspired by opus 420 a good friend of mine he's an awesome guy his video inspired me to make my own video on how to use a key box or how to make your own so what I've got is about 4 ounces of frozen trim and bud it's a good thing to freeze it beforehand that way the trichomes become more brittle and they're easy to fall off and the screen that i'm using is 120 micron silkscreen i got it at my local art store you can also use metals metal screen if you can find it and it's just a very easy way to get concentrates without using chemical solvents be chill and whatnot is becoming very popular and a big problem with that is people are trying to make it at home by themselves and that in itself is very dangerous it poses very a lot of risks including leaving solvents left behind in the leftover product and the possible risk of blowing yourself up and you shouldn't make butane hash oil unless you have a background in chemistry and organic chemistry to actually know what you are doing and there still needs to be a lot of research into canvas concentrates that use chemical solvents just yeah it's terrible reading the news and seeing somebody died in a beach hill explosion like one explosion is one too many deaths that's terrible we don't need that in our community and we have better ways to make it so let me stop rambling so what you want to get you don't want to do is of course freeze the trim for a few hours and oh yeah underneath my silk screen I have just a few pieces of wood just as spacers so they're above the table and I also have a piece of tempered glass it makes it much easier to scrape up that Keith and you're also gonna want a card I have my friend Corey for a business card just to help me out so and yes one man's trash is another man's treasure if you can possibly get your hands on trim at a very low price it's a great thing to take the advantage of because there's still a lot of trichomes left you're just gonna want a few handfuls and when you're using silkscreen you want to be very gentle especially with the small pieces of stems it can rip through that's why it is best to get an aluminum swing and you're gonna probably you're gonna want to gently brush it over for about ten minutes and I'm gonna put on my timer ten to fifteen minutes so we'll go for fifteen and a little history though hashish morocco produces actually nearly half the hashish smoked in the world spain has massive massive cannabis fields specially bred just for hash production and usually in in places like India and Afghanistan in Pakistan they would use indica strains because it's mostly known for its high resin content high trichome content and hashed hashes thousands of thousands of years old it's incredible it's just so fun to work with me it's actually working with a plant that can help you out [Applause] and of course doing this extraction won't extract 100% of the THC of the trichomes there will be small plant matter inside but you know I'd rather have residual plant matter than rich residual chemical solvents from beauty [Applause] and by getting shrimp from a local friend it's a good way to get some nice seeds [Applause] you find any small bugs just break it up you don't need to grind it beforehand or that will probably increase the plat matter that you'll get inside the benefits of making your own keep extraction is you can get very creative you can either make it simple setup like this where you're just moving it over the silk screens onto a glass top or you can make shakers I've seen people that have attached motors to the sides such as ones found in late video game controllers and that will automatically not that's pretty smart and you can also make a tumbler box there's one you can buy it's called the pollinator I believe marijuana has a video on it and it's a very effective machine but you can also make one yourself you stoners [ __ ] you guys are creative I feel a jump cut coming up all right so we're back 15 minutes has passed and let's see what you got first let's take out most of the tram just easier and let's see so like I said before there is going to be some small plant residual matter I'd rather have that chemical solvents Oh that's so Sears one man's trash is another man's treasure that's how you can easily extract trichomes from plant matter without using chemical solvents and I can't stress that enough we we there are let that up to the professionals please do not make canvas concentrates using chemical solvents at home it's very dangerous and that's why there are methods like these and you can do at home in a safe manner I don't want to hear any more [ __ ] explosions in the news that's scary so delicious delicious so hope you guys enjoyed the video and have a great day peace", "dJdBvEDZ14k": "hi everyone today I will be showing you how to make Keef using a polymer box to do this you will need a polymer box a grinder as well as your weed or your trim the first step is to grind up your cannabis and fill up the palm box with the ground material after you have filled up the pollen box shake for about 30 to 60 seconds then remove the base and scrape up your Keef you can shake the box again if wanted or at a coin to increase the yield but you will lose some quality and that's what you need to do to meet Keef with the poem box you", "nxtHb-T314Q": "[Music] [Music] what's going on YouTube this is captain Riggs bringing you guys an update on the flower room we are at the end today's the harvest day sixteen of the birthday cake or wedding cake or whatever you want to call it I hear that naming throwing around both ways same exact strain though this is 16 I'll just say birthday cake for the sake of the video here all in five gallon pots growing under three kind led XL 1000s and we are in day number 64 today so I've just been flushing them with just pure water and it's a good time to chop them down as you can see yes I have a lot of light bleaching unfortunately these plants got way taller than they needed to I wasn't expecting them to stretch the amount they did I've completely forgotten underestimated how versatile this strain is and just really you know how crazy you can get if you don't watch the height and try to manage it so I decided to kind of just let it go set [ __ ] it you know it is what it is I did what I could to support certain branches and whatnot with these wire ties and this is about as good as it's gonna get for me you know I'm a little bit disappointing because I definitely could have had better results but you know this it doesn't look too bad a lot of life leeching unfortunately some of the main tops there as you can see but you know all the stuff underneath though it's pretty money everything all the way down try to get in there a little bit show you guys some of the [ __ ] underneath he's doing pretty good so think I did the best that I could obviously given the fact that these stretch the way they did and I just didn't want to in the past you know when this has happened before what I do is I go ahead and just add another layer on top of it and try to weave them through the the netting and that's gone bad for me so I figured you know what bite the bullet let them do what they need to do a lot of them you know hanging on its side and whatnot but this is what we got so I'll go ahead and I'm gonna start getting into this try to knock it out as quickly as I can and I'll let you guys know the final wait anybody wants to guess in the comments go for it my goal is going to be four pounds that's what would make me happy anything less than that I'm gonna brush it off but I want four pounds out of this everything just looks fire that's for sure it looks really good really good quality bud and the wedding cake or birthday cake or whatever you want to call it some mix of Girl Scout cookies and cherry pie so alright guys just a quick update for you until the next video peace"}
