{"xlN5CgQcvAg": "[Music] our dough pieces have completed the intermediate fermentation of approximately 30 minutes and now we're ready for the most exciting and perhaps most difficult part of the packet making process the shaping of the baguette adobe's is a beautifully fermented beautiful texture we are working from left to right and we are taking our dough pieces off so we can replace them back onto the couch after shaping your setting our couch again I'm showing that there is enough flour on them rather a little bit too much flour on the final budget then too little it's an absolute calamity if the dough sticks to the couch which mostly happens on the new couch it hardly ever happens once the couch has been seasoned and used several times putting a bit of flour down and we start with our first baguette you're patting it down gently sort of with a curved hand patting out the larger bubbles but not all of them we're folding it over by 2/3 and then gently pushing it forward tightening up the dough on the outside flip it over by 180 degrees we're bringing the edges a little bit to ensure that the bucket doesn't get too long too early on bringing the ends and we're folding over the dough again by about two-thirds pressing gently the dough forth again the tightening of the dough very important we create a little farro with our thumbs we are rolling over the dough over the thumb and then tighten it again with a similar movement perhaps one more time to ensure that it o is really tight and one can see how the dough wants to jump back we're really tightening the surface beautiful bubbles are visible let's just check that it at the table has enough flour so we're rolling over the dough now for a final tensioning left thumb roll the dough over the thumb and with the heel of our right hand we are sealing the dough one can see that there's a nice fairly straight seam on the top and now we're giving in the final roll out to about 40 centimeters a classic baguette has about 350 grams and 60 centimetres long obviously we can't bake in a domestic oven 60 centimeter baguettes so we're making it smaller in dimension and by weight 220 grams and 40 centimeters we're making it slightly pointing to demonstrate that it's a hand shaped forget and we're placing it onto our Koosh folding up the Koosh to create a barrier and to kind of contain our baguette during the final fermentation number two padding out larger dough bubbles fold over by two-thirds tightening the surface flip it 180 degrees bring in the edges a little bit so it doesn't get too long at the beginning of the shaping process fold over by two-thirds and again tightening the dough we create a little farro with our thumbs fold it over with your hands and again tighten it by pushing it away perhaps one more time and one can see how beautiful and tight it is notice that the seam is always sort of straight during the entire folding process also notice that the thickness of the baguette is about the same we cannot correct everything in the final process now for this step we are rolling over the dough over the thumb and the heel of the right hand will seal the seam let's check our seam nice and closed if there's too much flour the seams would not close so well and from the center outwards we are rolling it into about 40 centimetres slightly pointy make sure that you have a little bit of flour on the baguette in case it feels a bit sticky and we're placing it onto the cush and number three hide out the dough fold over two thirds first tensioning flip 180 degrees bring a doubt piece together flip it over 2/3 again tightening it gently another one and again it's nice and tense we make a pharaoh then we're rolling it over our thumb and sealing it with the heel of the right hand a little bit of flour and from the center outward yeah shaping it again little point remember seam on the top and we are placing it into our Koosh make a fold and we're ready for the next one this time in Baker speed in making the dough strong on the outside but the inside we are retaining the beautiful area bubbly structure of the dough and our last one number eight for insurance a slight dusting and we're sending it off to the final fermentation covered with a cloth tuck it in gently allow it to ferment for approximately 30 minutes this is now the final fermentation after this fermentation the packets will be brought into the oven as always we are tightening up our table and we now wait for other gates for their final rise the shaped wickets have undergone the final fermentation of about 25 minutes although we are still a bit early one can feel it on presses makes an imitation and if it jumps back too quickly one must let it go a little bit longer however since we only can bake for but gets at a time in a domestic oven we now will remove four onto a transfer board and place the remaining four into the frigerator for baking later on to transfer the baguettes yeah dusting our board to ensure that we that the baguettes will slide off easily one way is especially when they have not proven too much one can pick them up by hand however this is not the particularly best methodology as we are handling them a bit too much the professional Baker uses a transfer board and we flip the baguette onto the transfer board notice now that the seam is on the bottom and we gently slide it onto the onto the board and once more the spaghetti are now ready for cutting but before we do that we place these in the refrigerator if they have proven a bit more one could leave the cover off to make sure there is instant heat exchange and the baguettes cool down and stop the fermentation in this case I'm confident that they can be covered for the fresh raishin face so these will go in the refrigerator and bake once the first four buckets have come out of the oven [Music]", "ba2DHI299PU": "hi it's martin i'm in the studio today with five tips for shaping baguettes okay five tips for shaping baguettes tip number one is simply practice in order to shape more beautiful baguettes you have to practice you have to put your repetitions in it's just like learning to play the piano or juggling or any other hand skill which is improved through practice and coordination so you've got to practice in tips two and three i'm going to give you methods which will help you to set that foundation and you're going to be well on your way to shaping beautiful baguettes tip number two for shaping baguettes it's pre-shaped before we make our final shape we have an intermediate step which we call pre-shape the more beautiful and regular our pre-shape is the more beautiful a final shape will have let me show you how to do it [Music] okay so i've divided these pieces into about 300 grams and let's give appreciate i'm padding gently to the gas and then i'm going to fold to the middle and seal if you see a large bubble just pop it so you see how i kind of brought this sides together sort of went like that and now i'm just going to start at the top and i'm going to roll down and press to seal roll down and press to seal and that looks good to me this is a tube or cylinder pre-shape let's do another one press to deflate slightly find any large air bubbles you can see that this piece isn't quite regular but that's okay we're going to fix that so again fold to the middle go to the top and it's basically a process of just kind of rolling it down i felt this sticking for just a second so i just drag it through a little bit of flour and what i'm trying to do here is really maintain sort of square walls if i can have square walls i'll have a roof which is beautiful and straight windows will go in easily to use sort of an architectural or building analogy so do you see how this is regular the more tubular this is the more beautiful and even my final shape will be okay tip number three for shaping baguettes this is what i'm going to call fold and roll i'm going to show you first how to fold and then how to roll and i'm going to demonstrate using a napkin so you can see very clearly what the folding steps are and then in tip number four we'll go to shaping the shaping of a baguette has two sort of sections the first phase is what i call sort of the origami phase and then the second is the actual rolling so for the origami phase i'm going to take this edge that's away from me i'm going to bring it two thirds of the way down we're basically making a letter fold press to seal edge that's closest two-thirds of the way up and then if you want to sort of identify for yourself what the middle portion uh that midline of the baguette is you can tap to do so and then you just bring this edge that's away down and seal you can either do that with the palm of your hand as you see bakers do or if you want you can also if it seems easier you can use your hand working with it as a paddle you can just take your fingers and you can press to seal and then you roll okay step number four for shaping baguettes in step two we saw a pre-shape in step three we got our method so step four let's shape a little bit of flour on my surface just a super super thin thin sheen of flour here and sometimes i like to have some a little bit out of my workspace up here a little bit and that way if as i'm shaping i need a little bit i can go up there often my hands might need a little bit or maybe the dough piece needs a little bit so i can sort of flip it up there okay so this is my tube pre-shape it's been sitting on the bench seam side down and the seam side is the side that i want on the interior of the baguette it's not the show side so if it was resting on the bench like that i just flip it over there's my seam okay so i pat to degas that will remove any large bubbles and i begin with what my letter fold right so about two thirds of the way down tap to seal if you see a large bubble you can just pop it turn this around and i'm trying to be regular i'm trying to maintain these square sides right trying to maintain that because like i said before if i have a square floor and square walls i'll have a nice roof and the windows are going easy you know so maintain that squareness so now about two thirds of the way down press to seal and if you want to have a sort of divot in the middle so you know where to divide the baguette there's my middle and now all i have to do is bring that to the leading edge and i'm done you can either do that as i showed using the palm of your hand to seal the heel there or you can use your fingers i'm a fan of using my palm so that's what i'm going to do so i bring this forward to the leading edge and i just press to seal and i basically have my tube so that was the folding portion and now i go to the roll and when i go to the roll i start in the middle and i just go back and forth and then i move my hands to the sides and then as i get to the points i taper just a little bit so back and forth and then hands applying soft pressure moving back and forth and as i get to the edges i just apply a little bit of taper and i look for the seam seam is there and i put it seam up on my koosh or my lid there's the seam let's shape i'm going to pat gently to remove any large air bubbles i get a sense of whether or not the dough is sticking to the bench the bench feels good it's got a light layer of flour and i can begin shaping so remember start with the letter fold sew that edge about two-thirds of the way down and then this side about two-thirds of the way down i'm trying to maintain this square presentation straight sides if i can maintain this straight aspect that'll translate into the final baguette and it'll be nice and even then i just need to bring this edge to the leading edge so bring it down press the seal and if your palm begins to stick a little bit just go out and grab a little bit of flour and that small sheen of flour on your hand that light sheen will be enough back and forth until i have a little bit of a divot here and then to the edges and press to taper baguette should have a nice seam and that will be the side that i put up when i put it on the couch so i place these on my flowered couch or linen seam side up between each dough piece i make a little bit of a pleat okay tip number five for shaping baguettes this is simply patience be patient with yourself be forgiving enjoy the mistakes if you make a baguette and it looks like a snake that swallowed an egg it's okay i've made a lot of those you'll see some of that along the way but often nobody else will notice but you so be patient with yourself enjoy those mistakes and happy baking you", "R8v7IQXN0rk": "this insane glass grenade is actually holding an 8 gram joint hi friends welcome to that high couple where we explore and discuss our passion for cannabis we are celebrating the holidays here in the dab and cabin and we are going to treat ourselves with one of the most expensive joints we have ever showcased on this channel this is some uh you made it to the end of the year you deserve this today we are going to be showcasing a hundred and fifty dollar joint this is a joint ladies and gentlemen this insane glass grenade is actually holding an 8 gram joint yeah what napalm's original grenade pre-roll seven grams of their premium gelato cannabis so you get a quarter all ready to start with yep then they add a gram of their live resin diamonds that concentrate component that extra like punch to it and then if that wasn't enough they wrap it in lift tickets yup lift tickets i love is an infused rolling paper we've seen them around since like the pre-legalization medical days so it was super fun to see that that was the paper that this was used for and we need to give a big shout out to mj one of our favorite delivery services here in los angeles we were able to get this luxury pre-roll hand-delivered to us so we didn't even have to go out and visit a shop during the pandemic yeah all right so let's get into the actual pre-roll itself oh i love it how insane is that yeah it just comes right out of the grenade i kept pulling this pin thinking that it came out but like not what you would think it's just the tag oh here we go pull it out and i love that the crutch itself is glass to make sure that it burns evenly honestly it looks and feels like a cigar it really does this is eight grams this is heft especially with this glass tip on the end of it this is impressive ganja marks groucho mars there we go that's what we're going for this is just a normal like standard run of the mill you can see look at that difference got some girth to it this is like maybe just over half a gram and this is the eight gram mega drink she's a big girl use something a little bit more serious than a bic just to make sure that you're getting it all the way across but cheers everybody this is insane we've never smoked anything like this before there's no way we are finishing this all in the channel in one setting we are not about to consume eight grams of cannabis but uh we're gonna get nice and stoney though oh man it's so it's it's so smooth because i've never taken a hit out of a pre-roll that has a lot going on with it the wax interacting with the cannabis yes oh my goodness it's got so many good chirps in there flavors are insane on that thing we should do something kind of special one of our favorite smoking devices yes does she smoke let's see oh my god guys she smokes we are going to be burning through this now oh

thing is is it respecting the needs of the bread in other words if you're shaping really fast but you're ripping the bread would you consider that a valid method nope because you don't want to punish the bread so if you're shaping fast and clean that's what we won so now we're going to make a round both I'll take this dough which is now nicely relaxed the seams are presently down so we'll turn it up so the seams are up once again I get the majority of the gas out and then initially it looks just like depreciating but here is where you really make certain that you're getting it as tight as you can so it's got as much structure as possible so when you're done it should be this round tight symmetrical ball of dough and your hands will be able to feel the inside of it you don't want to feel any big pockets that might indicate poor shape and you want it to have this nice even density when it's done we'll do that again even if you're only having two or three more strokes to go if you feel your hands getting tacky at all that's all you have to do you want to remember the tacky hands lead to a ripped surface and above all we want to avoid that ripped surface that'll always be considered a defect this is kind of the speed for cameras not for production what I just did was probably slowed down about 50% so if you're in production you'll try to get the same results again without having any harmful effects on the dough but in a much quicker manner than this dough is fairly relaxed and it should be relaxed enough for me to turn it into a baguette this is of course the one that started as a cylinder the seams are presently down once again I'll put the seams up Pat out the gas and if you're starting from a blunt your shaping is probably going to be a little bit different not necessarily faster or cleaner but it'll be a little different because you're already starting with this elongated shape so I'm just simply going to walk this down layer after layer until I get all the way down at the bottom I've made a pretty taut seam down there and now I'll put one hand in the center of the loaf and it's important to keep your fingertips and the heel of your hand on the workbench so it's a very very soft hand it's hard to quantify exactly how soft your hand is the way I describe it when I teach is think of the person you love the most and you just went over and you put your hand on their forearm how are you going to have that hand on their forum it's going to be gentle but at the same time there's going to be an affirmation in it and that's how we want to touch this dough I've made this little divot here and then you can hear my hands make noise on the bench because they've remained on the bench the whole time and I've rolled this out and when it's proper length which this looks pretty good and it's a proper cylindrical shape I'll call it done there's my seam you've got two options you can put your seams down or many people put their seams up which is how we do it at the King Arthur bakery this is usually the way I teach people to do it because particularly when you're starting out it's a good way to get a well-made baguette that has good structure to it and should have pretty good results coming out of the oven these are now ones that we appreciate round instead of cylindrical and we'll just start by pulling on them so they almost look like the cylindrical ones did first we just give a gentle patting and then we fold about a third of it towards us turn it around repeat after that second turning it's kind of like a business letter this should be about three to four inches wide at this point now I'm going to start this process of folding the dough and pressing folding and pressing and I'll walk my hands all the way down the length of the loaf and I'm doing it the way a lefty does so if you're a righty you'll start with your left hand on the right side of the loaf but I'm a lefty so I'm going to start with my right hand on the left side of the loaf my fingers are buried behind the loaf and my thumb is on the top surface and I'm simply going to bury my thumb by flipping my fingers over now I can't see my thumb but I can see my fingers and then my left hand comes along and just Pat's that little pot walk down the loaf and fold and press fold and press fold and press all the way down so I've just a sense you worked up this portion of the loaf and I've left a pretty visible lip here of about an inch that's important now I'll turn it around and I'll do the same exact thing but this time instead of having a lip I'm going to take the seam right to the bench so again I start in the same manner one two three four and walk your hands all the way down okay and now I've got my basic shape and I finish it the same way I did with the blunt one okay so that should give you a nice well-proportioned but get with good structure to it you can learn three shapes you'll be able to shape just about everything I think so its batard baguette and bull the round loaf that we shape so the basic form for me for batard it starts off the same team side is up seam side is always up seam side as always the interior of the loaf so ID gas them a little bit and then I start with a shape that is more sort of north-south than east-west the baguette was going to go this away the petard will go out also but the petard ends up with a nice belly so I start with a sort of nice north-south shape about two-thirds of the way down and seal and I bring the shoulders always calling the shoulders then you bring what I call the head down and seal so as I'm rolling this loaf I'm grabbing very small amounts of dough with my thumbs and I'm rolling against the bench to really try and create some surface tension on the exterior of the loaf it's really going to make a big difference in the shaping and its really going to translate through to the bake in terms of giving this loaf the strength that it needs to really gain volume when it hits the deck of the oven you can see that the seam is here straight line so at this point I'm just going to take it down just a tiny bit and then my hands moving sort of up and down and side to side or east-west just a little bit and we do these seam up same thing as if I get okay so one one more of these so I start with a little bit of a narrow shape I come 2/3 the way down I seal shoulders what I call the head down you can add one more step here if it feels like this one is just a little bit ragged on the edges it's not quite as symmetrical as I want at this point so I'm going to bring these in and now if I start and I'll stop again I've got a pretty square shape squarish I need a little bit of flour so I turn it over you you", "n0U8RdRdFDU": "[Music] the can tink of French bread or artisan breads or I'm taking our baguettes so we're gonna show you how easy it is to make so know this recipe is a little bit different it does take some time but it's all about building flavor so it actually takes a couple of days to actually make this dough from start to finish which I know seems a little bit daunting but I promise you the results are so so worth it so what's a little bit different here with this bread recipe is what we're gonna be making what we call a pre fermented dough so basically it's a dough that's made in advance of our main dough which we allow to ferment so how to maximize flavor and then that's what that Dolby uses the base of which will build our final dough so firstly just to get a little proof minted dog started we're using simply 450 grams of strong flour but a half a teaspoon but 7 grams of salt simply mix that straight in we're adding 245 mils of water and we're simply gonna take about 5 grams of fresh yeast so this is fresh yeast I don't know if you've ever used it or ever seen it but don't get too hung up over fresh versus dried a lot of a kind of comes down to what your backs to and tradition fresh he's lonely keep about two to three weeks you keep in your fridge unlike dried yeast which is kind of much more in line with the home baker and you keep for several months but also dried you so much more concentrated so we tend to use less of it generally the ratio is about 3 is to 1 so if you use about 20 grams of fresh it'd be about 7 grams of dried but at these small levels that were working at or only 500 grams of our easiest ratio is just to go off for about 2 to 1 so we're using 5 grams of fresh so simply your obably just looking at about a generous pinch of dried yeast is all we need it's just enough to get our dough working and that is it that's all it is for our proof minted oh so we're simply to combine in all our ingredients together so then once the dough roughly comes together simply just dump it straight out onto the table so what you want to do at this point is you want to knead our dough so I'm like kind of most bread recipes where you could find ourselves needing here for the next 8 10 minutes we're simply just doing enough just to bring it over roughly together because at that point we're simply is gonna pop it straight in the fridge and it's gonna sit there overnight for at least 12 to 24 hour so the idea is at a cooler temperature the East will still continue to work it's going to develop loads and loads of flavor within our dough and we're simply going to use this dough as the base denim which every gets are gonna be based because what we say the longer you prove it the better there is a limit to how long you can ferment your dough for and to lose a strand and break down so that's why we look at ways in which we can build flavor so be a true preformance you use a likes of starter cultures or polishes and with this one we're using a pre fermented dough just a minute or so that's all we need and at this point then the taker dose gonna pop it into a bowl into a fridge and the same happy sit there for at least 24 hours [Music] this the exact same dough which we just left sitting in a fridge overnight so you can see how it's proven so it's this though then that we're gonna base our baguette a partner we've got 24 hours of flavor right here so now we're gonna build the next level of flavor so once again we're taking 500 grams of strong flare then we're increasing our salt a little bit here so we want a good 10 grams right in 300 mils of water and we're just adding 10 grams of fresh yeast and again if you're using just dried yeast just go with 5 grams is all you need that can be simply just crumbled straight in so to that though then we're adding all of our pre fermented dough you'll find it easier to incorporate into your dough if you break it up into smaller little pieces because if you just try knead it in one solid piece of dough you're gonna find it much harder like your thyroid OHS is all about time it's all about developing flavor too much things in our life were in a hurry for so if you can give your bread as much time as you can and realistically the amount of work you have to put in it's very very minimal like you saw with the first part of the recipe there's simply Dunedin of the Cree fermented dough you only probably took about two minutes in the fridge and leave it be it's just a little bit of planning that's all so we start to combine all our ingredients together you probably find is still a little bit harder to kind of work together just because we've got the the pre fermented dough in there so let's take a little bit it's to mix everything [Music] so wants to know roughly comes together simply it's going straight out onto her table and again already told a star to need working that flowerin working it all together so this dough it's going to give you about fifteen hundred grams worth of dough so it would each be get done at about 250 grams it's going to give us six I know my feel like it's to money for yourself that's why it's a great way to bake for friends family and actually did the door once it's bate who actually freeze very very well no problem whatsoever you can freeze the base baguette toward out at room temperature and simply then once it's toid i with dampen her you running tap popping it back into a hot oven at 190 degrees for about eight to ten minutes if I lie with the door to warm up warm right right to the center so the idea of the moisture by wetting the bread stops the dough from drying out dry as the moisture off and it'll crisp up like today a commodity oven so it's a great way you can pop a few in the freezer bake here we get once a week you have fresh bread every day so you will find you don't might be low if it's off a little bit sticky resist that temptation to add flare but if we keep adding flour the dough will quite happy soak it up and your door just becomes heavier and heavier and tighter and tighter so we want to soft loose dough so you can use one hand you can use two hands whatever you want if you ever want to know the secret to firm arms knead bread and this is what makes bread fat free but only if you make it yourself he's usually dough scraper bring it back together and keep working at all so you'll be looking at approximately about eight minutes for the dough to come together and develop fully thing is it's very difficult for recipe to be exact some people are stronger than others some days you're just tired so the dough will always tell you when it's ready so there's a thing called the windowpane effect so you should better stretch your dough so there's virtually suit you and I should be on a sustained it's always but without ripping and without tearing so simply just slowly stretching the dough I work it out you can see is getting there it's getting like the elastic but it's just a grid just aerated here and that's just the don't tell me it's not ready so I needs a little bit more work so continue to need if you do have a mixer feel free to use it the dough hooks gonna do exactly the same thing that your hands are doing personally I like to get my hands in there play to get stuck in allows you to get a feel and an understanding for the dough or dough it's just there now all come together so it comes to testing you know again a little bit of oil on your hands it makes it all much easier to handle too easy to manipulate and as well as having firm arms you can have lovely soft hands so when you're testing your dough cut off a decent piece and when you test it don't just kind of come out here to the edge in credit or is the center and you're slowly nice and gently what can you do when side to side use and head of its own way to stretch it so as you can see it it's lovely elastics the lights almost kind of passing through it and there you are when we tried it was just ripping it was tearing and wasn't holding that's holding exactly now what we want and that's simply it so we're to still bring back together and the thing I love about this dough as this dough will hold perfectly in the fridge for up to 36 hours which means you can have the dough made we could take a little bit off this now pop with one side maybe bake off two or three baguettes put the rest in the fridge you could take a little bit more tomorrow bake fresh again and again the third day so really allows you to have fresh bread day after day ideally I'd take this dough pop in the fridge and again leaving it overnight so now we're going from day one we've had a pre fermented dough day - we've met our baguette though day three we're ready to bake so it's three days maximum flavor and I promise you it's so so worth it just cover that over in the fridge I want to leave it to prove for a minimum about 18 hours [Music] now here's a lovely baguette though it's been left fermenting last 18 hours it's gonna knock her dough back so well it simply is looking to knock the air for my dough what size reapportion - I do - will largely depend on how big your oven is and at no point overall in 30 inch baguettes not gonna fit into your oven so I see only fine for most kind domestic ovens at home about 250 grams it's a really nice portion I'm gonna give you a baguette this sort of length which will generally perfect for most domestic opens alone so important 250 grams so one more portion or adult everyone concerns from come from around bases and they're from around base we can manipulate it and change it any way we like so if you were trying to roll the baguette from start to finish in one go you're gonna find them much much harder because the dough will naturally want to shrink back so you're gonna find we do everything in stages we build it up with loud AK dunes relax it and you find yet to put a half amount of effort into your dough so once our dough has been shaped we just want to rotten roll them rough kind of rectangular shapes so it simply pop you don't over stretch your I'd rent one over the other and we fall into the center we go again took it back in on itself and I don't fall in the place of our baguette so taking each edge one on top the other let's pin it down all the way from you back into the center took it back in there on up again so what we want to do now is one to let it I don't rest we're gonna let us sit on the table for a good 10 to 15 minutes before we got to roll it again because you'll find at the door it's been worked quite a bit quite tight now to do this all pulling back in so by leaving at rest allows a glutton to relax and you want to find a very easy to stretch and roll so squeeze out on your table leave it be you can crack on clean up whatever you need to do but time you come back you don't gonna be ready to go so we're gonna give that 10-15 minutes we'll come back and then we'll give it its final [Music] so I door is nicely rested so you can even feel the dough compared to a couple minutes ago I've been trying to stretch it it's much much lighter it's looser so much more pliable and much easy to work so we've got the base ever began as it is so we kind of want to try to work with that natural shape seems folding over just about and a half inch or so just seed it down we go again finally third time roll up as it ideas were applying pressure so I was one hand off the other playing pressure working from the center all the way out from the center all that so a lot of people kind of when they're rolling that they're going great get towards the end and then it's a coin so don't be afraid to use the space and then to get over the pointy edges said your hands roll off the edge so began send traditionally to proved in linen cloth material called Koosh which in French means sleep because basically better guess it's going to sleep so we popped it baguette into our sauce upside down so kind of accident like a proven basket I don't worry about a sourdough so y'all sit side by side instead of proving out till I'll prove up so again when you're rolling them don't be ready to use the space just kind of decide you ate everything get the whole piece of dough moving one hand slides off the other bit of pressure from the center all the way out from the center all the way out it's basically kind of just ignore the dough that's all it is so from the fridge once the dough has been portioned allow it to rest 10-15 minutes if you can and once rolled it will be ready to bake within an hour and a half [Music] [Music] there is any access to drive it overtook them in relief against the proof [Music] so I forget sigh ready to go they've proved doing nicely nice little bounce to them so the ideas we won't everyone approved about 90 percent the ideas that last 10 love comedy oven karlie oven spring so the idea is the door will hit the heat it's gonna jump it's gonna bounce in the oven and also I need to physically picked him up so I pick them up and transfer them onto my tray so when it comes to getting a baguette out we see me just roll a forward release it and then transfer it straight onto our tray simply just pop your fingers in because you're not just pulling from here because if you do you kind of drag this one with you just pop your fingers underneath rolling from the floor and it's on to our tray fingers underneath roll em out it's straight territory and don't worry you can always kind of tighten them up a little bit when they're on the tray nice and gently so then the last thing to do to have a guess before they go into the oven is we need to score them again a lot of people when just kind of scoring baguette because of the way it looks as it's finished their tendencies cut straight across the dough what we're looking for is almost straight lines each one just offsets the next it's gonna look like an ear of wheat and then the next one starts just behind basically aim to do a straight line because you won't do a straight line you know doing a crooked annoys and you'll get the exact angle that we want again nice and quick it's incompetent so when we're cutting our dogs or we're screwing our breads we use a razor blade as opposed to say using their life because it's just razor sharp cuts cleanly and when your users things most important to remember it's not a bread knife you have to be nice and confident and you need to slash nice quick compliments and it works absolutely great so our breads are ready to load into Robin its preheated to 240 degrees now we're very lucky with these ovens are actually fitted with steams that actually release steam into our oven because the idea being for the first about 10 minutes of your bake you dough is still rising within the oven and if you have a really dry heat what often happens is the cross tends to form but the dough has to finish rise and so wants to rise but I can't break through the surface so it'll often happen is you'll tend to find that the crust feels over stops the dough from rising so you don't get the same you could have got steamed is quite important if your others are fitted with steamed pan you're not lucky enough to have that simply just a roasting tray preheated into the base of the oven and he cans pour in a boiling kettle or a splash of hot water but you release a blast of steam into your oven so we're straight in [Music] and they're gonna bake for about 20 minutes because we only about 250 grams I said I'm gonna bake it high and fast now a baguette had their full break so you can Peter they'll be light beautiful crisp lovely rustic baguettes and you can actually you can actually hear them sing just as you come out of the oven you're hearing on crack you're in a break so three days in the making I know it seems like a lot but believe me that's what every a little bit all out there it's favor use the thin crisp crust give this recipe a try promise you won't be disappointed [Music] you", "4yp8UhNnj-w": "[Music] that's great so to get better flavor in our bread what we can do is add a preterm it so this pressure meant that I'm making food today is called we call foolish I've got 0.1% use because I'm creaming it for 18 hours and then I add equal quantities of water to flour so this is five hundred mils of liquids and because this is a wet so we can then just mix by hands so just mix it until all the lumps have been incorporated so now this fits for 18 hours at 18 degrees tomorrow when we come to make our bread it gets incorporated with the rest of our flour the rest of our salt and the rest of our water and then we can go to the process of making our dough so with the dried yeast active mold salt and baker's flour five minutes on Thursday keep wondering it's on second speed all right what we need to do now is a window test so what we're doing is we're assessing the gluten structure within the dough so what we're looking for is how far we can stretch it and how clear the dough becomes so that gives me a good stretch but it's still a little bit cloudy so that's around about 75% gluten development [Music] [Music] so I left in a fold the lift in the fold is done two three three purposes it redistributes the heat in within the dough it puts the yeast back in contact with a food source any delay as the gluten so we build a gluten structure with inside [Music] you [Music] you so we're now after shaping our final final shaping a baguette so what we do is I we get our dough placed on the bench give it a light pat down getting our top edge and folding it down and sealing three-quarters of the way down the dough and pick up the dough spin it around and then do the same action but this time we're going to bring it all the way down and feel it on the bench once we've done that we then go into a stage where we try to build tension in the dough so just molding from underneath pushing away and pulling towards you just to build the strength in the dough surface and then into our final shape around about 45 to 50 centimeters long and then we play in a Koosh ready for its final party [Music] you [Music] but what you do so most people will do this so all your hand movements come from underneath so what happens is you push the dole away from you but the dough actually moves that surface moves back against and that's helped build tension in the dough we don't get tension the dough you can't capture the casts being produced by the yeast to never mold your dough from the surface always mold from underneath [Music] you so once the dough has had its final proof we need to check to make sure it's ready to go in the oven and we do that by doing the press test so when our fingerprint user only bounces back half way and still leaves a small impression it's ready to go in if I press it and there's no movement and it stays compressed it's over proof you could bounce us all the way back needs a little bit more time and it's slightly under proved we're going to bake these on the sole of the oven or floor of the oven so need to take it from my Koosh onto my wooden boards getting them ready to school make sure you leave yourself plenty of space in between your meget for allow for expansion but also to put allows the proper time so when scoring make sure the cup stay in the middle of the leggett your blade is only round about a thirty degree angle and you then go down slash generally product assistance the scoring of the day gives us our final shape but it also tells the dough where to crack if we don't the dough tends to crack wherever it wants to so if I getting paid to the reason behind temperature we're baking at 260 degrees little baking around about 22 minutes and we give the product about three seconds worth of steam that steam allows that they get to expand with that before setting its crust and gives us those beautiful ears hopefully that will create by doing that undercut in the score so as we watch they should expand cut which is called oven kick and then we should get some beautiful colors being created on the crust if you're at home obviously you don't have these ovens so you want to turn your oven up as high as it can go we round about the 250 degree mark and if you bake on a stone a pizza stone or a an oven stone gives you a better result even if you don't have the stone place your bread on to a hot tray have your trail already in the oven and then all you do is you get a pan and you fill it full of untreated chain-link and then you place a few ice blocks on the chain and it will melt and create the steam steam needs to be in the chamber for about the first five minutes of the baking process but internally our bread needs to be over 93 degrees 93 degrees all enzyme activity six or yeast is dead and all starch has been fully gelatinize at this point is the flu based locally we have a look at the craft color we've got the three colors that we're looking for we've got the yellow the golden brown and the burnished this all gives us better flavor in our bread [Music]", "Rp394a6NBfU": "[Music] all right so the baguette dough has fermented for a total of two hours with a turn at one hour and so now we're going to divide the dough and so we're going to lightly dust our surface scrape the dough out onto our surface and so I'm going to shape this dough into two different shapes I'm going to show you how to shape up traditional French baguette and then I'm going to show you how to shape demi baguettes which are smaller about half the size and fit more easily into your oven at home so for the French baguette I'm going to divide the dough into three hundred gram pieces and for the deme baguettes I'm going to use half that way so I'm going to divide it into 150 gram pieces [Music] you can always eyeball this but for me as a baker weight really matters both when you're scaling out your recipe just in terms of consistency and then also when you're dividing so things look more consistent if you find yourself making the same sourdough recipe or the same baguette dough recipe and you've become so comfortable with it that you can just sort of eyeball the weights of things and you know what the dough feels like then by all means you don't need to weigh anything out but for me consistency is really important and so I always weigh everything out from the ingredients to the the scaling of the dough right before I shape it great all right so when I'm dividing now that these are divided I'm going to appreciate them and pre shaping is the step right before shaping and you're pre shaping so that you can get an even and consistent final shape that's all so if you're shaping it into a ball you do really don't need to do a pre shape but when you're shaping it into a long baguette you want that baguette to be even and so you want to do some type of pre shape so that the final shape is even so the first thing I do is I take a breadboard here and you could also use your kitchen counter or just something that you can flower and let the bread sit on it for about 15 to 20 minutes so I'm just going over the board with some flour and now I'm going to take my baguette piece and I'm going to roll it up like I'm making a log and that's all that I'm doing with this pre shape as I'm rolling it up and I'm making a log and that will become my final baguette shape I'm not putting a lot of tension on this although you could but I'm just rolling it out just so it's nice and even now for the demi baguettes my pre shape is around and so I'm going to round this dough and so again I am flowering my hands because this is a little sticky that's okay I'm going to take against the surface that I'm working on instead of round and use that friction to create a nice all and I'm going to work two at a time and then these balls are going to rest along with the baguette oblongs for about 20 minutes and we're letting them rest because we want the gluten to relax and you might find as a beginning baker that your dough is already soft enough or relaxed enough for you to shape it into a baguette and that's great really for a professional Baker who puts a lot of tension in the dough you need to let that gluten relax before you can do the final shape the rolling here for example is really working the gluten and so if I tried to shape this into something else right now I wouldn't be able to so I need to let it relax [Music] so that's dividing and pre shaping baguette toe we're going to let this relax and we'll come back to it in about 20 minutes so I'm going to show you how to shape a baguette and then I'm going to show you how to shape Demi baguettes so I've moved all of my pieces of dough onto my board so I would have some more space but you don't necessarily need to I've got myself set up so I've got a row of flour right in front of me I've got my workspace where I'm going to shape my baguette I've got my bench knife which is really important in shaping and then I've got what is called a Koosh which is a French word it's a verb it means coucher which means to sleep and basically I've rolled this couch up and I'm going to proof my baguette on this couch and it's just going to sort of let my bread proof and rest and it sort of helps support my bread so it doesn't go slack when it's proofing so I've got my couch set up right over here on a board this couch is about 26 inches long you could easily substitute this is a linen kitchen towel and it's somewhat sturdy and this is an easy easy substitute if you aren't able to find the linen available so I'm going to start shaping my baguette dough and the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to deflate it just a little bit with a little smack you don't have to really deflate it because we did knead it by hand and then I'm going to take a piece of my dough and I'm going to fold it over itself like I'm making a letter fold only this time I'm going to use my thumb in my hand and I'm going to push the dough forward sort of like you're pushing forward parallel to your work surface and that is going to create this little bit of tension like this and then from that point forward I'm going to roll and seal with the palm of my right hand and I'm going to roll see I'm rolling it and I'm sealing it I'm going to go back over it and I'm going to do it one more time and see that has formed a seam on the bottom and so at this point I have my initial shape I'm going to roll my baguette out I'm going to flour on my hands a little bit so it doesn't stick to me and just start in the center and I'm going to work in the center and I'm going to work my way out so start in the center and then work your way out like that and so that is a shaped baguette I'm going to put a little flour down on my couch so the baguette doesn't stick to it I'm going to make sure that the seam is on the bottom of the couch and then I'm just going to fold the couch up just a little bit like that and now I have a spot for my next baguette and so this next baguette I'm going to shape faster so you can see what it looks like in sort of like real time so deflate fold over and out and then seal and then roll it out and the rolling out is really helping to even it out too and then you're going to just put it in the flour put it on the couch and then fold the couch up and now to shape the deme baguettes these are rounds and so the way I shape these is first I deflate it a little bit then I make a letter fold like this and then I'm going to bring the two top ends of my rectangle down to the center to form a triangle and then I'm going to take the top of that triangle down and now I'm going to just sort of roll it out and as I roll it out I'm going to taper the ends and then I'm going to dip it in the flour and then I'm going to make sure that I dust this a little bit I'm going to put my dummy baguettes right here and deme baguettes are a great way when you don't have a lot of space in your home bread oven if the baguette isn't going to fit like these will be a tight fit in this bread oven but you can easily fit multiple demi baguettes in your bread oven so I'm going to do a letter fold then I'm going to bring the two top corners down to make a triangle I'm going to take the top down all the way to the bottom and then I'm going to roll it out and I'm going to taper the ends and bring my Koosh up a little bit I'm going to keep going okay this is the last time you baguette I'm going to quickly shape it I'm going to put it on the flowered couch and then what I like to do sometimes if I have a little extra fabric is I like to sort of pull the fabric over the bread to sort of keep it from drying out and prevent a skin from forming on it so we're going to let this dough proof for about 30 to 45 minutes [Music]", "fXygPl8SlPg": "- These are the 10 things\nyou should be buying at Trader Joe's in March, 2021. Welcome back to the it's, I dunno why I said 2021,\nit was such a slouse. It's not like this is an amazing year yet, but it is on my YouTube channel. Thanks to all of you guys watching. Welcome back on the YouTube\ndeal guy Matt Granite. Today's video is gonna take you\ninside my local Trader Joe's from shampoo that you might\nnot have ever considered buying from TJs, to tiny avocados\nand their purpose in my world, Pretzel bagels. Plus why I grew very angry at Trader Joe's while filming this video I'm gonna expose it all right here. This video is not sponsored in any way. If you do like this content please give this video a thumbs up, Aloha. That was weird, right? You didn't know why I did that, but the first product is\na Aloha Pull Apart Roll, or as they call them the\nSweet Pull Apart Aloha Rolls which are reminiscent of some of the, I don't even know how to explain it. It's like if you try to,\nsticky button meets Aloha roll I don't even know how to explain it but Aloha is the way to go as a great decadent\nbakery item that I would I've never anticipated, enjoying so much. Highly popular with my family and the first item on this list. Now I did mention Aloha Rolls, but if you're looking to\nroll with it a bit more, wait till you see what\nI got a number three, and no it's not bread. And then number two spot,\na perfect snack meet, it's decadent dessert meets Peanut Butter Filled Milk Chocolate Peanuts, walk with me for a moment here. Peanut Butter Filled\nMilk Chocolate Peanuts, and the reason I say dessert\nis you can actually bake with this, really build upon\nthis incredible delicious base but the milk chocolate\nquality, phenomenal. And then the crispy peanut butter. This goes beyond that craft\npeanut butter type taste which I do like, but this would be more of a higher end peanut\nbutter textured. Just superb. How do I explain it? Like eating heaven in your mouth. So good. I really do enjoy that. The third product on\nthis list is not edible. And then I'm gonna get to the one that made me angry in a moment. But these rollers, Aloha rolls,\nnot that this is a roller. So witty, not at all this\nvideo's falling apart quickly but thank you for making it this far. I've got more great items to show you by the way, the Mood Odyssey very popular in Instagram, favorite. Knew this month, to my\nknowledge at Trader Joe's with some different potentially a way to help you de-stress. So many different ways\nthat you can use it, but I am flagging this to let you know that it is a third of the price compared to what you would see somewhere else. And Trader Joe's is definitely\nnot compromising on quality, but that doesn't mean I'm not\nharboring some hatred today. When I set out to shoot this video I was so excited to show\nyou the trending items the delicious items, part\nof this Trader Joe's hall is allowing you guys to not\nonly work up an appetite but highlight items that\nare also good bargains. And in the number four spot, it was promised to be an item\navailable at Trader Joe's but it is not available till mid-March. And what I am talking about it's the Australian-Style\nChocolate Ice Creme and Sandwich. I say creme,\nbecause it's not cream. It's not actually ice\ncream and it's modeled off this hugely popular world,\nfamous Australian dessert that I actually didn't\nknow anything about it. And then I was reading the blogs these little fun Instagram things. And I went in thinking,\nI'd be able to buy it. The store associates who\nare nice, despite my anger, sadness, and social isolation,\nwhich is not their fault told me that this would\nbe available by mid April. And for any of the items that\nI am showing you on this list if you get excited about something it does differ regionally,\nboth in terms of price which is why I'm not\nmentioning too many prices for this video and availability. So there's your disclaimer, a\nlittle bit late in the game. In the number five spot,\nactually, that'd be 10. If you move your hand out twice, so it's like a weird stop sign\nthat I didn't intend to do. But the Shepherd's Pie Steak Bites, a phenomenal find and\none of the most unique, my sister lives in London, England. So she went to school there\nand kind of never came back. But she still apparently loves me, and the rest of her family. This would be something\nwhere I could have that, oh, to where she resides right now. But more importantly, if\nyou guys are unfamiliar with how Trader Joe's operates they typically target the source of the most popular\ningredient to make a lot of their awesome concoctions, specifically the more cultural items. So if you see like a butter chicken dish that you absolutely love chances are someone at\nTrader Joe's got in touch with the top buttered chicken\nproducers somewhere in India. And that is now somehow\ninterwoven into the product. So they replicate a\nlot of the ingredients. That's why everything tastes so good. This Shepherd's Pie tastes specifically like something you would get in a British pub and it is phenomenal. All right, And in the number six spot, something that is small in size, but big in impact and\nunique, Teeny Tiny Avocados. So why am I mentioning\nTeeny Tiny Avocados? Well, we all know that avocados often go bad\nbefore we can consume them. And some of the larger avocados take a little bit longer to ripen. And you're often stuck with all sorts of avocado issues specifically\nfor the bags of avocados which just seem to not work\nout that well for a lot of us. Avocado was my daughter's\nfirst favorite food. She ate it as a baby. She actually has this babe,\nwhich I've kept which says, \"I know guac is extra.\" Very cool. And when we are making\nguacamole or integrating this into Cobb salad, there's\nso many different things. The Teeny Tiny Avocados are\nalmost always perfectly ripe, when we buy them. They don't go bad as quickly\nfor whatever reason that is. And there's just the right amount of size. So I don't have to discard anything after and I just like it. So that's why it's in the number six spot. Before I get to a Blood Orange Cake, or these reduced guilt meals which I'm gonna want your\nopinion on in a moment. Let's bring on the guilt\nand the deliciousness in the number seven spot. It's a Mac and Cheese Bowl. Unlike anything I have ever sampled. It is a Pepperoni Pizza, Mac\nand Cheese Bowl, spectacular. Perfectly seasoned, I love the\nway this all comes together. This was actually\nreleased as a Trader's Joe find in late February. But the problem was, it was so popular and not rolled out as quickly\nas I would have expected. It was nearly impossible to\nfind in the month of February which was why I am now flagging this as a March option that should be available at your local Trader Joe's. In the number eight spot, before I get to something my wife loves\nthat I don't understand, Pretzel Bagels. Oh yes. It's a bagel plus a\npretzel and equals awesome. I should have done a much\nbetter job articulating that but I think you guys can hear\nmy hunger and my excitement. I get goosebumps on my belly\nwhen I talk about this. This is a phenomenal,\npossibly one of those. If I were on an Island and I\ncould only eat one food item and it had to be a pastry, it\nmight not be that Aloha roll. It might actually be the pretzel deal. I don't know, I can't make up my mind, but if you guys are not\nyet aware of the everything but the bagel seasoning.\nIt's a very popular staple at Trader Joe's and they weave\nthat into different products. This is not that, but it does build upon that their strength\nwith bagel related items. And I love this in the number eight spot. In the number nine spot,\nTrader Joe's Dry Shampoo. Let me be very upfront with you. I do not understand Dry Shampoo. When I go into the shower\nand my hair is wet. I put shampoo in there. I don't understand why you\nwould use this when it's dry. And I know I might sound like an angry old man\nand not a 36 year old. When I talk about Trader\nJoe's Dry Shampoo. But it, it does make me a little bit angry cause I don't understand it. Meanwhile, though, my wife loves it. She puts it into her\nhair and she looks hot. So I don't understand what\nI'm complaining about. It's a premium item that you can buy at Trader Joe's that isn't\nfood related, which is why it's on this list, but it is\navailable this March. It's a well reviewed\nitem. It's very popular. And I guess it doesn't\naffect me personally in terms of my use, but\nit's not all about me. It's about you guys. So leave a comment. If you use Dry Shampoo or you\nwanna better explain it to me. I would love to listen. In the number 10 spot. It's a pizza item that's waiting to get personalized by you. And then I will jump\ninto some bonus items. But the new pre cooked Pizza Crust where you can just add your\nown toppings, a fantastic delicious find at Trader Joe's. And I will tell you compared\nto some of the Uber Eats and DoorDash orders I've\nhad that have gone wrong. And just how popular pizza\nhappens to be in my household. Not only is this a time-saver but also a money saver and\nit secured number 10 spot on the 10 things you should be buying at Trader Joe's in March, 2021. I'm now for the bonus items. I'm gonna move through these quickly. So get your shopping lists ready. First item, a Blood Orange Cake, moist, delicious, kind of tastes\nlike grandma used to make. If you had a grandma that\nactually made blood orange cakes I have two wonderful grandmas but neither of them\nmakes blood orange cakes. So I might buy this for them and ask them one day to make it, or maybe I should just learn it myself and stop relying upon other people. In the number two spot for the\nbonus items, Coconut Shrimp neither of my grandmas make this either. But I will tell you, I\ndid a recipe recently and it was disgusting. Buying this from Trader Joe's a much better\ngrab both in terms of costs, the shrimp size, divine ready\nto rock beautiful seasoning. I'd now like all of your\nopinions on the reduced guilt, or guilt free offerings that you can find from the meal selection at Trader Joe's. I heard this for the first time. I was like, what, what\nis a reduced guilt meal? And then I learned, well,\nit's for people where your new year's resolution\nmight've been to eat more healthy and it got derailed. And you've given up on\ngoing to the gym altogether. I'm gonna work on that, don't worry. And you want something that tastes good, but is also not going to impact\nyour waistline too heavily. So that's what that is. I guess my question is do you want to know that\nwhen you're shopping does that make the item\nfeel less delicious to you? Or are you excited? I'm going to hold my personal interjection and let you guys weigh\nin, in the comment section but there is a great selection\nof reduced guilt meals. Now bring on the guilt and\nbring on the Pulled Pork. I was enjoying the new Cured\nHam offerings available in March at Trader Joe's,\nbut their Pulled Pork second to none, unless my eyes deceive me. I actually think the Pulled\nPork offerings are repackaged or new and the flavor\nabsolutely fantastic. The next bonus is a burrito. And then I'm gonna wrap it up with two awesome dessert\nofferings. The Chicken Burritos $2 and 99 cents available\nat all Trader Joe's at the time that I am\nactually uploading this video. They are very satisfying,\nthe perfect late night snack. And actually, if you guys enjoy fast food. I did a video of the top fast food hacks that I recently uploaded on this channel. You're welcome to check that out. That was new for this year. And I did talk about burritos in there. All right, enough of the self plugs, let's move to the Mini French Baguettes. They are delectable, they're buttery, they taste legit, both\nin terms of texture. Even smell like something,\nthat might be Parisian. I don't really know. I've not eaten a baguette\nin Paris, but if you have maybe you would like this. There are many, and\nalso in terms of price. And finally for the grand\nfinale, the final bonus item the Mini baguette, don't know if you have ever wanted\nto try one of these. My daughter is obsessed with these and for my wife and I, it's\nreminiscent of those treats they used to hand out on airplanes. In what feels like a different lifetime. And I don't know, I think\nthey're, they're tasty. So there you go, that's my\nfull list of the top 10 things you should be buying at\nTrader Joe's in March. I realized there was a little\nbit of personal opinion in there, but if anyone\nelse has some other finds please leave me a comment. I do read through them. They help boost and sometimes\nlower my self esteem, but I'd love to incorporate\nother opinions that you have into future videos. You guys all make me better at what I do. So thank you.

Bye bye.", "XfNC6prB5PQ": "Another day has begun. I think someone sprayed dust and disappeared again today. And where does all this hair come from? I cleaned the house yesterday for sure, \ud83d\ude05 but it feels like I'm doing it all over again. The weather's really nice today. Days like this make me want to go travelling. Without any plans or concerns, I simply want to get on a train. Something that isn't a big of a deal, but needs determination. Arranging the cords. \ud83e\udd28 The more I put it off, the more tangled it gets. Something that needs even bigger determination. Washing the curtains. \ud83e\udd14 But I can still manage. \ud83d\ude01 Have you ever taken the vacuum cleaner apart? It makes you feel so good inside. Today I'm going to talk about boring housekeeping business. They put you in a never-ending cycle. That's why they're so hard. You want to enjoy the process but that's not easy as it sounds. Green onions have become real pricey these days. I should start growing them myself. \ud83d\ude06 Get rid of its moisture with a paper towel, and you'll be able to keep it fresh for longer. Just do this once a month. Will this make housekeeping a little easier? We don't want the process to be too hard. If you roll the bacon strips in paper foil, it's easier to use them one by one.

Sorry, broccoli. \ud83d\ude14 Sesame oil, crushed garlic, salt, and sesame seeds. Before, I never understood people who liked cooking. I always thought it was a hassle.

bowl i've got 150 grams of room temperature water 3 grams of dried yeast and 150 grams of white flour and that's got a protein content of 13 i'm gonna mix this together with a bowl scraper you could use a spoon but the key is not to worry about getting the dough smooth at this point the thyme in the fridge is going to take care of that the measurements for this recipe are exact so i'd advise weighing in grams but for anyone who isn't familiar with this measurement i'll leave the volumes for the ingredients in the description box below now this just needs to be covered and popped in the fridge for anywhere between 12 to 18 hours the series of extended proofs we're going to give it in the fridge are going to give great color great texture and great flavor so here we are the next day and as we can see the poolish has fermented really well it's nice and bubbly and very active so now we can mix the final dough before again letting that rest in the fridge so i'm adding 220 grams of room temperature water to the bowl and that's going to help the poolish release sprinkle on 13 and a half grams of sea salt and 4 grams of dried yeast i'm going to add this to a bigger container as we need to make sure this can expand overnight in the fridge without creeping out of our bowl give this a quick mix together to disperse the salt and the yeast and then add in 380 grams of white flour again this has 13 protein content give the ingredients a good working together either in the bowl or on a work surface if it's easier the aim of the game is to incorporate the wet and the dry ingredients together cover the container and leave out at room temp for 30 minutes and my kitchen is 20 degrees celsius today that's 68 degrees fahrenheit come back and give it a quick two minute workout just to make sure there are no lumps we're not looking for a silky smooth dough here the next slow proof in the fridge is going to produce a really smooth and elastic dough so now just cover it pop it in the fridge for another 12 to 18 hours right here we are the next day and as you can see the dough has proved really well in the fridge overnight now this has come straight out from the fridge it's still cold and i'm going to tip it straight out onto the work surface then gently bring each side of the dough up and over itself and form it into a ball i actually proved a double quantity of this in the end so i could make some pizza tonight so i'll divide it into two so that i'm working with the same amount as the quantity in my recipe and if anyone would like to see the pizza recipe let me know in the comments now you should have about 900 ish grams of dough and this recipe makes four baguettes that are about 35 to 40 centimeters long weigh your dough out into four pieces which should be about 220 grams each now first we'll ball each piece up and we'll leave it to rest for a good 20 minutes covered at room temperature and this will allow the dough to relax and begin to come back to room temperature i've used a small drizzle of olive oil in each one of these baking trays just to stop the dough balls sticking working with two of the dough balls at a time will give you a little more room in your kitchen but of course if you've got the space then you could shape all four at once but just make sure they'll all fit in your oven lightly dust the work surface and shape the dough ball into a short sausage by gently rolling over the dough and pinching down the seam i'm not squeezing out the gases i'm trying to keep them encased in the dough as i roll and press repeat with both pieces and cover with a cloth and then leave for 10 minutes to rest out of room temperature the rest is really important as it will allow the dough to relax and make the next shaping process really easy and finally we'll repeat the same shaping process again making sure we seal the dough from tip to tip the dough will naturally extend while you do this and again be careful not to push out those gases now let's gently roll out the baguette to get an even size and to taper off the ends working from the center of the baguette gently roll your hands forwards and backwards and slowly extend them outwards once you reach the very end you can apply a bit more pressure and roll out the tips now baguettes are traditionally proofed on a couch a cloth used for baking but you can substitute this for a tea towel that's been well dusted with flour but here i'll show you how to proof them on baking paper i'm going to bake these on my baking steel and i've added a baking tray to the bottom of the oven and inside is a non-coated stainless steel chain this is preheated in the oven along with the baking steel for one hour at 250 degrees celsius that's 485 degrees fahrenheit i'll use the chain and baking tray combination to create steam but you could use a preheated baking tray in the bottom of the oven if you don't have a baking steel or a stone then you could proof these on a baking tray and then slide that straight into the oven to bake but i find i get a little bit better oven spring when baking on a steel or a stone now cover with a cloth and leave those baguettes to proof for about 45 minutes this will depend on the temperature of your kitchen and while these are proofing you can begin the shaping process on the last two pieces of dough test the dough by gently pushing it with your finger the baguettes are ready to bake when the dough slowly pushes back out it should feel gassy but still strong now as these haven't been proved on a floured couch i'll give the exterior a quick flour and gently brush it that'll give a really nice color contrast when baked right now it's time to score imagine two parallel lines running down the center of the baguette about one centimeter apart hold your blade at an angle and not straight this is going to help with the ear of the bread opening up now don't score an angle across the baguette score almost in a straight line working from the right side of the imaginary parallel lines to the left start the next cut just above the previous one and so on now using a peel or something flat slide the baguettes into the preheated oven give the top a quick mist and gently throw two ice cubes into the steaming tray bake for 20 minutes or until you've got a deep dark color on the outside this produces the best crust in my opinion now your other two baguettes should be shaped proofed and ready to bake [Music] so a super simple little baguette recipe really easy takes a bit of time but really really worth the effort now if you make this and you post a pick up on instagram then don't forget to drop me a tag that's it i'd like to say a huge thank you for watching i'll see you again very soon stay tuned", "mdqV728E-ug": "[Music] what's up pop peeps in sugar I'll pop mine for 20 and we are back for another product review video before we get started popping so let's do our little thing that we call SML we need you to subscribe and while you're there I need you to hit that notification bell and also just like me because I'm pop mom and you guys already love me anyway so make sure you're going in that love but Ananya to guys today I know have been one like a total hiatus but maybe about a week or two now just because of the holiday break so I appreciate you guys hanging in there making sure you go to my videos as soon as they drop on leave Wednesdays I appreciate it I came back with something bigger this week guys I have Peck woods not to be confused with back woods this is tactless this is packwood's dot la is out of Los Angeles and I am so excited so be the proud owner of three of them I have all three pack words from LA they're now at planted 13 so you can get packwood's in nevada now at planted 13 so shout out to shot planted 13 that always hook me up with the latest that comes out I got all of these and Nevada from them they have an exclusive one called alien og so I'm excited I have all three so what I want to do today is just do a simple product review with you guys I will include all the links to Packwood's la comm so you guys can go in a site find out with new strands that they're coming up with but I'm just excited about the company so what they have done is infused rolling papers that look like blood papers and they're not they're a handmade hemp wrap paper that they put a vein into it to make it look like it was like an actual plant wrapper this guy's is special because they did three different infuse menteur this they have a concentrate in it they have a premium flower and then on outside they dust it with Keith so I don't even know how strong this is gonna be I don't I don't know how many puffs I'm gonna be able to get all I know is I'm gonna be a little out so I don't want you to judge me but we're gonna get into this I have three brands here this one is the alien OG hopefully you can see that this one is exclusive to Planet 13 once again shout out to them they are sold out maybe out of this one you guys have to call them and see this one is called GABA and this is a hybrid so is the alien og so both of these are hyper some remember hybrids want to keep you nice in the middle that way you can feel the head body high but not too high now this one the purple one is called purple punch and this one is an indica so today I'm not going to smoke Invicta I'm also not gonna smoke this particular hybrid Agathe I'm gonna go for the alien og because I am an alien and I want to get a shot off the plane 213 because this one was exclusive you might not see this one on the market I'm not sure so I wanted to kind of give my review to them as well what I thought of the one they made just for planting 13 customers so we're gonna get into this I'm gonna remove these two to the side so first of all I'm going to just talk about the packaging because you my peeps know when I do a product review I go there I go all the way there first of all I love that this can't break I do know they're going for $60 at the shop so they have $60 here in Nevada we can look up and see what they're going for Vegas but this is $60 so for $60 to Graham would concentrate premium flower and they keep one outside that does an amazing deal and I love that you can't break anything so you don't have to silver fragile because I mean your product is fragile but I love the date took the time to kind of like really design it where it's eye-catching as well and even if you see it inside of this place like it's playing 13 they have done the displays so beautifully so shout out to the pack was marketing team in LA y'all did that it also kind of reminds me in a weird way of a Kylie lipstick if y'all agree with me pop peeps just tell me that in the comment it really does it has that whole trippin thing on the side so this is really a good packaging I I'm impressed with packaging didn't even think that so you just roll it off it's a roll and I hope my camera can get to this so let me come up I want you guys to really see that when you first pull it out and you can really smell it the scent on this is I just love the smell okay so if you can see them holding my hand up you can see the key fits nicely dusted on it outside this part of it is a glass tip so it's gonna allow you to like kind of burn it evenly so you get a nice draw every time you pull that's what the glass tip is supposed to doing this is a nice sized glass citize I would say that's a couple of inches I don't know if you can see that real close up but that's like a two inch glass that's really nice to me it feels like if you had a mini cigar in a way so I kind of I love the feel of it it's nothing to it but to do it we're gonna get into it anything I like that's a blunt or the palm rolls or anything like that I like to light mines with the hemp I know this is a little piece of this is hemp rope I like to light it with that that way it gives me some type of control instead of letting my lighter control everything so that's how I'm gonna do it so choose the you pot peeps shot the Packwood's LA and let's get this alien og from shot planted 13 let's I like to inhale just to make sure I'm pulling everything I must say lighting getting I thought the pool would be happy they go be a lot heavier and it's not it's really smooth and I guess it has something to do with the glass tip now I can tell if you can tell I lit it wrong in here but it should have a nice even lip and because that keep us on the outside it shouldn't burn through fast that's what it shouldn't do if you find yourself in you lit it the wrong way just let it take its time and let they kind of like let it breathe and it'll evenly start to burn around so what I like is that you don't have to put the whole piece in your mouth it burns real light you can just put your mouth right on a tip just like my shirt be on the lookout for shop pop mom for 20 years oh I got that weed weird I like this a little dude not sure what premium flower I do know that the concentrate is nice and to keep this not even coming off on my hand I love that so let's talk a little more in depth about this back once I got my smoking hat on you know I've seen Rick Ross smoked this I've seen you waka flocka the baby little baby what's that other baby skittles baby I don't know one of them other babies they've all had this and now I'm hot moms at it I gotta do this I need a friend shout out to any of my papi friends that want to come share cuz I don't know if I'm gonna finish this this is this is a lot I might have this for the next couple days it's two grounds one person should have to finish this off seriously what did you say when you hi you just don't know what to say I guess you say that [ __ ] was good huh no I hate that y'all see me like this cuz I'm gonna be rolling I don't even know me get anything else doing this is too much this is probably not the best product reveiw to have done I'm super afraid of my life right now but this is nice you know what this would be great for like people that are having bachelor parties or bachelorette parties New Year's Christmas you can get them the people if you live in a legal state oh I can't move to this come to the East Coast Jesus [Music] Oh also Packwood's shout-out to y'all have made a collaboration with cocoanuts which some of the celebrities have teamed up to make these into like chocolate edibles kind of thing so check out backwoods la calm because they got a lot of interesting collaborations like they did a collaboration with planted 13 they're doing it with celebrities so shout out to them definitely gonna go to pack once when I go to LA cuz this is pretty cool in the light so stoned and how many puffs that I take I don't even know if somebody keep it count I wish somebody was here to play this is what they do to me pop beats they just leave me in a room with filming and just tell me to go for my own okay I'm really high seriously you don't think it too high he's just like alright I'm over it I'm like hi okay I think I hit this at least maybe 10 times which is extreme okay this is my review of a Little J first of all I'm high I'm really high and I just don't even know this hormone right now seriously I don't even I don't even know what to say I mean for once I am truly I think it's strong I for what a high grade us I feel like my body is just like somebody else came and took off really nice somebody named Adele a no Gina so somebody can come take over your body if you did a little G because I don't feel I don't know oh I probably wish I had a friend this year went that way I can have somebody to give me feedback and I know Papeete y'all wish to do that but you're not here right right here matter of fact you try it exactly it's like a calming effect but you just feel like hmm maybe I should take it slow like I feel like I can do things but I should probably take it slow I feel like if you were sharing with this this was someone you don't have to worry about them soggy enough to tip its glass so it's really like one stay sturdy you're not sometimes you you roll a blunt and then they get all saggy at the tip of it and you gotta pull it back together they've already solved that issue so this is a great cheerful I would suggest you buy it this holiday season share it with your friends you can put it out as you see I'm probably one hit just another day so this is definitely a two day if you buy yourself this is a two day situation it's no way this is no way it's just no way like I'm cool put old day I feel great about this situation would I buy it hell yeah yeah I like the alien og I do I really do and this key thing is fascinating it really is because it's not like coming off on my hands or anything Frank it don't come on that's just like amazing oh my burn my nose oh [ __ ] I feel cool this out oh I'd say that like I got a young Stoli if I put it alright guys here's my Beulah spec would if I had to give five stars I would definitely get them five pot leaves on these these is they they're the way you hold them they strung in your hand

and cost-effective we're using the rips today I think there's like six feet of paper in here so you can make a lot I know a lot of the pre-rolls I see online and it stores well to be real with you they look really overpriced and I would have paid that money I'm gonna show you how to be yourself easy and you don't need to use rips you can use any paper but the same method applies let's dive in make a pre-roll and stuff that thing up just grab a piece of paper cut it in half or a third or you can do the full thing I'll show you what that looks like in a minute go ahead and roll it into a nice cone shape no right or wrong way here you can watch how I do it I'd like to give a little extra and make that tip nice and firm what you want to roll it as tight as possible wrap it right around there and then you're gonna go ahead and grab your tape and you're gonna tape that and the paper cone is set to go next parts are optional you don't need to cut the top off but I'm just gonna go ahead and do it give it a chop and the next thing we're gonna do is go ahead and grab our papers we're going to pull out of rips about the same size as it cone cut that just go ahead take that paper give it a lick roll up a nice come here now let's go ahead and set that down put the paper coat on there and roll it from the bottom on up you want it to be nice and tight so that when you pull it out it stays and it's a nice perfect to come keep rolling don't stop just roll it right past the paper until there and it is three two one and there perfect go ahead and stick your finger in and pull out the inner paper mold this will leave you with a nice perfect pre roll well almost perfect couple more steps we're gonna use our raw filter tips today and we're gonna go ahead and fold those up and just toss it right in the end there you could do it without this highly recommend it though especially because you're gonna be packing it down makes it easier and yeah I wouldn't do it any other way and you can make it filtered about anything just find any piece of paper that has a little resilience we're gonna go ahead and stick that right in the back of the cone tap tap tap tap tap and we're going to go ahead and cut the top of the paper off so it's even and easy to fill but there it is that's the pre roll you would spend money on and now that you have the mold you can just keep making them really simple now there's a couple different ways I like to do this first you could just drop it in just like that and stuff it down this works its effective the second way is just dump it on there and push it in this is maybe a little more effective but my personal favorite the most effective is describe a piece of paper and fold it and chop it sell it's manageable to hold and go ahead and dump it in there and just use it as a chute to slide it right in there makes things a lot faster the paper is laying around it's not waste we're making you see everything here you're making the process speed up a little bit keep going ahead filling it packing it down you want to keep doing this you don't want to fill it and then pack the whole thing down or also be too loose you want to do it in steps it's a process fill it packet Philip packet and repeat let's go ahead and twist that top off here dress it up that cone is looking fat nice and there you see it it's not hard to do you got yourself a perfect color right there and that's how you make a pre-roll and that's still a fat size you know if you're passing out around to but here's how you make a bigger one let's take a full piece of paper making the same style cone but you're gonna pull two pieces and combine them this time just right on top each other now it's like one extra extra large go ahead same process roll that out from the bottom give it a lick twist it project there it is and that's a huge one thank you for chilling today I hope you found this video helpful and if you liked it give it a like drop a comment and let me know if there's anything else you want to see especially when it comes to rolling up because you know I love to roll up also don't forget to subscribe to true buds tv.com to be eligible for

"dt6pbWYbqPE": "[Music] we chose not to talk for a whole day we'd get through the day just perfectly because we know where we are in each step whether it's in the mixing step or if it's in the dividing and shaping birf it's in the bake step that's one of the most beautiful parts about a baker is where you see this wonderful choreography we have all these people who are meshing in a really beautiful way so that collectively we're getting the work done okay the first thing i'll do is divide some baguettes here in the King Arthur bakery we scale them at 14 ounces which would be the same as 400 grams some Baker's choose to go a little lighter and some some go a little heavier so I'll start by cutting off a strip of dough and then I'll look for a piece that looks approximately the right size if I need to I add a little scrap until the scale is more or less balancing in the middle for now I'll just stick that there and now I'll try to cut pieces that are have about the same mass as that first one so my goal was to cut them with this little scrap as I can so that my dough piece is comprised of mostly one nice solid chunk of dough we don't want it to be made up of 50 little bits of chopped up dog [Applause] [Music] the function of tree shaping is to take this kind of randomly shaped piece of dough and turn it into something that's a little bit more cohesive there are two basic methods for doing that the way we do it in the bakery is a very rapid and light degassing followed by a quick tucking of the dough so that after just a few strokes we've taken that random shape and we've turned it into something a bit more cohesive okay I'll do that again another method that's fairly common would be to pre shape it into a blunt shape you'd start in the same way a light degassing and then you'd start folding it up and just walking it like this so that your apreciate is like this as opposed to like this all right so on the surface that makes good sense to do it that way so then the question would naturally arise if we can do it this way and start out more aligned towards about get shaping why do we do it the other way in the bakery the answer is because we're doing you know some hundreds of baguettes over the course of a day or many hundreds over the course of a week and it's a lot quicker to pre shape them round rather than blunt so well somebody in a baking competition might choose to pre shape them in the blunt cylindrical shape for us we shaped them round because we can process them a lot more quickly and since it is all handwork we're very very attuned to how long it's taking us to do each phase of things all right now I'm gonna cut some loaves that are going to be slightly heavier and we're gonna do some that are going to be round loaves and some that are going to be over loaves [Music] these are going to pre-shape considerably more tightly okay one two so it's a kind of rolling and tucking and finish with a rounding any rips are going to indicate that I'm being a little bit too rough and so here I am trying to evacuate a lot of the gas eNOS this in there there's still plenty that's in there and you can see a lot of the surface shows evidence of fermentation gases that's a good sign that the dough is developing nicely what we want to avoid whether it's a baguette or a round loaf or an over loaf we want to avoid incorporating big pockets of air into the interior of the loaf that we'll consider a defect and one of the best ways to avoid those pockets is to first that's going to eliminate any of the larger pockets before you even start the pre shaping and if you don't do that then there's a tendency to have a finished loaf that has some oversized gas pockets you can hear there's some of those fermentation bubbles squishing their way out of the dough okay there's those [Music] you", "vnXEBMnQT8Q": "Iran is now unloading the Bennet so back in the days before our nice handy-dandy Oliver we used to do this on top of hand mixing and pre shaping and manually spraying into an oven staying up all night so Jon's scaling the dough and then I am kind of stretching it out to be the right size and shape so when I'm doing this I just wanted to try to do it to where it's pretty uniform throughout it also has the right amount of tension and then Dylan will put it in some rice flour and push it in on a sheet tray we just found like shaping them into a log for example helps the next station do what they need to do which helps me do what I need to do on the final shaping it's got to feel right like you don't want the dough to be breaking like forming a skin and then breaking you just want it to be like it has a little a give like a good balance I don't want to say when I usually compare it to a nice but firm but it still has a little bit of jiggle the secret is learning how to use the table the stickiness of the table in my opinion the stickiness of the table to your advantage there are several different ways that you can pre shape it you're basically just going for a log so I like to flower ahead of time so I'm not sticking to every little thing so you can roll it just like this honestly it's very this part it's very like low pressure so roll like this pass it on you can also because you're kind of also trying to start the process of building tension so you can also roll it in on itself like a almost like what I'm doing on on the final step but like this these have been pre shaped and then and then cut that for a while so that tension isn't too strong to where we can't do the next few steps so here we can stretch this out bring both sides into the middle I don't for me almost like a bow tie and then pulling it into the stro and halfway just pulling it out and then sticking it to itself half way and I turn it around and grab this and pull all the way over so like completely closing then I roll that onto the scene and start to use the tension of the table to kind of get a uniform link so oftentimes like the center will be skinnier and then the ends are a little bit fatter so I just focus on the ends in that case if I have a bulge all this work that little bulge and I'm just using like my fingertips and as little like scoops and then with my thumbs I'm just pushing up against the table so it's almost like you're pushing it into itself so here I have a little bulb there just going to work it just slightly more and then you can choose a point it ends but you can choose to have rounded ends I keep mine a little bit like shorter and plumper just so that they fit the sheet tray better and also because when they come out to bake they will already get like a little bit like they're gonna be looser in tension so that when to take them off of here an inch onto the baking board there's a little bit you get more leeway and then I keep usually like a little pile of flour AP flour spur my hands on this part since Logan and Dylan Dylan are helping me out I have everything please preps for me if the dough is too sticky I can just quickly dab my hands in there brush it off so it's sticking a little bit over here so I just added a little flowers to Rebekah's because they're they're kind of one of the more difficult things to support even though it's like when you watch videos it's like almost like they do itself fast and confidently that it's hard to imagine that there's so much to check the technicality to it but I like to use this so that I can kind of get the blade this is a like more traditional mom so it's got a a wooden handle and then like a curved piece that I'm just going to put this blade onto you bend it away from you and slide it through so that has like this nice curve and I don't have to work as hard to make the lines I need to make this is right flower we just like to add a little color in contrast you want to say if you divide this into three lanes you want to say within your middle lane so if you had like a lane here and Elayne here you want all your lines to be in the center as best as possible he's just gonna kind of deal like that and then the second most important thing is that you want about an inch of overlap to get a nice ear and I like to hang all my blades so it's kind of lifting up under the skin as I cut so I'm gonna find the center of my baguette and try to keep all three of my lines in the center just gonna go like this so I'm between these two lanes I'm going to overlap one inch come through again and overlap one inch and then this is the fun part you have to like kind of put it in fast like pizza the loves make about 30 minutes these bake about 20 to 25 so we do 484 20 and then 15 minutes with 8 seconds of steam for the first half and then 10 more 10 more minutes 10 to 12 minutes so similar about lettuce order with a baby needs a lot Darvin I'm gonna take the sexiest one out so I did not shape these so they're not as beautiful as I could so this I'll take this one is like my favorite in terms of how the scorning came out I'm going for this little ear that's sticking up but I actually like these to be a little bit darker so I'm gonna put a back in if you don't nail this boring or nail the shape baguettes are so finicky so if you don't nail this boring or nail the shaping like it'll tell you I'm kind of baked like these got no ears basically and when this one was shaped this is the what happens if you don't focus on the uniformity throughout so you have this kind of funny shaped it's kind of like sitting in the middle but bull Germans I like them quite a bit crispy er whipped awake because they're not dark enough what happened here I don't know that's what I was explaining it's a shaving erage not shaping these customarily you don't want to cut it right when you take it out of the oven otherwise you're gonna get a really doughy weird texture inside so this has been cooling for about I don't know three hours or so so we're going to cut into it so you get that nice crumb shot hopefully I don't slice my finger off so in a bag yet especially you're looking for a much more open structure than what you would get in in a loaf or at least a little bit more open structure to me like I feel like it could be better really gonna be more open this is very close to like our little scrum so I would I would wish to see like more a little more openness of course nobody really cuts it like this I mean well that's not true if you're making a sandwich it's a great way to cut it I prefer to use these for a bruschetta so that's not that's pretty nice actually the cross-section view but I like to use these for bruschetta they're great for sandwiches crust is really nice you kind of hear it very delicious I would have actually bake this even darker preferably my preference we try to bake kind of a variety of everyone for everyone ranging from super light to want more on the darker side I prefer the darker side but it's actually very convenient because you when you're baking you have to like really get to know your equipment and like each deck of this oven bakes like just a little bit different like nuances with every deck so it kind of naturally does that even in the same desk like from left to right the right always bakes lighter I think it's because there's less seam on that side the steam comes out of the left so the left always tends to bake a little bit darker", "wCnCa6YMFcU": "okay look so i'm going to be pre-shaping my baguettes um this is a sourdough baguette without any commercial yeast so i generally make three at a time because i have a home oven and i cannot fit more baguettes in my oven and bake them in reasonable fashion so i only do three at a time so obviously you want to flour your work surface a little bit with baguettes it's always good to have an extra pile of flour away from you that you can drop the dough into as you need to okay so i fly over the surface of the dough i'm just going to release it from the bowl scraper and i floured the surface of this dough as well so this has been in the fridge for 24 hours because i find it's a little easier to shape baguettes if the dough is cold so i'm trying to be as gentle as possible with it so i don't degas it excessively so i need to divide it into three equal portions let's get our trusty scale on okay so i'm going to do my best to divide it in three it should be approximately 300 grams each well i'm way off that's 270 so let's steal some try to get that up close to 300 let's start with that 290 that feels light and i'm way down on that let me just see what this other one is three eighteen so if i take about three off of that piece sorry about that scraping that's going to be fine to about 280-ish okay so we want to start by as i said by pre-shaping so we want to pre-shape baguettes so there is um so it starts getting some of the length and some of the shapes so i'm going to roll them into a a loose um roll or cylinder shape and you want circumferential tension you don't want longitudinal tension if you build tension the in the length of the baguette it'll contract a lot when you're trying to shape it so that's why i'm just going to do a roll usually for most breads if i was pre-shaving i would do a build a loose fuel but that then when you try to elongate that when you're shaping it there's more resistance and more elasticity and it'll tend to want to bring the baguette shorter than you want it to be okay so with a little bit of floured hands just literally just roll it this excess flour just brush it off you don't want a lot of extra flour okay a tiny bit of sticking just gonna put that there so it's lightly floured put it over here to rest we're going to be giving it a 30 minute rest 20 to 30 minute rest okay we're doing the same so again brush the flower off so literally a loose roll like absolutely nothing fancy just gonna get enough flour on it leave that there finally the last one get a little bit of flour on the sticky surface clean the ends leave it there so i'm just going to cover it with a towel and start a timer for 20 to 30 minutes we'll come back when it's time to shape", "6vEsoOMwNes": "[Music] the dough has gone through its bog proofing stage we're now ready to go into this next stage which is the scaling dividing so we're going to make a little Vienna so I'm going to scale out 650 grams per loaf by having the same weight in your loaves that means that they will prove and it means they will bake exactly the same amount of time [Music] we can't leave these like this we need to put them into their pre shape shape so depending on what we do we're going to make them into other rounds for the vienna's and we're going to make little cylinders for the baguette so just I like to put my loaf loaves onto wooden boards just so it helps protect the temperature of the dough remove any excess flour off your bench because this will start to change the hydration of your dough and it will stop you the dough from gripping to the bench so all we want to do is fold it over itself we want to make a nice round tight dough all the time we we mold from underneath we never mold from the top so using our hands sliding and rolling crimping it underneath and allowing that beautiful smooth surface to be created on top this is what traps the gas in our loaf of bread if we just have that loose we're allowing the gas to escape so round it up it's are balding from underneath with the baguettes what we want to create is a cylinder so what we want to do is flatten it out whenever we use my doing bread making we never use claws we only use the flats of their hands okay flatten it out square off your ends get the top edge fold it down top edge fold it down fold it down sealing it against a bit on the bench and then just tightening it up from underneath to create a little cylinder we'll do that again use the flats of our hands square off top edge down top edge down top edge down see so this is telling the gluten which way we want it to go when we come into a final shape we've scaled them we've divided them with pre-shaped them now they need to go out into what we call an intermediate proof which is just a little bit of time around about 10 to 15 minutes just for them to relax so we can get them into their final shape at this point we need to make sure that it doesn't form a skin we want to keep it protected so we'd cover it with either a trolley rack or cover or a tea towel if you're at home so our breads had its intermediate proof we're now going to put it into its final shape so we're gonna use a couple of things we're going to use Koosh which is just a heavy linen material that we wrap the bread in that creates its my own microclimate and giving it the bread we're retaining the moisture in the layer allowing it to prove without forming crust or we can use a cane basket which we call a Benetton so let's start with a Koosh we'll start with our 650s and we're going to turn this into a Vienna I want you to imagine that this has a divided into quarters okay you're then going to get two top corners and fold them in turn it around get the top two corners fold them in fold in and then fold completely over ceiling on the bench then you're going to tighten it up and into getting this tightness in the dough is what helps you create the final shape if it's too slack it'll there'll be too much sideways movement so push to about the halfway mark pull to the halfway mark push until it's nice and tight and then we can go and place it in our Koosh so again the Vienna so bring the corners in bring the tip in turn it around bring the corners in bring the tip in fold it in half seal it rub this part and this part of your palms along the bench and that creates the points okay don't pull out when you're molding the red actually push in and you'll create a nice fat middle with on in the bread and then it's a beautiful torpedo shape place it on the Koosh small fold and that's where our next load lot go so corners in point in turn it around in point in folding half seal on the bench push and pull until you get a tight skin always molding from underneath never mold bread from the top place onto your couch now she's had a final shape what we do is we'll just tuck her in and then place her for her final proof and next shape we're going to do it's going to go into couch again so we'll just make sure we've semolina the couche make sure that it doesn't stick this also gives your bread a little bit of texture when it comes out of the oven so you've got that slightly coarser grain on the outside so all we do is we square off our ends we take the top edge we fold it about 1/3 down push creating a bit of tension then we grab the edge again and slowly bring it down this creates the cylinder okay we don't have a fat middle and we don't have pointy ends and this will create more of an even loaf flat now square off tension tension tension tight place in YouTube you can make a song out of that tension tension tension tight tension tension tension tight when I place my bread in the crew shy always put it seemed side down so I know where the seam is if you put the seam up when it goes in the oven and has a tendency to open up on you and crack so with our Benetton's these arcane baskets this is more traditional we once we're just your light sprinkle of semolina a little dust of flour just to get those rings and then we just round up our loaf just like we did before and so we can get nice tight all out of it once we've got a nice tight round ball we then place it upside down in our Benetton's this is how we shape a baguette now there are many many different ways of shaping a baguette this is just the way I do it once again no claws only flats so we just Pat the dough out slightly top edge I bring it about 3/4 down sealing it turn the loaf around top edge all the way down to the bench this time sealing it off against the bench tighten it don't worry about lengths at the moment this is where we just get tension in the dough ok once we're happy with the tension we then place our hands in the middle and slowly bring it out to the size that we want to place it in our Koosh flatten out top edge down three-quarters turn it around top edge all the way down to the bench seal it tension shape now you notice that I haven't got any flour on my bench at the moment because if I get too much flour the dough's will start to slide and it won't get the tension that we need inside our dough so once we get them into their final shape we now let little need to let them prove now this can be done a number of ways we can either it which means we slow down the yeast and we extend its fermentation time or we can just leave it at room temperature and it can prove at its own rate I like to refrigerate this four degrees and then I will give it around about six to eight hours at around about 18 degrees for its final proof what this will do is it will allow more flavor to develop as slightly sour profile will come through and will get also get because of the low temperature proving bits like Nicholas did it's all skin on the outer the outer surface of our loaf of bread [Music] you", "1Q0LeKpAACg": "hello again my name's John I'm a retired cook from the northeast of England in the UK and welcome to another one of my bread videos this recipe is a great favorite with our customers friends and family and it's these delicious cheesy baguettes it's similar to my French baguette video or but you'd be policed and all with the addition of extra yeast this one doesn't take as long to complete and here's a list of the ingredients you'll need if you want to have a quart making them yourself another cup Shin says this recipe will yield 8 9-inch that's 23 centimeter delicious cheesy buckets ok I'll start the recipe by adding to the ball 700 grams that's 24 and a half ounces of strong white bread flour that is to say white flour with at least 12% protein in its ingredients now add the salt and whisk that in before adding the yeast [Music] right at the East End the chives the chives are optional but they do give the finished bread a mild onion flavor and whisk laws into the flour too [Music] time to out the cheese the cheese will mix into the flour easier if it's straight from the fridge now gently fold it in using the whisker Shawn right time to add to 520 grams that's 18 and a half ounces of cool water try to use bottled or filtered water if you can ask the chlorine in tap water can slow the activity of the East dam slowing down the fermentation process in some recipes is or care but not in this one now bring the ingredients together until it reaches a sticky mass are shown in the video you can use a mixer for this initial mix but only until it comes together this only takes about 90 seconds by hand in real time saw unless it's absolutely necessary it's not worth having to set it up and then you have to clean your machine afterwards [Music] right I'll cover the door I like to use a shower cup but you can use cling film plastic wrap or even a damp tea towel and set the timer for the first of two 45 minute Rises [Music] as you can see the door has arisen some but not a lot on this first occasion I now need to give the door a quick fold this is to merely even out the temperature so I lightly wet the bench unscripted or out of the ball and with wet hands give the door a few turns [Music] if it sticks to the bench a bit like my house just loosen it off with your scraper once it's had a few Falls you can visibly see it getting smoother [Music] or get clean up your work area and get it back into the ball and set the timer for the second and final 45-minute rice [Music] right while I'm waiting for the second rise I can start to prepare a couple of things first I'll oil a strip of cling film or plastic wrap and set it aside for now this is to cover the pre shape against as you'll see a little later the second is to grease a couple of baking trays I'm using a little lard to do mine it's always best to get these jobs out of the way ahead of time you'll also need to prepare what's known in the trade as a well floured baker's couche all it is is a piece of material to rest the baguettes on for the final rise I'm using a 100% cotton bilikiss I knit from the linen cupboard and I'm seriously praying that she doesn't watch this video okay the second 45 minutes are up and it's time to start pre-shipping the buckets I'll start by dusting the work area with flour then I'll scrape the door out of the ball and give the door dusting a flower too this is to prevent sticking when cutting it with this scraper and as you can see after the second 45 minutes the door is full-bodied and well risen [Music] right time to divide the dough into four equal pieces if your measurements were right at the beginning the total weight of the door should be 1,300 grams that's 46 ounces so the four pieces should be in the region of 320 grams that's 11 and a half ounces each and don't worry I haven't forgotten that we're doing eight buckets it's just easier to appreciate them in four pieces [Music] okay it'll be simpler if you just watch how I pre-shape these buckets this is an important step as it allows the door to rise and relax making it much easier to form the final bucket shape [Music] once they're all formed cover them with the previously oiled thing film then have a bit of a cleanup especially if you've dribbled oil from the plastic wrap like I have and set your timer for 15 minutes [Music] once that 15 minutes is up I can start forming the finished baguette shape okay I'll read us the worktop with flour and uncover the pre shapes one at a time and each one will have to be cut in half you have to eyeball them at this point if you try to wear them you could end up little bits all over the place forget them as close as possible but don't worry about it at the end of the day these buckets are handmade and not churned out like some robot machine would and if one bucket ends up bigger than the other just grab it before somebody else gets their mitts on it and once again it'll be easy to watch how it's turned rather than try to explain it but try to do it as quickly as possible because the more you handle the door the more it will tighten up and become a bit difficult to shape if this happens to yours just let it relax for a few minutes and it'll become more pliable again once the buckets are formed get them onto the couch as shown and give them a light dusting a flower as you go [Music] once you've just about formed each bucket finish off by sailing the base with the heel of your thumb as shown in the video may ensure the seam is at the bottom when transferring it to the Gousha [Music] [Music] right I'll quickly go through the rest of them forming these buckets takes little practice but once you get used to it he'll just fly through them honestly it's more difficult for me to do the slowly for the video than at my normal speed [Music] not this quick mind [Music] once all eight had done get them on the cushioned cover them with the dry lightweight tea towel and set the timer for 20 minutes now these oxy take 30 minutes to rise so when a time's up reset for another 10 minutes and not allow the oven to get up to temperature right once you reset the timer turn on the oven and set the temperature to 230 degrees Celsius that's 445 Fahrenheit or gas mark 7 I'm set in mine to 210 Celsius allowing 20 degrees Celsius for the fun assist you'll also need to place a ton of hot water on the bottom shelf of the oven this creates a steamy atmosphere to help the maggots become crispy [Music] right time's up no with light hands and that means with very little grip gently transfer the buckets over to the baking tray now space them out like I'm doing in the video and that gives them a little room to expand and rise once they're all on the tree give them a spray with water before scoring them with a razor blade or an extremely sharp knife like miners Shawn [Music] [Music] now garnish the tops of the buckets with a little cheese and Shawn don't use too much as it may inhibit the spring or rise in the oven [Music] right I'll do exactly the same with the other tree the ovens up to temperature and now it's time to bake [Music] try to get them into the oven as quickly but as carefully as possible before closing the door give the inside of the oven a sprayer with water this will make the baguettes even more crispy now set the timer for 16 minutes after 10 minutes flip the trees bucked the front and top to bottom for even cooking to avoid a blast of hot steam or on the door very slowly swap the trays around and close the oven door as quickly as possible [Music] after the 16 minute stick these wonderful baguettes out of the oven and get them on a wire rack to cool and as the caption says you may well have to restrain yourself from diving in with a butter knife between your teeth the smell of freshly baked bread is fantastic enough on its own but when it's combined with the aroma of toasted cheese it's downright irresistible and just listen to how crispy and light these are [Music] well you can't actually hear how late they are but you know what I mean now there's only one more thing to do and that's the all-important taste test think I'll make myself a nice ham sandwich while they're still warm well the crumb inside this bread looks wonderful not as bubbly as my French baguette video recipe but that's because this is only hard to 45-minute Rises which results in a better structure for sandwiches and of course I'd be using some of my homemade butter and if you want to know how to make your own butter I have a video on my channel I'll leave a link in the description box below this video right I'll get some of this delicious lean honey roast ham on and with the flavor of the cheese and chives it only needs a little sea salt and pepper and nothing else right here we go and as I knew this is absolutely delicious under filling choices are endless for this sort of bucket

liquid starter widely used in France bakeries easy to handle foolish is one non technique to increase a dough's extensibility and develops Airy crab and a light taste of hazelnut to the baguette Oh for the 12 hours room-temperature polish whisk water with a pinch of yeast and flour scrape the side of the container well with a rubber spatula and cover with plastic wrap and seal it with a rubber band pocket and leave the polish on the countertop at room temperature for 12 hours look six hours have gone by then 12 it's bubbling and cracking it smells so great in order to remove the Polish easily and without deflating it pour the water in a center of the bubbling flesh and transfer it into the mixer bowl along with remaining yeast flour and salt mix for five minutes on low speed and five minutes more on medium speed or until dough is smooth and comes away from sides of ball since the dough is highly hydrated 75% do not add more flour if it looks soupy and the beginning of mixing the dough will come together too the air it should look just like that the temperature of the door by the way should be between 75 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit 24 to 27 degrees Celsius cover up though with a wet kitchen towel and let rise for 60 minutes then flour dough and transfer it onto a floured work surface do not put down next divide dough into four equal portion carefully deflate each portion and shape into loaves dust linen cloth with flour known as baker's couche or use a fragrance-free thick kitchen towel and let love's rest cover for 20 minutes gorgeous to shape loaves into baguette flatten each love and try not to deflate too many of those lovely air bubbles fall down the top third of the dough and use the heel of your hand to seal the edge repeat once then use the palm

Florida MJ 4:20 here and today I'm going to show you how to roll your own cone joints at home so what you will need is some paper pair of scissors some cardboard tip material 1.25 papers you could use other size papers I guess but I use 1.25 s you need a pen and some masking tape so the first thing you're gonna need to do is make the mold for the that you're gonna need to make your cones so take the tip of the pen and get this so that it starts curling like that and then take your finger and roll it this part can be kind of difficult to get going stick with it so what you want to do is keep this end right here small and keep the whole thing in general not getting too fat unless you want really really fat cones of course you know however whatever shape this is in at the end is how your cone is gonna be shaped so really I guess you could make it all kinds of shapes if you want to that would be kind of cool to make a really big fat cone huh so and I'm sure everybody's done this in kindergarten rolling up some paper like this and I probably should have done this beforehand but you take your masking tape a little piece off yay I can do this all righty that's pretty cool now if I can find the end of this thing there it is right there just tape this right here and there you have the mold for your cone joints pretty cool huh all right imagine if we had paper is that big huh now we can set the tape aside and for the next part you got to get out your paper this part is pretty darn simple just kind of want to line this up at the bottom here so it lines up at the bottom of this form and just roll that sucker up and make sure you wet it before you let go so you get the paper to stick there you have the paper part of your cone take off one of your little deals here and get the pen part out of the middle right the ink part and you take this you can use other stuff too like a small screwdriver you just want to get this part started so it doesn't crease you know if you use the cardboard out of these they're a lot more likely to crease so using a tool like this really helps get this whole thing bent like that and now you want to take a look at your paper it's only about that big so you're not gonna need the whole thing down there what is it we all right now you take the filter cardboard and notice how this isn't even that's good that's okay because this isn't even either this is on a perfect cylinder you slide that down there stuff it down with the pin and you're almost good to go now this part this part right here there's a little bit easier if you have something like that has a screwdriver like and so you basically you just want to tighten that up down there and all you have to do is stick this down there and turn it like a screwdriver against the edges and it's this one's actually counterclockwise but you'll get the point so and you just want to turn it sideways like a screw until it's tight up against the edges so now we have our cone paper voila very cool huh and so you can change the size of your cone by where you roll it on here too you don't have to roll a completely different sized one but you can you can roll them fatter than this you know your form you can roll them skinnier you know however you want to really let's get some wheat ground up since I'm not really reviewing a strain today I'll just use my grinder get out some of the 27.4 7% evany and ivory I got in $125 an ounce sale stuff is pretty good it's got a little seeds on it but what are you gonna do right it's a good deal get this all ground up all right you might have gotten enough in there might need a little bit more and I forgot one thing that'll make it easier so I'll be right back all right now I'm back I think we will need more than this for a little bit more in the grinder oh it's all gunked up in there dang it is a sticky string got lots of trichomes on it those have a lot of seeds though a medical this is just powdered now all right I'll show you the seeds I got so here's I'm not done with those ounces yet but these are probably about three-quarters of the seeds I've gotten a lot of them were chopped up while I was cutting up the weed another thing you can use is a funnel you can stick it in the end of the cone paper and it'll make it packing a little easier I usually don't use it but you know there's the option if you want it so they'll get this thing packed up you just want to make sure that when you're packing the cone joint that you pack it as you go don't pack a whole bunch in there and then pack it down that is gonna cause your joint to run like crazy believe me or another thing that that causes is for your joint just to completely go out get that thing fully packed keep tamping it down as you go and actually one thing I'll show you the best way to do this it's a little bit more difficult is to actually put the paper on backwards I'll show you about that well yeah so that's a nice little personal conjoint here not a big ol fatty but if you want to you just roll your paper higher up on here and it's a fatter cone automatically I'll demonstrate it for you after I get this one packed this is going to be a nice postpone for me 27.4 7% and it shows to lots of trichomes covering this bad boy let's see when you get to the end just kind of cup your fingers around it like this and then you can just punch down on it real easy nothing difficult here that's for sure hands are just covered in this stuff all right so here we have it conjoint not sure how much this weighs that is about point nine grams so let's assume that the paper and the cardboard weigh about what point two or something because I only used a very little bit of it so it's like a point seven gram Joey that's pretty good it's packed in there nice and tight draws really well I can feel that now let me just demonstrate for you real quick before I get this choked up let me demonstrate how if you you lit up higher you get a bigger cone out of it so before I match the bottom here this time I'm not gonna do that I'm gonna roll it further up here you just lick it again same as before here we got the cone and you see how much fatter this one is so there you go if you roll it up even higher you're gonna get an even fatter one and I think it would be funny to make a really fat mold where it's just like boom you can pack yourself some really crazy ones and on these if you just if it has a bigger tip right here you'll just cut off a little bit more of one of these filter papers there we go pretty cool way to save yourself some money this will work well if there's any of those shake deals out there in your area or whatever there you go alright now before I light that join up let me show you how to back roll back roll look hold let me show you how to back roll a cone joint so you take the paper and you see oh here's the sticky side you put it on backwards so we're gonna be doing the sticky side is gonna be outwards so you see this I don't know if you can see that here's the sticky side okay so you take it and roll it like normal except that you get it into place like this and then you moisten it before you roll it up and now you just roll it and continue to moisten it as you go okay and so you're rolling rolling rolling rolling now it's rolled on there and it's stuck together right and you have all this extra paper hanging off what do you do what do you do indeed you find my lighter and I'll show you what to do you take it and you light it I went ahead and looked it one more time just to make sure that it's sealed before I do this let's say you take the lighter you just catch it on fire and let it burn hold it up so it doesn't really burn there you go and now you have a back rolled cone here right now what is the advantage of this well it's not a well okay first of all there's a lot less paper on this on a back roll but the other advantage is specifically for cone joints if you look in here you see how there's that paper right here this is a pain in the butt if you're packing a cone joint if you look in the middle sorry these are really delicate until you get that cardboard in and if you look down the middle of these they don't have anything in the middle so they're really easy to pack so that's why you would do a back roll cone joint very cool huh they're a little bit more delicate they're gonna have a way better flavor though because you're just cutting out that much more paper so well I'm about way better but you know they're gonna have a better flavor alright so let's get this lit and toked up no I'm definitely ready for it it's raining cats and dogs out there right now I'm pretty gloomy Saturday so no I could use the medication that's for sure so this is how you light the cone joint I guess I should have said that you just want to roll it around the end until the whole thing is lit you don't want to inhale the cone joint while the flame is on it because it will make it run like crazy this won't prevent it from running but it discourages running by lighting it even leaf alright there we have a nice DIY cone joy at home see if we can toke it without it running all over the place get all this jakey stuff out of the way those always come in handy huh sure plenty of people have used those at a pinch or two yes that ashtray is not all that interesting really it's burning pretty nicely um flavors pretty darn good as far as today this morning I probably had the most flavorful joint I've ever had it was of citrus farmer and that grapefruit flavor just came right through I mean I got all excited because key relief is I'm gonna sail and then I saw that all their flowers in store only that was a bummer vitae kids have it a sale it doesn't include flower hey these guys need to get with the times there's like half of the patients went straight to flower smokeable flower as soon as it was available I should tell you something so you know we're gonna bind and you don't have that's what I normally use like packs of these papers or I'll show you these cones pre-rolled cones like this it's just convenient but you know if you need to you can make them yourself at home save you a little money or if you're just did a pitcher you go have around party bays there you go never be without your cones woods you also roll my hand I'll have to show you a hand roll come join those aren't as good at least mine are a lot better with that mold there before my guess I don't know what you call it coffee stuff all over the place really feeling the effects of this ebony and ivory Sookie fee you can really tell it's a 20/20 7.47 presented man so uh anybody else out there roll your own cone joints been doing it for a while I actually started out not with doing cones but just for the longest time I would just put filters on my joints man that would be interesting actually if I did an evolution video of my evolution of joint rolling because I have a very distinct evolution of what I've been through you know really crappy crappy hand roll joints you know with no filter anything you could barely talk out of that clog up on end to I would put for a long time I put really small filter tips in for a long time after that I would put in bigger filter tips that I started trying to do cones never really did get big in two blunts but there have been times when I did you know rolling once man oh man as you can see is burning really nicely that's another thing you can make sure that you know there's a lot of complaints of pre-roll of cones running really badly we'll get good and then you don't have to have them roll all right I'll be running good you get good they won't run a lot of it also has to do with the grinder you want a nice even grind people say that it's bad to have a fine grind but it's really not is that bad nope you just gotta pack it correctly I like this a lot this is just a metal dab tool you can probably get it for five or ten bucks at any head shop all right but let me tell you what makes a good packing tool for these things so what makes a good packing tool is it for it to have some diameter to it like this you know it'd be a little bit heavy so that you can let the weight of it do the work so when I'm packing I'm not really pushing too much as much as letting it drop maybe having a little bit of pressure add to it with the fact that this is heavy and metal really helps that the other thing I like is for there to be a smaller tip I'm still a flat end you know I want it to be flat on the end still but a little bit smaller on the tip than it is in the main part because this helps it this packs it down and then if there's gaps in the edges you could turn it around the edges like this and it'll pack around the edges you could also just make another one of these if you're out of everything but paper just make another one of this but roll it so tight that there's not really a hole in the end you can just pinch the end I guess and use that to pack it I think I'm gonna make a video next couple days where I show all the different ways I can roll a joint gonna be cool and there's a lot of people out there just come in to cannabis now that it's legal I think that's really cool I think it's an awesome thing you know there's so many people have been missing out for years and welcome right so I think it's really cool who would people discover something like cannabis it really helps improve their life and can really you know help with problems that otherwise might require harsh drugs or you know have really bad side effects from those drugs and that kind of thing as cannabis you know we've been using that for longest time as a medicine we know pretty much the side effects and stuff nothing too crazy with it I know that cannabis has helped me with my PTSD so much and I only wish that it had been legal earlier because that stigma really really hurt for years I mean if you already have PTSD and you wake up with nightmares and many a paranoia it's just made so much worse when you think that your medicine is gonna make you go to prison you know I mean man I did the mixed messages you know it works you don't makes you feel so much better but everyone in the society tells you how evil it is and you're breaking the law and man that's why I'm just so glad that we have a medical system here in Florida no don't have to feel like a criminal for doing something that's totally fine it's solely wholesome there's nothing wrong with cannabis you know it's like saying there's you know milk is terrible no looks not terrible it's just you just got to use it in moderation not not drink milk at every freakin meal and for snacks and you know same kind of deal oh man sorry you're pretty harsh at the end here see I wonder how much THC that is 192 milligrams it looks like THC very interesting so well guys I think I'm done until there we go roll your own pre-roll conjoint at home well just you rolled it it's not pretty rolled using a few simple things you probably got around your house anyway and there you go so hopefully you can save yourself a little bit money make your own pretty rolls own thank you very much for watching y'all have a good", "vVp3VBsWsXo": "hey home bakers is Jack here bakery Jack can't dock you keep bringing you your weekly bread making tip every single Thursday and if you're baking bread ahead of time planning for Christmas you might be interested to hear about the part about principle roll da Vinci hello there welcome back to bake we check YouTube channel where I showed you little bit my bread making expertise every single Thursday it's two weeks till Christmas and that means two things if you haven't placed an order for your bakery check merchandise as Christmas presents this year last order dates are fast approaching so get your order in ASAP and secondly if you haven't thought about what you're gonna eat over the Christmas season it's time to sit down with a pencil and get planning plan your preparation for a perfect Christmas meal I love that part of Christmas but hey well it'll be like that so picture this scenario you want that fresh bread taste on Christmas Day or Boxing Day but you don't want to get up at 4 o'clock in the morning to make that happen it's completely possible to make bread tastes fresh like it's just come out of the oven but you actually baked it a few days ago or a couple of weeks ago you got to pop it back into the oven to reheat it and bring that freshness back 10 to 15 minutes in the oven is usually enough to bring back the freshness but it's usually just enough to make the crust too crispy or to dry out your bread if it was fully baked in the first place does that make sense so then the answer is if you're deliberately baking bread ahead of time so that you can refresh it make it taste fresh you have to part bake it then when you put it back in the oven you're finishing off that final part of the bake not unlike most of the artisanal bread that you see freshly baked every morning in the supermarket after that final 10-15 minutes in the oven it will be just perfect as if you just baked it if you are part baking ahead in time for Christmas or any other time of year for that matter there are few things to bear in mind as always we are talking principles here there is no one-size-fits-all process that can guide you through step by step but the principle applies to all part baking always works best with smaller breads and that's because you can bake it through to the middle in a shorter amount of time without it taking on too much color I wouldn't intentionally for example bake a 2 pound loaf part bake it's because they'll have to bake a long time for it to be ready in the middle and in that time the outside we get properly crusty when you bring it back to life in the oven the outside probably get a little bit too crusty and the heat probably wouldn't have penetrated to the inside all the way in that short amount of time for smaller breads like rolls or the Christmas wreath bread I made a couple of weeks ago you can pretty much guarantee that by 10 minutes before the end of baking time it's gonna be baked through to the middle the rest of the baking time is there just to get a nice golden crust on the outside of it so you're pretty safe that the inside is baked ready to store it or freeze it ready for the big day if you part bait your rolls or Christmas wreath bread ahead of time by like a few days you'll probably get away we're storing it at room temperature either pop it in a ziploc bag wrap it up inside a cling film or put it in some sort of airtight box or ten that way the moisture would be kept inside the bread over the next few days and then in the final bake it won't dry out too much if you're baking any further ahead of time it's a nice idea to freeze things let it cool down completely and then pop it in a ziplock bag or wrap it up in cling film and pop it in the freezer it will live quite happily in your freezer for ages this stock answer is probably one month but you might get away with longer as long as you wrap it nicely to avoid freezer burn freezing bread works but what you got to remember and what nobody ever talks about it's the damage factor I'm talking about a little chip here and there or a crack where you've just tossed in a box of fish fingers into the freezer on top of your bread without even thinking be careful if you're freezing your part baked bread and to bring it back to life you've got a few options but I tend to do and why prefer is to take it out of the freezer and leave it on the side to let it defrost overnight before finishing off the bake the following day when I'm ready there are other ways and tactics you can employ to make that happen that I put to the test in another recent video that I will link up here somewhere there's another interesting learning point within that video about the detaching crust as a home baker you have your own instincts and they'll be different to your neighbors and possibly different to mine depending on your level of experience and practice but you won't gain your own instincts without trying things out for yourself if I gave you straight-up instructions for every single bread down to the minute and the temperature oven that's a ton of a work for me to try out and you'll learn nothing so let the takeaway of this video be the following stop baking your bread just before it starts to color up too much 10 minutes before the end of the baking time for a small bread is a nice guideline when you bring back the bread in the oven a good temperature to use is the same temperature you would have used in the first place to bake your bread the temperature your oven would have been had you continued to bake it all the way to the end 10 to 15 minutes in the oven so bringing it back is a nice guideline but keep your eye on it stop baking when it's a nice golden color os is crispy and crusty as your taste when you put your part baked bread in city oven it will start baking and get soft and steamy and then it will go through that stage that heat will go to the middle when the outside will start to dry out and get crispy and crusty exactly like it would have been had you baked it all through to the end in the first place so that's it for this week make Christmas easy for yourself plan your menu man I love that part prep yourself ahead of time so you can enjoy the day without worrying have yourself a glass of mulled wine and keep the cooking process streamlined without compromising on creating something exceptional for your friends and your family don't forget if you'd like to make the rosemary and cranberry Christmas wreath

fermented baguette recipe the easiest process to feed families busy schedule let's get started pour water first into your mixer bowl add flour salt semolina and yeast and mix on low speed for 15 minutes then transfer to into a greased the plastic container and let dough rise at room temperature through about and now when the dough has doubled in volume deflate and round dough into a smooth ball place the dough into the same bowl cover and refrigerate overnight after the resting time put the cold fermented dough on your work surface to come back to temperature for about now golde resting doe is also a practical matter once the dough is mixed and resting for 14 hours or more it is not a big deal and once it is pulled out it takes a couple of hours to get it done transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface without deflating it yet and divided into three seven and a half ounce equal pieces flip over dough skin side down gently deflate and fold each piece of dough down into a rectangle shape cover bread with a wet kitchen towel and let rest for 45 minutes at room temperature bread is alive beautiful after the resting time shape each piece into a 16 inch length forget the size of your baking tray starting with the first one you shaped to shape a baguette it is not complicated give a gentle patting folding and pressing with the heel of your hand as if you were folding a business letter even gate each baguette by rolling it a back and forth on the work surface with both hands over the center of the loaf and walk them out to the ends until the baguette reaches the desired length arrange baguette seam side down cover with a wet kitchen towel and let proof for about an hour or until it has almost doubled in size the last step before baking is to slash the tops of the baguette then carefully slide the non-stick baking mat into the hot baking tray or stone and throw a few ice cubes for the steam and beg bread for about 20 minutes smelling bread coming out of your oven will make your day and by the way like professional if you use baker's couche flax linen proofing cloth and if you want to be more creative or or shaped baguette in a dumped clean kitchen towel and coat them with sesame seeds or poppy seeds this is going to be something look at that crusty creamy crumb and so much flavors homemade French baguette made easy I am Brunel boos thank you for watching and don't forget to subscribe you you", "_43P2kwYynY": "so we're gonna do here is appreciate that gap light shapes and I'm gonna start with 390 gram units so to pre shape the bag that I like to work it just by gently rolling this thing up starting to train the dough to end up in an elongated shape once you're done reshaping you put these away in a protected environment for about half an hour so for the baguettes I take them and flip them upside down before I shape them so to shape the bad guy we take our dough we take a sit we push down on that leading edge one more time flip it over take that lip put it on the top and fold it over one more time to close that seam then you take this and it elongate it out to the proper length in this situation we had to take the seam up and place it on our and dusted couch create a pleat and then you're ready for the next one [Music] so what I have here is a 390 gram unit gonna need a set shape it just like the baguette not too tight as you roll it up then you can extend this thing longer than a Baghdad nice and evenly whenever you're shaping the baguette make sure you don't close those ends off too soon because if you do it becomes hard to get rid of the air pockets on the inside and then what you're gonna do is you're gonna roll this thing up and then the other one in the opposite direction not too tight you pick this up and you place it upside down onto the floured area right [Music] here we're going to shape a circular doughnut and what I do is I appreciate this round I'm going to flip it upside down very loosely shape it into a round now you're gonna let this sit for 20 minutes and then you're gonna open the center here we're gonna make a round donut these are the ones that we loosely pre shape before I'm gonna take him out of here put a little bit of flour in the top yeah and the easiest way to do this is you take your elbow you go into the center of the slope and you work it around so you have that hole in the center and then you're just gently going to elongate this let it rest for a second and go to this second one and then just by going around your hand you can start to it elongate this don't pull too fast and go back the next one you do the same thing and one last time elongated take the bread upside down and place it on here let that rest for about 40 minutes and then it's ready to bake these we can call a trifold so what we're gonna do is we're going to take our this has been shaped two times already loosely the second time we're gonna put a flower up on top D Cassatt and then we take a dowel and we're going to extend a little tongue out we're gonna rotate it we're going to take another point here and do the same thing if the dough is a little sticky don't hesitate to put a little flour up on top let's go to the first one one more time so we want to make sure it sticks right in here so just put a little bit of water on here and then we're gonna take a little bit of fan release and just running around the outer lips then you take that and you fold it up then taking a little flour into a basket take this and you place it in here so this is called a topic ta which base that means a pouch usually referred to tobacco pouch but I'm not going to endorse tobacco smoking here so what we're gonna do is just make a pouch same thing again you degassed this I'm gonna use a little larger rolling pin and I'm going to extend one side of the lip on here then just to make sure that it fits now would take our pan release spray to the outer edge flip it over then making sure you have some flour in here you take this and you proof it upside down in the basket so here we have two baguettes roll them on here and because we want the floured surface side up we don't rotate it around to leave that side up so an easier way to do that is you actually flip it over pick it up and then roll it off of there and then whenever you got back out to make sure that they're nice and straight when you put them down these do not have to plow on it so we can take them right from here pick them up and place them down on this one we want to add this side off so I'm going to flip it over first pick it up so we got the right side up we're going to place it down here I'm going to use this tool to make three incisions [Music] here I'm going to cut this light and epi and then I'm gonna go to the outside over here [Music] you [Music] you", "eQLTJLF89A4": "hey what's up everyone deserves to know what a really great fresh baguette right out of the oven tastes like today I'm gonna show you how to make one [Music] let's be totally honest outside of France the word baguette is used very loosely and I'm not here to police and call people a lot of fake baguettes but to me a bag that means one very specific thing we're talking about flour water salt and yeast that's fermented to make something that's cracker e toasty creamy and tender all at the same time in my mind the place to start when you're talking about a really great baguette is how we ferment it our baguette is going to be paying tribute to a classic style pre ferment which is called a Jewish a poolish is basically this flour and water that we mixed together ahead of time with a little bit of yeast and we let it ripen on the countertop overnight before we mix that into our final bread dough for our Polish we're gonna mix together 150 grams of bread flour and 150 grams of room-temperature water so that we're gonna add a very small pinch of yeast once all that stirred up to combine we're gonna let it sit on the countertop overnight for about 12 to 16 hours the next morning when we come back our polish smells really sweet it's very yeasty and it's all boozy and full of gas in my mind making a Polish is the ideal way to build a ton of flavor and complexity into a yeasted dough without over fermenting it or making it tired and sluggish now we're gonna move into the beginning part of our mixer so grab your stand mixer or a stainless steel bowl if you're doing this by hand which is entirely possible by the way into that bowl we're gonna measure 240 grams of warm water all of the right polish that we ripen to overnight and 400 grams of bread flour AP flour will definitely work here too if that's all you have but I like bread flour here for you guys at home mainly because it makes the shaping part of this bag and a little bit easier later on we're gonna start by mixing this on low speed just until things are well combined at this point we're gonna move this dough into a quick 20 minute Auto lease to slowly hydrate this flour for a quick refresher on what Otto Lee's is and why we do it check out the sourdough tips video from a few weeks back I'll link to that down below once everything is combined we're gonna cover the bowl with a tea towel just to keep things from drying out we're gonna let that hang out and on at least for about 20 minutes and after that we're gonna come back and add two grams of yeast and 10 grams of malt powder we're gonna start mixing on low to get that combined and hydrated before we add our salt mul powder is not a hundred percent necessary but it does go a long way in replicating a pro-level baguette this is just one of the small adjustments I've made to this formula to make it a little bit more friendly to the home baker most professional bread bakeries have access to a flower called malted flour this just means that a very small percentage of the flour is supplemented with malted or sprouted barley flour adding multiplier increases it's ferment ability but it also gives our crust that distinctive brittle shiny almost dark red crust that we really want in a harsh style bread especially a baguette I got this stuff for like seven bucks on Amazon so it's kind of like my bee man's home bread hack 2020 Edition once our yeast and Mulder is welcomed by and we're gonna add in 11 grams of salt I'm gonna continue to mix this on medium low speed for about 2 minutes at that point I'm going to turn up my mixer to about medium-high and knead for an additional two to three minutes or until the dough clears the bowl and starts to slap the sides a little bit so there's a real art and science to mixing dough out there for sure but small batch home dough mixing is just a matter of making it strong enough so give it a hard time in the bowl to get there maybe about four minutes total at that point we're gonna wrap it up with plastic wrap and we're gonna set a 30-minute timer after that thirty minutes we're gonna give this door one strength-building fold I like to stretch the dough out till I feel real tension and then just fold it back over itself after five to six of those folds we're gonna grab this whole massive dough and kind of just fold it up under itself to create a nice taut shiny top at this point the dough should be plenty strong for a baguette but if you're doing this by hand you might want to add a second fold at the 60 minute mark just to make sure that it's getting all the way strong mine's feeling good so I'm gonna move on we're gonna set a two hour timer well let those fermenting I'm gonna mention that for real baguettes at home you probably need a lame a lame is just the term we use for a fancy razor blade holder that bakers used to cut slits in the bread for these bad gets to open properly and get the look and texture of a real baguette we need uniformed slanted cuts that go pretty deep into the dough owing to this one down below if you're interested this one came with a leather blade cover which is very helpful for safety as these are super sharp so stay frosty with these things okay so it's been two hours in our dough is roughly doubled in size it looks alive and is pre gaseous I'm gonna flip this dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and I'm gonna divide it into four 225 grams pieces I turned this into a four piece recipe just so you could have some extra baguettes to either share with friends or even freeze them I figure any time you're gonna go through the trouble of making and fermenting something it might as well be a big batch so that future you can benefit from your hard work now once we've got our dough cut into four 225 grams sized pieces we're gonna gently turn them into little tot rounds this is called pre shaping we do this mainly to give ourselves uniform pieces of dough to start shaping with the move here is to use your left hand with the dough scraper to push the dough and your right hand to kind of pull it back towards you and tuck it under you don't want to go too crazy getting these too strong and tight the dough's pretty dry and doesn't need a lot of help we're just looking for a nice simple round shape once we got these pre shaped we're gonna let these stand here and rest for 20 minutes under a tea towel after 20 minutes rest time we're gonna come back to shape these baguettes to properly proof a shaped baguette you're gonna need a little piece of fabric called a Koosh this is a pretty rustic canvas cloth that we use to separate and support the little torpedoes of dough once we've shaped them if you want the real-deal baguettes set up at home I definitely recommend grabbing one of these off Amazon I think this one was like 12 bucks and it's very similar to what we would use in the bakery so the real challenge of making a great baguette is in this step the shaping step okay to start we're gonna clear the work surface off by flipping the other three dough balls into a lightly floured surface out of the way once you got your single dough ball we're gonna lightly flour the top and flip it on to that side so that the bottom is facing up this way we're just gonna gently degassed it and push it into a general rectangle shape starting from the top I'm gonna use the tips of my fingers to press and roll this dough over up and into itself each time I roll it on pressing it down and pinching it forward just to seal it up now we're gonna be rolling this tube that we've made back and forth putting pressure in the seam with our thumbs when we push forward and pressure with our fingertips when we pull it back towards us this rolling hand triangle move is how we stretch these out into a baguette shape is we get these stretched out more and more we use a little bit more pressure on the ends to taper it off that's how we get those signature points on the baguette be sure to keep this seam side down and use a little bit of pressure from our finger tips and thumbs when we're rolling this back and forth once we've shaped our baguette to roughly 12 inches in length we're gonna transfer this over to our floured Koosh the dough needs to be supported on both sides in two that we're gonna be pulling the canvas up with a little bit of slack creating a little bit of hill on either side that acts as a barrier from the other baguettes and also as a support [Music] we're gonna shape up the rest of these baguettes and we're gonna Koosh um up just as I described before to proof these we're gonna fold the linen over itself just to wrap the whole thing up make sure the sides are flipped over enough to create a little bit of support and tension on the outside baguettes almost if there was an ghost baguette out there holding it up once we wrapped up we're gonna let those proof on the counter for about 45 minutes at this point I'm gonna preheat my oven to 550 and put my baking stone in there to preheat this might seem like a really high temperature but home ovens aren't very powerful so we're overshooting on temp a little bit just to help replicate the thermal mass of a deck oven at a pro bakery so after 45 minutes our baguettes have risen quite a bit when I poke them with my finger you can see an indent but that indent kind of pops back that lets me know they're kind of at that perfect sweet spot of proofed so to make these baguettes we're gonna pull out our baking stone and put it on something that can handle the heat I've got a metal rack here I'm gonna give the stone some semolina flour to prevent sticking and then I'm going to transfer these baguettes over using what I call a flip board this is basically just a sturdy piece of cardboard from a box in my basement but anything the length of a baguette that's kind of sturdy and flat will do and then slide it on to the stone we're gonna repeat this for both baguettes once I've got these on the stone we need to arrange them a little bit just so we can make sure they fit under the lid once we're all situated we're gonna grab our lame and make three to four very deliberate diagonal slices on an angle and after we scored properly we're gonna grab a lid mine is a stainless steel bowl this cover is necessary to trap all the steam we need to get these baguettes to spring properly in the oven once I've got this stone covered I'm gonna load the whole thing into the oven and turn it down to 485 degrees I'm gonna bake this for 10 minutes with the bowl as a cover during this time the baguettes are gonna spring and rise and after that 10 minutes we're gonna carefully remove the bowl and finish baking these on 485 for an additional 8 to 10 minutes I usually go the full 10 minutes because I like my baguettes quite dark you know they're done when the outside begins to have a dark tan almost reddish quality to it when it's got that good dark color and it feels hollow on the inside we're gonna pull it from the oven and let it cool for about ten minutes the only bread I eat hot is usually a bad gas we worked really hard for that brittle crispy crust by making a foolish using mount powder and fermenting this whole thing very carefully so it's never gonna be better than after that first ten minutes so grab some fresh grassy salty butter smear it all over and let's eat some [Music] choice T yeah so that's a classic French baguette at home there's a few special moves here both a little bit of practice you can totally do it it's totally worth it I had a ton of fun breaking this down for you guys today if you have any questions leave them in the comments down below I will help you guys out the best that I can as always thank you guys so much for your time and attention thanks for sticking around and we'll see you next time", "W5S6_8xxnaU": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "7Rf4x5yPbX0": "hi I'm a Jesus Jack here baked which I thought co-taught UK bringing you your weekly bread making tip every single Thursday and this week is super practical how to shape up a bats heart roll it [Music] hey you guys welcome back to making jackie youtube channel where i share a little bit my bread marketing expertise every single Thursday to have you make amazing bread at home well if you are new welcome you've got about a hundred and five or six videos to catch up and don't watch the first ten cuz they were not the best not my best work watch it don't judge me on it so I batard is the long loaf with slightly rounded slightly pointed ends if you so wish let's cut to the table I'll show you exactly how it's done okay here's a tone I've mixed in needed s been resting for an hour as 80% white flour 20% brown and it's a 65% hydration for those of you interested I'll need to spec underneath it's one kilo of flour and so I'm gonna make four sort of medium sized batteries out of it I've got my break reject dough scraper and my pot of flour there in case I need it or dust in the tops nice and flowery anyway so it's gonna come straight out the bowl a standard onto the table upside down from here what I'm gonna do is just push it out to make it easy for myself to be like cut into four pieces with the fledge the mitre scraper like this I'm not gonna weigh these you could weigh them if you wanted to you really wanted to get them bang on exactly the same you could weigh them out we've spoken about that before but for this purpose of this I'm just gonna cut it into four pieces like so now that we're here I'm gonna do a pre shape this is the pre shape we spoken about in another video yet again right just gonna make it into a nice ball like this exactly the same as what we have done in the past right take a piece of fold over make it into a ball so they're all uniform shape is much more easier and shape stuff from a nice round ball instead of some weird triangle wherever it is when it comes out after you've cut it so I'm shape these roughly into bowls like this now a bit of cupping underneath but this terney and cutting just to tighten out even off nicely and now we've got a nice bouncy ball number one a pop up there and the same with this one with the guessing slightly we get an attention back and we're gonna let it rest there before the final shape we can't shape it now so you bouncing we can't shape it we have to lay rest up and relax once again and then we go for the final shape so imma leave it here for about 10-15 minutes it's probably closer to 15 I'd imagine they rest up with a bear flower top cover it up again with my cloth it's gonna sit there relax ready for the final shape okay let's have a look oh yeah nice bit more delicate a bit more spread out ready for final shape so starting with the one I started with they'll release it from the table I scraper upside down onto the table it shouldn't stick so I shouldn't really need any more flour once again stitch myself up with the surface let me move this around will resume there we go it's got a bit of extra space here now to work with just gonna dust underneath a little bit make sure it doesn't stick all the time now what I'm gonna do here that just push it into that circle not being particularly forceful with it and now I'm gonna pick up where there would be two top corners here and here like this and then I'm gonna fold them in like that this bit then becomes our middle that comes down right and now I'm gonna roll and push and roll and push exactly like shaping a loaf video except I'm gonna bring my thumb's inwards and push everything in to get this bowl G bit in the middle let me show you what I'm talking about by this I'll push I'll push push push pull push squeeze up that seam up into the table so it's nice and there we go now we've got our shape now I can give it a little roll on this one too just to make it a bit more uniform and then with a seam side underneath that is our batard all ready to go Matt this duster up now on all over and pop it up here out of the way up there just cover number two upside down onto the surface push push push push push is sticky so it up now always check it's not sticking underneath take where there would be two top corners if it was a square fold I mean this bit comes down roll push push push push push push squeeze up a scene okay let's go over to it's not this similar to a loaf of video but I don't want those square in say I want the pointy ends and to get that we need to redistribute this mass into the centre roll push rubbish rubbish you can roll these really points if you want to like this that's quite nice if you want to do that get that artisan look when I get the little bit of a dark color on the ends that's quite nice actually when you get that pop out there give it a good old dust and the last one push it down top two corners in fold that middle roll push roll push pull push pull push pull push pull push roll the ends and there we go so considering I didn't weigh those out first they've come out not too bad in terms of consistent size I'm quite happy with wherever you do next whether your stone baking whether you're proving on a tray or baking that's how you do your lovely but sod shape and there you have it that's how to shake a batard and just fly the rest of my shaping videos it's not as simple as you might think it's not as easy as just rolling stuff up and making the ends point so you've got to redistribute the dough in a specific way in order to hold that shape until the end listen thanks so much for coming back every single week if you haven't subscribed yet have a think about it maybe watch a couple more videos and then have a think about it I look forward to seeing you next week for another bread making - see ya there it is the classic backside thanks to stopping by this week to watch the bake the jack video of the week the batter is increasingly becoming one of my most favorite shapes of the moment don't forget if there's anything you need bread making bits and bobs scrapers in cloths you can find their bake with Jack coder UK forward slash shop shipping to you all over the world see you next week [Music]", "iai3Af_Q1OE": "today we're going to make baguettes but we're gonna make it using a pre front and this pre front is going to be a poolish so in preparation for doing that we're gonna end up having to mix this and then let it ferment over a certain period of time this is actually recorded today before because what I want to do is be able to show you what it's gonna look like now and then the stages that it ferments over until tomorrow so a poolish poolish is the same amount of flour and the same amount of water and a small percentage of yeast the the attributes to what it's going to give to the the baguette itself is giving a little bit more extensibility so ability to kind of stretch into a longer shape without having as much elasticity the the ability to kind of retract on itself it's also going to help with an open core open cell structure and then obviously flavor okay so we're gonna end up this is thirty percent of the overall flour weight okay and the same amount of water and then a small pinch of yeast and in doing this leaves that it's going to ferment overnight approximately like 14 to 16 hours and it's going to give a very almost like a sweet smell and flavor and it'll transcend in the baguette and you will be extremely satisfied with making that baguette as I mentioned it's only gonna be a very very very small amount of yeast so I'm actually just gonna put a little bit in here and it's literally just a pinch all right since it's gonna ferment for such a long period of time you really really do not need a whole lot and this now like I said it's 447 grams of water 447 grams of flour that I'll scale into here I'm gonna mix the water in the yeast together first just to make sure that they're it's all in there and it's it's not really gonna dissolve yet a whole lot but if you mix it together the water was at about 62 degrees to 65 degrees again I'm in Florida so the overall temperature in the air is probably around 70 to 75 in the house and so I since it is going to ferment overnight I don't want it to go too fast and it's gonna create this nice flavor so like I said it's between about 62 to 65 degrees that I scaled it off all right so now I need to clear it to zero again okay actually it was okay so now we have our 447 grams of flour for 47 grams of water our little pinch of yeast and we're just going to mix this that's such you can use your hand or the spoon but all we're really doing is it's not mixing a dough in any respect it is just getting this hydrated and then making sure that all of it is combined so again just make sure that all of the flour is hydrated you're not actually developing any gluten or anything of that nature by the mixing process and since it is the same amount of water same amount of flour it's going to be very liquidy as such so what we have is this right here consistent this is likely to it's gonna at least double almost triples so it'll literally be at the top when it does it's gonna you know have lots of bubbles that are inside it and you'll see a kind of doming and then slightly retracting all right so yesterday what we did was mix the poolish that is going to now be incorporated into the final dough the rest of the dry ingredients and obviously the water and for the overall formula we had a 2500 gram total dough wait all right it was a hundred percent flour 65% water 2% salt and 0.7% yeast instant yeast we took out 30% of the flour and then the same amount of water a little pinch of yeast let that ferment overnight so that was 447 grams of flour 447 grams of water and again just like it's a little less than a gram of yeast this had been mixed just by hand actually I used a spoon and it was allowed to ferment we're at about 16 hours right now right so as I mentioned it would have doubled if not even come close to tripling in volume and you want to get it at its peak which means it's gonna be startin to dome and then when a domes and it starts to recede ever so slightly that's when it's ready mine actually went all the way up to the very top of the container and thankfully I did put it on a plate because if I just keep this going it will continue to ferment and overflow what I want to do is just show all right and you can see how nicely this ferment it has a absolutely fantastic smell aroma and it's gonna add a tremendous amount of flavor plus it's gonna have some physical dough characteristics that's gonna allow it to be easier for baguettes where it's going to be extensible so when we're shaping it's gonna be able to stretch much easier then something that's a little bit more tight and a little bit you know different physical characteristics so what we're gonna do is with our mixing bowl pick the Polish see how nice and lively that is all right now this is the scaled water which is 523 grams best way to kind of clean out your container pour that in there and then all you got to do is just kind of scrape down your container and you'll get 99% of everything out okay as I was very common in bakeries to do excellent all right so you can see the water and the poolish right we're going to add dry I mean actually it's the same container to ferment the dough get the yeast okay so flowers at about 1400 or 1043 grams yeast about nine grams and the assault at 30 grams all right put this on the mixer and then if you remember make sure you've got it locked in on both sides here and then you're gonna push it down and it's a little clip that's behind if you don't do that it may shake the bowl and even come off again put your dough hook on turn it make sure that this is also locked in and solid lift up your bowl and then keep it at a low speed in the beginning [Applause] water temperature was at about 65 degrees there's gonna be some friction and temperature that's gonna come from the filter foolish also the flour temperature and the room temperature itself and then the friction of the mixer you're still looking for approximately 75 even on up to that 77 degrees at the most together the range between 73 to 77 degrees is good for baguettes all right so it's going through that pickup stage you're starting to bring it together okay so you can see it as it's picking up this has been about two minutes I'm gonna continue to let it incorporate to another pilot for five minutes and then I'll go into second speed to start to develop the bit okay so our dough's been mixing in first speed or low speed for about seven minutes total you can see that it's fully incorporated and now what we're going to do is go into a higher speed what we've just call our second speed which is going to be the development of the dough so these DS strengthening it's gonna stretch and pull to overlap the gluten strands so it gets stronger and stronger so we're just gonna increase that up and then this is gonna run for about three to three minutes at most they'll finished mixing what we did was about seven minutes and first speed low speed around two or so on a KitchenAid mixer and then I moved it up to about six to seven as a second speed to develop the dough and that was at about three minutes right this is I never on this KitchenAid mixer try to go to full development because they tend to destroy the dough or try to it also creates too much heat so often what I'll do is is mix it just slightly less and then I'll give it a little bit of a fold if necessary on the bench this is a slightly lower hydration than the straight dough baguette or a straight dough bread that we made the other day yeah so it's gonna be a little bit stiffer and you can see it in in pretty good shape right all right so I said it's not a hundred percent developed and that's on intended as such and what we're gonna do just give it a light fold very similar to what we had done before and then just kind of bring all this together and just put it in your proofing container all right want to check my dough temperature which is essential and we're at 77 degrees I'm at the high end and I need to be thoughtful about where this would lead if I did not get that but it's gonna ferment for anywhere from 50 minutes to about an hour maybe even an hour and 10 minutes it's my room temperature is pretty warm today it's about 75 degrees so I'm gonna check this kind of the lower minute side and then we'll see this but it'll it'll come very close to doubling in size as well so we've let our dough to ferment and it's been about an hour and 10 to 15 minutes or so pretty happy with the way it looks you can see that it has for the most part doubled in volume could even see kind of where this has created a lot of gas and this when you open the lid you'll actually start to see understand what we talked about on aromas and this as compared to a straight which we did in Prior video this now has a tremendous amount of fermentation we were able to ferment 30% of the flour overnight 16 hours approximately and now an additional hour and a you know 20 minutes and the bulk fermentation it's it's much lighter much area and it actually just it smells fantastic so what we're gonna do is take a little bit dusting flour just to kind of ease it out and we're gonna divide these we have to do a pre shape prior to shaping just take your scraper and just kind of loosen it up all right so what you can see is it's much more lively than what a straight dough is and it has a lot more just kind of overall gas and definitely flavor so all right so we're gonna turn the scale on and I'm gonna scale in grams still but what we are going to do is about seven ounces to two hundred it's about two hundred grams and then also we're gonna shape these out to around fifteen inches reason being I can only do fifteen inches is because that's the depth of the oven I can't really load a baguettes sideways so we can maximize this at about 15 inch amount but if you're to do it a traditional baguettes let's see what you would do at the competition the coupe Demond generally those are going to be at 250 grams total weight which is about nine ounces and anywhere from 50 to 55 centimeters which range is around 20 to 22 and a half inches right this like I said we have to adjust to our oven we are baking at home so you know this is still be just fine all right so my scales and grams and I'm going to scale this at 200 grams approx again you can be smart when you're dividing your dough and kind of cut it into a strip all right and then cut off pieces and again don't cut directly on the scale itself because you can hurt yourself right so that's 200 grams that's it here [Music] all right 200 grams if you have more than one piece why don't you lay it down on the opposite side so those pieces start to come together before you're ready to to appreciate okay so we did finish dividing the dough itself we had 2,500 grams of dough divided into 200 grams each as an individual piece it's a little bit less than what you would normally do for a baguette but you know like I said since the oven is smaller I'm gonna have to adjust the size of the baguette to what we're gonna end up doing but we have to pre shape these first and so if it was sitting like this just flip it over okay only a light amount of flour is necessary we're gonna kind of put it into a little log all right that's it it's only gonna sit like this and it's a very simple free shape we're not doing anything other than just kind of folding it over itself so that we can get this in a position that when we do shape it's going to be much more successful so we had a chance to not only pre-shape but let them relax approximately 15 minutes it's going to give us a chance to just very lightly shape the breads by allowing them to relax as I said these are smaller than a traditional baguette and all that we are going to have is just our little log here okay just a light bit of flour this is our proofing Koosh it's made out of like a kind of a flax linen and they'll proof just easily so very similar to what we did before we're going to fold over I like to kind of use my thumb's to press in okay and now we have our little bit additional log start with one hand in the middle all right and then you're gonna start to with even pressure from all fingers at once so you keep the baguette itself even okay and then you're just gonna kind of taper it a little bit at the ends all right and that's that's really it so a lot of people will proof these either the seam side up and do so to let it dry out a little bit here or you can even dust and put flour on the couch so you can have a kind of a floured top to it and then what we're gonna do is just give a little fold here and we're just gonna keep going through Rebekah's you don't want to spend too much time doing it and honestly the least amount you put pressure on this and least amount of movement the better there's a little bit of stickiness you can just kind of run it through a little flour but you don't want too much because then it starts to slide all over all right so we'll just keep doing this if you did a really good job it's hard to see the scene I push it away from you as I say you can kind of use your thumbs there's a little bit of tackiness it's easier and best to that roll it through but I always leave this area without flour because as I said they will start to dry out and slide and it makes it much more difficult to shape this out all right there we are so what we're going to do is go through each of the baguettes and I'm going to continue to put them on here these are going to proof approximately again 50 minutes or so maybe up to an hour and 10 minutes Baggett's had a chance to prove about an hour an hour and five minutes or so and if you look at these it's a test proof they've had a chance to obviously expand but then what you want to do with your your hand or your finger you give a slight indentation it's there and if it starts to slowly expand out and leave a slight indentation as there is right here okay and you'll see it on the side as well right so for us to be able to load these baguettes as I've done in a prior video I used a sheet pan a little dusting flour on the top here so it slides off we've had the proofing Koosh that has been able to proof these this is a really nice one that I was able to find online and then a transfer peel all right you can't you can but it would not be advisable especially if it's a full-length baguette to pick up a loaf of Baghdad while it's proved so we use what's called a transfer peel instead of buying this online actually got the hardware store bought it for three dollars cut it sanded it and it's much easier to do it that way and then we're also going to need our LOM you know our scoring blade all right so to do so it's going to hold your transfer peel pull back the baguette couche and this is the seam up if you remember so let's first do this if these are just even slightly tacky just to make sure that you're not going to be stuck to anything just do that all right we have a nice little baguette all right same here now we only have space in an oven of this size I can do four maybe six across I'm gonna do four right now what's essential though is that we're gonna score our bread load it steam it and then do it again a second time on the other side of the oven and when you're scoring a baguette it's very essential we're gonna do only three scores on this because of the size of the bread generally it's anywhere from five or six sometimes seven depending on the length but you want it at a relatively flat angle you're only going to use about the top quarter to top third of the tip of the blade all right and you're gonna slide it just kind of give a little sliver into it and it's gonna be at a diagonal like this not across too much and not down the line nearly as much just slight angle coming across like this all right so if you can see they overlap it's gonna be about a third each you want to try to keep it within what I call the shoulders so each score starts and ends within that shoulder all right and it's just gonna be that little flap that's gonna come up like this all right so we'll do the same here the speed of what you do it is always what's helpful and then we're gonna load this into the oven all right a little bit of steam for right now and we will steam more and when we look a second set it baguette but you want to go fast controlled speed actually is what I should say it flipped over flip it back and then over and all you do is just kind of lightly gently bring it up okay the rest will load after this and since I didn't catch it in the beginning I can go back not a big issue [Music] you're loading it also you're trying to do that with quite a bit of speed [Music] all right now it's gonna fill the oven with steam it's gonna be able to develop up and over the bread it's going to help to allow the bread to expand properly over the first few minutes and then the crust will begin to set the steam will evaporate all right right so we had a chance to load and bake all of our baguettes and they turned out quite nice these are not a full-length baguette this is be what you would pretty much call a demi baguette they're about 1314 inches and I'm pretty satisfied with them the the steam on these had turned out quite nice there's a nice golden color to these and you can see that the the scores have opened up nicely and and they've they've pretty much done what they're supposed to do I did have one baguette that did not receive as much steam as the other and it's a good example to show what it means when you don't have steam and why we need to do it okay if you can notice on this it's a much duller color and and it's you know just overall appearance is very flat it didn't get that nice gold and shine and that's indicative of a lack of steam it had enough to expand and baked actually fairly well but a little disappointed on that but the you know the rest of the baguettes have have done nicely and if you noticed we were able to put three scores on normally it's about five on up to seven and a full-length baguette but satisfied overall and it's really just about as simple as it is we make a pre from it the night before mix it doesn't take much on mixing let it ferment shaping takes a little bit of practice but not a whole lot and then then eventually scoring and loading does but that will come with practice just remember to keep your scores within the shoulder of the bread and at a diagonal and they overlap at about a third each score all right so I'd like to say thank you for watching our video and and again subscribe to the channel there's gonna be more and more videos that are gonna be coming that's gonna get more complicated and so the first you know several videos are starting to lay a foundation the next video what you're gonna see is breakdown of what bakers percent is and and it relatively simple explanation as to what it is but it's it's very much necessary to understand when we start to make other breads and then I hope to go into another video after that about ingredients and then bring it back to building up sourdoughs and then going into sourdough bread making all right so I'd like to say thank you and if you would like to follow any of these videos or other references you can see us at Kingdom bread - Tampa com", "8TCUtaqnLq4": "hi I'm Steve and welcome to my kitchen today I'd like to show you how to make bag s like this these baguettes will complement any meal I'll be using fourteen ounces Co tap water 1/4 TSP instant yeast 1 and 1/2 tsp salt 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil give it a quick stir to combine now bread flour 3 and 1/2 cups I start out with 1/2 I put it on the side so that it doesn't splash and then 1/2 through I'll stir to combine it's beginning to come together and there it comes I'll scrape the side of the bowl to get the dry flour in with the rest and then I'm going to tumble it a little bit there's some dry flour on the bottom and if you tumble it you get the wet from the top to touch the dry and when it touches the dry it will be absorbed into the ball there we go all we need to do now is cover the bowl with plastic wrap and it's ready to proof dough should be proofed for 8 to 24 hours I generally proof overnight on the kitchen counter the dough is proofed overnight it's time to make the baguettes as you can see the dough is risen and more than doubled in size I'm going to dig ass pull and stretch bring the dough down okay I'm gonna straight scrape the side of the bowl get all the dough into the ball okay now I want to roll the coat I want to add some flour to the dough the dough is very difficult to handle because it's wet if you add the flour you make it easier to handle this by the way has one reason why you don't have to weigh the flour if you keep adding flour and adjusting flour it's not that precise this is a very forgiving recipe and all you need to do is add the followers needed okay I'm gonna put some flour on the counter rollable go out on it now I'm going to divide it I'm going to divide it into three parts before I do it-- it I spread it out a little bit because it'll be a little bit easier to divide it into thirds okay I now have thirds next part some of these are larger than the others no problem see this looks a little small that looks good that looks the biggest so what I'm going to do is take a piece from this one and add it to that one okay now I'm going to shape these just like you would shape rolls you take it and you tuck it underneath and you add flour as it gets sticky on the top just going to tuck it underneath got it add some flowers these are quite sticky as you add flour they're not as sticky either way they will absorb a lot of water that's partly a lot of slower because they are quite wet yeah it's no problem okay I'm going to add a little more flour to work surface here my next step is I'll take each of these I made them round now I want to make them a little bit more into a log this is called pre shaping in other words I want it longer than that to be my baguette but for right now this will do just fine then I'm going to rest it for 10 to 15 minutes what that 10 to 15 minutes is going to do his adult will loosen up and it'll be easier to make it longer [Music] and whatever I do I cover it with a lint-free towel tennis ready this time to finish shaping the baguettes let's finish shaping the dough okay then use a little more flour gonna start with one right here well now to spray the pan first gently by the way I do it over the sink okay and here we go just link pinion them a little bit there we go they stuck to the counter so because the dough is quite wet no problem that will add a little more flour to the work surface bottom line is we were able to make them longer because they'd rested and they're ready to bake all I need to do was cover him with a flour sack towel to let him finish proofing cover baguettes with a lint-free towel and proof for 30 to 60 minutes before dough is fully proofed move oven rack to middle of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees it's time to bake the bread baguette should be baked for 25 minutes at 450 degrees the baguettes are ready let's take a look and here they are still a little hot here we go there's a nice little bag yet and I love baguettes fresh and hot from the oven I taught off the end has served it with extra virgin olive oil this recipe others like that are in my noni bread cookbook cookbooks are available on my website no need bread central.com and amazon.com thanks for watching", "7jx_JH69YPQ": "hi today we plan on making rustic baguettes and when I say rustic it's gonna be is where you have a traditional baguette which would be flour water salt yeast or if you do it with a pre ferment of poolish in general this is going to add one more complexity to it actually to where this is going to have not only polish but it's also going to have a Levon and then just to make it a little bit more deeper flavor than you would normally put 3 percent whole wheat flour in there as well now with the whole wheat flour or any other additional flour flavor you can do you can do 1 to 3% depending on the strength of it like corn flour or if so even when you do something like that or even this whole wheat it's it's relatively cool to take it and give it a little bit of a roasting so you can put it on a sheet pan put it in the oven very very specifically watch it kind of flip it around a little bit it only take probably 30 seconds or something but if you do that you can add even a deeper flavor today I'm just gonna go with just the 3 percent whole wheat 97% white flour then I've got a white liquid Livan and a white polish okay and then of course salt little pinchy a still even though it's gonna be leavened much with the the pre ferments hmm but it's also gonna be at what's the 0.2 percent on commercial yeast alright so here I first want to show what the Levon and the poolish look like and show you when they're at full strength and when you want to use them so right so what we have on the left is the poolish and you can see this almost it goes between double and triple it's that's height and volume after you first mix it and when it comes to full of maturation it's going to come up and then just start to slightly recede and you can see where it's slowly coming down here and you can you have about maybe a two hour window from when that's very very - when it's going to start to kind of lose its its strength and then on the Levon which is our white liquid Levin on the right side here that's very similar this will continue to ferment you've got a longer window to use several hours - for even six hours depending on the temperature of the room and such so when you have the two and you combine the two together you're gonna get that wonderful extensibility that you gave it to poolish and then you get the that kind of strengthening and then also that Chu with the Levon we're only gonna go with a small percentage of the Levon with the majority of the percentage come from the poolish for the reason that again you're looking for a light and airy baguette but to give it that a little bit more of a country your rustic flavor to it with the Levon with the Chu with the strength you'll still get that wonderful cell structure but you're going to get that that that deeper flavor all right so let's so let's get back and we're gonna start scaling this off and mixing okay so with the poolish the best way to go about kind of removing this from the container take your water kind of run it around the edge is the best and it'll loosen it up enough to just kind of slide out all right all right you get the majority of that out right in the beginning all right now I need to scale off 209 grams of the liquid LaVon okay so that's coming in at about 14% when I do that so it's just adding that that touch of LaVon yes and then all we're gonna need now is dries as well as you know salt yeast alright a little bit of the remaining water as well of course now this is all does that have mixed so far in these videos it's gonna be a slow mix and this still doesn't have any enrichment so there's no additional fats so the best way to go about this especially on a KitchenAid mixer mix it at a long slow speed with the bulk fermentation do some folds to build up the strength the mixer itself will not develop the dough in the way that doesn't damage all right so best way to use this much more of your hands after you get the incorporation stage which is during the first six seven minutes so it's gonna mix just again about six seven minutes I'm gonna come back looking for a target temperature of about 75 to 77 degrees and and then we'll see alright so we got about six and a half minutes or so looks like this is developing pretty well I didn't really want to go any further and the one concern that I always have mixing on these kitchen aids is the friction so the dough temperature can get too high if I mix it for too long so again we're looking for between 75 77 degrees yeah and again yeah that's so I'm at at 78 degrees a little bit higher than I you know would normally be projecting but it's not an issue it's not out of control but again that that friction and that's continuing of development is not necessary and so with this dough we're gonna bulk ferment for approximately an hour and a half maybe an hour and 45 minutes okay and again depending on your dough temperature this is not necessary to fold but I'm just gonna kind of put it in a position that it's together better and what we're gonna do with this I'm more than likely going to fold this at about 45 minutes okay so let it ferment come back check it again again each and every time you mix the dough and when you do it more consistently you'll know what to expect but you have to get a feel for what the dough is gonna do and what you're expecting it to happen in the you know the next hour - - so each and every time you do this pay attention whether you need a fold or you don't need a fold or if you need to hurry up on the timing and such okay so going in at about 45 minutes the dough is coming along very nicely it's gonna be let me say about an hour and a half total but what I want to do is give a fold because it's not coming out of the mixer enough to be that way so all right so again just a nice long stretch all four directions okay looks very nice so given both the fold the length of the fermentation the acidity everything these are the things that helps to build up the overall strength so with very nice dough come back in about another 45 minutes and divide okay so we've get an hour actually about 45 minutes this time around and the dough looking very volume is very very nice looking forward to the way this turns out so we're gonna divide this and pre-shape as you would for baguettes and it's it's essential and how you do this the care and the steps taken when making baguettes there's a reason they use this to judge the quality of competition and bakeries and such so technique is everything this okay so now as you see this very very lively dough that's we're gonna handle with care and we're gonna divide at 280 grams that's approximately ten ounces the oven when you're baking at home the most most ovens are being basically the same for each there's only fifteen inches deep so I can't make a full baguette okay you can't load it baguettes sideways intern ovens don't even try the length of this is going to be about probably 12 13 inches so I've reduced the weight that you would normally scale a full-size baguette to like I said 280 grams which is approximately 10 10 ounces right try to cut little rectangles little squares that don't have too many pizzas added to it all right so all right cut the long strip try to cut again approximate to the size and don't cut directly on the scale so you don't damage the scale itself okay so when pre shaping that's why you need to get kind of the rectangle square we're just going to give a light little fold over to make a log okay and we're doing so with you know a very gentle touch all that gas retention that's happened during the first fermentation we want to retain it and then we'll deal with it later after we're shaping so again it's just a very gentle like now if your dough is very loose you can pre shape a little bit more aggressively to build up additional strength okay but this dough has approximately 67 percent hydration between the mixing and the folding that's all been coming along nicely so that's not something I need to worry about we're gonna let these relax for about 20 minutes and then come okay so we're gonna shape these have had a chance about 20 minutes to relax again it's it's very the steps in the process to get to making of them you know very good baguette is giving it the time the attention the detail as you're doing it it's not hard it's just kind of follow the process go along with it gentle hands all the way through and as we shape this okay you're just gonna again kind of release it from table these are a little bit smaller obviously this needs to be more like demi baguettes but we're just gonna kind of fold over and I'm gonna press in with my thumbs more than anything okay and just give it a light little fold and then okay it's seal it all right now you want to release it from the table before you start to shape so if my seam is here and I'm going down when you shape its again it's gonna be an even pressure from all fingers as you do this and what I found when you trained a lot of people doing this a lot of people like to stand on one side or stand to the other side tends to get a little bit more tapered this side little fatter this side try to keep with even pressure given that pressure all the way down to the baguette okay so I'm going to taper these a little bit more than I would for like say a traditional baguette for the more rustic look this is also going to be floured on the Koosh with the seam up so that we can have you know a nice coating of flour on the top of the baguette as well all right so again just seam up do that all right same thing again just a gentle fold over press him with your thumbs give it a little bit lease release it from the table now you can actually roll it through a little bit of flour if you need be not too much because you just basically starts sliding it okay and then go in with the taper find your seen okay that's what's important make sure that you have enough room to be able to do this so all right a few more baguettes flour on the bottom seam up all right so we've had final proof at about two hours maybe two hours ten minutes or so and what we're gonna do when we load up the baguettes is cut a couple baguettes and then I'm also gonna cut a couple epi so you'll do a little bit thing where it's it basically kind of creates a baguette into some rolls right so again with transfer peel if you remember these were proofed seam side up guys so we're gonna roll these over [Music] okay so just in general for cutting baguettes this size in particular so it's gonna be three scores four would be a little bit too much you need to get kind of an even length you score overlapping by about a quarter to a third each bag each score and keep it within the shoulder itself okay so now there's a shoulder being the sides there so it has to be overlapping like so okay for Eppie what we're gonna do is take scissors which I'll show you on this packet in particular how to do so if I'm going to score baguette again just it's gonna be three very sharp blade maybe eighth of an inch to even a sixteenth of an inch deep at an angle okay and I have them overlapping but I said about a third right now for an epi what you're gonna have is this it's going to be cutting it a scissors again at about it maybe 45 degree angle if you cut up too high like this when you need to move the bread over it's going to kind of create this little crease so what you want to do is try to get an angle and you're basically going to take your thumb go one direction your finger go the other direction you're gonna go back and forth and cut a piece so it's just gonna be like that a little bit over just let it kind of rest and fall to the side okay it's it's not necessary to force it it'll just come up like that basically what's gonna do is give it just nice kind of a roll and then instead of doing just three scores on a rustic baguette often what you'll end up doing is actually just having one long score so all the way and and just a little flap up all right so when we load this again have to be careful what you're doing steam with some ice and a little bit of water [Applause] you get a really nice result probably the bake on a home ovens about maybe 25 minutes maybe 27 depending on your oven temperature at a bakery you're generally trying to get up around maybe 21 to 23 minutes but this will take a little bit longer so about 25 minutes or so we'll check it out all right it's a rustic baguette the final bake came out very nicely with when you have the poolish you have to live on a little touch of the whole wheats a little bit longer fermentation than you wouldn't it for a you know maybe a straight dough or endo or just a traditional baguette with the pollution you get a little more depth of color a little bit more depth of flavor as well and it's gonna have a little bit chewier crumb okay it's still gonna have a thin crisp crust but it's gonna be a little bit chewier crumb and overall it's just it's just a different approach to making a baguette it's another way to think about fermentation it's another way to think about how to create something in your mind that may be a little bit different so try the ideas put but different preformance different sours different things together don't overcomplicate it that's the main thing just make it a 1 a 2 you know possibly situation maybe a third but that's it don't muddy it up that's the idea but wonderful baguettes okay nice little Demi's that you can do in your home oven I actually had more than this my kids loved eating him so I lost a few on the way but I think you'll do the same as you're making yours the EPI is well very simple to do you got a nice little roll that you can kind of just break off and it actually nice other thing to do with this sprinkled with a little water prior to baking and sprinkle some sea salt on it or even even like an herb or something but sea salt matches so fantastically with it you break it off and it's a nice little roll that you can add to a salad to something of that nature so overall very happy with it follow the videos look at the whole spectrum because each one has been building on another concept so if you watch the whole series that we put together I think this is number 13 you can follow it at Kingdom bread - Tampa at the YouTube channel and then as well at our website which is Kingdom bread - Tampa calm all right so enjoy you", "fKRZOpHvcdI": "hi it's Martin dinar low and today we're filming at the King Arthur Studios no one's been here so it's safe for us to come over and do some baking and we need it because they have extra ovens and today we're going to make a pile of classic baguettes okay so let's do this and again thank you sir and again we're doing the classic baguettes these are classic French baguettes recipe is on the website so yesterday evening I started a poolish a poolish is a type of free permit if you're new to bread baking you may not have made bread with a pre firm it before there's a really good blog that I wrote on the King Arthur website about pre ferments and different types of pre ferments and why you should use them and all of those things so this is a little bit of flour and water and yeast that we mixed yesterday and you can see that you see all these bubbles in here you can tell that it's active right this is equal parts by weight flour and water so what that did overnight was the yeast begin to eat sugar which is in the flour and they produce flavor as a byproduct of that process so it's called fermentation right so we've been getting the fermentation okay so foolish in the bowl and I'm going to pour my water in water is lukewarm and I'm just gonna start a combined the recipe says put everything in the bowl and just go and that's another way to do it too but when I'm mixing by hand I have a tendency to break things up a little bit because I want to make sure that everything is homogeneous my hands in a mixer we tend to let it run for a while and it does some of the work for us but I'm being a little bit more cautious than that okay so I'm gonna put the east end and salt in salt and yeast are okay together it's a myth that they're not okay together they actually work just fine no one's gonna get hurt this dough will spend a much bunch of time with the yeast and the salt in the same place so it's okay if they begin that relationship right now it's not a big deal just mix to combine I'm using instant yeast I always use instant dry yeast it used to be that we had to sort of prove yeast or put it in water and let it begin you don't have to do that anymore it's been the processing has changed so that you don't have to do that which is nice okay I'm just stirring a baguette dough should be a soft dough it should be a pretty soft dough now what I will say about this recipe is that it is not as soft as a recipe that I might make in a bakery it's a little bit stiffer and that's okay because if you're new to baguettes and again I think I've said it many times before baguettes are not easy it's not an easy place to begin in fact if the first bread that you want to make is a baguette I would say let's wait let's let's make that you know let's hold that hold on hold off on that for just a little bit so now yet those should be a pretty soft dough but like I said this is a little bit stiffer and the reason for that is that it's a little bit easier for you to shake if you're new to the game it's a really wet dough it can be pretty challenging your shape now I gave myself a little bit of extra water because I have felt like this dough has been a little bit on the dry side and I think this one can take a little bit more water in my hands are happy shaping wetter dough so I have an additional about 40 50 grams of water that I'm gonna add all of that I think I could add all of it let's just go for it but I waited until I felt like I could kind of see where the dough was before I added that extra water in and now I'm just gonna need it in my hand this dough gets an hour and a half of full fermentation and it has one fold in the middle of that process and the folding is just like kind of like the folding is kind of like what we've done we we shape right you remember that yeah but I would say about adding the additional water it is try it as written first like really follow the instructions the first time and if you're happy with the resulting you don't need to do anything if you feel like the structure is a little bit tighter than what you want then I would say maybe add a little bit of water the next time if you're a musician you may know what tabular curious or even just musical notation a recipe is like musical notation in a way in that it's notes on the page and the notes on the page will get you close to the song but they're not the song they're not the song it takes time it takes practice to get to where you can interpret things and become a good musician a good singer a good banjo player or a good bread maker so it takes time in repetitions okay so this down is together and what I would say is go ahead and scrape your bowl down and then set a 45 minute timer and leave it covered do your fold at 45 minutes and then at an hour and a half or if it feels a little sluggish or it's a little cool in your house then maybe it two hours go ahead and go to your divide we're gonna clean up here and then I think we're ready to move to the next step yeah okay so I'm gonna start this divide and we already have some which are divided and Arlo is just rounding those up yeah yeah that looks really good so Arlo is taking a divided piece of dough and he's just folding the corners to the center and that's about it you don't have to do more than that that's perfect you don't even need to round it no that's good that's good you're just gonna sort of gather it and bring it together and then put it seem down yeah seam down on a floured surface and you keep going with that and I'm gonna start with this one the recipe on the website for the classic baguettes makes three and I have done I've done a fair amount more than that I've been a couple double batches so I should be able to get about six out of this these are scaled and about right around 300 grams so we're gonna get these divided and then we will come back for shaping so we have these divided and now we're going to let them relax for I'm guessing this is going to take about 20 minutes to get to a place where we can shape it so we're gonna let them relax make sure that you cover them if your room is particularly dry you're gonna want more than just a towel or something on top you're gonna want a piece of plastic or something which prevents the skin from drying if the skin dries you will have problems when you go to shave so protect those baguettes okay so this dough has had 15 20 25 minutes I don't know somewhere in there to relax and it's starting to feel like we could shape it if you pick a piece up and it doesn't sort of easily and actually these might just be just a Titch young but it's okay we're gonna make them work if they feel tight and you can't stretch them in just your hands right here then you're probably gonna have a hard time shaping of them so anyway I think these are pretty close and let me see how they feel this is our linen let me fix this real quickly I'm gonna put a little bit of flour down before I go to shave thanks buddy put a little bit of flour down and smooth it out this is linen this type of linen is very good as well this is a flax linen you can also use somewhere around here you can also use a dish towel as long as it's a pretty tight weave it will be okay the nice thing about canvas or flax linen is that it has some rigidity to it and so when you go to load it makes it a little bit easier it also makes it so the dough doesn't stick quite as easily so I recommend linen I recommend flex slim it's like the industry standard okay I'm gonna shape a couple here and then I'll have anthem come around and have her shoot over my shoulder so that if you so that you don't have to look at this upside down okay so if you've watched our videos you might have seen the shaping video we did a video where I cover baguettes shaping but I'm gonna do it again today just to sort of helping people out I start with a letter I go half way down and then I come all the way to the leading edge and seal and press to seal now I go back and forth to get down to about the diameter that I want and then I elongate how much do i elongate good question martins this piece of parchment right here is exactly the length of my baking stone look 18 inches I keep this piece of parchment on the bench I can use that as a guide I can use that as a guide and it just so happens that that's the same as this is that 18 inches yes and it's the same width as this baking tray as well so I have a couple things to help me the right length I roll it through a little bit of flour that helps keep it from sticking as well and then I put it on to my baking tray and make a little pleat or I sort of gather some material in between then I go and do another one we do one more and then I'll have anthem come around and then I'm gonna have you show you some - okay you shaped some baguettes but all of us all of us could use practice all of us including myself so I'm basically making a letter and I like to have sort of straight ish edges and make a little divot in the middle come down once and then I come all the way to the leading edge you can do that a couple of different ways you can use your hands sort of working with paddles or you can come and you can use your hand to seal like that so then back and forth to the diameter that I want and I taper the ends go through the flower and then I put it over here and you'll notice that whenever I put it over here I always place it seam up it should be seam up all right come around here so let's see this again I pad it a little bit I fold it in thirds like a letter I want it to be straight as best as I can come down halfway and then I come all the way to the leading edge and press to seal go to the middle back and forth to about the diameter that I want and then I go to hands and I roll to the edges and as I get to the points I just apply a little bit extra pressure so that I get some taper in the flour over to the linen or what we call Koosh and I gather where is she yeah okay okay you want to do one side by side with me sure just do that by side okay so we'll do flour there you don't need much flour if I'm gonna flour the surface I like it to be near but not in where I'm shaking so I like to be near my shaking surface not in my shaking service and give it a little bit of an east/west type so it's a nice pesto side by side that's perfect yep perfect now Pat it again now down just a little bit yeah and seal with hands like paddles perfect and then turn around very good and see bring it just a little bit down that's very good hands on the paddle and hands like paddles and seal press it up to make sure you're not stuck to the bench does it feel like you're stuck at all or no feels pretty good yeah okay so then with like the karate chop boom boom boom boom in the middle like that now hold it just down a little bit like as little as you can yeah perfect perfect yep perfect and now see if you can come all the way to the leading edge like that looks better than mine so far I love it okay is it sealed okay yeah that's good now yep no this is where it may feel a little bit funny but what you're gonna do is with your right hand since you're right-handed make a cup like this and what you want to try and do this keep the palm of your hand and your fingers on the bench and listen for the sound yup like that very good yep and it's okay to let it go kind of back and forth a little bit like you don't want to just kind of like stay in one spot you want it to travel so let me see where you are there a little bit more yeah a little bit more of a divot in the middle yeah let me see yeah that looks good now in with two hands watch this and with two hands and just so don't be asked to start here and what you want to do is when you go in right here don't let that dough get past your hand as you slide to the outside don't let that big lumpy part get past you so look what I do here I'm not gonna let that dough get past me I'm like rolling it out of the way a little bit does that make sense it's good it's good so if you find yourself in this place where you've got a little bit of them up just go back in the middle and don't let that thing get past your hand don't let your hand like just roll over it you've got to kind of push it out of the way yep like that keep that people kept on the bench yep yep keep that palm on the bench back and forth yep that's good to go one more time and make it and give it a little bit more travel there you go yeah like that like that it's okay it's okay it's really good now when you get out to the ends match it a little bit just match the tips just a little bit so that they point dude this is really good do you see that bubble right there it's like that's okay get out of the way now this is gonna be a good baguette I promise you and listen how many baguettes have you roll something like that it takes a long time to get to where you can roll that gets beautifully and evenly and it's the kind of thing that I have to practice everybody has to practice and with time it gets it gets easier but it takes time I have said it before and I'll say it again I always joke that the baguette is like you know it's like a figure-skating move make sure your fuchsias floured okay so we're going to shake a few more of these and then you can just keep on filming get it together east-west a little bit for it and we'll pick it up make sure that it's really square so if you're sticking a little bit yeah this one looks a little bit skinny this way right yeah so what you can do is you could actually take that and you can go all the way to the leading edge with it and just be done let's skip that intermediate yeah so give yourself that did it there you go there you go yeah yeah plus two steel very good now before you go let's see here for a second so you're really close okay now you're ready just how you're ready to do it look how even it is see how beautifully even it is into end yeah you know that if you start there you're gonna have a good back out okay that's good now both hands good good good good that's good and you can still see the scene right yeah that's right right here yeah there we go oh thank you these last two one fight over it viciously shaping becomes fun in the beginning it can be a little bit stressful and I I remember that but with experience it gives to where you get to where it's fun if you get a little bit of dough on your counter make sure you clean that because dough will stick to dough dough will stick to your baguette so if you have some no there so go have just as little as you can on us that's too much yeah that's good now to the leading edge now I move kind of quickly but don't feel like you have to move at that pace you just move the pace which feels comfortable to you yeah good now when you go to the site this time don't let that doe sneak out you know don't let that dose sneak past your hands you maintain your wall there yeah and it's gonna help flattening and spread the dough yep I mean hands a little bit powdery or I mean a little bit sticky just rub them on the for a second there you go good good good that just tapered a little bit there you go if it gets stuck if you feel like it's getting stuck a little bit just come over here this is gonna be a good bag you may think like us isn't it like exactly what I want it's okay I shape a lot I've shaped a lot more about what I want than you ever will unless you get started pretty soon okay so we're gonna let these proof and then we'll come back and make them so you want to start straight from the bench down and I'll put these in a place where we can free from something okay okay so I think that we are ready to load pubs are hot I tested backups in here the other day and I ran the oven at 525 which is pretty hot I think that might even be higher than what the recipe says but it's the temperature that I needed in order to get these up to where I felt like we were gonna get a nice oven spring from the back I have a baking stone then I had baking steel I have a cast iron pan which is empty preheating in the bottom of the stove can you bake baguettes on a baguette screen yes can you bake them on a sheet tray yes can you make them without steam yes but each one of those things has an effect on the bread right so if you make them in a steamy environment they can rise more fully because the crust stays nice and moist and allows it to expand if you bake them on a stone or a steel those hold heat very well and they push a lot of heat into the into the bread when you loaded it and so it expands well if you just put them on a sheet tray and put them in there they don't expand as well if you them in an oven without steam the crust dries and sets and they don't expand as well and so I'm doing everything I can to sort of emulate a baker a bakery masonry oven okay so I have parchment I'm gonna load these onto parchment then and slide them in I think that it's a little bit easier and I think that you at home will have an easier time with that so that's the way that I'm going to show you so the baguettes are proofing here let me show you like these are pretty well proofed if you can look and see they feel very marshmallowy to me so I think they're ready to go this was the first one that we shaped and so that's the first one that I'm going to load they are rising seam up the seam will be the bottom of the loaf so I need to I need to invert them so that's gonna be the top side of the load and then I just pop them on here and this is like your last chance to edit it also if there is anything that you want to change about the shape I look at them as I transfer them and I just make sure that they're nice and straight and they look good right yeah feel it although feel it and tell me what you think it feels like it's kind of puffy right yeah feels puppy I should say it just doesn't aside one note about these this recipe uses poolish but I will tell you that I set one poolish so half of these are foolish baguettes in the other half I seeded with a little bit of sourdough culture and so the other half are a more like sourdough or Levant flavoured again so that's up on that so I have enough room to bake 6 baguettes per oven we're in the studio today because no one's here and it's quiet and I wanted to be able to show you more than just a couple of I guess which is all my oven could handle I know right I think actually the new shape that which is pretty awesome okay so now it's time for for what we call scoring and we could spend a day talking about this I'll try and talk you through the broad details so the reason that we score is not only because it's pretty it's functional first and foremost scoring is functionally cutting the loaf tells it where to expand it tells it where to expand and it helps it expand more fully in the oven okay so that's why we're scoring so first and foremost you need to score well in order to make the most delicious bread because as the bread Rises it'll have a more open crumb structure with a better score now Baggett's are traditionally cut with five to seven slashes or scores what I like in the home oven is to do a single cut and so let me just do one and stop talking so come in your anthem maybe I'll talk for just another second sorry do you see how my fingers are almost drawing a channel down the middle on the highest part of this baguette do you see that that's basically where I want my cuts to land so I'm gonna start at one end and I'm gonna go to the other end I'm gonna start at one end and I'm gonna go to the other end like that if you go slowly you'll see some blade drag and I'm going slowly to try and show you but I but I should be going more quickly there are a lot of different lumps that you can use these are pretty good but once the blade is dull most of them you can't change the blade and then you just have to throw it away so I like this type a piece of metal with a blade that you can refill and then you only have to replace the blade okay so do you want to score sure okay so do you have a preference on Witchblade no okay so I want you to hold it like this like that and I want you to see if you can land it right in there and you can use your blade angle just you can go down just a little bit with your blade angle does that make sense and you're just cutting with the nicked corner of that blade you're just cutting with the corner of that blade and be careful because this will cut you okay and go down just a little bit you want to almost like get underneath just a little bit like that yep [Music] what dude that was amazing look perfect yeah really good really really good okay do another one and same thing just cutting with the tip of the blade and you can cut even a little bit deeper than that one yeah good perfect great when do the last one sure really good Wow okay and make sure you go right off the end mat right not the end listen blade angle there's a lot to talk about here blade angle is important the most important thing though is that your oven has good steam if your oven doesn't have good steam they won't open and it doesn't matter how you score so make sure you're baking with steam first and foremost we already have that discussion and then make sure that your cuts are good this might need to be just a little bit deeper so I'm just gonna hit it again just to make sure I think we're good okay so now I'm gonna load okay I made a little pizza what I did was I just took one of the baguettes and I just mashed the middle of it I didn't touch the sides but I just smashed the middle of it put a little bit of sauce cheese fresh parsley mozzarella and then a little bit of herbs in there I can tell which ones you shaped but just barely I tell you what I'm pretty impressed you come work for me in a bakery yeah takes times where you get there okay do you want to score yours I know that one's yours why don't you do that one straight give it a straight cut see if you can get the blade so right now you have it straight up and down and that's fine for some lows if if you can turn it just a little bit it'll be even better but the main thing is like try and get it into end and then if you can turn it some that'd be cool too yeah very good what I mean by turn it is and you could be just a little bit deeper just a little bit deeper so what I mean by turn it is instead of being straight up and down you get at an angle so like this see I'm like see I'm kind of like cutting it at an angle a little bit do you want me to score one with more than one on a more like yet we would in the bakery so I'll do let's try five one two three four fine let's do this 1 2 1 2 3 4 5 and why don't you do that last one straight be nice and strong with it fat yeah but still just use the tip there you go good now go yeah nice okay I think you did pretty well what do you think looks good all right so yeah mind the blade make sure that you always put your blade back where it goes and always in the container and keep track of it okay let's look it's a peak come here obviously not done far from done but looking pretty good yeah looking pretty good this oven tends to be very hot on the top so probably in the next couple minutes here I'm gonna shuffle them because if I don't I'm gonna end up burn on top and white on the bottom so we give them a little bit of a flip you know every oven is a relationship that you have to sort of develop there's no perfect oven there no perfect bakers so you have to sort of have this relationship where both of you get better okay okay what do you think it looks so good now we're really gonna smoke it crusty ears open nicely we've got a little snack here maybe with our baguette dough a little pizza baguette yeah so thanks for joining us today we hope that you learned something baguettes are a journey enjoy the journey eat your mistakes and we'll be back soon with another video good job thank you and really hopin Oh Oh",

Today I'm going to show you how to make\nbaguettes - this is one of my favourite recipes to make.\nI actually spent some time in my early 20s working in Paris and patisserie\nand I had to get up at kind of four o'clock in the morning to go to work and\nthis is the smell that would wake me up so it's very nostalgic one for me. So\nwe're going to start by getting all of our dry ingredients\nready together in a bowl. So we've got some strong white flour,\nadd 10 grams of salt. Next up is the yeast, we're using an easy-bake yeast\ntoday. You could substitute this for a dried\nactive yeast that would require kind of rehydrating and some water before you\nadd it to everything else and so if you wanted to substitute it\nfor this recipe, you would use about five grams of dried active instead of\nthe seven gram sachet of easy-bake. So to this we're going to make a little\nwell in the centre and then we're going to pour in\n360 mls of tepid water and then we'll start to work the dough\ntogether using a dough scraper, trying to keep hands\nnice and clean for this initial stage. It's a fantastic bread for beginners so\nit's a little bit simpler than the traditional way of making baguettes\nwhich would require kind of overnight fermentation.\nThis is going to be kind of from mixing to eating\nin under three hours which is a massive advantage.\nOnce everything's come together in a mass like this, it's time to tip it out\nonto the bench. I'm not going to dust it with anything\nas I don't want the dough to absorb any more flour at this stage.\nBecause it's so wet and sticky, we're going to work it in a slightly different\nway so we're going to use our hands kind of like forks to pick it up from\nunderneath and then literally throw it down,\nstretch it out and fold it in on itself. This is definitely a place to take out\nsome of your frustrations. This can take anything from 5 to 10\nminutes and every so often you want to make sure\nthat you're using that dough scraper to just walk the dough\naround the bench and capture any bits that might be starting to dry out\nand see if you can get it to be nice and smooth on the surface. If I were to run my hand under some cool\nwater and press into it gently,\nit's already springing back and another good telltale sign\nis that you can see that curve against the edge of the bench,\nso it's actually holding itself up a little bit, that tells me that it's ready\nto start its first prove. It's going to go in here and get covered\nuntil it has almost doubled in volume. So my dough's been proving for about an\nhour now you can see that it's really well risen.\nTime to roll these out. So a nice bit of flour on the work surface to begin with.\nOnce it's out of the bowl we're going to kind of divide it up into eight,\nhave a little check on the sizing - if you can see that any are clearly bigger than\nothers you can fix that at this stage. So I now\nneed to give them a little bit of initial shaping and this is to build a\nbit of tension in the dough so that they rise really well later on.\nSo we want to make them into a nice ball shape, best way to do this is to stretch\nthe outer edge of the dough and fold it in\non itself and do this all the way around the dough. Only put\nflour on the bench but not on the top so that it can hold\nitself together once we once we do those folds.\nAnd I'm just going to kind of press it around on the bench a little bit,\ntrying to develop a little bit of a seam at the bottom so\nkeeping a dryer piece of bench for this without any flour on it is\nreally helpful. So while they rest I'm going to prepare\nwhat's known as a couche. This is basically a flat well floured\ntowel and I'm going to line them up so we'll\nhave eight baguettes running down the tray like this\nand I need a little bit of overhang because I'm going to fold it inwards as\nI go. So from here I'll take some flour\nand just make sure that my towel is really well dusted\nso that they don't stick, it's pretty heartbreaking when you get this far\nand then you can't get them off the towel. So the pre-shaped dough has now\nhad an opportunity to relax and now we can\nroll it out really easily so I'll start with the first one. I'm basically\ngoing to press it out into a kind of oval shape\nusing the palm of my hand and then once we've got this initial shape, I'm going\nto fold the top half over and just press it into place.\nAnd then we'll turn it around do the same with the other half\nand now we need to do the final shape by folding the whole thing in half so I'm\ngoing to use my thumbs in the centre and draw half of the dough over the top\nand then press into it to create a seam. So from here we're\ngoing to kind of press really firmly from the centre,\neven pressure as we go out and to about the length of the tray that we're using\nand then to taper the ends it's all about pressing\nthe outer edges of your hands into the dough. Now I'll try and find where that seam was so I can put it at the bottom,\nI'll lay it on top of my couche and just fold that towel up and the next one\nwill sit right next to it. I think you have to do it a few hundred\ntimes for it to be um for it to feel really, really natural, um,\nbut I think with bread making practice practice makes perfect!\nSo final ones going on the tray there so they're sitting nice and snug.\nMy baguettes have now risen for about 45 minutes so you can see that they're\ndoubled in volume and they're ready to go onto trays and be baked. So I've got a\npreheated oven ready for them to go into and I'm just going to gently transfer\nthem by opening up the cloth and lifting from\nunderneath. So they are considerably more delicate\nnow that they've been proven a second time, there's lots and\nlots of air in there, and once we've got them onto the trays\nwe're actually going to score the surfaces of them,\nusing a serrated knife doesn't tend to snag on the dough as much.\nI'm going to go for really long diagonal cuts\nacross the dough as deep as I can go in one\nswift motion. The scoring is a really important part of the process because it\nallows the dough to open out when it goes into the oven,\nso we've got tons and tons of water in there which is going to\nturn into steam and that needs somewhere to go so baguettes can open up and be\nreally nice and airy rather than very dense and doughy. So they need to go\ninto the oven at about 240 degrees or as hot as your oven will go and it will\ntake anything from 12 to 15 minutes for them\nto develop a really nice golden crust. For the full recipe click\nthe link in the description. So you can see that they've come out of\nthe oven they took about 15 minutes and the best way to tell if they're done is\nto look for the colour of them so you want\nreally nice golden, caramel crust. You could give them a little tap\non the base and that will tell you if it sounds really nice and hollow\nthen they're cooked all the way through. Really good bread should speak for\nitself so I think the best way to serve these is with a little bit of\nsalted butter. So this is how I'm going to eat mine, it smells\nabsolutely unbelievable.", "Tq2aDik3vZY": "[Music] when you divide and pre-shape for baguette it's important that you cut your dough into a nice square piece so first i'll start out by cutting off a strip of dough that is about four inches wide and cut the dough into a square as i'm shooting for about 350 grams so at the end i want to have about four by four square pieces [Music] okay start with a square piece gently pat it down fold it once and twice and when i fold i have my fingers together so that way this creates a straight line and then fold press gently away to create a pressure tighten the skin okay so make sure that your dough is not sticking to the table gently pat it down without using your fingertip fold now have your fingers lining up like this so that way it creates this straight line that you can fold and press gently down and away to create a little bit of tension here same way press gently away for the tightness of the skin now when you do this you should have your elbows facing out so that you can line your fingers like this if your elbows are closed you end up poking with your fingertips which will then break the skin okay here's the final shaping for your baguettes okay first take your pre-shape seam side up and gently flatten down with your hand create a flat surface and first fold in about one third so that way you're creating a seam in the middle okay so it's the same motion as the pre-shape for the one-third turn it around and fold my left hand is folding and ceiling with the heel of my hand fold and seal fold and seal just enough pressure so that way the dough adheres to each other so you have a straight line down in the middle and we're going to fold this one more time from the seam fold in half and seal seal okay and when you seal make sure that your heel of your hand is square to your bucket if you chop it on the side of your hand then it's going to make this dent on the surface roll from the center first slide in one hand and then slide in your next hand make a big movement zig zag okay and find your seam place on the cush seam side up okay and make a fold on the crush okay one more time flatten down slide your hand underneath just like the pre shape fold about one third and seal gentle pressure downward to seal create a seam in the middle rotate fold with your left hand and seal fold and seal and fold in half the seam is formed right down here okay and start with one hand now if you start with two then you may end up having this little bump in the center slide one hand and then the next one and make a big movement with your arm move from your shoulder not just your wrist even pressure all the way to the end okay and then seam facing up okay and on the cush you want to give a little bit of room around your baguette so that way they can grow but then the koosh and the by placing the baguette right next to each other that will help sort of grow against each other and support the structure of the look on the board you can fit about six to seven baguettes at a time", "bpFEABepSxY": "welcome everybody to Brazilian kitchen my name is Pedro and I'm your host for today's recipe today you're gonna learn how to make bone France ace guys I'm not gonna lie this recipe is very challenging and I had to try four times before I got it right but don't worry I'm gonna give you all the tips and tricks that you need to get right and the first time all right so if you haven't tackled your big current time challenge yet this is gonna be I want you to make this recipe and I want you to tag us on instagram also don't forget to follow us on instagram subscribe to our youtube channel and like this video alright this recipe has a lot of different names in Brazil some people know it by policy some people know it by pontius all major casa Chino there's a lot of different names in Brazil for this recipe so I want you to comment down below if you know a different name and where you heard it from let's see the ingredients 330 grams of flour 200 milliliters of water 4 grams of yeast 8 grams of salt 4 grams of sugar and 14 grams of unsalted butter the first step to make our French roll is we need to create a sponge and for that we're going to be using 30 milliliters of water that we have warmed up according to the specifications of the yeast so if you read the yeast case it's gonna say how much you have to hit the water so in my case it was 110 to 115 degrees Fahrenheit so I just hit the water in the microwave for about 15 seconds and that did the trick we're also going to use 30 grams of flour in all of the years now we're gonna cover it with the depth towel and set it to rest for about 30 to 60 minutes I'm gonna place it in a warm place like the microwave or the oven and then when it's done I'm gonna show you guys how it should be the texture guys we can see the texture that we have a couple of holes here like air has come into the into the sponge so this is the texture that we're looking for it's kind of higher in the middle and if it starts to decrease in the middle it's going to lose strength and your breads not gonna grow enough after 30 minutes have gone by you have to check your sponge every once in a while we checked with every 10 minutes and a minute 50 it was good to go and after we have this texture we're gonna start adding the rest of the ingredients so we're gonna add the flour the sugar the salt and finally the water which you're gonna add little by little so we're gonna add a little mix and then we're gonna add more as you guys can see we still don't have a single uniform dough so I'm gonna add a bit more water to it we can see that now I have a one dough but it's still too dry so I'm gonna add the rest of the water and start mixing by hand now I'm gonna add the butter so I'm gonna need and incorporate the butter into our dough gonna be messy for a while but it's gonna get better [Music] guys it's important that you use unsalted butter because I use salted butter when I was trying this recipe and everything became just too salty if all you have in your house is salted butter use it less salt use it like 6 grams or salt or something like that guys if you have never needed a dough before what I'm doing is basically I'm pressing and spreading then I bring it all back together and I do it again I'm gonna keep doing this until we have the right texture that I'm gonna show you in a moment this is the texture that we're looking for so we can pull the dough and we see that it's not breaking easily and that is also has a very elastic surface after kneading for 15 minutes I saw that the texture was not quite there yet so I left the dough resting for 5 minutes and it just got into this perfect texture that you just saw we're gonna leave our dough to rest for 15 minutes every time you put the dough to rest you have to cover it otherwise the dough will get dry and will not be good in the final zone guys we just waited 15 minutes and our dough is ready for the first model we're gonna take it out and we're gonna split into 6 different parts guys I'm gonna take the dough off the ball but without pressing it too much so be careful I'm gonna spread my dough and then I'm gonna cut it in 6 different pieces always use a tool like this or a knife so you don't tear the dough okay now that I have 6 pieces I'm gonna use a scale and try to leave it the same or similar sizes I have here about 540 grams of dough so I'm going to try to leave each bread up 90 grams now that we have similar-sized oh I'm gonna make a little ball so we can start doing the pretty modeling I'm just gonna make an arch with my hand and start rolling to dough without pressing it to open the dough just press it with your fingers but remember to be gentle and then roll it roll and press I'm gonna leave it here to rest for another 15 minutes ten minutes later we're going to model it so we're gonna get our our dough and the bottom part that has to stitch we're gonna put it into the top and we're gonna open the dough again the same way we did before and we're gonna roll it again we have to put pressure here so the top part is as smooth as possible and now I'm gonna roll it but arching my hand so the top was to be higher than the edges I'm greasing the baking tray so the bread won't stick to it I'm gonna model all of the dough and I'm gonna put it here with two fingers so we can let it grow now that we shape all of our breads I'm gonna cover it again and let it rest for another hour while we let our bread rest for our dough rest I'm gonna preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit and remember to take the dough off the stove because it might get too hot guys with 15 minutes to go to put our dough in the oven we're gonna add some boiling water because this kind of bread it needs a lot of steam going off so I have a baking tray here that I'm gonna put into the oven the lowest possible and then I'm gonna pour water into it we now have five minutes to go before we put our dough into the oven and I'm gonna uncover them so the top can get a little dry and will make it easier for us to cut look how beautiful and big they are remember we have two fingers between them before they just grow close together guys now that it's time for our bread to go into the oven we're gonna grab our sharpest knife and we're gonna make a single 45 degree angle cut into the breads now we splash some water into the bread and put it into the oven it's been 15 minutes that the bread is in the oven and now I'm gonna take off the water and turn the baking tray be careful at the 15 minute mark if you want to take some to freeze it's the time to do it so take it off let it cook for a while and then you can freeze it we're gonna let it there for 10 more minutes and that should be enough to get there golden crust that I love we're gonna live our breaths to rest in the cooling rack for a while our French rule is ready but before we try it don't forget to like the video don't forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel and follow us on Instagram right so let's do this now we're gonna spread some butter on the bread [Music] guys this was French rope I hope you have liked it and I will see you soon in the next video Otello go [Music]", "f0RjnQGrwzw": "hello again my name's John I'm a retired cook from the northeast of England in the UK and welcome to another one of my bread videos okay this recipe is for those who are finding my original bucket video a bit too time-consuming to take on now this bucket method shaves over an hour and a half off the other recipe by using what's known as the police or sponge method all this means is you have to spend five minutes making up the police a few hours before you begin the actual bucket recipe usually the night before and here is a list of the simple ingredients you'll need to make up the police it's also known as a sponge or a starter right I'll start the police by adding a half a teaspoon of dried yeast to the strong white bread flour and whisk that in the next and last ingredient is the cold water and I'll give that a thorough whisk now the measurements for this and any of my recipes really are carefully worked out so please use digital skills and get to know grams it is so much more accurate than ounce and cup of measurements right once that's done cover the ball and get it under the top shelf of the fridge now the reason for the top shelf is it's the warmest part of the fridge sort retards or slows the fermentation down to a steady rate and it's that slow fermentation that gives this bread its fantastic flavor very much like my ciabatta recipe okay it's it I was later and it's the next morning for me and it's time to start making these baguettes and here's a list of the rest of the ingredients including the police that I made up yesterday now after it I was mine looks like this but if yours has been in longer and it looks like this one don't worry it's fine this test one that I did was in my fridge for 24 hours you can see it is risen and then sunk again but as long as this bubbles it's okay right add the water to the police and give it a good whisk up now set that aside for a moment while I mix the flour and the salt in a separate ball [Music] [Music] now at the polish mixture and give it a good mix until it all comes together into a sticky door as always I'll be using the handle of my wooden spoon to do mine don't be tempted to you Shi whisk at this point the door is way too thick for that tool you can use a stand mixer but only until the door comes together but mixing it by hand only takes a couple of minutes right don't forget to scrape down any dried flour from the sides of the ball and cover and set the timer for the first of only two 45 minute rises and that is where you see at the time from my original bucket video by making the police you only need two 45 minute Rises instead of fall now these times may slightly vary depending on the temperature of your kitchen the ambient temperature in my kitchen is 23 Celsius that's 74 Fahrenheit which is ideal for proofing this door and after the first 45 minutes you can see how much the door has risen slightly wet the bench before turning it out this will stop the door from sticking to the worktop and with wet hands give the door a few turns this is called knocking the door back or degassing it also distributes the temperature evenly throughout the door notice how much smoother the door looks now get it back into the ball cover and set your timer for a second and last 45 minute rise [Music] okay while waiting for the door to rise I'll get a couple of things ready starting with the baker's couche all this is is a well floured piece of material to proof the baguettes on I use the 100% cotton pillowcase for mine it's a lot cheaper than the proper baker's couche material and it does exactly the same job you'll also need a slightly oiled strip of cling film or plastic rub this is to cover the pre shaped buckets a little later set that aside for now now flour the worktop preferably next to the Koosh cloth and have your digital skills ready to divide the door accurately [Music] okay once the time's up carefully turn out the door onto the floured surface [Music] once the doors on the bench dust it with flour and start dividing it into however many buckets you're making out of this recipe you'll either get four large six medium or eight small now providing your measurements were correct at the start the adorn should we twelve hundred and twenty grams of forty three ounces I'm making six medium baguettes out of mine so each piece of door works out at two hundred and three grams or just over seven ounces each now the next step is to prep the buckets and let them rest a while this will relax the door and make forming the final bugger chip much easier rather than me try to explain it'll be easier if you just watch and copy how I'm doing it [Music] [Music] once they're all done cover them with the oiled cling film and set the timer for 15 minutes [Music] [Music] once the 15 minutes is up start forming the buckets you'll find the door is much easier to handle after it's been relaxing for a while now once again I'll let you watch how it's done I'll go slowly through the first couple to give you an idea but the best and only way to learn is to practice [Music] once each pocket is font lift it over to the cush and lay them out as Sean [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] once all the buckets are on the couch cover them with a lightweight dry tea towel or dish cloth and let them proof for 30 minutes [Music] when there's only ten minutes left on the proofing time pre-heat your oven to 230 degrees Celsius that's 446 Fahrenheit or gas mark eight you'll also need to place upon a hot water on the bottom shelf or the other this will create a steamy atmosphere in the oven which makes the baguettes crispy one more thing you'll need is a spray bottle of water standing by for a little later okay [Music] once the 30 minutes are up carefully transfer the buckets to a very lightly oiled baking tray or trays I'm using two trays three buckets on each you'll have to decide what we are using depending on what size buckets you're making [Music] once the buckets are on the tree I'll give them a quick squirt with the water and with a very sharp knife or razor blade score the buckets are Shawn I'm giving these three scores on each one [Music] right I'll quickly go through the second dot [Music] and now get them straight into the preheated oven once they're in give the oven a quick squirt with water before closing the door this will make these baguettes even crispier once they're safely in the oven I'll set the timer for 16 minutes after about 10 minutes I'll be swapping mine around top to bottom and back to front this is for even cooking okay that's the 16 minutes up and mine are done this is how we like them but if you prefer yours a bit darker just give them a little longer but check them every two minutes the last thing you want after all this effort is to burn them [Music] and there they are six delicious light crispy baguettes made at home the smell in my kitchen is amazing and just listen to how crispy these are wonderful okay I'll cut one open and have a look on the inside now what you can see the crumb are bubbles are not as large as my other French baguette recipe but still perfectly acceptable I'll add some of my homemade butter and have a little taste test [Music] and

everyone I'm Beth today I'm making a Vietnamese baguette it also known as bun me in Vietnam this bread is known for its light airy tattoo on the inside and very thin crispy crust on the outside let's begin in the mixing bowl I will come by bread flour salt quick dry yeast sugar mix the dry ingredients co in cold water Mik water with flour for a minute then stop with a low speed leader though for a couple minutes then straight down the flower on the side of Bowl meet on the speed number 4 for 4 minutes let the dough rest for a couple minutes then knead it again on speed number 4 for 4 more minutes now the dough is very soft now we'll remove the dough and play it into this the lady greased bowl cover and let it dry for 1 hour after 1 hour the dough arise really nicely justly we move the dough onto this lightly greased countertop divide the dough into 6 equal portions you can use a scale to make sure your dough or eco size I can eyeball it that why my is the live it off and now shape the y'all go into a ball shapes just fold and then pin it together cover and that's beef alright for half an hour after half an hour we will shape the dough into rolls lightly grease your countertop just slap and flip the bills to be four times this step is very important for your project to come out lightly and airy inside you need to do this step flatten it now with your hands then roll the dough out into 10 by 11 inch rectangles and make sure the bottom and get the thinner than the top now roll it down and remember apply more pressure on both and off the wall go it down a few times to make sure the road is smooth play it on the budget pan and if you don't have a baguette pan you can do a regular baking pan but light it with a parchment paper so it won't stick no comedy role and let it rise for 40 minutes or when it double in size spray water on top and roll to make it easy to slash make three slashes on top of each roll right before baking we will bake the roll at 475 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 to 23 minutes okay everyone if I get it done look how pretty it is the very crunchy in a very life it delicious you can have with sandwich like meatball hoagie I hope you enjoyed it recipe thank you so much for watching and I will see you next time", "ZAt-R_MAA5I": "okie dokie let's see now we're going to shape the baguettes they've uh rested out 25 minutes did half the difference between 20 and 30 so we're just flattering a little spot over there bench scraper it's good to have that handy let's uncover them very good so you will need a floured couch to rest your baguettes what are these other things wet towels so i can dampen the baguettes after they're shaped and then i'm going to put them uh the damp shaped baguettes onto a tray of poppy seeds to try to coat them with seeds okay so starting with the first pre-shaped dough flip it out onto the uh flour i have over here nicely floured just gonna flour my hand slightly flatten it out a little surprising that you'd flatten it out isn't it and you think oh my god i've got all that nice air in there and here we're getting rid of it so anyways have a little bit of flour on your hand so with one hand you turn it in press it into the other turn press into the center so we're trying to build some tension circumferentially turn it every time i turn it i try to pull it out a bit to get it closer to the final shape which is i want around 16 inches that's the maximum i can do okay so again for one hand you turn it in press down with your thumb or some people use the heel of their hand i don't know i find that awkward okay so i'd like to have a look at my seal because in this case i didn't do a good job sealing so i'm just going to seal it up a little bit notice there's a spot here which is very sticky okay so generally speaking we want to seam side down we're going to try to extend them so they're already almost to length so with both hands we're just doing a little rolls just little rolls this little section a little bit longer so i'm not going to go to full length because all this manipulation it's going to contract and shrink a little bit in fact i forgot to get my ruler ahead of time just to give you an idea of how long so actually that's quite good i want it to be almost 16. it is almost 16. keep track of where the seam is in my case there's a seam it was underneath because if you have the seam down when you're finally baking it it won't blow out if you have the scene anywhere but down it'll blow out there okay so that's actually pretty well shaped i'm pleased with that put it here just to wet it a little make sure that the seeds will stick okay just lightly wet it's great and then again transfer onto the seeds so they say roll on seeds i don't know how you're supposed to roll things on seeds you can't they can just sit on the seeds okay then i'm going to transfer to the koosh those seeds should be pretty well stuck okay now onto the koosh okay okay koosh i've used quite a few times and i always flowered a bit too i didn't place the seam side up as well as i like you don't want it torqued okay while those seeds stuck hopefully they're stuck well enough i'm just going to lightly flour so we're ready for the next one okay let's try the whole process again now these seeds just need to shake them out again that's pretty good okay shaping the next one here we go again flip it out onto a floured surface a little bit flour on your heel [Music] flatten it out a bit and then now i'm going to turn it in now the first fold goes into the center so with one hand the heel of your thumb the heel of your hand turning it in towards center okay that's good i'm going to lift it turn see it's gotten longer each time so that's good do the same thing again so this one we're going to fold it over to the edge and make the seam along this edge so we're building tension circumferentially around the baguette now i know a lot of people do a lot fancier shaping than i do but i found this actually works quite well so now i'm just gonna have a look at the seam i like to make sure my seam is well stuck good turn that out so length we're almost there so we don't need to stretch it too much seam side down one of the challenges i find is either having too much flour or too little flour too much it just slides too little it's too stuck so anyways i've had this sitting here too long now it's getting stuck down just gonna loosen it a little bit so let's roll it out a little so i don't want it too fat in the middle we aren't rolling too far there that's enough transfer seam side up okay onto the wet cloth let's get it nice and wet so we can ensure the poppy seeds stick the first time working with popsi seeds they're lighter than the sesame seeds so i'm hoping they stick well never worked with poppy seeds before i could never find them all of a sudden i was able to find them at the grocery store let me see if i can roll it a little bit yeah i can roll it just a little bit i don't want to degas this too much over here because it didn't get enough seeds i think that'll be fine okay quickly over to here now good so we're going to make a pleat to separate these babies over just a little bit more okay i'm going to re-flour a little bit more for the final baguette okay so last pre-shaped dough into the little pot of flour i have a little bit of flour on your heel of your palm pat it down a little okay so going towards the center slightly floured hands turn with one hand pressure into the center stick it down i like to make sure that's padded down lift and turn that's stuck way too much i'm going to turn that back in because that stretched way too much we don't want that get some more flour in my hand i have a bit of dough from that sticky edge i don't want that either okay so we're going to turn this one back all the way over to the edge okay so turn over flat with your thumb and get this raw dough out of the way that's going to cause a problem i can get it off come on okay so i'm just going to get a little bit of flour there let's keep an eye on this surface here turn that down okay so we're not bad for length skinny the center a little and then just roll out so actually that's almost too long already so i'm not going to do any more on that flip it over so i can keep an eye on the seam seam looks good make sure it don't lose the seam okay let's see what just happened there where is the seam there we are okay so let's pick this up over to here let's make sure he's nice and damp get the seeds already again okay there we go okay see if i can roll them a bit get seeds on the sides a bit more okay not bad okay transfer him back to the koosh over here and that went fairly well keeping the seam side up on the koosh make another pleat a little bit more flour so it doesn't stick to the koosh now the other thing to remember to do and i've forgotten in the past is to lightly flower the bottom which is sticking up why do you do that because when you're transferring this to your transfer board and then onto your peel if there isn't [Music] any flour on this side which is going to be the bottom it'll stick to your transfer board and then cause a lot of trouble if it's stuck okay it might be floured so next i'm just going to cover this i'm going to leave it for half an hour at room temperature so a little bit of room temperature proof and then i'm going to put it back in the fridge the reason", "zTRMAjOtcbY": "Oh hi and welcome to episode number 373 with watts for charkham these gourmet hotdog rolls are actually Vietnamese baguettes the super crispy crust and beautiful soft Center mics for the perfect hot dog roll the process is simple however it is time-consuming so I do suggest making at least this batch size to make it worth your while you can go directly to the principle recipe by clicking the on-screen link at the end of this video to start plus the strong white flour salt sugar and yeast in your mixer bowl place the bowl on your mixer and mix the dry ingredients together briefly add the water and the lava mix it to mix and knead for 8 minutes if you're kneading by hand knead for 10 to 12 minutes remove the bowl from the machine scrape the dough down cover the bowl with cling wrap and let the dough rise for 60 minutes in a warm place rub a little oil onto your work surface turn the dough art and cut it into eight equal pieces for regular rolls or for four-foot long rolls working with oiled hands fold each piece of dough in on itself three times then transfer these to a baking sheet cover the baking sheet with an inverted roasting tin and allow these to rest for a further 20 minutes this is the second rise the work surface is still adequately oiled place one of the dough pieces on the surface and flatten it into a rectangle use your rolling pin to run a tower a rectangle of four to five inches wide by eight inches long starting at the top roll the dough down to form the roll roll the dough on the surface using your fingers to close the ends transfer the role to your baguette pan or a baking sheet repeat this until all of the baguettes are formed now time for the third rising likely cover the buns with cling wrap and allow them to rise again for 45 to 50 minutes halfway through this time start to pre-heat your oven to 230 Celsius or 450 Fahrenheit after the third rise to remove the cling wrap and mist the rolls with water use a sharp knife or blade to slash three cuts into the tops of each roll spray the rolls again place a pan of water in the bottom of your oven place the buns in the center of the oven and bake them for 20 to 25 minutes until golden remove the buns from the oven if you're using a perforated baguette pan allow them to cool on the pan otherwise transfer the buns to a wire rack and there it is beautifully crispy crust with lots soft and airy inside just waiting to become a gourmet hot dog thanks for joining us today please subscribe

I'm Jill. And today I'm so excited to\nshare this recipe with you. This is my recipe for\nhomemade French bread. This recipe only takes a few ingredients you probably already have\nin your pantry and even the beginner can make this French bread. Okay, here are my ingredients.\nI have six cups of flour. I may only need five and a half,\nbut I will show you how to tell. I have a little bit salt, I have some warm water and this is\njust barely warm on my wrist right now. It's at about the two cup Mark. So what I want to do is I want to bring\nit up so the bottom line of the water is parallel with that line. So\nI don't want the top lip. I want the bottom part of the\nbubble. So right about there, two and a half cups of warm water and\nthat's between 95 and 110 degrees. If you're getting pretty technical but\na little bit warm to your wrist works great. Okay. And then I have just like two tablespoons\nof sugar and a tablespoon of yeast. I'm going to use this egg for the egg\nwash on the top and then I'm going to add a teaspoon of salt, just\nregular sea salt. Okay, so in my mixing bowl, I'm going\nto take my two cups of water to the mixing goal and you don't really\nhave to wait a long time on this. I know my yeast is good.\nIf you're wondering, you probably need to prove to your race\nyour yeast and I'll have a little bit of information on that on the principal\nrecipe if you need that. Okay, so here's the water and the sugar and the\nyeast and you just want to mix this to be sure your yeast is dissolved.\nPut that back on. Okay, and now I'm going to add\nabout half of my flour, so I know I'm not going to\nbe needing more than this. So I have my six cups in there\nand I'm just going to add that. Then I have very nontechnical about a\nteaspoon of salt and now I will lift this up and just turn it on low speed here and let it do its\nwork here for just a couple minutes. Get that all. Nice to\nmake sense. Hey and before too much further. I'm also going to add, see if I can do this one handed about\na tablespoon of olive oil and I'm just going to guess that about a tablespoon and okay. And now I'm going to\nadd a little bit more flour leaving about a half cup in my container back up. Okay. I'm going to let this mix\nfor about two minutes. Okay, so I'm just going to add\na little bit more of this flour. I don't want to add at all. We want to add maybe a half a calf\nat a time and then we'll let it mix. See it's picking up all the flour\nthere on the sides of the bowl and we want to add flour until it just\nstarts to pull away from the sides of the goal. And that's how you know that you have\nenough flour in your dough so we want to keep mixing to make sure that it's all\nreally well incorporated and mixed in. All right here you can see that a lot\nof the flour has come away from the bowl but it's not quite done and if you\nare doing this by hand, just follow the same\nprocess and keep on mixing, keep on needing your dough. Okay, I'm\ngoing to add a little bit more flour and it's okay if it sticks a little\nbit on the bottom of the bowl, but all of this along here, we want that to be picked up by the dough\nball and that will give us the right consistency. Like right now,\nthis is just way too doughy. All right, now take a look at this one. See it's picked up all of that flour and\nI just have a little bit left here in the bowl and I'm not going to\nneed that. This looks perfect. Now I'm going to just let this need\nfor about 90 seconds or two minutes, and if you're doing this by hand, you'll probably have to need it for three\nor four or five minutes until it's a really elastic key and\nit's not super sticky. All right, it's been needing for\nabout 90 seconds. Maybe two minutes. Look at that. That is some\nperfect dough right there. Okay, so now I'm just going to let this sit. I\njust have a little bit of a cloth here. I'm going to cover it and leave it in\nthis warm spot here for about 20 minutes and then we'll shape it into the Lopes.\nAll right, so this is the fun part. Here's my dough and then as you can see, it has arisen to be will\ncome more than double. You don't need to let\nit rise quite this long, but I had a couple of other things I had\nto do. So let it rise a little longer. Actually, before I get\nstarted, any is anything more? I'm going to talk to you about bread\npans. So this is what I usually use. Just a large baking sheet for\nmy bread pan for French bread. But this is a fancy French bread pan. This is like what they\nwould use in a bakery. Um, have you ever noticed that there's like\nkind of a round bottom to the French bread? Well this is the kind of French bread\npan that they use and it's not necessary to use this. It does hold its\nshape just a little bit better. Um, so I dunno, maybe I'll make\none in this one and then, and that one you've kind of tell if it's\nworth your time and kitchen space to keep it an actual French bread\npan in your kitchen. But anyways, I'm just going to go ahead and spray\nthese with nonstick cooking spray and then we'll get started on rolling\nout of French bread.. Uh, you can use oil or the nonstick\ncooking spray either works fine. Okay. So the first thing I'm going to do is\nmake sure that my counter is really clean and dry and cause a lot more mess\nthan you need. If it's not dry. And then I'll just\nsprinkle out some flour. Just use your hands and just\npull it on out of there. Okay. And then I like to keep a sharp knife\nhandy and just roll it around in the flour a little bit so it will be sticky. And then I'm just going to eyeball it\nhere and you can weigh this if you really want to know. But um, just\ncut that in half. Okay. And then since this is a sticky side,\nI'll just get in a little bit of flour. You don't want to work the dope too much, but just enough to keep the flour kind\nof from making your hands really sticky. Okay. So you want to keep your\nflour on the surface here. And I'm just going to tuck my hands\nunder here because I want a nice smooth loath. And then if you'll get a little bit of\nflour and put it on your rolling pin and then just kind of work in the\nmiddle and pull down and over here and you're going to see a lot\nof little bubbles popping. And that's totally normal. We want our bread dough to be about 14\ninches long and kind of a rectangle. So just work it for a little bit and actually if it gets too stiff you can\njust set this aside here and work with the other one. Again, moving from the middle\nand just rolling it out. Okay, I'll put that aside\nand work with this one here. [inaudible] okay, good is about right. So now for the fun part, this is about rectangular,\nif you can see it there, you know I would say 12 inches is\nprobably that. So we're about 14 inches, so I'm going to turn it over and you\nwant to use the smoothest side to be the outside of your French bread. So this is the rough side and I'm\njust going to roll this out here. It's nice and long and smooth. I'm just going to put this right in here\nand then I'm going to tuck my ends in and on this side. Do you see\nhow it has that role there? I want to just tuck that in and as it\nrises it will get rid of the separation from that little bit of flour and we'll\njust kind of absorb it. There we go. And we will score it here\nin just a minute. Okay, we've got another nice little rectangle\nhere and it doesn't have to be perfect like she gonna use this side for my outside limit, kinda tight there. And then throw it on here and again,\ntuck the ends in again, it's okay if it rolls\nover, just tuck it all in and try to make it all\nsymmetrical in the size, the width, and also the\nlength. Okay? As you can see, I've got this nice long piece of dough\non my pan here and I just have a nice sharp knife. Now I'm going to score this about four\ntimes and you don't need to go very deep, but if you have a sharp knife,\nit's going to be perfect. So there we are, there's the scored French bread and then\nI will also do this to my other one. And again, you just do\nit kind of on a diagonal. And I'm only gonna do three on that\none. There we go, just like that. Okay, so the next step in this is to make an\negg wash and I just have a little bowl here. I'm going to crack one a, add a\ntablespoon of water and then whisk it up. And you can also make an egg\nwash with just egg whites. I actually like to do that egg yolk with\nit for French bread because it was a nice really rich color. There we go. That's already there. And then\nI just choose a pastry brush and just brush it all along the\nsides and inside of your score marks, just lightly coat everything. Mm. Okay. And as you can see, this\nis already starting to rise. Rush, this whole thing. All right, I've just got this bread here sitting on\nmy counter and I will let it rise until it's about devil, which will\nprobably be about 30 minutes. And then we're going to bake\nit and it will be good to go. You can also add Sesame seeds to the\ntop of this for shredded cheese like Parmesan or asiago to have it like a\ncheese crust of bread just chop up some of your favorite herbs. Here is the\nbread and it's all nice and arisen. Okay, I'm going to bake this in a 375 degree\noven for 30 to 40 minutes or until it's golden Brown and pop that in there. Okay guys, I just have to\nshow you how pretty this is. Take a look at that. It's been\nbaking for about 32 minutes, so pretty. Okay. And now I have my other pan I'm going to\nput in there and one thing I forgot to share that I did last time. If you just throw in a few ice cubes\non the bottom of the oven tray there, the moisture will help get a nice thick\nand crispy crust to your French bread. All right, so again, the\noven for 30 to 35 minutes. And if I would've had both\nof the loaves on here, I would have just done this\nonce. But since I had two pants, I couldn't fit them in my oven.\nSo anyways, see you in 30 minutes. Okay, check out these two\nloaves of French bread. I think they turned out so\npretty. It's nice and crusty. Just like the French bread\nyou'd buy in a bakery. And this is the one that was made\nwith the French loaf pan. But look, they are just about the same height. This\none is maybe just a little bit taller, but this one also has a great\nshape to it and a beautiful color. Okay, so should we dive into this and\nsee what it looks like on the inside? Is that nice thick crust on the outside? How is that for some amazing\nsoft and spongy on the inside. And then of course it's Crusty and\nchewy on the outside and a little bit of butter to this. This is the perfect side\nto any Italian meal. That is some really nice\nFrench bread. All right guys, I hope you enjoyed this episode\nat the carefree kitchen. Be sure to follow me on social media.

Now, this recipe only takes a few ingredients.\nIt does take a little bit of time, but this is a really easy recipe, and even the beginner can\nmake this French bread.", "EK8n-ZjhdP8": "all recipes member Joe submitted this recipe for French bread rolls to die for saying it's easy to make and the dough can be made in a mixer bread maker or by hand let's begin by pouring one and a half cups of warm water at 110 degrees into the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough hook attached add in one tablespoon of active dry yeast and two tablespoons of white sugar stir the yeast mixture well and then let it stand for about 10 minutes until it becomes creamy then add in 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil along with one teaspoon of salt and two cups of bread flour mix the dough until the ingredients are just blended and then a half a cup at a time add in the remaining two cups of flour until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl lightly flour a clean work surface and turn the dough out knead the dough for about eight minutes or until it's smooth and elastic lightly coat a large bowl with oil place the dough in the bowl and turn it to make sure it's lightly coated with the oil cover the bowl with a clean damp cloth and let the dough sit in a warm place until it's doubled in size which should take about an hour while the dough is rising lightly grease two baking sheets once the dough has risen punch it down turn it out again onto a lightly floured surface divide the dough into 16 equal pieces form each piece into a round ball place the dough balls onto your prepared baking sheets leaving at least two inches between the balls cover them with clean damp cloths and let the rolls rise until they've doubled in volume about 40 minutes while the rolls are rising pre-heat your oven to 400 degrees once the rolls have doubled in size bake them in your preheated oven for between 18 and 20 minutes or until they're golden brown all recipes member Joe also suggests that the rolls can be brushed before baking with one beaten egg white mixed with 1 tbsp water if desired once baked the beaten egg white gives the rolls a nice professional Baker's look", "jKbf2nC5864": "today sara and i are going to make one of the more challenging breads baguette and it's a two day process here we're going to have some flour and equal amount of water we're going to mix all this up and then this will rest on the counter top overnight and tomorrow it will be nice and bubbly and airy and this is what you will incorporate in the final dough you just want to make sure that there is no dry flour left and now we're going to place it in this food safe container and this is where it will rest all night long at room temperature just as a comparison i'm going to show you the one that we made last night and that's the exact same amount and you can see as to how nice and airy it is now this one will cover up and we'll set it on the counter as for the final dough now that our polish is ready we're going to take what water is left over and pour it all along the edges of the polish and this will enable the polish to slide out much more easily so you will see as to how easily the polish would just slide out and then with my scraper we're gonna get what's left in the bottom i reserve just a little bit of water for later on when we will add the salt now it is time to put the yeast in and here we have some pasta di riborto some dough that was left over from the last bake and this will add so much great flavor to it as well so if you have it great if you don't that's okay but whenever you make baguette keep a little bit in the refrigerator and add it to the dough so here we're gonna put the yeast in to get it nicely hydrated we're also gonna put this dough in as well and now with my hands we're going to incorporate all the ingredients i almost forgot here is some barley malt syrup we're going to incorporate that as well i should have done that sooner with the water but that's okay we're going to bring it in and knead all this together as you can see i still have not added the salt we're going to wait to add the salt later the dough is coming together of course you could do this in the mixer and stand that mixer with a dough hook but sometimes if you over mix it do you know that the dough can oxidize and instead of being this pretty yellow color it actually gets bleached and turns white and it gives an end result that is kind of flavorless now we're going to sprinkle the salt on top and the leftover water and this will really help me to incorporate the salt and waiting to put the salt in also helps with not affecting the yeast because the yeast being in direct contact with the salt would kind of lose its strength you see as to how shaggy this dough still is and not smooth at all we are going to cover it up and allow it to rest for about 10 minutes and then the magic will begin to happen let's peek doesn't look a lot different but now i'm going to wet my hand and you will see already as to how much more the dough comes together in this case i'm just kind of cupping my hand and tucking it under but you could also stretch it and fold it and go around this way and the reason i'm kind of shaking it like this is i want to wait until there is a bit of resistance i don't want to rip any of the gluten strands that are already there and now i'm going to put it down again and allow it to rest for another 10 minutes all right another 15 minutes are up i'm gonna show you something if i just touch the dough with my bare hand without getting it wet look what happens instead if i wet it just a little bit there's nothing there that's why i use just a bit of water and again you can see as to how nicely the dough is coming together it's nice and smooth now we could also put it on our work surface i'm just going to put a little bit of flour and here we can work it this way we let it rest for the third time and once again we'll give it a quick workout and at this point you can really see how nice and smooth our dough is we will place it into this food sleeve container cover it up with a lid and allow it to rise in the refrigerator overnight almost forgot i wanted to show you the comparison so this is the one we just put in and this is the one that was able to rise overnight in the fridge let's see if you can see right here this is where it finally was able to rise to and here is the other one just gently dust our work surface set this to the side and then help it out just a little bit with this rubber spatula and just allow the dough to come out the dough is out and now we're going to be able to divide it and pre-shape it we're going to measure it out perfect set it here and here our dough has been divided this little piece i am going to put in some plastic wrap and use it for the next bake now we're going to pre-shape it i'm kind of going to tell the dough who's boss and i'm already going to shape it in such a way that it's going to be easy for us to make the bucket to shape the baguette here's the first one once again i'm just going to put these corners in already begin to build some tension and you see how it's already in the shape that it will need to be for a traditional baguette we're going to set the dough right here on our work surface cover it up and allow it to rest before we actually shape it into a baguette our pre-shaved baguette have been able to rest and we will need this baker's cloth or a couch and that's where we're going to put the shaped baguette on i'm gonna very lightly dust the work surface put it upside down and then right in the center with this part of my hand i'm gonna press it down and then bring it in just like so turn it around and once again we'll turn it in like this again and now with this thumb i'm going to fold it over and with this part of my hand i'm going to seal it so here we go with our first bucket now we're going to put our hands on top of it starting up like this and it's almost as if you were to put your hand gently on somebody's arm so you don't squeeze you just gently put it on there so again like this and from here we're gonna roll it out now we're gonna find the seam which is right along here and we're going to put this on the baker's cloth just like so with the seam looking up we're just gonna dust our baker's cloth place our baguette right on top we rolled it here just so we have a nice edge here and then pull this edge up so here we are with this part of my hand i'm just going to make an indention right in the center then put my hands like this and make one fold already flip it around do the same right here and then with this thumb i'm going to press in and fold and this is where i'm going to make a seam by hitting it again with this part of my hand and this creates tension and makes a very nice seam all along we're going to start rolling it out to the edges once again but here is our bucket you see the seam is right along here and we're going to place it on the crush or the baker's cloth with this sitting on top [Music] do [Music] and here are our baguettes comfortably resting on the crush we're gonna cover them up with the rest of the couch and allow them to rest and here they are they have been allowed to proof once again we have our peel ready [Music] we're going to make sure that they're nice and straight and this is just a simple way of doing that plus i want to make sure that they're about the same distance from each other and now it is time to score them here is our lamb it's a blade that is you see it's kind of curved like this so what we're really going to do is just get under the surface of the dough and make the cuts so that it will be able to have these beautiful ears that open up one thing that is important to remember is imagine the bread being divided into thirds so you do the cuts only on the center third you don't want to go across this way so you kind of have to do a decisive cut i'm going to put my hand right here starting from here we're going to cut like this then overlap it a bit because if you don't overlap it it's going to kind of have this strangled look [Music] let's open the door we're gonna place the baguettes at the back we're going to put some water in to create steam we're also going to add some steam into the oven just like so our baguettes are ready and here we go they're nice and crunchy and smell absolutely amazing now let's look here you see a bit of an ear here here as well and now we're gonna open it up and see what the crumb looks like and here is our crumb and it looks very delicious and we are going to wish you a petito", "YA3-xFLfZ-k": "in this video I'm going to be demonstrating how to make a basic baguette that you could easily replicate at home and in future videos we'll go into a more detailed and more advanced technique but if you're new to baking bread this is a great starting point for you and still going to yield a very good baguette that you can make fresh at home now you're always going to want to start with your trusty digital scale that can weigh in grams and has a tare function that allows you to zero out the ingredients also a couple of baguette molds and you can pick these up online around eleven or twelve dollars and also some two inch Hotel pans and I'll put a link to all this stuff in the show notes now between the hotel pans and the baguette molds this is what we're going to use to generate our steam and the initial phases of the baking process and it's this steam that is so important in creating that crackly crust that are so hard to replicate in a home kitchen you're going to start this recipe by weighing out 800 grams of all-purpose or AP flour and you want to make sure that you're using a national brand of all-purpose that has a protein content or a gluten content of around eleven and a half percent now in the US there are some regional southern brands that are formulated for making biscuits and the gluten content is lower around nine to nine and a half percent and it's not appropriate for this recipe next you want to weigh out 520 grams of warm water around 85 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit and this is going to give us a 65% hydration rate based on the Baker's percentage next weigh out seven grams of active dry yeast and the seven grams active dry yeast is about equivalent to one packet of yeast that you buy in your local supermarket and this will come out to be a little bit less than 1% by the Baker's percentage now our final ingredient is our salt which is going to be 16 grams or 2% by the bakery percentage and always kosher salt I'm going to set the salt aside and going to disperse my yeast into my warm water and this isn't so much to activate it or hydrate it as it is it's just to make sure that it'll be evenly dispersed throughout my flour when I mix the two together my thought is if I have the yeast evenly dispersed throughout the water it'll permeate the flower fairly easily so the next step is to take my water and yeast mixture and or it into the bottom of a mixing bowl I always like to have the water on the bottom and then place the flour on top it just makes the initial combining a lot easier and then I like to use one of these nifty little hand spatulas the little rubber bowl scrapers to combine the flour and water and you can also just get your hands and they're getting nice and dirty and roll that flour and water together until it comes into a shaggy sort of mess the sort of a loose ball of dough and at this point instead of kneading we're actually going to set it aside for a little while placing it in a plastic container that's been sprayed with panelist spray and let it rest for about fifteen to thirty minutes and this is called auto lease and the purpose of auto lease is to allow the flour and the gluten in the flour to hydrate making it a lot easier to knead the don't work with the dough and when the dough is easier to knead you have to knead it for less time and that'll give you a better flavor because the more you knead your dough the more it will oxidize so after that oddities period what you can do is you can do what's called a stretch and fold just like this where you pull that one third of the dough and fold it back in on itself one third of the dough and you fold it back in on itself and I did spray that board a little bit of pain relief spray just to make it a little bit easier to work with and you round the dough as you're going to continue the stretching fold method you would let the dough relax for 20 minutes and come back and do another stretching fold and continue this at 20 minute intervals for about an hour to an hour and 40 minutes and the stretch and fold technique actually allows you to form a gluten network without kneading the dough and it'll give you more larger irregular holes now for the traditional actual kneading method you're going to use the heel of your hand and press the dough outward away from you dusting the board just lightly with flour just as little as possible so the dough doesn't stick and continue that kneading process for a couple of minutes after a couple of minutes you want to add in your kosher salt and the reason why we waited till now is because kosher salt is salt in general well tighten gluten strands and make the dough more difficult to knead at about the 6 minute mark we're going to check our gluten structure by stretching a thin membrane out a piece of dough and you see how it's tearing on me there that shows me that my gluten network where my gluten structure isn't fully developed yet but at this point I'm kind of getting sick of kneading I want a little bit of a break so it's going to spray the board a little bit of panel a spray spray the top cover the bowl with plastic wrap and then I hang out for about five minutes and go relax for a second after that five to ten minute rest you'll notice that the dough is a lot more pliable and easy to work and from here you can give it a couple of stretching fold you can knead it for a couple more minutes and you should be pretty closed in the ballpark of having that nice gluten Network so rip off a piece of dough give a little stretch and it's hard to see with the lighting in this camera shop but basically you're looking for a thin membrane that light shines through which we now have so I'm just going to round the dough and at this point now that my gluten structure is nice and developed it's time to bulk form it so just place it back into a plastic container that's sprayed with a little bit of a pain relief spray or you can rub it with a tiny bit of oil so it doesn't stick and you want to bulk ferment the dough at room temperature and the bulk fermentation is also known as primary fermentation and you want to bulk from it at room temperature for about two to two-and-a-half hours or until the dough has nearly doubled in size at that point it's time to divide and form the way you can do this is very gently turn the dough out onto your working surface that has a little pan release spray on it and be careful not to decompress the gas out of the dough too much and you're going to divide into four pieces and notice how I'm cutting into rectangular shapes that's going to make the baguettes a little bit easier to form and I'm scaling these four pieces to about 330 grams of 340 grams apiece now once you have your dough divided and portioned you onto a preform and the way you do is you take the top third of the rectangle and you fold it into the middle creating a seam with your fingertips right down the middle and then you take the top two-thirds and you roll them back onto the bottom third trading a scene with your fingertips while tucking in the ends and then you can also use your fingertips to seal that seam now commonly what you'll see too is a tension pole just like this where you tuck your fingers along that seam and you drag that seam along your board creating tension on the top of the preformed loaf and it also helps to seal that seem one more time from my perspective just the top third of the dough and then rectangular shape you're gonna fold back on itself create a seam directly down the middle and then roll back to the top two-thirds again and create a seam now you can usually heel of your hand to close that seam up get a little roll and you always want to rest seam side down and this preform is going to allow us to do the next step which is the benching or the bench rest and we're going to bench rest the preform baguettes for about five to ten minutes to allow the gluten structure to relax during this time you can go ahead and spray your baguette molds with a little bit of pain relief spray you know get them ready so you can form your final baguette and just place them right into the mold and then you want to take your preformed baguette which was resting seam side down and turn it steamed side up and then gently press down along that seam with your fingertips slightly decompressing the loaf and elongating it by stretching it out by pulling it from both ends and then you take the top third again you press it into the middle of the dough or the baguette and you seal that seen with your fingertips and then you take the top two-thirds and you roll it back on that Mouse bottom third creating a seam with your fingertips pressing it down as you go and you want to use the heel of your hand to seal that seam so you have a nice tight seam that doesn't explode on you and you bake now if you want to elongate you just simply can roll the dough with your hands a little bit and stretch out any long get out and then you go and find the seam that you had originally and when you find that seam you place that seam in your baguette mold seam side down now if you want to have some pointed ends you can just simply counter twist your baguette and that will give you pointed ends and then elongate it slightly and again you want to find that seam and place it in your baguette mold seam side down now real quick from my perspective again here's our preformed baguette seam side up I'm going to go down the length of the baguette using my fingertips to gently decompress it I don't want to be overly rough here I'm just gently decompressing it and stretching it out slightly and then I want to use the my fingertips to fold back the top third into the middle and create that seem going directly down the middle and in that top two-thirds is going to be rolled back and seamed with the bottom one-third using my fingertips initially and then using the heel of my hand to go back and create that seam now when using the heel of your hand you always want to make sure that your fingers are pointing up towards the ceiling never flat because that way you're gonna if your fingers are flat you're going to crush the dough just going to go down that seam seal that seam with the heel of your hand if you need to you can roll it to elongate it and again you always want to place it seam side down to proof now once you've formed your baguettes you're going to cover them in the hotel pants with your plastic wrap and allow them to proof for about an hour to hour and a half or until they grow to about one and half times their original size at this point it's time to prepare for baking and here I have a sharp Baker's razor and I have it just on a little popsicle stick now when scoring baguettes you want to do it at an extreme angle a little bit less than 30 degrees coming in horizontally and that's what's going to give you the nice little Leafs or ear marks when they expand in the oven and here I'm making three slice marks as I go down the length of the baguette and then I'm going to place some ice cubes in the tray and the ice cube is going to help generate steam when we cover it with tinfoil so I'm going to seal the top of the hotel pan very tightly with tinfoil and then pop this into a 500 degree oven and bake covered for the first ten minutes of the baking process now at this point after the ten minutes you're going to remove the tin foil and you'll notice that when you remove the foil you're going to have some steam bellowing out and that steam is going to help your expansion and again this that's what's responsible for that nice crackly crust when baking a baguette I'm going to drop the oven down to 425 or 400 degrees depending upon your oven and bake for about another 10 minutes and I'm going to check them rotate them top to bottom and turn the pans 180 degrees and then from here bake at another anywhere from 15 to 20 minutes again depending upon your oven and you want to make sure you get a really nice dark golden brown color because the bottom because you're using baguette molds the bottom of the baguette won't brown as much the top so you want to compensate for that by getting a nice golden brown top to really extract the full flavor of the flower now from here you want to allow your baguettes to cool for about 40 minutes before slicing and when you slice into this you'll notice that you have somewhat of an irregular crumb when you squeeze that crush it's going to crackle and crunch which is really what makes this technique important with using the steam and the crumb itself is somewhat irregular not as much as if we would have done the entire process with the stretch in full technique but that's a little bit more advanced so we're going to cover a stretch and fold a little bit more advanced process for making baguettes and a follow-up video to this but suffice to say nothing beats a nice homemade fresh baguette straight from your oven for sandwiches and soups and just dinner in general for more information and for this episode shownotes head owner to Stella : comm /sb to", "BmFnJOAWvi0": "it's baguette time oh yes ladies and gentlemen today we're making crusty baguette like a baker when you baguette you don't regret i am welcome to vincenzo's play with the buckets thank you anthony silvio the fantastic baker he's been showing us so many secrets and techniques how to bake and today showing us how to bake baguettes crusty baguettes crusty baguettes the french way yeah i can't wait please show us the first step is we need to make a pre-fermented dough today the pre-fermented dough we're going to make is called poolish which means that we mix together equal quantities of flour and water with a very very very small pinch of yeast mix it together and let it ferment overnight we're going to allow this one to ferment for 12 to 18 hours depending on how warm the night is or the day is when you're making this and then tomorrow we'll come back and we'll mix that poolish into our final dough to make beautiful baguettes we have 190 grams of cold water 190 grams of bread flour and then i have here some dried yeast of which i'm only going to use a tiny pinch the first step is we need to add our little tiny pinch into the water then we can add all of our flour and we just simply mix since we're using equal quantities of flour and water you can see that this is quite a wet dough it looks almost like a paste but by the time that we let this ferment for 12 to 18 hours overnight you're going to see tomorrow this is a very active and alive bubbly mixture now we just need to cover this nice and tightly and we're going to leave it at room temperature we'll see you tomorrow it's time to mix our final dough let's have a look at the ingredients we're using we have our poolish we have 380 grams of bread flour 2 grams of dried yeast very important that the quantity of the yeast is exact we have 10 grams of sea salt and optional we have 10 grams of die static malt powder diastatic malt powder can be found online but if it's too hard to find you can just leave it out and lastly 215 grams of nice cool water firstly let's add our poolish into the water all of it into the water you can see it's nice and gassy so it's actually floating on top of the water there now it's time to add all of our yeast our malt all of the flour and lastly add your salt on top of the flour we add the salt on top of the flour so that it doesn't come in direct contact with our yeast and kill that activity now we just need to simply stir all of these ingredients together in the bowl continue stirring the ingredients together until they are all combined and the flour is nice and hydrated now that you've combined the ingredients together and all the flour is hydrated simply cover the bowl and we're going to leave this to rest just for about 15 minutes to allow that flour to continue hydrating and then we're going to get in in just a moment and start to mix it by hand this step of resting the dough is really really important and it's actually going to make kneading the dough by hand in a moment much easier for you so be patient and allow the dough to rest okay it's been 15 minutes now we're going to remove our dough from the bowl onto the bench and you can either wet your hands or use a bowl scraper if you've got one of these and we're going to take you through how to do the slap and fold method which is how we're going to knead our dough before we start to mix the dough i want to show you if i pull some of this dough out can you see how the gluten strands in the dough are a little bit uneven it's not very smooth and you can see that it's actually breaking a little bit okay this is an indication that our dough is under mixed so now we're going to mix the dough and we'll do this again at the end to show you what it's meant to look like when it's properly developed before we start mixing the dough by hand we're going to dampen them so i've wet my hands a little bit and now we're going to do the slap and fold method here's how we do it we scoop our dough off the bench and with our slightly wet hands i'm going to slap the dough forward pull at it and then fold it all the way over okay now i'm going to turn my hands this way and pick the dough up from the side and return back to the starting position again slap the dough forward pull out it a little bit and then fold it over and we're going to repeat this for the next few minutes to begin to develop the dough's gluten let's do it continue to slap and fold your dough for the next few minutes until the dough is nice and tight and it builds that beautiful gluten development now that we have been mixing the dough for a little while it's time to check its development we can perform the window pane test that we did earlier just by pulling the dough out between our fingers gently we want to see that the dough is nice and shiny and strong elastic but also extensible and can you see that you can see through there it's a very very thin film and that's a lovely window pane now that our dough is beautifully developed we're going to shape it into a nice tight ball and then we're going to pop it into our bowl to ferment for the next two hours to roll this into a nice tight ball i'm just moving my hands in this motion okay and i'm touching the ball with my right hand then my left hand then my right hand then my left hand pushing up against the dough making the skin of the dough nice and tight so we get this beautiful tight plump ball we're going to grease our bowl with a little bit of olive oil just a touch just to help the dough not to stick then we're going to grab our dough place it into the bowl cover your bowl with plastic wrap and we're going to leave this to ferment at room temperature for a good two hours and at the one hour mark we're going to uncover again and give the dough a fold on itself to reinforce the gluten structure within the dough our baguette dough has been resting for one hour so far so let's uncover it you can see it's increased in volume what we're going to do is we're going to take this dough and with a nice damp hand just gently come underneath pick it up stretch and fold it over itself turn the bowl 90 degrees again stretch fold over itself and do that twice more so you've got all the sides and nicely folded over nice and gentle you're also spreading the olive oil and that's going to make a really nice tight dough once again because as the dough rests it becomes very loose and extensible so by folding it we just reinforce the gluten development in the dough so let's cover this once again and we're going to leave that for one more hour at which point it'll be ready to divide and to shape now our dough has been fermenting at room temperature for two hours it's time to divide let's have a look at our dough looks beautiful it's increased in volume it's nice and fluffy exactly what we want okay let's pop our dough onto the bench nice and carefully beautiful now it's time to divide our dough into the smaller pieces today we're going to divide them into 200 gram pieces each at the shop typically a baguette dough would weigh 350 grams and that's because they become really nice and long but we can't fit them in our domestic ovens at home so that's why we're going to make a smaller weight and make a little bit of a shorter baguette so it can fit in everyone's oven so cut a piece of dough gently move it over to a digital scale and keep cutting until you've got 200 grams more or less place that aside so now that we have the dough divided with no flour on the bench at all okay we're going to now pre-shape the dough what we do is we grab our pieces of dough and just fold them over each other a couple of times until it becomes a little bit more plump and tight and then just like before we can start to round the dough off into a nice little round it doesn't have to be perfect at this stage we just want a nice uniform shape now that our dough is nice and pre-shaped we've brought some of the structure back into the dough and they're nice and tight before we final shape these though they need to be allowed to rest for 10 to 15 minutes so the gluten can relax again and then we'll get to final shaping them [Music] dust just slightly on your bench with the flour and now we're going to take one of our pre-shaped doughs and flip it upside down okay a little bit of flour on your hands what we're going to do is pick up the baguette on each side and just stretch it out a little bit place it down now we're going to take the top of the dough and we're going to fold it towards us about two thirds of the way down the side of the dough just like this and just use a little bit of gentle pressure on that edge to make sure that the dough sticks now we need to turn the dough 180 degrees so turn it around and we're going to do the exact same thing we take this top edge here and fold that towards us two thirds of the way down pressing just gently so that the dough sticks now we just need to add the finesse to the shape so what we do is we remove all of the dry flour otherwise if we try to roll on top of flour it's not going to roll properly it's just going to slide starting in the center a little bit of pressure and then move your hands apart and apply more and more pressure as you get to the ends to make that beautiful tapered edge now we're going to lay our linen cloth over the tray dust generously with flour so that our dough doesn't stick and now we're going to place our dough onto the floured linen tea towel it's important this smooth side on top that's going to be our presentation side so what we're going to do is we're going to flip it upside down and you can see that seam that we closed earlier on that line that's running through the center there that's now facing up let me show you what we do here with our tower we pick up from the sides and lift it up so that there's a little bit of a separation between each baguette make sure you place them down with the seam side facing up and they're going to sit right up against each other so they give each other a nice warm cuddle now we're going to cover it completely i'm going to place another tea towel on top so that we can put them to bed okay and then we need to leave them to final proof now that they're in their shape for about 45 minutes to an hour until they're nice and supple to the touch and then we can place them into our hot oven to get a really nice crispy crust on your baguettes it's important that you bake on a hot baking stone so now that your baguettes are starting to proof it's time to preheat your oven with this baking stone in the oven set at 240 degrees celsius on the conventional setting which is the top and bottom element heat not fan force and you need to preheat that oven nice and hot for at least half an hour before you bake i've got my baking stone preheating in the side of the oven on the other side of the oven i just have a tray there getting nice and hot because once i place my bread into the oven i want to throw a little bit of water onto this hot tray to create lots of steam and quickly shut the door to capture as much of that moisture as possible our baguettes should be final proof so let's uncover them you can see they've expanded and plumped up when i press them you can see how the dough slowly bounces back slowly springs back and that's a good indication that they're ready to be baked if i was to touch them and they sprung back really really quickly then that would tell you that they need longer to proof okay they're under proofed and they're still got a lot of life a lot of energy in them so just leave them for another 10 to 15 minutes but as it is at the moment the dough is springing back just ever so slightly so these are beautiful and ready to bake with if you have a pizza peel at home you can use a pizza peel but if not you can simply use an upside down tray [Music] to slide your baguettes off the tray into the oven nice and easily to prepare our tray we dust with some flour we get our baguettes remember these were placed onto our towel here with the same side facing up so i move it out get my thumbs underneath carefully carefully twist it over and then gently pick it up and place it down dust with a little more flour on top to slash our bread we're going to use a baker's lamb which is the tool that we use to properly score the bread okay now i'm going to come on top and very gently but with a quick motion do three lines going nice and straight down the length of the baguette making sure that each time i stop and then i come over and i overlap the line so i'll show you exactly what i mean overlap overlap overlap overlap there we go so i have a few tablespoons of water ready to dump onto our hot tray to create the steam i've got my baguette slashed onto the flour tray ready to go it's time to bake here we go dump the water onto the tray and very quickly close the oven door bake for 10 minutes initially then we're going to remove that tray with all any residual water that's on that hot tray then close the oven door again and bake for another 10 to 15 minutes until our baguettes are beautiful and deep deep golden in color it's been 10 minutes let's have a look fantastic i'm gonna take the tray out of the oven and just leave the oven door open for a couple of seconds you can see that that steamy environment has allowed our dough to expand beautifully now we're going to close the oven door look at these beautiful baguettes they're ready they're so deep deep golden they look absolutely stunning look oh look at that crust that's the right sound that's the sound we like oh guys let's see the big reveal let's have a look beautiful look at that lovely open crumb structure lots of gassy bubbles it's going to be lovely and light when you eat it and the crust is still nice and crispy absolutely stunning and i'm going to cut a slice for me because you're not worried about me all you're worried about is to eat worry about it it's the best time of the race don't you trust me it's good enough you don't need to try it it's crunchy i couldn't be crunching moist at the same time such as more bread wow i need some extra virgin boy on top put some more in the middle a little bit of tomatoes some mozzarella please guys write a comment yeah what else do you want let us know what you think tell us what would you put inside your baguette what type of sandwich would you make that's right that's what we want to know what type of sandwich rather comment below follow us on instagram and subscribe don't forget to subscribe thank you so much the baguette mean chances play thank you anthony ciao you're welcome great man who shared us who shared all his secrets with us so tomorrow i can go and open a bakery and i'll call it anthony silvia bakery ciao", "MyGIWXvR4Ts": "hey home bakers is Jack here bakery Jack da koat UK bringing you your weekly bread making tip every single Thursday in this week I want to show you how to make these lovely little lemon shaped rolls exactly the same size roll it hey I'm bakers and welcome back to the bait which a YouTube channel where i share with you a little bit of my expertise every single week in a bread baking tip video like this one if that's up your street in your new consider pressing that subscribe button and joining the party let's get on with it this is something i sought to take for granted i guess getting everything exactly the same exactly the same size but some people have asked me how is done how do you get them all uniformly the same size let's go through with it with these little lemon shaper rolls to give you an idea of what I'm talking about cut to the table okay here's my though it's been kneaded it's rested up for an hour and it's ready for the shaping stage let's go with through with statistics it's a straight up yeasted dough made with 80 percent white flour 20 percent wholemeal flour half a kilo of flour in total is 65% hydration with a little touch of olive oil to keep everything soft did you get all that good I've got a few things here to help me out one is this calculator to stand a box of flour with a bake with jack scraper inside and the weighing scales the first thing we need to do is weigh these dough to see what it weighs I want to get 12 rolls out of this dough which i think is more than doable with half the kilo of flour dough but first in order to get them all the same size I want to weigh each one and in order for me to find out how big they should be and it's away the dough as a whole and work it out so I'll pop that on there let's see what it is shall we eight four nine eight four nine let's call that a 50 shall we 850 grams divided by 12 is 70 71 grams all right let's go with 70 grams to see how far we get with that 74 70 grams per roll let's get off there now I'm just gonna cut 12 pieces are just going to cut the first one to see where we're at first a hundred and twelve that's hundred and twelve right let's take a little piece off and we'll get it down to 70 73 that would do a couple of grams are besides okay this stage kay we're just going to go through all 77 a bit too big there we go I always recommend this you might want to cut on the scales I never cut on the scales I feel like putting additional pressure on top of scales is probably about out there whether it is or not I don't know but I prefer to take it on and off getting them all together this one for example I think that's exactly 70 I just put those three little wolf cuts together and you can do there that stage that's fine just put off cuts together if you need to make up the amount and work your way through hopefully you'll get 12 around about a similar size you can be bang on the gram if you want to if you're going on to the bake-off get bang on that gram but for us at home couple of grams other sides is not really going to be that noticeable okay get rid of the scales now we've got 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 so we still what's well that's good news 12 pieces at though now they're the right there yup sticky sides underneath so I'm gonna flip them upside down and make them all into balls now our final role is not ball shape okay fire in order to get them all the same if we want to shape them all the same way it's much more difficult to shape that in the same way as shaping that for example and get the same shape at the end so the best thing to do is to make them all a nice uniform shape for us to deal with then afterwards a nice little roll like this if you've probably seen this technique before in their video did about shaping up a roll just flipping over fold on the in on itself turn it over set of smooth sides on the top and tying it out it's a nice smooth round ball I'm using minimum flour always always minimum flour can get away with in fact I haven't put the table at all I'll put some on the top of the day when I turned out other than that it's all cool it's not sticking it's fine I can get away with it twelve little balls all the same size and if you're doing round rolls all the same size this is it this is as far as you take it we're going to take that extra step further let's get those little lemon shaped rallies okay let's I'm all down I'm going to line them up nicely it's just a little bit more pleasing to look at in it let's be honest by that wonderful get my cloth and put it back on the top these are bouncy balls now okay that's hight bouncy balls if I try and shape these up into something else now it's not really going to happen this is called the pre shape and this is the rest before the final shape I'm literally gonna give it cuz they're small five ten minutes just the rest and relax and then we'll do the final shape after a little touch of dust just in case things dry out I don't think they will and we'll come back to these five to ten minutes max I reckon okay so here we are and I think they're ready to go that was ten minutes in the end today by the way they're much softer relaxed much more ready to go for the final shape the first thing I'm gonna do because I've slightly stitched myself up here by putting this here is I'm going to move these across here to free up this workspace here so I've got maximum space I can work in with nothing on it now one thing to know is I'm gonna start up here do my shape I'm gonna stop here do my shape cuz this is the first one I rolled into the ball that means by the time I got to this one here the last one this one theoretically well actually has had more less time resting than this one this one's the most requested and this one's the least rested so hopefully if I do it the same way I'll end up with this one last and it would have caught up with the rest of them really the difference is so minor but there is a difference if you want to get them exact I've got two trays here lined with parchment paper are ready to go I'm just gonna put them up here out of the way where you can't see just so I can put my rolls on there as we go along there we go I'm gonna start with his top on so the top one is gonna be my saw a test the one this is where I'm getting at this side what I'm gonna do working on principle I'm going to side what I'm going to do to transform this into a nice lemon shaped rosolio beard that's just in case you need it on the top only turn it up the other way upside down now a little press my fingers and Knuckles into a nice circle and I'm going to give a cup of a rose a couple of folds sorry into a nice lemon shape so a little press fold one two I think that will do and then I can give it a little roll with the sides of my hands I'm gonna make the ends a little bit pointing I could do it a little bit more space on this table what we're gonna go with anyway that's fine about that seam underneath that little roll goes onto my tray now all about they were meant to do is remember exactly what I did and do exactly the same upside down push push push push one fold two thoughts roll the corners number two done and hopefully it all be the same upside down push push push oh oh roll roll in exactly the same way every single time twelve lemon shaped rolls pretty much identical I didn't do too badly I put them on two trays to give them plenty of room it's a puff up because I might as well there's two shelves in the oven already all I'm gonna do now is give it a little dust of flour all over each in fact I'm gonna pick one up and just have a little roll in the flour for good coverage there's one more thing that I want to do to these is which is give us some nice decorative cuts on it now I don't want these to bust open in the oven to burst open I could sort of a baguette I just want to cut them for a little bit decoration let them prove up and then put them in the oven after I'm looking for that burst so I'm gonna cut them now before they've proved up I could use a green yet for this if you got a green yet you can use a green yet that's the razor blade however because I'm at this early stage and everything's a bit firm I can get away with using the tomato life like this you can use this later on in the proving you can't get away with this because it's too clumsy and it's not like a grignr it's too clumsy but this stage I can get away with it so a few little cuts exactly the same way on each one before I leave it to prove up when you're doing stuff like this and you want to get them all the same it might seem like I'm being a little bit particular but you have to be particular to get them all the same if you put them already down at the same angle each time then you can slice it the same way every single time without having to adjust your body in between because that's when you're going to start getting inconsistencies these I'm going to let these prove up for about 40 to 45 minutes I want to take them right to the cusp of the puffs so they don't get too much oven spring I'm not looking for them to burst open the top I just wanted to open nicely during the proving I'm going to bake them for about 12 to 15 minutes on about 230 degrees which is maximum on my oven with plenty of steam they should hold a nice shape because I shaped them all exactly the same way they should puff the same they should bake the same and all come out looking the same we'll see shall we so there you have it that's how to get those lovely little rollies exactly the same shape and exactly the same size you just do exactly the same thing and it might sound obvious but it's something that I touched on in that video about how to slice a loaf of bread you slice every slice exactly the same way and it'll always be exactly the same it just sounds obvious to me but nothing is obvious to everybody this is the sort of repetition that a baker has on a day-to-day basis and when I was working in a bakery shaping up hundreds of those one after the other after the other after the other that's the sort of repetition you get and that's how you get exactly the same size practice practice practice thank you so much for hanging out with me every single first day for your weekly bread making tip I look forward to seeing you here next week for another one don't forget if you've thought about clicking that subscribe button the beginning and forgot about it along the way don't forget to click that subscribe button it really helps me out the time I'll see you next week for another read makings good bye bye you", "-9DrwXYCICg": "we're going to make baguettes today the recipe I'm using comes straight out of the book how to make bread by Emanuel  Andrea one of the many great recipes in his book the instructions are pretty straightforward it starts with mixing up a pre ferment called a poolish the night before and then continuing in the morning making a poolish couldn't be simpler in this case we're adding a gram of instant yeast to 125 grams of all-purpose flour and then mixing that into 125 grams of warm water you'll find all the ingredients and measurements on our website so you don't have to make note of them now and this will sit covered overnight this is the poolish that I prepared last night it's bubbly has a wonderful yeasty aroma and it's ready to go let me see if I can get it closed up for you to the poolish we add 140 grams of warm water then the dry ingredients which consists of 300 grams of all-purpose flour 5 grams of salt and a gram of instant yeast and we're going to mix this just until the flour is incorporated until all the ingredients come together now we have kind of a rough ball of dough but we're just going to let that sit in the bowl for ten minutes covered and then come back in ten minutes I'll show you what we do next now you're going to do a series of brief meetings that are more like stretching folds each one should only take about ten seconds the instructions call for this to be done a total of four times and 10-minute intervals about the end of which you'll have a nice smooth ball of dough and you cover it between each kneading if you wet your fingers a little bit the dough won't stick when you're kneading this is the fourth time doing this and the dough is indeed nice and smooth now now we're just going to let it sit here and proof covered for one hour all right it's been an hour we're going to punch down the dough and weigh it weighs 689 grams divided by three so we want each piece to be 230 grams so we're going to divide this into three even pieces that's 230 that's 230 so this should be 230 228 close enough all right now we need to flour the board a little bit and we're going to flatten these out gently and do an oval kind of an oval shape and stretch the ends and fold towards the middle and then you're going to take the top edge of this piece and fold it towards the the middle about 1/3 flip it 180 turn it 180 and do the same thing on the other side fold the top edge towards the middle turn it 180 do the same thing on the other edge now hopefully you have three uniform oblong loaves that you're going to let rest seam side down for 15 minutes these two look pretty good this one's not quite the same shape but now it is sort of and I'm going to cover that with a damp towel so they don't dry out while they're resting okay 15 minutes rest time and after the 15 minute rest period we're going to take one of the loaves turn it over flatten slightly and starting at one corner fold 1/3 of the way towards the middle and move to the other end do the same thing and then going back to the other side fold the other the last portion over so it's all rolled up and then just roll it out like this to form your desired to get till you get the desired length could be a little tricky getting just the right uniformity you're after that's pretty close flattened slightly starting at one corner fold one third of the way over go to the end there and one third then finish folding it over and roll it out now you're going to place them on your flowered couch or baking linen cover and let them rise until they're about double in size it's about one hour now the fun part scoring and baking a couple of ways you can do this is to transfer the loaves to a baguette pan like this score the loaves and go straight into your preheated oven or if you're using a baking stone you can transfer them onto a parchment paper lined cookie sheet which slides easily onto the stone and that's what I'm going to do now I'll use this baguette flipping board to transfer the dough onto the cookie sheet for scoring use a long or a super-sharp blade scoring can be a bit tricky you want about 5 1/4 inch deep cuts down the middle overlapping by 1/3 and the blade held at about a 45-degree angle and you need to move kind of fast so you get a clean cut and don't tear the dough I think you need to do this several hundred times to get the feel for it it's awesome to watch a real pro do it most of the time I don't get it right and what I do it's pure luck and into the 475 degree oven for about 15 minutes or until golden brown I'll pour about a half a cup of water into a hot pan to produce some steam all right it's been about 17 minutes definitely look like they're done and they sound like they're done they're done now we'll let them cool for about an hour let's see if we can pick up some of that wonderful crackling noise did bread mix while it's cooling all right let's take a look at the inside all right well these look pretty good the crumb which is the inside part of the bread on a baguette it is supposed to be characterized by lots of random size holes with none of them too big this particular loaf could have more of the larger holes for that I could experiment with increasing the hydration level of the dough somewhat next time tweaking things like hydration levels proofing times and dough handling can make striving for bed perfection something of an obsession I probably made this recipe about 6 to 8 times and these loaves are pretty typical of the results I get sometimes they look a little better sometimes are not so great but everyone has delivered an excellent baguette eating experience with a crispy crackly crust and a soft creamy crumb so if you like baguettes give these a try thanks for watching you I hope you enjoyed the video one last note baguettes are best enjoyed within a few hours of baking so planned your baking schedule with that in mind have fun with it and please share your results", "wl7zl__jSGI": "there are only\nfour primary ingredients in this recipe which are\nflour water salt and our yeast leavening agent\nit's really a basic recipe but when you get the method\nof making it right, the timing, the shaping and the baking,\nyou get a piece of bread that's worth more than the sum of its pieces,\nyou get a baguette In this video we're going to be making a simple crusty baguette as our yeast we'll be \nusing fruit yeast water and just in case you want to know more about fruit yeast water or how to make it there's a link in the description box to\nour video on it do check it out back to baguettes this is a recipe I've actually got through a lot of trial and error It does take some practice to really master working with and observing the development of this dough because it's relatively high in hydration it's pretty wet however I'd kind of liken it to riding a\nbicycle and that once you have it down you probably won't forget it and once you've tasted a delicious homemade baguette it'll be unforgettable too, so let's step straight into it or you know let's take a baby step to\nstart the baguette journey that's our poolish, so just grab 100\ngrams of bread flour and an equal amount of fruit yeast water mix the two to combine then we'll leave it for around 12 to 18 hours to fully rise and ferment after that time the poolish should look bubbly and it will also smell absolutely delightful we could also try a float test on the poolish\nif it floats in a bowl of water then it's good to go you should also observe the beautiful\ngluten strands underneath the surface when our poolish is ready we'll make the\nfinal dough throw the poolish into the bowl or\nreally let it slink out and then scrape whatever sticks to the\nbowl it's also best to do this above a scale so we can make sure we get every bit of poolish, or most of it I mean,\nif there's one gram left it's fine with that first thing we'll do is add\nwater this recipe is about 73 % hydration, so 73% times the total amount of flour in this recipe is how much water we have in it and that's going to help us get big open holes in the crumb or as we call it an open crumb after that we'll throw in salt, salt\nisn't really what shines in bread but it is what makes bread really shine,\nwithout salt you get a flavorless lump with a lot of issues, salt in the right amount not only enhances flavor it also\ntightens the gluten structure to be exact should be somewhere around\ntwo percent of the total amount of flour so make sure you've got that amount right after salt is in we'll stir this until\nthe ingredients are relatively well incorporated, then we can add in the final ingredient the flour using her spatula we'll combine it into\na shaggy mass then we're gonna put away the spatula\nand mix with our hands we're just gonna mix until it looks\ncohesive and homogeneous so about three to five minutes of mixing mixing not only will it be smoother and homogeneous it will also have developed some gluten so it'll be a bit less sticky\nand more elastic, since it's there already we're just going to scrape off\nthe dough on our hands and put it back into the bowl then we can just cover it with plastic and we're going to leave it for 45\nminutes if we're doing our first set of stretch and folds after 45 minutes, the gluten in the bread\nwill have relaxed from the mixing we did and the dough should look like this I also have prepared a small bowl of water by the side to prevent the dough from sticking onto my hands I'm going to dip my hands into it\nfrequently throughout these sets of folds now to do a set of stretch and fold we're going to start by grabbing the\ndough from the top side pulling it up and then folding itself over we'll turn the bowl 180 degrees repeat on the opposite side then do the same thing for the other two sides after all the folds all we have to do is\ncover the bowl back up and wait another 45 minutes before doing our next one it's very simple, isn't it? once you get quick at this it's possible to do it in under one minute that's how fast this process is my personal record is something like 35\nseconds not that i'm proud of it or anything to briefly outline the whole process of stretching folds we're going to do a total of three sets of folds with 45 minutes in between each set these folds are meant to develop gluten structure in the bread while preserving its airy interior so we rinse and repeat these sets of\nfolds until we come to our final third set of folds, at which point we\nshould have done enough folding to build the gluten structure and we can\ntest that by doing a window pane test so, taking a small portion of the dough\nand trying to stretch it out thin enough to see light passing through it,\nas you can see it happening here the dough has passed the window pane test,\nthe dough should have also become a lot airier like this, it's fluffy\nand jiggly when you move the bowl all right after the folds are all done\nwe'll leave it to ferment for an hour outside at room temperature then we can either put it in the fridge overnight or leave it outside until it rises this much to get the best taste, the first option is preferable because letting the dough rest in the fridge slows down the yeast allowing the\nenzymes and the bread to work their magic, creating complex and more importantly yummy tastes, therefore if you can I'd really recommend letting the dough cold ferment in the fridge now after the whole bulk fermentation\nhas ended, first thing we'll do is prepare our work surface with a little bit of flour make sure to dust it evenly, just a little bit then we drop the dough out onto it by flipping the bowl over like this then after spreading it out a bit we'll\nmake a line down the middle of the dough with some flour and cut it into two even\npieces being swift and accurate with our\nscraper, the flour down the middle should help prevent the dough from sticking to\nthe scraper how many pieces you divide it into\ndepends on how you plan to bake it you can divide into smaller portions so that you can place it into a casserole pot or a dutch oven here two is enough for me, so i'm going\nto leave it at that and now we'll take one of the pieces and\nstart pre-shaping so we'll take the edges and pull them in\nbefore rolling the dough up to form a roll like this and then we can tighten the dough up by pushing the dough back in this way this forms a really nice smooth roll which will make an excellent basis from\nwhich we can do our final shaping on later, we can also\nmake the dough a bit more rectangular by tucking in the edges we don't need to tighten the dough too\nmuch though for pre-shaping, so this much is enough since it already\nlooks very smooth we'll stop here and put the roll aside then we'll do the same pre-shaping we\ndid on the other piece of dough now going through the same steps once we've done that we'll put the\npieces of dough next to each other and cover them with a glass bowl\nto prevent them from drying up while we let them rest, we're only going to let\nthem rest for 30 minutes so it'll be quite quick this\nis called a bench rest it's just meant to let the gluten relax in the dough\nthat we can shape it later without running the risk of ripping our dough after 30 minutes have passed, the dough should look a lot more relaxed and have spread out we're going to take off the glass bowl\nnow and get shaping them to shape them we'll start by preparing\nthe surface with a small amount of flour and then using a scraper we'll\nscoop one of the pieces up and flip it over onto the surface we'll also slide the dough around to\nmake sure that one side has been properly coated in flour we'll now try to form the dough into a rectangular shape,\nwe want to do this by patting it out and stretching the edges\nwe could also degas it at this stage we're just going to influence the\nresulting crumb structure of the bread we just pat it out gently not really\ndegassing then we'll get an open crumb so lots of\nbig air pockets if we were to just hammer down the dough\nbe degassing it fully the resulting crumb wouldn't be as open\nit'd be a bit more dense with much smaller air pockets,\nit's up to your own preference for the crumb all the while we should still be\nshaping it again aiming to make it as rectangular as possible\nonce we're satisfied with the shape we're then going to fold the bottom end\nof the dough up over using our fingertips to seal it and then we'll pull the top end over\nthat seal we lift it up a bit and stretch we do\nthis to quickly make sure the bottom is well floured and not sticking to the\nsurface you can also add a little flour if it's\na bit sticky then to tighten up the baguette even\nmore we make a final crease like this so placing our thumb in the middle of the\ndough we fold it over and then seal its edge with either the heel of our other\nhands or our fingertips, it's a quick and easy\nprocess really make sure you're really pressing it down when you seal though because it has to be sealed properly during shaping if the dough gets sticky it's perfectly fine to use a little more\nflour but we're trying to use as little as\npossible so just the bare minimum amount to keep the dough from sticking if you'd like to form pointy ends and or\nmake it longer you can also roll it out and then apply more pressure\non the ends to sharpen them okay for me this baguette looks great so\nit's time for us to leave it for the final proof now we'll just quickly transfer the baguette onto the couche I've got a\nrolling pin to prop it up on one side and we're going to also make a fold\non this side to support the baguette after the first baguette is in we're\ngoing to move on to shaping the other piece of dough\ngoing through all the same steps and finally we'll transfer the baguette\nnext to our first one so that they can shore each other up\nand also adding another fold in the cloth to prop up the other side of the\nbaguette cover it and with that we're good and\nwe'll leave them for 45 minutes to an hour and a half as a final proof\ndepending on your room temperature it may take shorter or longer sometime before the baguettes finish\nproofing we're going to start preheating the oven to\n250 degrees celsius make sure it gets nice and hot inside there alright so here the baguettes are after\ntheir final proof we'll just pull the couch open now and\nwe're going to use a board to flip the dough onto, I  also like to add a little rice flour to prevent the dough from sticking to\nthe board and making a mess to move the baguette flip the dough\nfirmly but gently onto the board by holding onto the cloth okay so to score the baguette is the next\nstep, in this case we're gonna aim for three scores that are almost horizontal\nit takes some practice to really get this right, I just recommend being\ndecisive and cutting quickly to get a clean cut once the baguettes have been scored\nwe'll slide them into the oven one by one\nspraying after each one has entered the oven with that we're going to let the bread\nbake on top and bottom heat at 250 degrees celsius now for the first\n20 to 25 minutes or until we see it's no longer growing\nthen we'll take away the steamer and lower the temperature to 230 degrees\ncelsius bake for about 20 more minutes or until\nit's done now while baking what we'd like to do\nfor the first period of time is to create a condition inside the oven\nclose to a sauna a lot hotter though and extremely humid\nthis type of condition is extremely beneficial to our bread\nbecause the humidity in there will allow our bread to rise more by preventing the\ncrust from drying up and basically halting all growth which\nis bad if you've got an oven that has a built-in steam feature like a combi oven\nthen feel free to use it if you don't have one then this is a nice solution\nsetup that i found works pretty well and it's done, there we have our\ndelicious baguettes they are crispy chewy and beautiful", "LDIPvdkCwpE": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "_Iod0m7rDyY": "hello again my name's John I'm a retired cook from the northeast of England in the UK and welcome to another one of my bread videos in this one I'll be making these delicious ciabatta bread rolls this recipe yields eight good-sized rolls but you can increase the ingredients to make more in the same timeframe providing you half the oven space and once again I'll be using the police or sponge method and if you're not familiar with that I'll explain as we go and here's a list of the simple ingredients needed to make this fantastic bread there's only four flour water salt and yeast and these ingredients also include the measurements for the police okiya felishj sponge bigger starter whatever you want to call it it's a pre ferment meaning setting the way a mixture of flour water and a tiny amount of yeast and letting it sit for a few hours before making the bread usually in the fridge overnight using this method greatly improves the structure texture and taste of the bread and it also gives the bread a longer shelf life okay I'll start the police by adding 200 grams of water to a bowl from the main ingredients list now I use digital kitchen scales to measure all of my ingredients as it's the only way to get exact measurements next I'll add the 200 grams that's 7 ounces of flour also from the main ingredients list and the final ingredient for the police is the quarter teaspoon of instant or active dried yeast and assure you how little this is a weird on my Joomla skills one gram that's all you need that lulz will be a good idea to test the yeast before you start the recipe I have a yeast test you can perform on my sandwich bread video I'll leave a link in the description box below okay give that a good mix make sure everything is amalgamated right once that's done cover the ball and get it under the top shelf of the fridge now the reason for the top shelf is it's the warmest part of the fridge sort retards or slows the fermentation down to a steady rate and it's that slow fermentation that gives this bread its fantastic flavor right and after 12 hours sitting at the top of my fridge this is what it looks like now all bubbly and ready to start making some fantastic bread now pour the remaining water from the ingredients list which should be 200 grams or 7 ounces into the police ball just a loose-knit of our Shawn for this recipe I'll be using my stand mixer if you are not using a mixer just combine the remaining ingredients with the police that's the rest of the water flour and salt give it all a good mix cover it and let it stand for two hours that's the only way you can do this without a mixer with the mixer this will take about five minutes right I'll add the combined water and police to the mixer bowl followed by the 300 grams that's ten and a half ounces of flour on the lusting gradient the eight grams that's one teaspoon of salt okay with the puddle attachment on I'll start the mixer off slowly at first for one minute and just out of interest I'll set the stopwatch to see exactly how long this will take to form the dough while that's going on for the first minute are quickly likely Oyler wide for only that a little later right after that minute I'll switch up to the next speed for a further minute and after that minute is elapsed I'll be switching up to the next and final speed which on my machine is number four and once the door starts releasing from the sides of the ball it's ready to go on to the next step what's happening here is the gluten strands are forming and bonding together accelerated by the motion of the mixer it's kneading the dough in other words for those without a mixer the CM is happening in your door only at a much slower rate and there it goes once it's all released from the sides of the ball I can stop the machine and then transfer it to the oiled Bowl are prepared earlier and that only took four minutes forty seconds now for safety reasons switch off the machine at the wall socket and clean down the puddle with wet hands you don't want your fingers in this thing if it's accidentally switched on right whether you've spent the last five minutes mixing the door or the last two hours waiting for the door we're all at the same point now and the next stage in making these ciabatta rolls is to let the door rest and rise for two and a quarter hours but it needs to be turned and knocked back a couple of times so I've set the timer for the first of three 45-minute rest periods [Music] right the first 45 minutes are up and with wet hands get the door five or six turns or make sure you have plenty water on or this door will stick to dry hands just copy my technique and you'll be fine now cover the ball and set the time away for the second 45 minutes and like the police these 45 minute rest and rise periods are very important for the structure texture and flavor of the bread okay the second 45 minutes are up just to exactly the same and turn the door few times with wet hands this is merely to knock the door back and distribute the temperature evenly throughout the door and I expect to be glad to hear this is the last time you'll be handling this wet door in the bowl right I'll cover that and set the timer away for the last 45 minutes okay while waiting for the door to rise I'll get a couple of things ready start him with the baker's couche all this is is a well floured piece of material to proof that your putter rolls on I use 100% cotton pillowcase for mine it's a lot cheaper than the proper baker's couche material and it does exactly the same job next job is to flour the work area try to arrange these sorts next to the couch cloth it's just so you don't have far to transfer the door to okay once the last 45 minutes are up I need to get it out of the ball without touching it as at Doremon and knock any of that Gus out of the door and the best way is to tip the ball upside down and let gravity do the work as Shawn just simply hold the ball a couple of inches from the floured surface for a few seconds and simply let it flow out all by itself and there it goes easy-peasy now this is a high hydration door eighty percent in fact sorts of very wet door sought to shape it you'll need plenty of flour on don't be afraid to use it as any added flour at this point is only external and can be simply brushed off after the rules are baked right once shaped into a rectangle with the scraper and eyeball it into two pieces there now divide each of those pieces into four rolls [Music] use the scraper to help move each one over to the Koosh once you get a rule completed fold up the cloth as shown to support the rolls this is why Baker's use a Koosh especially with wet dough if you just lay a DS on a baking tray to proof they will just spread out and you'd end up with flat pancakes don't worry about them being perfect shapes just get them as close as you can at the end of the day these are homemade who not mass-produced [Music] once all the rolls are tucked up nicely on the couch cover them with a dry lightweight cloth and set you timer for 20 minutes [Music] okay one is about 10 minutes left set your oven to 230 degrees Celsius that's 450 degrees Fahrenheit or gas mark 8 I'm set in mind to 210 Celsius because mine is fun assisted and it runs approximately 20 degrees Celsius hotter than indicated on the dial just after you turn on the oven place a pan of hot water on the bottom shelf this will create a steamy atmosphere in the oven which shall make the ciabatta rolls crispy know these chapattis are traditionally baked on a stone but most people don't have one of those so I'll be baking my rolls on the underside of a couple of baking trays turning these trays upside down just makes it easier to slide the rolls on and off as you'll see a little later and to transfer the rolls on to the hot trays of using my homemade feel board lined with parchment paper but you can buy these fairly cheaply online and you can however use a heatproof cutting board lined with parchment paper like I did a my ciabatta loaf video here is a short clip from that video sure what I made sorry about the steam [Music] okay the 20 minutes are up and it's time to get these into the hot oven right remove the cover cloth and carefully lift them over to whatever peel you're using I can get four to time on my board we shall be able to handle these quite easily but be as gentle as possible right I'll carefully but confidently slide the first four in and then I'll quickly get the door closed while I load up the second four once they're all safely in the oven I'll give the inside a few quick sprays of water this will make the ciabatta rolls even crispier right once the door shut I set the timer for 18 minutes I would normally swap these around halfway through for even cooking but the trial run I did on these the other day they were fine so I'll just leave them as they are right the time's up so I'll slowly open the oven door to avoid a blast of steam and check to see if they're done these could do with a little longer so I'll get them back in for a further minute okay I'm happy with these now so I'll take them out if you want yours a bit darker than this just give them a little longer notice how much they've risen since I put them in this is called oven spring and that is caused by the carbon dioxide gas and alcohol that the yeast produced while it was fermenting during those forty five minute rises and that gas expands with the heat in the oven and that's why you get those classic bubbles in ciabatta bread and don't worry about alcohol that's burned off during the cooking process and it's been about 10 minutes in such a phlegm out of the oven so I've got one oven and let you see what they're like on the inside and there's that classic chapati crumb or bubbles I was prattling on about a few seconds ago all I gotta do now is get some of my homemade butter on and give it a try I like the caption says if you want to know how to make this butter I'll leave a link in the description box below okay all I can say about this bread is that you have got to try it this is without a doubt one of the tastiest breads you'll ever eat it is seriously good and of course and gets the thumbs-up well thank you again for watching please like share comment and

the demonic cookery channel so today we're making part baked bread so I was in the supermarket this morning buying some yeast and I couldn't believe the rows and rows of empty shelves obviously down to the corona virus outbreak and people bought buying but it was mainly processed food that had gone off the shelves things like meats but especially bread there was no bread left in this major supermarket and that was quite shocking but the baking aisle I was interested in those shelves were absolutely full there was literally no problem there whatsoever so I thought I'll tell you what I'll do I'll make a video today to show you guys how to make part baked bread which obviously you can put into the freezer and then have it a much later date a month two months down the line so the only real downside to part baking bread is it only really works with small pieces of bread like rolls sub rolls and baguettes with a larger piece of bread like a 2 pound loaf part baking still means that we have to get the internal temperature of the bread high enough to bake but without actually fully baking the outside a large loaf like a 2 pound loaf to get that internal temperature high enough the time taken means at the outside of the loaf is almost fully baked anyway but with a smaller piece of bread like a roll sub roll or baguettes that internal temperature can be reached quicker without the outside of the roll actually baking fully so once the inside internal temperature is reached we take those rolls from the oven cool fully on our wire rack is you would normally within wrap in cling film or food wrap and straight into the freezer then in a month or two months time we can take those rolls from the freezer take them out of their food wrap cook from frozen if you like at the same temperature you would normally fray a loaf of bread and the cooking process then will be around 10 to 15 minutes until they're fully browned on the outside and though roles will come out of the oven as fresh as he were if you actually did them from scratch update and that's a real advantage of part baking bread so as usual a full list of ingredients will be given at the end of the video so let's have a look at those ingredients now and anything else we're going to need for today so for today we're just going to be making a basic bread dough recipe so I've got 600 grams of a good quality strong bread flour I'll be using 3 tablespoons of olive oil 14 grams or 2 7 grams sachets of fast-action dried yeast 400 milliliters of lukewarm water a teaspoon of sugar and a teaspoon of salt and this is enough ingredients to produce 8 decent-sized bread rolls so first thing we do is to add all of our dry ingredients together mix those through thoroughly so I'm going to be using a food mixer with a dough hook attached to make the dough so I've placed our flour into the bowl for the food mixer and add in the salt sugar and give that a mix turn our frost action so I juiced [Applause] once they're mixed in our three tablespoons of olive oil and take some of the flour up into the spoon to get all of that olive oil out so now I'm just going to mix this olive oil in by hand just until we produce a fine almost like a fine breadcrumb so once everything mixed in we've got the bowl on the machine with the dough hook attached I'm now going to add the lukewarm water a little bit at a time with the machine on a middle speed setting once we get a really good hydration of the dough we may need all of that water remain mume not once we get a decent dough forming an angle to turn the machine up slightly higher than the middle speed setting and leave the dough then to knead with the dough hook for about ten minutes [Music] so once the dough has come from the machine so we needed it for ten minutes with the dough hook I've lightly oiled a large bowl shape the dough and placed it into the center covered with cling film or food wrap this is now going to go into a warm part of the house until the dough has doubled in size okay so the dough has now doubled in size I'm now going to use a set of scales to divide the dough equally into eight pieces but I just want to show you this so for anybody who's over the age of maybe 45 there's a bit of TV cookery program nostalgia the galloping gourmet it says Graham Kerr so that must have been in our family for quite some time God said I'm going to divide these now into eight equal portions okay so we've got our eight equal portions using our galloping gourmet dough divider so next thing we need to do is to shape these pieces of dough into a roll shape and create some surface tension on the top of the roll so I'm not using any flour whatsoever if your dough is slightly more hydrated than this and it's catching quite a lot then use a little bit of flour but not much the more flour you use the more difficult this process is provide just to take these to one side just show you with this one so you take our piece of dough flatly outs a little bit and then also I'm going to do first is just take an outside piece keep turning and just fold that in do that about six or seven times until it starts to form this circle we then want to turn it upside down and the reason for not using flour is because I want that sense of it of this Delta grab on to not stick to the work surface but grab on to the work service so that it doesn't turn over I'm then going to place that part the heel of my hand on the work surface and keep that there so what I don't want to do is I have to rotate like this what I'm going to do is grab hold of the dough and then work the dough around keeping the heel of my hand on the work surface I'm applying a little bit of pressure so the dough itself what I'm doing is I'm allowing the del to turn without actually turning over and very quickly that creates a lot of surface tension and a really decent shape to our bread rolls so that really simple technique works very effectively but as I said if we have flour present on the work surface or too much flour Pleasant what happen is as I'm rolling that dough around it has a tendency to roll over as well which is what we don't want to do because we're still got our creases underneath but that top bit of the dough has a really decent amount of surface tension and and looks great so we just carry on and do that with all of our pieces of dope so once we've shaped all of our pieces of dough I'll place them onto our unimproved tray lightly dust it this tray because I know in the past I've had a little bit of difficulty with bread sticking to this particular tray but if you've got a decent non-stick tray you won't have to dust it with flour first it's just getting to know what equipment you've got in your kitchen missing to do is I'm just going to dust lightly with flour I'm then going to cover this tray now with food wrap or cling film to place into a warm part of the house again but just for about 10 minutes I don't want to have these double in size I just want to go through a second proofing just so these they start to expand and make sure when you place your dough onto this oven proof tray they've got plenty of room around the actual dough so that it can expand okay so the bread rolls have now proved for the second time for about 15 minutes so they've not quite doubled in size preheated the oven already to 200 degrees centigrade so we're going to be baking these as a slightly lower temperature than we would do if we were baking them fully right through to the finish so normally I would bake these types of roles at 220 degrees centigrade so preheat the oven 200 degrees centigrade obviously I'm going to be removing the food wrap or cling film before they go into the oven so I'm placing these into the center of the oven and I've got to bake them for between 12 and 15 minutes so as I said at the start of the video we want to bake them fully on the inside so they don't collapse but we don't want them to brown on the outside unfortunately I can only give you a guide regarding time because obviously your cookers that you guys are using a different to mine so I'll be looking at these through the glass of the oven door after about 12 minutes and I'll assess it from there okay so these are our part bakes finished I've kept four of them in the oven to cook fully because we were having those four for dinner this evening what these are going to go into the freezer taking them from the oven took 12 minutes to bake place them onto a wire rack to cool down fully very important you place them onto a wire rack anything like bread cakes or biscuits put them onto a wire rack to cool down rather than onto a flat surface because they will sweat underneath once they're fully cooled I'm going to be wrapping these individually in cling film or food wrap and then placing them directly into the freezer it's entirely up to you guys how long you keep them in the freezer but all I can say is I've had homemade part bakes in the freezer for three months taken them out baked them and they've been just as fresh as the ones that were sat in there for a month because in tell it to you how long you keep them in the freezer for what I will say is when you take them from the freezer to bake them to carry on this baking process to bake them fully obviously take them out of the food wrap or cling film and bake them directly onto the rack in the oven or on to a wire rack not onto a flat surface a baking sheet because we do want the heat from the oven to circulate around the whole of the apart bake so they cook evenly and they will take once you've taken them from the freezer they will take around another eight to ten minutes to fully cook and they'll be absolutely delicious you so that's a part baked bread really easy to do and at times like this all around Christmas when the shops are full you don't really fancy going out it's one less thing to worry about because you'll have a freezer full of bread please subscribe to the channel and as usual if you've enjoyed this particular video hit the like button thank you very much for watching", "DBBJYda-dyA": "hello friends and welcome back to the channel in this episode we'll make pan depi this is a variation on french baguette pan meaning bread a pea means weeds talk so the bread is meant to look like a stalk of wheat and this funky effect is achieved by cutting it with scissors so keep watching to find out all about it and as always you'll find the full recipe with all the details down in the description box so let's see what equipment we need tray with some non-stick paper a bowl scales dough scraper temperature probe scissors and a thick lint-free towel now onto the ingredients you'll need some strong white bread flour some water some yeast salt and the seeds are optional i'm using linseeds now a regular baguette or this pan the pea is made using your pre-ferment my kitchen is quite hot so i'm using cold water but basically to make a pre-ferment you take a portion of the total flour a portion of the total water and just a little pinch of yeast then you mix it all together and leave it to ferment this particular preference is called a poolish and the main purpose of it is to add flavor and texture to the bread so mix your ingredients and let them ferment for 10 to 12 hours and of course depending on how warm your kitchen is or how cold it is it may take less or more time but you want it to double in size for sure now once your polish is ready make the dough get a big bowl add your water add the yeast add the salt give it a good mix next up we can add the pre-ferment it should be nice and light doubled in size and full of air bubbles and when you drop it in the water it should float when you stir it it should resist if it's runny and loose and you can pour it out the jar then it's over fermented and then you can start over but if it's looking good add your flour and continue get your scraper give the dough a mix in the bowl until you don't see any more dry flour once it's all nicely mixed you can continue on with your hand i prefer doing this first part in the bowl to avoid making a mess on the table but once the dough has been formed tip it out on table and start kneading it is not very wet and sticky so we'll use a regular kneading method what i like to do is press down and forwards with the heel on my right hand then using the fingers of my left hand i fold the piece of dough under the heel of my right hand then i turn and repeat once you've done this few times this motion will become completely fluid and you won't even think about it all in all it should not take more than five to seven minutes and once your dough has become nice and smooth and not too sticky get in bowl ready for fermentation but always take the temperature first 24 to 25 degrees celsius is just about right if your dough is warmer fermented for less time if it's cooler fermented for longer same goes for your kitchen air temperature but my one is just correct so i'll cover it up and leave it to proof for 45 minutes and after the first 45 minutes you need to give it a fold folding will dig as the dough equalize the temperature and create more layers in the gluten structure making the dough stronger to perform a fold place your dough out on the table smooth side pointing down and stretch it out a bit and fold the edge over the middle going around in circle until you reached point where you started and until you have a nice tight ball and flip it smooth side up again tighten it against the table pinch the bottom together place it back into the bowl make sure the smooth side is pointing up and cover it up we'll leave it to proof for another 45 minutes now we should have puffed up real nice by now and after the bulk fermentation we can divide our dough into two pieces now normally i would recommend using scales when dividing a dough but if you're making two pieces then it's quite easy to eyeball it so just use your scraper to cut it right down the middle and don't worry if one is a little bit bigger than the other one now after dividing we need to pre-shape the dough you can use a light dusting of flour if you feel that it's a little bit sticky to pre-shape place the dough smooth side down flatten it then fold the edges over each other and then fold the top down and the bottom over the top i hope that made sense just wash my hands you want it to be kind of a blunt cylinder shape basically and after pre-shaping we need to rest the dough for 15 minutes so the gluten relaxes we can do the final shaping we are trying to achieve a baguette shape here because that's what it is it's a baguette the only difference is that before baking you'll cut it with scissors so to shape up get dust your table lightly with flour you don't want too much then place your dough smooth side down flatten it out fold the top third over the middle then turn it around and fold the bottom third over the top now watch my hands i'm using the thumb of my left hand to tuck the dough into itself and the heel of my right hand to seal it shut we're kind of rolling it into itself and sealing it shut then you want to turn it around and repeat the process on the other side this may feel a little bit tricky in the beginning but just practice and you'll get there and once you've sealed it up brush off the excess flour and roll out your baguette i like to make them with pointy ends but it's up to you make sure it's at least a foot long and if you messed up the first one you got another one practice on right so our bread is ready for the final fermentation this is where our towel comes in make sure you flour it well you don't want these to stick in bakeries they use a thick piece of linen called koosh on which baguettes ciabattas and other breads are being fermented on so grab baguette and place it smooth side down on the floured surface just organize it make sure it's nice and straight next we need to lift the towel up and make a crease which will separate the baguettes from each other and then just repeat with the next baguette make sure there's enough flour place it smooth side down and then cover them up we'll leave them to ferment for 45 more minutes during final fermentation preheat your oven to 240 degrees c no fan and after the final fermentation we can see the baguettes are puffed up nicely now get your baking sheet with the non-stick paper and carefully place the baguettes on it with the smooth side pointing up so we need to flip them around again and then just make sure they're nice and straight make sure they have enough space between them grab your scissors and we can start shaping this is the fun part and it's also quite simple so to turn these into wheat stalks grab your scissors cut right down but don't cut all the way through and then fold the pieces of dough either to the left or to the right and you can see how they're starting to look like wheat stalks but if you're not into weeds talks all you need to do is slash them with a razor and you'll have a regular baguette the best use for these is like a tear and share super all kind of thing now this next part is optional but i like to sprinkle the cuts with seeds so they stick to them it just gives them nice visual effects and now get them in the oven bake them for around 20 minutes and that's your pen they pee easy right get them out of the oven and enjoy and as always if you have any questions or suggestions drop them down in comments and consider subscribing if you haven't already i make bread baking videos every wednesday and sunday and it's not only recipes i also teach principles of baking so if you are into your bread stick around thank you for watching i'll see you in the next one", "By19j41uS6Y": "we're now going to look at shaping up I get so again we've got a nice relaxed piece of pre shaped dough at home you obviously need to make sure that your baguette is going to fit in your domestic oven so I would try and scale this to 200 grams and that should be long enough to fit on a baking tray not too big that you'll have to have a u-shaped buy get so we've got a good side and a bad side top and a bottom the good side is going to remain the outside of our baguette so we're going to turn it over I'm going to knock some of the gas out of it Pat it out with the heel of my hand and then I'm going to form a rectangular shape again this is starting to get that long stretch of I get shape what we need to do is you know I could just roll this out into a into a sausage and make a pie get the shape or you'd end up with is very wonky not very pretty looking I guess at the end of the day so we're actually going to build a structure into this and what we're going to do is build a coil into it so that when we slash the baguette it should open out into that lovely lemon shape okay so we've got our rectangle we're going to take the top and fold it into the middle I'm going to push it down make a ridge so you've got a really clear light to work with I'm going to pick up the dough turn the whole thing around and I'm going to take the top and fold it into the middle again you've got a really clear Ridge to work with now I'm going to start folding from the top into this ridge line now I'm going to do that three times I'm going to use my left hand to pull the dough over you can see my thumb is going to go into this ridge line and I'm just going to pull the dough over and pinch it down with the heel of my hand all that are over pull it over keep pinching it down and then I'm going to exaggerate this ridge line again I want to push it right down again so I've got a clear guide to work too as you can see we're starting to get some length in our blade yet I'm going to do the same thing again I'm going to take the top I'm going to fold it into the ridge line folding it over and pinching it down with the heel of my hand then one less Ridgeline very near the bottom of the loaf now it's going to fold the whole thing to meet itself right over top of the dome it's the bottom of the dough and give this a nice firm pinch down with the heel of your hand there all along the line if you find you're getting stuck just get your scraper lift up the door again and just have a look at that see if there's anything that isn't stuck together you need to pinch it together just to make sure it's all nice and tight as you can see we've now got the main body of the baguette we're not quite done yet though so now we need to build some malanga things to it so need to imagine you're doing brushstroke at this point start in the middle and slowly work out rolling the baguette backwards and forwards applying equal pressure if you can so you get a nice long braid out here it goes if you find that it's fighting back quite a lot I shrinks immediately and just leave it a minute and come back to it that's again the gluten getting all tight and bunched up and it just needs to relax again this one seems to be not too bad actually I'm just going to stretch it out you have nice pointy ends if you want or leave them stubby depending on how you fancy your baguette and again it depends on your preference make a really thin one if you want lots of crust and not too much crumb in the middle otherwise you can keep it a bit a bit shorter a bit better if you want a softer interior to your burger so I'm going to stop there as you can see it's not a hundred percent neat and perfect but what will happen now is the gas will rise up once more and it will fill any imperfections out so you get a lovely smooth tube and then just before we pop it in the oven we'll dust it with flour and 1 slash it okay so we've got our shaped if I get now so you need to get your tripe and it's really good to have a packet of semolina to hand it just coarse flour basically but because it's course it works like ball bearings so it means it's really easy to slide loads on and off and when you're loading them into the oven or means they won't stick to the tray so I'm going to dust my tray with a little bit semolina and then I'm going to lift my baguette onto it that's it I'm sure it fits okay and then I'm just going to leave that to rise again cover it with a tea towel and just so it doesn't dry out too much I guess we'll prove up really quickly so we'll be putting this in the oven within 15 minutes what we don't want is it to really prove up too much and start to become very wide and very flat ends up looking a bit slug light a bit ugly so we just wanted to have enough energy now to prove up a bit and then it will burst nicely and spring it open in the oven okay so I'll put that to one side a minute as you can see this is any kind of 15 minutes after we shape them and they've already risen up loads and they're still holding a nice nice firm shape had they started to spread sideways then they would be over proved and to tell they're ready and they look nice and full they've probably doubled in size but if you use the pad of your finger just press down the indentation you cause slowly fills up with gas if you pressed it and the whole thing collapsed it would mean it was over proved and we left it too long if you press it and it springs back immediately then it's probably under proved sliding you just need to have that middle ground really so that over 2 or 3 seconds the indentation will slowly fill back up with the gas it causes so we need to get these in the oven also as you can see our loaves really well don't really ready to go in the oven now and again press down say anything slowly fills back up over 2 or 3 seconds right I'm going to sprinkle a little bit of flour you can either use a dredger like I've got or just use your hand same flicking technique is quite good nice dusting of flour this protects the top surface of the loaf but also makes a nice contrast for when you slash if I get and so you expose the inner crust in contrast to the white flour so this is where your sharp knife comes into play you need to trust this sharp because what we're going to be doing is not pushing down onto the lope we're going to glide across the top of the loaf and allow the sharpness to do the cutting and you need to be assertive for this again it's this same false confidence in a way you will get confident as you practice but just trust that this works oh nice sharp knife we're going to cut along the length of the baguette this is a little another trick I get slashes look something like this there Lee angle wise when they come out viewable they're not cut about angle if you cut at an angle what you'll get is a humvee bumpy cutter filler type shape you won't get a beautiful open Fe shape which is the lemon shape I was talking about earlier so the trick is actually to slash almost along the length the baguette very straight cut and that will open out to create that lovely spring when we roll the dough over and over and over so that will expand and open out into a lovely lemon shape slash so I'm going to cut it now I'll show you how to do the other trick is to cut through your hands if you put your fingers there and you start cutting you're in danger of cutting your finger so if you cut through your hand each time you'll be holding the dough so the dough won't slide and also you'll be cutting away in your hands so it's nice and safe one two three four nice and me I'm going to do it again one two three four okay so these are slack now they're ready to go straight in the oven and you ever need to be hot on a domestic oven you can get up to 230 to 250 degrees C put them on full whack slide them into the middle of the oven and they're going to take 15 to 20 minutes the beauty of of I get is as I Sophia when it looks but you're sure it is made so I'm going to put these straight in on the trails there now what will help if I get form a lovely brittle shiny crust is some steam so we've got some water in a spray you can use obviously a smaller domestic spritzer like this give the inside of and a good spray this water then close it off and even loan the 15 minutes and we're set", "wVf2OJO_o_c": "welcome to Franco star family I am Franco and I have with me and today we are making for you Prince Brad we are going to bake some french bread for you the tools that you are going to need for your friendship baguette are a sifter also known as a strainer 1/2 a teaspoon a teaspoon a timer you can always use your cellphone or dough cutter a measuring cup a spatula a wooden spoon with a rounded tip this is called a baker's couche but you can also use a 100% cotton pillowcase a new pillowcase that works just as well you would see it later on in the video you also need a cookie sheet that will hold the baguette breads when you are when you have completed rolling them out you would need a spray bottle and plastic wrap the ingredients that you will need are 25 ounces of all-purpose flour 1/2 of teaspoon of instant dry yeast 1 teaspoon of table salt 19 ounces of cold water and 2 cups of flour 2 just a counter so ania are you ready to combine all the ingredients yes I am very good but first let me tell the viewers at home please bear in mind that a measuring cup has several different measuring components you can measure by cups leaders milliliters or by ounces we are using an ounce recipe so make sure that you measure your flour by ounce and you measure your water by ounce right right yes okay so we have the sifted flour here we're gonna combine what's next Ania dry stint yeast we're gonna put that in good girl then we have stop salt regular table salt if you are using kosher salt you can use a teaspoon and a half we're only using one teaspoon of regular table salt but if you're using kosher salt use a teaspoon and a half right spatula please mix milady during this wonderful time of quarantine and I hope all of you families out there are being safe we have started to cook more together as a family it's a wonderful opportunity to cook more to share recipes and to actually teach the children you know many different skills that probably they wouldn't learn if we were in in quarantine stir it right yeah mix everything well mix it up very good Anaya I'm going to mix it just a little bit more we want to make sure everything is incorporated well alright and here is where Anaya is going to add the water regular tap water is fine bottled water is fine but it has to be cool right we're not gonna use the spoon head we are gonna use the spoon handle rounded tip right and I'm gonna show you why because you need a solid object that'll stir it because the dough really does get sticky and we're gonna we're going to have several different components so the dough so this stick is actually what we are going to use pour the water in and I am all of it baby thank you very much we're gonna put the bowl over there we're gonna let Anaya start the stirring and then I'm gonna take over for her I'm going to move this out of our way okay so gonna keep stirring the dough is going to be a sticky dough at this stage so bear that in mind right I'm gonna take the spatula we're gonna scrape off all the excess dough we're gonna put that over to the side and we are going to cover there you go bite my hands we're going to cover the dough we're gonna cover the dough with a plastic wrap good job and I asked for how long 15 minutes 50 minutes right so set it and forget it we're gonna do this for four times that is what is going to give your baguette bread that yummy tasty chewy bite right 50 minutes four times we'll be back the first 15 minutes are completed great now we're going to take the dough out it is going to be sticky what you can do is wet your spatula we're gonna take the dough out we're gonna pour it onto the surface do not add any flour yet right yes we're gonna take the dough out at this stage I am going to wet my hands just like the spatula so the dough is not sticky right we're gonna need it not much it is going to be very sticky but this is what give that chewy yummy flavor of the baguette bread right yeah it is gonna be very sticky so I just gonna knead it a little bit I'm gonna take the spatula out for Mama put it on that side honey yep all we're doing is creating air pockets in it right right and we're gonna put it back into the bowl right yep right I'm gonna get exactly Anaya your dough cutter is going to scrape all the extra excess dough back in because we have to let the dough rise again another 50 minutes it is sticky it is going to be sticky dough right sticky I'm gonna I'm going to wash my hands and we are going to put the dough back for another how long I am Dean minutes 50 minutes the timer I will get a new trainer plastic wrap we have the timer on and we are going to set it and forget it actually we're not gonna forget it at all we're about to go through something else where's the timer honey buns okay we're gonna seal it did you start it all right you're gonna start the timer again we'll be back now we're going to take it off again you can see spatula we're gonna need it again just a little bit I'm gonna wet my hands the textured dough cutter and we are going to set it for how long and ayah 15 minute again get the clock the stop you're gonna put it back in now that you have allowed your dough to rest for four consecutive sequences of 50 minutes each your dough is now ready to start working with right if your dough is still too sticky at this stage you can add a little bit of flour but we really need a well surface I mean a well floured surface at this point here right so we're gonna work the dough ania I'm gonna do three French breads or baguettes and I am gonna allow you to roll one right so we're gonna take the dough now we're gonna do some light meeting not so much again because that makes the dough too heavy and we don't want to make it heavy so the dough should still be quite soft to touch you see our bread cutter you want to press it down for me we're gonna try to get four even portions this is for home so unless you're you really really want it exactly the same you could use the scale to make sure all of your dough portions are evened out however you can eyeball it that's just fine right so I'm gonna give it that Aniyah one dough you're gonna work with that one honey and when I will work with these three right so stay over here we have to make sure your section is floured make sure your surface is well floured right so now we are going to what is called pre roll the dough you listen it baby yeah so we're gonna start from the middle start from the middle put your in there and we're just gonna press down right we're gonna press down again using just your fingers at the tip we're gonna press down again we're gonna press back yeah if we're gonna press back here we're gonna press out here we're gonna press down you're gonna press down keep pressing after you do this a couple times you'll get the hang of it if you don't have enough time because you know life is so busy and we don't have enough time to let the dough sit you don't have that 50 minutes four times in your date what you can do you can actually do the dough in the evening and take it and put it in refrigerator covered overnight and then the next morning you can work with the dough it'll give you that same yummy flavors and a lot of bakeries do that right so after we get the dough like this we're gonna fold it in on itself right we're gonna fold it in on itself yes we don't turn it over and now we're just gonna shape it we're gonna shape it a little bit then we're gonna take some more flour I want you to sip Taniya let me show you let me I'm gonna do my station and we're gonna put the pre-roll do your area hit it a little harder honey a little harder so the flour comes out good we're gonna take your dough and we're gonna put it here right on the flour and we're gonna leave it right there right we're gonna do this one again again now and this is the faster version you're gonna do this is what is called the pre roll well floured you're gonna put it there then great job Ania great great job gonna knead it out then we're gonna fold it on itself see and all of the dough there pretty much just about the scene now we're going to take a new sheet of plastic wrap and lightly oil it I'm regular canola oil olive oil is firing lightly oil it and then you're gonna take that and cover your pre roll dough keeping them separated because they have to rise again you have to cover it especially if you have a cool house in depending on where you are geographically so and we are now going to leave this for how long and I am 20 minutes 20 minutes it'll be back okay now that we have allowed our pre roll dough to rest for another 20 minutes this is a nice dough and I'm gonna work with these three you're right baby yes okay so let me do it first the dough is going to be very soft right so we are going to want one second pay attention and then I'm gonna show you again make sure your surface is well floured we're gonna turn the dough over and we're gonna start to again spread it out with our hands right we're gonna spread it out with primarily your fingertips to get all your gonna feel a lot of air pockets right you're gonna turn it over one more time and now we're gonna fold the dough fold the dough you're gonna use the palm the base of the palm of your hand and you're gonna squish it down I'm gonna squish it down and this is where what is called that Vegas hoosh I'm probably saying it wrong but that's okay push push comes in so we're gonna roll it out shape it out but this is where this comes in again you can basically use a new I have a brand new pillowcase a cotton pillowcase 100% cotton pillowcase but this has to be well floured so you're gonna flour it so when the dough sits on it it does not stick to it again right we're going to pick it up and then we're going to just position it on it then we're going to cover it you're gonna bring this up right so we have one right this is where all that extra flour is gonna come in ready and I oh yes so we're gonna work with yours now I'm gonna take yours going to move it just a little bit right put it here and we're gonna start to spread it out with our hands we're gonna spread it just your fingertips just your fingertips all right we're gonna turn to go over you're trying to push it into a long you know how the French breads it's that long shape yeah you're just using your fingertips to spread it out you feel all those air pockets feel like little bubbles inside right yeah that's the East action so we can turn it over again you have to look at it because we want a pretty bread right yep so when you get that now you're going going to take the corner and roll it alright we're gonna roll it pressing it down a little bit we're gonna roll it a second time roll it a second time because your little hands are small you could turn it this way use this portion of your hand this just just a little we're gonna press it but we're gonna press pretty hard but they seal together right and then you let me do mine have to catch up to you right and then we're going to roll it one more time a half a roll so we get that nice long shape it's really nice having little helpers I remember when I lived with my aunt in New York she taught me so much about cooking and baking so then if we're gonna pick it up lightly you can shape the end your end is a little no it's fine it's perfect right try to get them all the same size we're gonna take it now and put it again and then bring it up again because remember they're gonna rise they are going to rise again so when you bring that to you yeah and then we have one more so we're gonna remember which one is yours then we're going to do the last one do you having fun yet yeah and remember clean hands clean hands this is a wonderful opportunity to cook with your children you can fold it on itself again use the palm of our hand give it a half fold and again are you gonna section it so each each dough have its own section again we're gonna put it down again now you're going to need a regular tea towel a regular kitchen towel and you're going to cover your rolled out baguettes now for another 20 minutes so set your clock again for another 20 minutes set the clock the time on Eire got it yep and we will be back again when you've completed the last 20 minutes you will then put your oven on to bake at 400 degrees and allow it to heat for 12 minutes we're gonna set the timer again for 12 minutes your bread should still be covered down and you are going to place a pan of water at the bottom of the oven this will allow a steaming property and you're going to see later on I'm also gonna use the spray bottle to spray it up against when they get in the oven that will allow you to have that yummy crust that we all love okay our last 12 minutes are finally done okay we are going to move on see that the bread has risen and this is just a piece of cardboard covered in foil so create a flipping mold for the dough so we don't mess with the shape so we are going to put it here Anaya and we are going to flip it flip it on to the train then we are going to bring it over let's do an is so we can get her speaking ah take it on deck here huh I'm gonna strap their baby and we're going to put it here right here is where we're going to score it if you of course you've had French bread you know that it has slices coming down or one long slice coming across what this does it allows the bread to rise and bake evenly so I like to cut it make sure your knife is sharp I like to cut it across I like the way that looks get down deep enough that it will right would you like the same thing honey you're gonna score it and this is where you can help but now we're gonna take a spray bottle you're gonna give it to spray it's just lightly right - all right I'm gonna spray on top of the bread not close we're just adding some mist or full sprays right to each okay all right you want to pick it up for me okay loving is hot so be careful preheating and we're also going to spray inside of the oven to create a nice steaming effect this will also allow the crust of the dough to take shape you're going to leave the dough in for eight minutes and then you're going to rotate the pan so that way it can clip evenly all across hi Aniyah are you gonna sit there and watch the bread rise yes okay our first eight minutes are done so we are going to turn the pan around I'm gonna put it back in we're gonna spray one more time for another eight minutes or so all golden brown we are finally finished our homemade bread great job Ania great job too me too are you ready to taste yeah it's still a little warm the house smells amazing are you gonna do the dance you were doing when I took everything out the oven she was jumping around the kitchen like yes yes yes it's done um the house smells amazing amazing so which one can we cut yours yep this was the one she rolled out you can hear all of that wonderful if you can zoom in you see you see all of the air pockets you can the crust is crunchy and the inside is soft we normally have it with cheese or like wheat and olive oil right let's pick a piece I will take the bus song and vinegar Matisse see it's very clear what's so good I have the children I like mommy hurry up because they want some chairs and I have great job honey we hope you'll try this wonderful recipe if you like this video please give us a thumbs up my mouth is full of bread subscribe to our Channel Franko's fat family and don't forget to hit the notification button so you will get a notification every time we upload a new video I'm so sorry my mouth is full French bread you can really make it at home", "m_rPW5X9zec": "[Applause] top quarter into the middle turn the net not quarter into the middle and then bury the top enough flour on the palm of your hand just to keep it from sticking but notice I have very little flour on the table itself only as much flour as if you needed to keep it from sticking time so now while I'm doing this I'll go back to the beginning this dough was mixed using what's known as the straight dough or SDL straight Dometic alright it's basically put on your ingredients into the mixer let it mix until it's appropriately mixed now that's very very simplified this is a lean dough okay this is a lead though right it has bottled water used to sauce this is a French style dough which means that if you've ever had a bad yet or a good Italian thread they're both similar it's very open the crumb is open it's not tight so it's got some nice big holes there's almost as many holes as there is bread inside so we don't want to over develop the gluten but gluten remember is the protein that is in wheat and several other types of grains that give you strength structure elasticity you remember that from the last class hopefully so we want to mix this at what's known as a short speed a short speed is utilizing the mixer only on low for a relatively short amount of time and what that is is for the first four minutes and we did this with the window in how they key works the ingredients with the exception of the salt will go in and mix for four minutes I don't know speed speed one you want to go through what's known as the pickup and the cleanup which is the ingredients are putting a person just come together and then ultimate a ball of dough by the end of the first four minutes you are ready to begin adding the sauce the reason why you don't add salt at the beginning is salt get in the way good afternoon the work should be enough one missing okay and right away because all can't get in the way of the flower properly absorbing all the water that to remember itself one of the properties ourself kind of it's hypostatic so pulls moisture sword itself and use things properly hydrating tonight the other thing is depending on the kind of Beast you're using salt might actually damage or kill the East and East remember Asia the leavening agent is biological events is alive so she want to make sure the salt doesn't come into direct contact", "JGV4M0GABFQ": "hello again my name's John and welcome to my latest video this time I'll share with you how I make these beautiful 1/3 whole wheat flour baguettes that you see on screen these buckets are very similar to my ordinary white bread flour baguette video but with a few slight changes to the recipe and waiting times over the years I've tried various percentages of wholemeal flour from 25 percent to 100 percent and found that my personal ideal combination is 1/3 wholemeal flour to 2/3 white bread flour this way you still get a good percentage of whole-wheat fiber in your diet but still maintaining a light crispy delicious unhealthy bucket now I mail my own whole wheat flour so just out of interest I thought I'd show you how I manage this obviously I don't expect most of you to mill your own flour you just party yours but try to find a whole male flower that has 14% protein in the contents I'm not being sponsored by anyone by the way I just thought you'd find this part of my process interesting [Music] and this is the wheat I use it's a high-protein organic wheat I buy this in 25 kilogram bags which lost me about a year so I save quite a bit of money too apparently if stored correctly in the proper container unconditioned this wheat could last up to 30 years and it will still grow and plundered okiya a measure of one kilogram of weight that's two of these jokes each containing 500 grams you've got to haul this with two hands us it's got a bit of a kick when you start this thing as it does a powerful mortar and that's the second job of week going in [Music] and that's about all there is to it one kilogram of wheat grain in and one kilogram of wholemeal flour out was no additives or preservatives just pure unadulterated high-protein organic whole wheat flour brilliant now I get started with the baguette recipe [Music] I start by way enough 233 grams that's eight point two ounces of wholemeal flour which is one third of the total amount of flour needed for this recipe next is four hundred and sixty-six grams that sixteen point four ounces a strong white bread flour now the total amount of flour used should be six hundred and ninety nine grams that's twenty four point six ounces the water the best way to measure the water for this or any recipe is to weigh it and the most accurate unit to measure it in is in grams the grameen EU key is the same as a gram anywhere else on the planet but I'll give the way it announces - but that's not fluid ounces its ounces on the scales see what I mean there's absolutely no uncertainty or ambiguity with grams and for this recipe it's five hundred and twenty grams that's eighteen point three ounces of cold water that the yeast for this recipe is one level teaspoon of active or instant dried yeast and just out of interest that should with four grams or not 0.15 ounces and that's just about spot-on if you're using fresh yeast for this recipe you'll need 15 grams or half an ounce the salt you'll need for this recipe is one and a half teaspoons or nine grams of kosher salt or one teaspoon that's six grams of ordinary table salt by the way there's a full list of the ingredients at the start of the video I'll also include a full list in the description box under the video okay I'll start the recipe by adding a flower under yeast to a ball and giving that a good mix using a whisk if you used in fresh yeast dissolve it in the jug of water and give the water a good whisk now I'll add the salt and whisk that in till then put the whisk away you don't need that anymore time to add the water pour the whole lot into the ball and start to blend it together I like to use my trusty wooden spoon handle to do this part it seems to be the perfect implement for mixing this type of door however if you find us a little difficult to do you can use a stand mixer using the door hook on very slow speed but for no more than one minute and only for this initial mix don't forget to scrape down the sides of the ball once the door has been formed and you'll notice when the door looked shaggy and start sticking to the ball cover the ball with some sort of plastic wrap or even put it in a plastic bug I use the shower cup the idea is to look in the moisture and not let any of the water vapor evaporate now the door needs to develop over a three hour period but it has to be turned and knocked back every 45 minutes just the same as my other bucket recipe this is probably the most important part of the process because this is where the fantastic taste and texture is achieved I know this seems to annoy a lot of my viewers but if you want probably the best bread you've ever tasted this is what you have to do and to be honest a three-hour proofing time is not long compared to some artisan bread recipes if you want a quicker bread to try have a go up my sandwich north on my channel I'll leave a link in the description box below the video right that's the first rest and rice period over with now scrape the door out of the ball using a spatula on to a slightly wet bench as shown in the video and give it a few turns making sure your hands are wet like you see me doing try to omit it the way I'm manipulating the door I believe this is a common French kneading technique and it's very effective you can actually see the door becoming smoother with each stroke if you find it a bit difficult for the door the best you can all you're doing is knocking back the door on an evening out the temperature so it rises evenly the folding process shouldn't take more than 30 seconds you don't want to be overworking the door [Music] right cover the dog in and set the timer for the second 45 minutes try to keep your work area clean and tidy after each rest and rise period each time you remove the cover you'll see the door has developed a little more as the yeast is doing all the hard work for you if for some reason you're not seeing your door rise then there's a good possibility your yeast is no good so before you attempt making these do a test on the yeast first I show you how to do this on my sandwich love video on my channel check that out first and have your yeast prove itself before starting any bread project I'll leave a link in the description box below the video [Music] [Music] okay that's the end of the third rest and rise period and as you can see the door looks full-bodied and smooth I'll give the door its lust fault and cover it for the final 45 minutes and while it's happening I can begin to get a few things ready to start form in these buckets one of the first things you need to get ready is a 75 centimeter or 30 inch length of cling film or cling wrap cover the cling film with the fine quart of vegetable oil this is to cover the pre shape buckets as you'll see a little later in the video [Music] next you'll need what's known in the trade as a baker's couche all this is is a well floured cloth to rest the buckets on for the final rise I use a cotton pillowcase for mine as it's a lot cheaper than the real Koosh material and it does the same job just thought my wife doesn't watch this video okay I'll give the bench a good dusting of flour and I do this next to the couch so I don't have far to transfer the buckets when I start to form them I also have a small ball of all-purpose or plain flour handy with a little baby sieve for dusting now the last 45 minute rest period is over and it's time to start to form the buckets I'll begin by scraping out the door into the middle of the floured bench and give the door a light dusting of flour then I'll divide the door into four equal pieces using scraper if the quantity of ingredients were correct at the start of a recipe you're finished door should wear twelve hundred and thirty grams that's two pound 11 ounces saw each door piece when divided should wear three hundred and seven grams that's just under 11 ounces [Music] [Music] once the door has been equally divided I need to preciate the baguettes us the door has to rest a while before forming them into the proper bucket shape just copy the way I'm doing them in the video once all four are pre shaped cover them with the oiled cling film and let them rest for 20 minutes and like I said earlier this will make forming the finished baguettes a lot easier and the reason for this is when door has been handled the gluten strands tighten up but once it has been allowed to rest a while the gluten strands relax again and it becomes much easier to shape [Music] okay now those pre ships are done I'll cover them with that oil cling foam added earlier and set the timer for 20 minutes [Music] time to start forming the finished baguette shape take a piece of the door if it's a bit sticky add a little flour and then manipulate the door into a rectangle like you see in the video now roll the door down towards you from the top of the rectangle tooken in the ends as you cool once you get to the end use the heel of your thumb to seal the bucket leaving the seam on the bottom then simply form it into the long baguette shape and then carefully transfer it to the Koosh using the material to separate each bucket from its neighbor [Music] [Music] [Music] okay rather than make another two long buckets from the last two pieces of door I'll make four mini wants the made exactly the same as the long ones just a bit of a variation in the length these are great for making solid sandwiches with [Music] [Music] [Music] right I'll just let you watch as I finish off the rest of the mini buckets and I'll speak again once they're all done and on the couch [Music] okay that's them all done now I'll cover them with my light holy Jade towel and set the timer for 25 minutes as it's pretty warm in my kitchen today by which time they should have risen enough to start baking them if your house is on the cold side it may take a little longer now after 15 minutes I'll turn on the oven and that'll give it 10 minutes to get up the temperature but I'll speak more about the oven in a minute okay there's only 10 minutes left on the timer it's now time to pre-heat your oven to 200 degrees Celsius that's 395 Fahrenheit or gas mark 6 I'm setting mind to 180 Celsius because my oven is fun assisted and it runs about 20 degrees hotter than indicated on the dial to make nice crispy baguettes they need to be in a steamy atmosphere so carefully place a pan of boiling water on the bottom shelf of the oven just after you've turned it on you'll also need a spray bottle handy for a couple of things as you'll see a little later right the time is up if your buckets haven't risen as much as mine give them a little more time but like I said earlier my kitchen is pretty warm today and that'll make them rise a bit quicker when it's called in my hopes I sometimes after weird up to 45 minutes and as you can imagine this is one of the problems with making bread videos as it's very difficult to use set times as everyone has different conditions in their homes so you'll just have to rely on visuals if your buckets look like they stand there ready to bake okay I need a couple of lightly greased baking trays this first tree is for the for many buckets and I have a longer one for the larger baguettes once they're on the tree it give the buckets a quick spray with water this will make them easier to score so using a very sharp knife or razor blade scored the door the same way as I'm doing in the video me and she where you overlap each cut this will allow the bucket to rise evenly in the oven the diagram should give you a better idea of what I mean these small ones get three cuts each and the big ones get four [Music] or Gail just set those aside to look at the two larger buckets on their tree to transfer the large buckets I use my homemade pail or flipping board all it is is just a piece of strong cardboard covered in aluminium foil it works great [Music] now just do the CMS with the smaller ones a quick spray of water only differences these get scored four times [Music] time to start baking the baguettes carefully put the trees into the oven I'm putting the larger buckets on the top on the small ones underneath no particular reason as these fan assisted ovens do tend to cook pretty evenly between top and bottom but I've notice mine seems to be hotter at the back of the oven that's why I like to turn my bread partway through now just before closing the door give the oven a quick spray with the water for extra crispiness Chris penis but don't think that's a word actually but it definitely should be the large buckets take approximately 17 minutes to cook under smaller ones about 15 so I'll set the timer for 10 minutes then give them a quick turn for even cooking be careful when opening the oven door released the steam slowly as you can see the buckets have sprung quite a bit coconut days the large ones need another 7 to 8 minutes under mini buckets are almost there so I've set the timer for a further 5 minutes then take the small ones out [Music] okay the smaller ones have done so I'll take the words out I know they look a little light and underdone on this camera but I assure you with my video lights reflecting off the bread now I'll set the timer for another two minutes to finish off the large buckets and there's the small ones all cooked and looking a lot better in this light and they are wonderfully light also you can hear how crispy they are as I'm taking them off the baking tray and the smell is absolutely gorgeous [Music] [Music] okay it's time to take up the large ones [Music] and they're cooped enough for me if you want them a bit dark I'll give them a couple of more minutes but not too long you've invested a lot of time in making these and the last thing you want is to burn them and there they are all golden brown and looking delicious [Music] right let's have a look inside of one of these mini buckets the one thing you'll notice about these homemade buckets is you don't get a really large crumb or bubbles in the bread like you do with ordinary white bread flour buckets I have no idea why but I suppose it's to do with the wholemeal flour [Music] regardless these are very light for a 33% wholemeal bread now the only thing to do while it's still warm is to try a piece with some of my homemade butter I have a video on my channel how I make this butter if you want to check it out I'll leave a link in the description box below the video and honestly done is absolutely beautiful I personally think these homemade buckets are tastier than the ordinary white bread buckets but as usual my wife disagrees I really hope you give these a try it does take a while but it's well worth the time and it's also very enjoyable to make this type of top-quality bread and amazingly it only takes four simple ingredients to make this bread flour water yeast and salt so thanks again for watching I'll be back with another recipe very soon please

they\nlook that's pretty impressive do we get to do the sound test again see crunch ok\nvery nice so so how do you feel about this one I feel a whole lot better about\nthese baguettes ok everything started to come together I'm still not it's great I'm\nstill not shaping the baguettes that was luck I didn't share that one and I need to nail\nthe temperature of the wood oven it was a little bit hot and that's my impatience\nok you know what this needs butter butter ok ok so now we can taste\nI don't know I feel like this is an unfair taste or the last time we didn't\ntaste it with butter I know but I have a good feeling ok\nso much softer yeah the texture inside is much better um it is over baked on\nthe outside mm-hmm and that's temperature control in a wood oven which\nI'll get to this is only what the third time I've cooked anything in it so\nthat'll get better but the texture of the actual bread is really nice isn't it\nmm-hmm they have to wait to it I'm cheering for\nyou to tell us how you did it don't worry they're not going anywhere\nthey'll be okay here's how I made it this recipe started yesterday and I made\nwhat's called a poolish or a pre ferment I mixed together water flour and yeast a\nvery tiny amount of yeast and made a really sort of loose wet slurry put a\ncover on it sat in the counter and left it for about 18 hours on day 2 before I\nstarted making the dough I fired up the wood oven\nI built a fairly small fire it was cold today and I let that heat the oven up\nslowly over the course of the time of making the rest of the bread came back\ntoday and uncovered it and you can see that it really has bubbled up and you\ncan see that there's a lot of activity in there you've got the yeast that I\nadded but you've also got the wild yeast that was just on the flour so it's not\nquite sourdough but it's approaching sourdough I pour it in water and then I\npoured that mixture into a stand mixer it's really gooey goopy and sticky get\nas much out as you can I add it in flour salt and another little bit of yeast and\nI stirred that together with a wooden spoon just to come up with a ragged ball\nof dough I put that onto the stand mixer and then I let that knead for about four\nminutes you can see it changes from a ragged\nball to a nice smooth elastic dough turn that dough out onto the countertop shaped it into a ball put it into a bowl\ncovered it and left it for forty-five minutes came back at 45 minutes and it\nhad risen a little bit and you just sort of grab a little piece of the dough from\nthe outside you bring it to the center you turn the bowl you grab it to bring\nit to the inside you turn the ball and you do that four to six times and then\nyou reform it into a ball put it back in the bowl and cover it again 45 minutes later you come back you\nscrape it out onto your work surface and you divide it into roughly three balls\nof dough that are about the same and if you haven't already subscribed please\nsubscribe now and smash that notification bell so you find out about\nour new videos as soon as they come out shake those into a ball put them on to a\nKoosh and cover them you let those stick\ncovered for anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes come back take one of the balls\nand then you flatten it out and this is the difficult part of shaping you fold\nit generally in half and each time you fold it in half you press down to seal\nit then you turn it around 180 degrees and you do exactly the same motion again now you put it seem side down and you\nroll it into a rope or a baton or into pretty much the final shape of the\nbaguette put that back on the Koosh and cover and let that stand for another 45\nminutes to an hour before I did the final shaping I checked\nthe oven and scraped all of the coals off to one side brushed it out clean it\nup and it got it ready for the baguettes it won't double in size you'll only get\nmaybe an extra 50% in size but it will look marshmallow and puffy\ntake it off the couch put it on to your peel use the Lum and cut three long cuts I then took the peel out to the oven and\nlaunched the baguettes into the oven and I think I did fairly well this time\nclose the oven door and let that go for about eight minutes then I opened the\ndoor and I turned the baguettes around just to make sure that they got even\nheat all the way around when they had reached an internal temperature of about\n200 degrees Fahrenheit pulled them out of the oven and left them on the counter\nto cool and one of them I sprayed with water while it was still hot and I don't\nknow if that spraying with water made a difference this is the one that I\nsprayed with water so I mean but this this one is still nice and crispy nice\nand crispy and crackling um that might just be something that some French\nbakers do because their grandfather did it who knows although we may also may\nnot be making them to a level where you notice the difference\nthat's probably an honest answer so this is version 3 yes any other changes you\nthink you're gonna make for this I need to work on my shaping and I need to work\non my temperature control for the of the oven but the oven isn't as scary as I\nthought it was going to be it really isn't it's it's fantastic to to cook\nwith wood I really enjoy that part of it so there will be another version of this\nof this baguette recipe as I sort of nail it down I think the recipe is solid\nI think the amounts are solid it's just technique at this point so come on back\nand and see if we can improve on our baguette you", "Idx4QJwcPHA": "shaman all right this is where the Vatican rise or proof and then I have my free shape baguette so this is a rectangle or cylinder appreciate that we're going to do we did last week we're going to do again this week and they've been resting for about 15 minutes so every time you handle the dough there's always a rest or relaxation period and that's really really important with the baguette because if we don't let the hell relax between pre shaping and shaping it's going to be very difficult to the longer so that's important if you find when you go to shape your baguette that your elongated it shrinks back or tears or it's incredibly difficult to elongate let it relax more let it relax more so I lift the dough up with my scraper turning it over into the flour bring it towards me so this part of the bench has no flour don't want it shape in Florida tea gas one two three and I pull up once and then I fold down so I have a seam in the center and then my thumb most people it's going to be me it's my left hand I put my left hand in that seam that crease and I pull the dough over my left thumb with the same end so this is one-handed this happens with the same hand there's a tendency to use the other hand as pull it over and you're going to squash the dough when you do that so here you pull it over with the same hand and the other hand comes in very upright use the base of your palm and you press down very gentle as gentle as you can and that's going to preserve the cylindrical nature of the baguette shape the more round it is at every step more round and upright it's going to be at the end the more volume that's going to get so I came down halfway stick my thumb again and that crease you're seen pull it over my thumb with the same hand the other hand comes in to just get that turn just a gentle gentle gentle if your hand is very upright you're actually touching the minimum of the dough that you can your hand is fly you're going to flatten out this top syllable baguette is going to be more flat right third time thumb in that crease right where the seam is this time I'm going to seal the seams so I'm going to be a little bit more aggressive with how I how much force I put downward and that's my cylinder that's the end of the first phase the second phase elongated make it longer cup your hands over the baguette press down as you can expand your hand and that will elongate the baguette check it to see if it's relatively even it's 23 or 24 inches then you're going to turn it over to see that the seam is in the center of the bottom rotate Coosh we should be a little bit taller than you", "5FRcdJHXB0g": "[Music] hi Kathleen with a San Diego artisan bread school today I'm going to demonstrate how to shape a batard or an oval about my Bannatyne ready it's all floured ready to go I've got my dough nice and relaxed ready to go I'm going to flour my work surface okay take my nice soft dough I'm gonna kind of shape it into more of an oval here just by manipulating it with my fingers okay I'm gonna grab the two corners I'm gonna pull them out I'm gonna pull them in and go down about 1/3 of the way I'm gonna just hold it just for a few minutes a few seconds rather with my fingers then this little bicycle seat I'm going to pull that down and just hold it until it stays okay drag it's a little bit of flour then do the exact same thing on the other side I've got the corners I'm gonna pull them out create that triangle see the bicycle seat there pull that down and just hold it for just a second here and I'm going to put my thumbs not on the seam itself not on the seam but just above the seam right there I'm going to push down I'm going to pull over my thumbs so I've created some tension here and then I'm going to seam it closed I'm gonna roll it towards me let it just sit there for just a minute and let that seemed kind of close up gonna check my seam it's a little bit open here and here so I'm gonna just finesse that closed and that looks fabulous I want any final shaping I think guys just a tad longer than my Bannatyne so what I'm gonna do is just push in the corners seam that down then I'm gonna pick it up and put it seem side up in the Banat on okay one thing that's important to remember when you're shaping dough is always work towards yourself roll towards yourself not away from yourself or sideways so you have much more control if you're working towards yourself [Music]", "d5Yqi7uu8s8": "hey home bakers its jack here bake with jack dog coat UK bringing you your weekly bread making tip every single Thursday and this week if you don't do this already it's gonna be a bit of a game changer for you hey you guys welcome back now one of my most in fact the most successful video I've ever put out on this channel is one entitled how to stop my loaf from spreading out flats that's the most popular one I don't know why it's not particularly good one but it's probably the most helpful hands on one there you'll see and a problem that is experienced quite a lot so consider this video a little bit of a part two to continue on from that one if you're still having issues with loaves spreading out where there it is that Cobb loaf or a bloomer or whatever it is that's spreading out for your not rising up nice and tall and proud here's something that you can do okay before we begin a couple of things to note this dough that I have made is about 65% hydration and it's just strong white bread flour this works with all different flours and all different those however once you get into sourdough territory and super wet dough's the shaping technique is slightly different although the principle is exactly the same so the key is if you want to build more tension in your dough more structure in your dough to help it keep that nice tall shape as it rises up really nicely you got to shape it up not once but twice and let me go and get your dough and tell you and show you exactly what I'm talking about okay here we go as always I've got a nice little tiny box of flowers help me out along the way and the baked wheat Jack dough scraper super helpful pieces of plastic available from the bakery Jack shop and here's my dough it's been resting up for about an hour it's all proofed up and ready for the shaping and this is what I'm going to do first first things first that's the table just a little touch as usual now I'm gonna take it out of the bowl it's gonna come out bowl upside down nicely for me as normal every single time side down so it's nice and sticky on top but it doesn't stick to the table underneath now I'm going to make this this is a 1 kilo of flour which will make me two nice loaf so I'm going to push it out very slightly just to help me out and then I'm going to cut it into two to make two loaves and whatever you can into two or four at this point you just cut it into what you need to cut right here goes straight side of the scraper like this flat edge down onto the table like this cut down and peeta way all the way down I'm not going to weigh these to see if they're the same but you can if you want to that's fine first thing I'm gonna do is the pre shape so the first shape I'm just going to fold out like this and fold it into that nice ball exactly like I did in that last video like this right nice nice ball by that wonderful tighten it up a little touch on the surface of the table and that is the shape of your cob okay that's your cup loaf shaped up but that's gonna spread let's say it's gonna spread a little bit if we have that problem here's what we do next we just leave it alone for a bit that's all we do next we just leave it alone so that's the shape of your cob loaf done I'm gonna do exactly the same with this one make it into a nice ball phone in on itself like that nice tight ball ready to prove up into a nice cob loaf done two nice bouncy balls ready to go but just to make sure that they do rise up nice and proud now I'm just going to leave them a bit I'm going to rest them here for 15 minutes or maybe even 30 minutes and then I'm going to shake them up again so pop your cloth back on the top and go and sit down go relax okay 30 minutes has passed and if we take it off you can see it's definitely growing and it's spread a little bit this one's not too bad because of the low hydration but the higher the hydration the more likely it is going to spread out and all you got to do it's flip it back upside down make sure it doesn't stick if it does give it a little dust in the flour give it a little press and just shape it up a second time rebuilding that tension rebuilding that structure and it will come up even taller then it would have done before you go a little squeaking a little pop as you're popping the bubbles there but that's the absolutely fine in fact it's a good sign here means that you worked it really well on the first place and there you go now it's got his bounce back it's guys firm this back in its structure and you can keep doing this again and again and again is only gonna make it better better structure at least a better shape and better chance of it burst in open on the top when you make those cuts later on and there you have it that technique works whether you're making a Cobb loaf like that or whether you're making a bloomer or whether you're making baguettes or rolls divide up your dough shape them all into balls first and then shape them then into the next thing that's double the shaping you always build in structure and tension along the way making them even better structure for the final shape and that's it one more thing I want to tell you about which is really really exciting is that bake with Jack merchandise like the rather wonderful bag with Jack dough scraper and that crop that you saw earlier and now available for worldwide delivery so if you want to get your hands on one click the link in the description underneath taken to the bake with Jack shop and I can post it to you wherever you are hello world how cool is that as always thank you very much for being here I really appreciate it and I look forward to seeing you next week for another bear bread-making wisdom served straight out of my nuts see you soon bye-bye [Music]", "RgqPli_sLLM": "so the focus on this project is to wrap our brains around pre shaping and final shaping some of these classic shape that everyone should know how to do the weight is not so important but we're going to go with units like a baguette for 390 grams and then any scrap pieces you always stick them on the bottom of your loaf flip it upside down so the nice side is down then you're ready to appreciate so to pre shape a classic baguette we take this very gently and just create a roll and we place this ideally on a wooden board and let it rest for 20 to 30 minutes for our intermediate proofing stage so for pre shaping rounds we're going to start with a unit of 550 grams I take my dough put it down and pull towards me repeat this motion about four times till you start to tighten that membrane of your bread then we place it onto a wooden surface for an intermediate proofing stage and looking at these two very simple pre shapes from here I developed every final shape that I'm going to make bread out of and here we're going to appreciate little rolls at 90 grams and the pre shaping is no different than on their larger friends so to our final shaping we take our logs degassed them wind them up one more time creating a nice little log here rotated 180 degrees fold that lip onto the top of the previous shape and now tighten this thing up closing the seam with your right hand then we take this and extend it to that final nice and even desired baguette shape find your seam right here and for this one we're going to make it look rustic we're going to place it upside down on the flour dust to couch to shape the tart we take our pre shaped rounds flip them over D gasps them then we take and creating a triangle with our hands you pull back and you push forward push forward take these outer wings fold them in and keep on rotating till you create a nice tight membrane in the center and it should look like an almond shape by the time you're done take the seam on the bottom take this shape and place it upside down onto a floured dusty couche you guys so if you ever want to invest in a specialty tool these are great little bana tones they're a little pricey but if you get one of these liners that are removable you can use it both for a natural surface or than a Egyptian linen surface dust it with some flour to shape around we take our pre shaped round flip it upside down de gas it fold in one wing the next the next in a circular like motion flip it over being careful not to get too much flour in the center and start to tighten up that membrane then we take the shaped pool and place it upside down in our basket and now it's ready to prove for one hour so again what we have here is our pre shaped rounds to do this we just very quickly take our hands and work them into a round shape again to shape the batard you can also take a small roll take it and now just using your fingertips start to create that almond like shape when you get to this point looks a little bit like a triangle you just even out the ends I one thing that you want to think of when you're learning to cut baguettes don't do this on every baguette but it's a great way to practice take a permanent marker and draw two parallel lines down the length of your loaf then with your blade you're going to start on the opposite side and cut towards the other side overlap by 1/3 and repeat repeat repeat and finish it off at the end good way to see that you start on this side of the bread and end up on the opposite side you don't want to cut across the bread like so you want to keep it nice and elongated along the top angle of your mouth you", "L76I01n9csk": "hello again my name's John I'm a retired chef from the northeast of England in the UK and welcome to another bread video and in this one I'll be making these fantastic sourdough mini baguettes you can view the ingredients list and full written method for this recipe on the recipe page on my website I leave links at the end and under the video or just click on the I icon top right of the screen before I go any further I'd like to give a quick shout out to this week's patreon and PayPal donators and they are Simon Walker Tom storey odd Linda Thompson Lynn us a bonus Catherine G white thank you very much everyone it really does help the channel and as I mentioned this is a sourdough bread recipe so you'll need a sourdough starter to follow along if you don't have a starter please see my sword or start a video on how to make one I'll leave links in the description box below the video or just hit the I icon top right of the screen okay I'll begin the recipe by making what's called to polish and this needs to be made well in advance of making the baguettes and let it sit at room temperature for several hours I normally set mine away the day before right in the ball a half 200 grams that 7 ounces of water called a room temperature is fine try to use bottled or filtered water if he can't next add 50 grams that's 2 ounces of your starter that's been sitting in the fridge make sure you get these measurements correct because this polish is part of the whole recipe followed by 200 grams that's 7 ounces of strong white bread flour [Music] now give that a good mix cover the ball and let it sit at room temperature for at least eight hours all this does is allow the starter to become strong and healthy and ready to begin making the bread in this case baguettes and for those who are not familiar with salad or it's a homemade east but with in my view a much better taste than commercial yeast and once you've made your sourdough yeast you can keep it indefinitely in your fridge but like I said check out my sword or start a video for everything you need to know about the subject and here's why I made yesterday now this police has been sitting on my kitchen bench for the last 10 hours and as you can see it's all bubbly active and ready to go okay time to weigh off the rest of the ingredients for this recipe starting with 520 grams that's eighteen point three ounces of bread flour followed by three hundred and twenty grams that's eleven point three ounces of water and yes it's always much more accurate to weigh the water to finally eight grams that's one teaspoon of salt and that's all you need for this baguette recipe right time to put the dill together I'll start by pouring the water into a suitable ball next I'll add the police to the water and give it a good whisk make sure you scrape it all out of the ball with a spatula don't forget the ingredients list and full written method for this dish is now on the recipe page on my website just click on the I icon top right of the screen or simply click on the link in the description box below the video next add the flower followed by the salt and mix that to a sticky door I'll be using my trusty wooden spoon handle the mixed mind you can use the stand to mix it to do this part if you wish but only until the door comes together remember this is a no need recipe but as this only takes about 90 seconds to mix I'm just going to do mine by hand try to scrape it all of the sides of the ball to right cover your ball and set your timer for the first of three 45 minute rises these 45 minute rest and rise periods are very important to achieve the fantastic taste structure and texture of these buckets okay after the first 45 minutes slightly wet the bench and scrape out the door and with wet hands give it a few turns but only for about 30 seconds are shown in the video this turning action distributes the temperature and knocks the door buck or de Gus's it and this is when you should see and feel the door becoming much smoother now get it back into the ball cover it and set your timer for the second 45 minute period after the second rise do exactly the same take it out give it a few turns with wet hounds and bench get it buck into the ball and set the timer for the third and last 45 minutes [Music] okay while waiting for the door to rise I'll get a couple of things ready start him with the baker's couche all this is is a well floured piece of material to proof the buckets on I use 100% cotton pillowcase for mine it's a lot cheaper than the proper baker's couche material and it does exactly the same job you'll also need a slightly oiled strip of cling film or plastic wrapper this is to cover the pre shaped buckets a little later set that aside for now next job I need to lightly oil a couple of baking trays I simply under drop a vegetable oil and wipe most of it off with a paper towel there should be enough on the paper to do the other tree to the trees I'm using our 30 by 30 centimeters that's 12 by 12 inches right the next job is to flower the worktop and get you digital scales ready to divide the door into however many buckets you're making out of this recipe you can get either 4 large 6 medium or as I'm gonna do 8 small okay once the time's up turn up the door onto the floured surface sprinkle flour over the door and divide it into 4 equal pieces and if you're making six buckets divide yours into six equal pieces and if your measurements were correct at the beginning each of your four pieces should weigh approximately 310 grams that's 11 ounces each now the next step is to pre-shape the buckets and let the door relax a while this'll make forming the final bucket shape much easier rather than me trying to explain how to do this step it's easier if you just watch and copy the way I'm doing the pre shapes [Music] once all the pre shapes have made cover them with the oil cling film that was prepared earlier and have a bit of a cleanup and let them rest for 15 minutes [Music] once the times up flour the bench again and start to form the buckets as shown [Music] you can either make four large buckets from here or as I'm gonna do eight small ones first our eyeball each piece in half once again rather than me trying to explain how to do them probably the best way is to watch how I form the buckets I'll go through the first couple slowly so you can get an idea how it's done and fly through the rest but really the best way to learn is to practice yourself even if they're not perfect bucket shapes they'll still have the fantastic taste I do explain in a bit more detail in my other bucket videos on how to form them if you want to have a look at those but I'll say it again practice is the key [Music] once you form each baguette place it on the couch as shown [Music] once all the buckets are on the couch cover them with the dry lightweight cloth and set your timer for 30 minutes when there's only 10 minutes left on the proofing time pre-heat your oven to 230 degrees Celsius that's 446 Fahrenheit or gas mark 8 you'll also need to place upon a hot water on the bottom shelf of the oven this will create a steamy atmosphere in the oven which makes the baguettes crispy one more thing you'll need is a spray bottle of water standing by for a little later okay the times up so I'll carefully transfer the buckets to the lightly oiled baking trays evenly spaced them out once arranged on the tree score the buckets with a very sharp knife or razor blade on this occasion am using this blade called a baker's LeMay these are brilliant for scoring bread dough and you can find them quite easily online I'll be making three slashes on each of these buckets check out my French baguette video on how to properly score the dough right I'll quickly go through the rest of the baguettes and get them into the preheated oven now carefully open the oven door to prevent a blast of steam once they're safely in the oven give the inside a quick spray with water this will make the baguettes even crispier get the door shut set your timer for 18 minutes this time may vary depending on how well done you prefer your buckets after 10 minutes I'll be swapping mine top to bottom and back to front this is for even cooking okay time's up so I'll get them out and onto a wire rack to cool for a few minutes and once again release the steam slowly when you're opening the oven door and don't they look fantastic [Music] they feel really late and just listen to how crisp they are and I hope you noticed how much they'd written in the oven this is called oven spring right it's been about 15 minutes or cut one open so you can see the inside and just listen to that once again how crisp lease our door buckets are and it has quite a nice bubbly Chrome on the inside the texture and structure look fantastic under smelling my kitchens amazing I can't do a taste test today but I assure you these sourdough baguettes have a truly fantastic flavor and those who know sourdough bread will know exactly what I mean so get yourself a sourdough starter made and have a go these and other sourdough recipes I promise you won't regret it and once again please help

for now", "64L5CVZut4o": "hey guys welcome to Sophia's kitchen I'm gonna make something really awesome for you today I'm going to make some crusty happy tasty fluffy bread rolls for you something that you guys have been requesting for quite a while so I'm going to show you one of my really nice recipes that I make on a really regular basis at home that I've been doing as a child already and they are really crusty and amazing so let's get right into it so it's really simple actually to make really fluffy inside but crusty outside bread rolls and I've got a mixture of different flowers for you today but essentially what we're going to do let me get started with some water you just need water and some yeast to warm up and you know the drill guys if you've watched some of my videos before you always have to want your yeast in some water or liquid before you actually add any other ingredients because we want to make a really nice environment for the yeast to grow and feed through the bacteria so that we can get a lovely fluffy dough so it's going to line up now and 37 degrees and then we're going to add the rest now that that's done we're essentially just going to add all of our remaining ingredients our yeast is essentially corporated into the water and we can keep going with the rest now I always add my flour first so I've got some zero-zero flour here if you don't have zero zero flour at home just use some plain flour because we want to make sure they are nice and fluffy inside we don't want to use flour that's too strong and I'm going to combine this with an extra coarse wholemeal flour that I've got you could mill your own wholemeal flour by using some grains milling them on speed ten for one minute that would get you some really nice hollow flour in the Thermomix or you could also use some spelt flour for this particular recipe they'll go really well they add a really nice texture and make the bread rolls that sort of a much better and then afterwards we're gonna add some salt I've got some really lovely Selvig along which is a really nice salt that reacts really well with bread creates a lovely deep flavor and you want to make sure that you add something that's really really good quality because you only have a few ingredients so to make your bread rolls even more fantastic invest in a soul that is really good quality same goes for flour all we need to do now since you pop that on meet it and then we're going to let it prove in like semicircles finished meeting ready to prove basically our bread dough is completed down now it looks a bit like that so it's a little bit sticky because we have home your flowers as perfect and what I'm going to do is I'm going to actually pop it inside my femi serve balls you can get these in the link in the description below they basically help insulate the heat you could just leave it in the bowl of course but if you are making something else at the same time you can just put them in there and they will preserve the heat really nicely acting as a little bit of a proving cupboard and the dough should come out really easily because it is wholemeal and it is actually quite a dryad oh we're gonna leave this guy to proof for the next 45 minutes to an hour until it's actually twice the size and I'm gonna just pop the lid on nicely so the way to do it it's just by basically flipping it inside-out if you happen off my silicone and lits and you don't have to do that that's basically how it's done now I'm gonna press it down a little bit to create a little bit of a vacuum and then we leave this to proof until it's ready now in the meantime let's do one more thing as that's really important for a really crispy crusty bread rolls you pre-heat your oven to the highest setting either on two hundred and fifty degrees and I actually inserted a cast-iron skillet into my oven you could you don't have one that's really nice and big basically use a an upside-down baking tray the reason why I do that is because I want to make sure when my bread balls go into the oven they go on that hot skillet or that hot baking tray so that they can fake to perfection straight away that will help with the crisps penis now help you just to get really really lovely bread rolls so let's see you once we've proved and once we've got our dough ready for you guys so it's been about 45 minutes to an hour and my dough has basically doubled in size which is exactly what I wanted I'm gonna take it right out of myself balls now and essentially that's what it looks like it's really nice and fluffy and what we're gonna do is we're gonna pop on the silicone baking mat that I have just stuffed with a little bit of flour and then essentially just drop it onto it it will not look like your normal dough because too by using either home your flour or you're using a spelt flour so it will definitely look a little bit more coarse and dark then you are used to and that's absolutely fine so we're going to basically just divide this into eight pieces so I'm harming it first using a dough scraper and then we're going to sort of make a bit of a shape so that we can create four equal pieces like that and just make sure if you want to make 100 potential and you really want to be on the safe side you can of course away these pieces as well but you don't have to do that so literally estimated your bread rot will be fantastic even if they're not a hundred percent away and then essentially all we need to do is create lovely shapes and you could make this round you can make it overall but I'm essentially just going to make it round with a little oval pinch and that's how I really enjoy my bread rolls at home so you create lots of tension by rolling it between your hands and then you're just making a bit over and over ending to it and that's all you need and you do that with all of them you leave that on to the serve onto the silicone baking mat and leave them to proof for another sort of good 10-15 minutes while your ovens finishing off and you can then bake these guys [Music] so it's been another 15 minutes or so and my bread rolls are actually ready to be baked what I've done is I've actually prepared my oven and preheat it to the highest setting I've had my cast-iron skillet in there for quite a while remember you can just use a tray it's really simple and I find that the traveler apps you fantastic go on here unless you just put the tiny bit of polenta on you don't have to do this if you're using a normal nonstick tray you do have to do it if you are using cast iron where because essentially stuff will stick otherwise and then don't look it up what's so on it also that smells so nice and I'm going to take my wonderful bread rolls just one by one very quickly pop them onto here make sure there's enough space in between each because they do rise a lot in the oven if they don't rise insanely much because they are obviously full of cauliflower and then what we gonna do is we're just going to take a sharp blade scoring knife something like that that you have make sure it's not serrated and you're essentially just going to snatch the middle you can go as deep as you can basically just to make sure that these open up really nicely we're going straight through the center in a nice quick sharp move so that these guys open up in the oven it just gonna look really really wonderful and and then we're gonna just do one last thing you can either spritz them now if you have like a water sprayer or you just take each individual one and quickly brush it with some water what that does is it creates that lovely cross cuz ruin oh you guys want crispy crusty rolls so that's what we are all about when they're doing this water and that's also for normal breads as well so if you wanna make normal breads at home and you really want a lovely shiny crust that is how I tend to do it but if boning Rexburg sort of harder dough's that are not too soft then we're gonna pop this right in the oven on the highest setting take some off this water again you have a water spritzer you're just gonna spray it here and there and if not be very quick Chuck in some water and close that up and turn the temperature down immediately to 2:30 so a little bit lower and we're gonna cook these for 50 minutes until they're really nice and golden brown it's now 15 minutes later and I'm really hungry for red rolls because they look so fantastic so I'm gonna take them out of the oven they are perfectly crispy crusty done breakfast look at these guys I mean it can't be more perfect than that really and you can see because they've been basted with some water they've got this perfect shine to them somebody put one up for you guys extremely hot still and just baked perfect baked bread rolls and you can see because I've used home your flour very coarse form your flour that they obviously look a little bit more coarse on the outside and they will also be a bit more coarse on the inside but they will be super super tasty so have these guys with some fresh butter it's part of a sound we're just part of your dinner soup there's some amazing ways of using up these bread rolls and they just taste so incredible so you guys go ahead make these at home they are beautiful so easy to make perfectly versatile with different flours adaptable and I'm gonna enjoy mine I think the similar teller because I just really like Nutella speaking of Nutella if you fancy some no teller then follow the link in the description below where you can find my epic recipe

literally tears itself apart something not unfamiliar to this country consisting of several distinct regions i'm york matters and i'm a european correspondent but I also love to bake so here's some food for thought from Spain you need just 35 milliliters of water to make the pre dough for a Spanish pan Deepika's mix the water together with one gram of yeast and 70 grams of plain flour [Music] leave it to ferment in a glass jar like EU leaders during an overnight summit 14 hours at room temperature Spain's Prime Minister knows the school need to be patient with to stick to our values principles our common goals in this case our goal is a pre doe that is as fruity as Spain by far the largest orange producer in Europe next take 150 milliliters of water and mix in 290 grams of plain flour after 30 minutes at the remaining ingredients another 200 grams of plain flour 80 milliliters of water 5 grams of fresh yeast and 10 grams of salt knead the dough by hand for 10 minutes and leave to rest for 5 then roll it out with a rolling pin this loaf is from a family of threads called pan candy all these were reserved for the nobility and Kings who much like dictator Franco later on were responsible for centralized rule from Madrid so always roll the dough outward from the center to the edge applying even but intense pressure something old Spanish reached and experienced at some point in time spray the dough with a bit of water and then fold it repeat this step four times this is something unacceptable for us really come on if you can have four elections in just four years surely you can do this four times over I don't think so I don't think so okay so how about we repeat this step just once for every official language that is spoken in Spain Castilian Colosseum Basque and Catalan would that be okay I think so excellent so next divide the dough into three pieces roll them out and roll them up into a sausage about 25 centimeters long 15 minutes later you need to reach for a razor blade make deep cuts into both sides the pun Deepika's is a bread that literally tears itself apart just like its home country Spain the pieces are yearning to detach themselves at every corner for a long time separate is more strongest in the bus country but now the government in Madrid faces the intense heat of protests from Catalonia 200 degrees Celsius is what you need now place the loaves with water slide them into the oven and throw in a good dash of water bake for 30 minutes place the finished loaves with hot water and let them cool on a grid good news for

the crust is softer than a forget the texture is finer and the taste is sweeter the lows will have horizontal slashes on top and be glazed with egg wash before baking when I was a princess gianna bread was a very successful item still your ideal bread for all sandwiches from hotdogs to the top-notch sandwich check this out here braised pulled pork sandwich with orange barbecue sauce in it coleslaw the best ever I am whatever booze you are watching the real-deal cookie job indeed you can make bread without the use of your stand mixer this one is easy first step combine warm water yeast and sugar then add dry ingredients and mix until just combined then transfer the dough onto your work surface scrape out excess dough left on your hand add the softened butter and knead using the palms and the heels of your hands until dough turns completely smooth that's gonna be a workout for about eight to ten minutes and by the way do not add any extra flour of during the mixing and shaping process it will modify the recipe making the dough much tougher there is a certain tactile pleasure in kneading bread by head I told you place dough ball in a greased container and let rise for 30 minutes or until it has tripled in size meanwhile and may some egg wash blend one egg with a pinch of salt look at this beauty divide the dough into nine pieces and shape them into tight balls each love should wait about three and a half ounces 100 grams that's plenty for one sandwich but you can make them smaller or bigger if you want that's totally up to you cover the balls with a damp towel or a plastic wrap and let rest for 15 minutes then flatten each ball to remove air bubbles from the fermentation and shape them tightly into 8 inch 20 centimeter bonds still no extra flour needed Vienna bread dough PN Hwa is very similar to panda me which is baked in bread or loaf pans as mentioned earlier Vienna bread has slashes on top which makes this bread so unique arranged four to five bonds per tray leaving a large space in between then brush with egg wash and carefully score 20 times or recently using a razor blade or a very sharp paring knife very important the slashes must be done before the proofing process you can of course score the burns like a baguette but in this case it won't end up the same let upon's proof for about an hour and bake at 450 degrees Fahrenheit 230 degrees Celsius for about 15 minutes halfway through rotate each tray remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature look at these beauties it smells just incredible it's not to mention

much and thanks so much Jessica and we're bringing more recipes so stay tuned to start this recipe play 750 grams of water in a bowl and half of the flour for this recipe I'm using 500 grams of bread

and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes after 30 minutes remove the towel and add 200 grams of sourdough starter and 100% hydration I have 20 grams of kosher salt and start mixing your dough by hand this dough is very wet so it will be easier if you keep mixing and folding for a couple minutes in you ball until the dough comes together cover with a towel and a dress for 30 minutes start stretching and folding your doll try to stretch the dough as much as you can cover with a towel and let rest for 3 minutes again repeat the same process at least twice every 30 minutes you will notice how the door becomes more elastic and shiny as you lay regrets after every stretch and fall after the turn a stretch on fall covered with a towel and let dress for a couple of hours after two hours you will notice how you doe will look very bubbly and ready to be shape but what I like to do is to put it in the fridge or night and let it prove to get a better and deeper sourdough flavor so cover the dough with a plastic wrap and place it in the fridge the next morning take the ball out of the fridge let it rest for an hour so the dough comes to room temperature then take it out of the ball [Music] and the butter in three equal pieces I like to use my scale to get even pieces flour one side of your table from the other side carefully stretch judo in format into small balls with the help of a scraper transfer your balls to the flower side of the table and let them rest for 30 minutes sprinkle some flour on top of your dough and cover them with a flour sack towel [Music] to shape your packets full one of the sides of the dough into the middle and press firmly but carefully with your fingers turn the dough around and repeat the process now for one side to the middle of the dough

I'm gonna show you how to make a really nice French baguettes at home you will need some flour some yeast some fresh yeast I use here some salt and some lukewarm water the full recipe you will find in the info box just below so we started make some sort of pre dough and we use half of the yeast a little bit of a flour we're gonna leave this dough for about five hours at room temperature and we mix it with the water I do use all the water here in this pre dough we make so the the dough can while fermenting develop lots of flavor because the flavor and bread comes from long fermentation times normally you can leave a baguette for for 24 hours to prove as well or even more so clean the sides of the bowl a little bit because it's always important to work clean then we wrap it or you can use a lid unfortunately I did not have a lid for this one so just use cling film after about four hours at room temperature at the the dough is really nice and bubbly it just smell very nice just has a really nice nice smell to it now we start use the rest of the yeast we keep me kept before you can use dry yeast as well just use about 1/3 of the weight that you would use in fresh yeast which is crumbly freshest in the flour then mix in our pre dough for this recipe right now you don't need any additional water because we did use all the water for the pre door already you could keep a little bit from the water just to clean up the bowl from the pre dough now we mix everything together just so that's just combined with all the flour you could use a machine of course as well like KitchenAid for example or any other kneading machine but doing it by hands there was no problem either it's not not too much work I will leave it covered again to rest for about 20 minutes this will make it a lot easier to to knead the dough later and we leave out the salt for this process just don't forget to add the salt later because otherwise you'll have a rather not tasty bread okay after 30 minutes now we actually start the whole kneading process as I said before you could use a machine for this as well I quite like doing it by hand so now we add the salt so it doesn't disturb the fermentation process before and now kneading I do rub just try to rub it over the working surface just try to stretch the dough which will develop the gluten structure in the in the dough which is important later for the for the bread to develop the texture so after 10 minutes and just take about ten minutes the dough is nice and stretchy it hardly sticks anymore as long as you always keep moving it it doesn't stick when you hold it by hands in your hand it will stick a lot you can you make your hands a little wet it won't stick it won't stick then it will help with the stickiness okay now we form a little ball for this we just stretch it always to the middle from turn the outside and stretch it into the middle this way you get a nice elastic texture on the outside which will later help the proving process as you as you turn it in the middle the outside will get nice elastic to be a little bit like rubber like this I'll leave it to proof again for about another hour it always just depends on the temperature you have always of course if it's in the wintertime it will take a little bit more in the summertime I just go a bit faster and so one hour is just about it the guideline if you have 10 degrees in your room temperature it will take obviously a lot longer ok after one hour we start working the door again for that lightly and flour the surface this recipe is from my German channel and in Germany the flour we have is quite different than the flour you have for example in the UK or in the US but I think all-purpose flour should work just fine with this just make sure you use a flour which has no yeast in it already okay this way we gonna portion it in three equal parts use a scale sword so they're pretty much the same weight because this way they will have the same cooking time in the oven later so after I've portioned it I make little packets out of it this way I'll just fold it in the middle turn around fold you in the middle again this way I have a nice little packages which I will leave to rest for another ten minutes this way the dough can always relax which is important like have time for the dough to relax this whole folding to the middle and stretching process is very important to shape the baguettes later because if you don't do it they won't rise equally and they might burst open in places where you don't want them to so for all sorts of bread this way of folding it it's quite important and it will bring you your bread baking definitely to the next level so we just cover those packages for another about 10 minutes 10 to 15 minutes and now it's actually time for shaping the baguettes and this whole shaping is quite important as well so we press it a little flat don't press out all the air just slightly press it flat and then we fold them like a roll then we do it again and then we press the seam together with our wrist and then we just shape nice baguettes make sure you don't make them too long so they still fit on your baking tray this recipe I'm late for you know like a conventional oven you have at home so it does fit free little baguettes and the whole shaping process is quite fun I quite enjoy doing it and YouTube will enjoy it believe me so you press a flat and then you just roll it a little bit this is very important again for the whole rising of the bread so you get a nice and round baguettes and when you put them on the tray make sure you have this seam on the bottom with a little practice you will get better and better okay this is how they look like I use a bit of a flower on the tray later it does give her a nice much more rustic look if you use flower so I'll leave them covered again to rest for another forty-five two minutes to one hour in the meantime I preheat the oven and I put a little tray of boiling water in the bottom this is important to cook the or to bake the baguettes to use a little bit of steam in the beginning so they're number one they will rice more equally and number two the crust will become much better so I preheated the oven to 250 degrees Celsius and the bottom I will write down it as well what temperature is in Fahrenheit in the info box so after 45 minutes the baguettes have nearly doubled in size I use a bit of flour again on top which will give again a nice rustic look and then you can use a nice sharp very sharp knife to score the baguettes you can use the raised up light as well if you have one and then you put them in at the highest temperature which is 250 degrees in my oven 20 minutes of steam after 20 minutes they do look like this quite nice already and then I take out the steam turn down the temperature to about 200 degrees Celsius and then bake them for another 5 to 10 minutes depending on how how good the crust is already in this case it took another 5 minutes and then I put them down on the rack to cool down before I cut them don't cut them hot and there you have your beautiful French baguettes and it's actually quite easily made so I hope you did enjoy the video and if you did give me a thumbs up describe to my subscribe to my channel if you haven't done it yet and you can of course recommend those videos and share them with your friends and I'm looking forward to your comments down below and see you next time bye-bye", "vEG1BjWroT0": "hi welcome back to s FBI and our online baking series today I'm going to talk you through dividing a softer dough you know 73% hydration and up up to 80% if you're working with whole grains 100% hydrated so I'm going to talk you through the steps after the bulk fermentation so when you move into the divide you'll have to get yourself a scraper you should already have one you can get a more rigid scraper I recommend getting a wider scraper you have options with the wide scrapers whether it's kind of traditional handle a hardware store you can get a plaster knife such as this 1/8 inch is kind of an ideal size stainless steel they offer as well which would be perfect for a food application so get your dough ready to divide and I'll show you how to do that so now we're ready to divide our dough of course checking to make sure that we have some some elasticity it is going to be nice and extensible a dough like this I'm not going to use dusting flour underneath so I'm going to let that dough just pour out of the container I will only use a little bit of dusting flour on this top surface get my hand coated a little bit across the top of this and the idea is it's we know it's stuck to the table we're going to cut this piece of dough from the mass so we're going to cut that scraping that clean on the table so this is severed I can then cut a little bit of dusting flour set that onto my scale sticky side down I'll go for 1.2 kilos from there I can move that piece of dough back to my table and divide my next piece so it's gathered into a slightly organized mass and I can come back with my scraper for the pre-shape so I'll divide another one a little bit sticks to your knife that's fine you can add that to the next piece cutting that from the massive dough see my table is completely clean underneath this hey if it starts to stick to your hand rub your hand in a little bit more flour 1.2 kilos and down this top surface can have a little bit of flour in it so it's not sticking to you but it shouldn't be coated okay now for the actual pre shape so again we're using our scraper as an extension of our hand the dough isn't going to stick to the scraper as much our hands and it keeps that surface clean so grab one of your masses of dough smooth clean sides still on top and you're going to sweep around that and pulling that dough towards yourself I'll show you on that angle by pushing that dough away from me so it's oval in one direction from there I can rotate and then push again so I'm generating tension it's slowly coming around so I'm pushing away from myself rotating resetting pushing into that dough and it's slowly rounding up for me pull rotate pull until that stands up you don't want to go too far once you break this thin gluten membrane this dough would just kind of start getting more and losing more and more volume so gently transfer to a table okay so we're sweeping around the side and pulling towards ourselves this hand is here to hold as you pull the scraper out rotate pull towards ourselves rotate pull towards ourselves rotate pull towards ourselves that's plenty of tension pop any large bubbles that show up during that process transfer gently to your board see that curls under okay we're going to we're going to do the final shape of our of our highly hydrated sourdough certainly going to be dusting baskets again tapping that sifter so you get light dusting not shaking the sifter rice flour blend is advised for a dough so these are relaxed 30 minutes going for the final shape I am going to go with dusting flour in front of me getting my first piece off do your best to get it off in one clean motion if the pieces of proof end of each other a little bit that's a good glimpse into the strength of your dough these pieces pull apart clean as separate pieces then your dough is strong enough they glue back together chances are you divided your dough too early our round piece I'm pinching it along the sides gently draping that open overlap those pieces those edges that brings some initial strength into this dough spread the base a little bit make sure you're not stuck to your table one little pat down across the top and then we're going to start rolling this up this roll should be with inside this outer boundary as we go down the dough so roll and push roll push roll push no tearing along this front edge as you roll it up small little bites all the way down okay one quick seam over flour on your hand and there's our batard ready for a basket find your seam set that into your basket note that I'm not shooting for the entire length of my basket it's going to fill into this basket overnight as we it you you", "ZzhNCUKOKoY": "hi I'm Anya welcome to my kitchen today I would like to share with you my recipe for baguettes in Polish we would call them baguette key and this is a incredible recipe for very crusty a little bit chewy bread which my family enjoys a lot I'm preparing it at least twice a week so I think that tells how much we like it I hope you guys are going to be curious enough to give it a try and in case you decide to do that let's have a look at the ingredients so you know what you need I'm starting preparing my baguettes with putting all the ingredients into a bowl of my stand mixer first I'm putting salt then I'm putting a lukewarm water after that flour and at the end I'm adding the East and then with the hook attachment I'm going to be working on my dough for around 5 minutes until the dough is nice smooth and elastic when this happens we're going to form a ball of dough and then spray it with a little bit of water cover the ball and set it aside now the trick for this baguettes is to keep it for six hours because the fermentation will give that specific taste for a baguette which we really enjoy during that six hours few times I will need to punch down the dough because it's going to try to run out of my bowl how many times I have to punch down depends on the weather flour and all the other things but usually it's between one and two times I have to punch it down to keep it inside the ball now after the six hours I'm punching it down the last time I'm forming a ball I am covering again the ball with I'm using my cover but you can use a plastic wrap and then I'm putting it in the fridge in my case usually overnight now if you would like to make it faster at least two hours in the fridge you would like to keep it the cold dough it's much easier to work with I found and it's much easier to form my baguettes when I'm ready to bake the bread I'm going to take my baking pan I'm going to line it with a silicone pad but you can use a parchment paper and then I'm going to dust it with generous amount of flour this is ready we remove our dough from the fridge I'm dividing it into two halves and working with the first half I'm going to form my baguettes now if you find the dough sticky sprinkled your working surface and the dough with a little bit of flour what I'm doing I'm just tucking in one end creating a shape of a baguette so tackling in and then pushing it down tacking in pushing it and rolling a little bit after I'm done I'm going to roll it to make a nice even snake which I'm then putting on my baking tray and on my baking tray which is generously floured I'm going to roll it tiny bit so it's covered with the flour I don't to dry out then I'm going to do the same with the second part of the dough arranging on my baking pan cover it with the plastic wrap and then with the tea towel and I'm going to let it double in size usually in around 1 hour and a half or two hours now when they doubled in size I'm going to turn on my oven and preheat it to 220 degrees Celsius which is 450 Fahrenheit and then I'm going to take scissors and make cuts in the top of my baguettes I found that the scissors are the easiest to use you can also use a very sharp knife if that's more comfortable for you but I use usually my scissors and then I'm going to cover it with a tea towel and wait for my oven to be ready when it's ready I'm going to pop in my baking pan and then I'm going to spray my baguettes with water I'm going to spray the baguettes and a little bit sides of my oven as well as the door of the oven I really wanted humid inside my oven I'm going to set my timer for 20 minutes after 10 minutes I'm spraying my baguettes with water again turning the baking tray around and spraying the other side as well and then I'm waiting for the 20 minutes now after the 20 minutes have a look if it's not browned enough leave it for another 2 or 3 minutes if it's brown enough for your liking just remove it from the oven and then pull it down off on the wire rack you can remove the excess of the flower with a clean cloth I hope you guys enjoyed the recipe as usually let me know what you think don't forget to

fermentation starter 6 215 grams the flour into a bowl add 1/8 of a teaspoon of instant dry yeast a pinch of salt and 170 milliliters of warm water the temperature of the water should be 32 to 35 degrees Celsius mix the combine and cover with plastic wrap set aside for 12 to 16 hours after 12 hours place 750 grams of flour in the bowl of a stand mixer and 3 teaspoons of salt 2 and a half teaspoons of instant dry and mix mixing on low speed at 500 milliliters of warm water the temperature of the water should be 32 to 35 degrees filter or 90 degrees Fahrenheit as the dough is coming together add the fermentation starter in chunks knead for about 5 minutes the dough should be moderately loose transfer the dough to a bowl cover with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature for one to one and a half hours the dough should increase in volume by four to five times gently spread the dough onto a floured surface take one third of each side and fold it towards the center brushing away any raw flour folding the zoo increases the strength and elasticity of the dough return the dough to the bowl seam side down cover with plastic wrap and let rise for one hour we love baking bread and have many recipes on our website visit videoculinary.com to find italian ciabatta bread Fran treeoche Middle Eastern pita bread and more recipes likely flour your working surface and hands divide the dough into five six equal parts depending on the size of the loaf you want usually the length of the baguette should be 60 to 65 centimetres and four to six centimetres wide we made six baguettes of about 50 centimetres long and four centimetres wide pray shape the dough lightly roll each piece of dough into a log tucking the edges in and set aside now work with a piece of dough you rolled first use one hand to fold the further away from you edge into the middle push it down with the heel of your other hand turn the bill around and repeat the folding twice [Music] roll the baguette into the desired length transfer to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and cover with a towel [Music] lightly spray the towel with water to avoid formation of a crust on the surface of the biggest and set aside to cool for one hour after an hour very carefully use a razor blade to score the baguettes make long cuts almost parallel to the long side of the loaf bake in a preheated oven to 240 degree Celsius for approximately 20 minutes until golden brown if your oven has a steam option pre seal it and load with steam for the first few minutes of baking if not spray the oven with water when placing in the bread ever guests should have a crisp crust a creamy aromatic rum and lots of random psycho remove the baguette from the oven and cool on a rack this delicious real French baguette is ready to serve as you can see one baguette did not make it to the final photo we just couldn't help ourselves thank you so much for your unity please a perfectly possible eternity you have time bye bye bye you", "YZbRpFOiOLs": "hi guys I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I want to show you how I make a homemade baguette now by no means am I saying that this is like the French classic authentic baguette because anti-romantic porta fire at the France a Paris nowhere but I do know that I like my bread I love my carbs and I certainly love a good homemade baguette and I think I really enjoy this recipe I make this up very often if you watch our vlog channel which I'll have a link down below you'll know that I make this very often it has been wildly requested so I figured I'd share with you my version this is how I make it it comes out perfect every single time so I figured I'd share with you the ingredients you'll need are few and very basic starting off with some flour I'll talk about this in just a minute you also need some salt I've got some warm water here with a little bit of sugar in there as well and you'll need some active dry yeast now the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to take my yeast and sprinkle it over my water and sugar and just let those sit aside for a few minutes while we talk about the flour the flour I'm using is Italian double over our you can absolutely use regular all-purpose flour it will be just fine I just tend looking at this ovens preheated I did for another recipe I like to think that this just gives me a little bit of a better texture to my bread but regular all-purpose flour would work wonderful here now I know that to make baguettes there are tons of different variations of doing it you know some require cold water and rising overnight mine isn't like that mine doesn't take overnight to do and just once you see the result I think you really appreciate it you'll get really delicious crisp crust on the outside and real chewy inside it's just perfection on every level I'm going to make this in my standing mixer just to make life a little bit easier on myself all I'm going to do is add my dry ingredients to my mixture and wait for my yeast to activate my yeast is looking good you can see it's foamed up at the sides and I can really smell it which is always a good sign I often get questions about when they make bread recipes or Center roll cinnamon buns or whatever and people say you know my bread didn't rise or what did I do wrong everything came out really hard chances are your yeast either was not activated properly or it expired so if you're you still an activate you're not going to get a good bread so now all I'm going to do is let this mix for a good at say five to six minutes or until the dough kind of comes together and I will show you what it looks like was there okay now do not panic because this is a very sticky dough but it is going to create what I like to think of is a really amazing baguette so don't worry about it it'll all be alright what I have here is an oiled bowl I just have it oiled with some vegetable oil but you can use anything you want and then I've got my dough scraper here handy because this is going to help me get my don't out of here really nicely because a spatula is just not sturdy enough to get my sticky dough out don't worry if it looks super sticky you're gonna have to trust me when I tell you it will work alright let's get it off for there I'm just going to take my pastry brush take the oils on the side and Pat it all over the top and now I'm going to do is I am going to cover this with some plastic wrap and stick it somewhere warm I'm going to put mine in my microwave not turning to my girl wave on leave it in there for an hour and a half to two hours it really depends on the environment it's in you want it to double up in size pretty well it'll take between an hour to two hours so just keep your eye on it and when it's there we will move on to the next step I don't really now remember because this is more of a wet dough it's not going to get old domed like a pizza dough would so relax now what I have here this is like a little baguette pan they put on top of a baking sheet you do not need this at all I use it because it makes my baguette look a little bit more like a baguette like the bottom just looks really nicely you don't need this just use parchment paper on a big baking sheet and you're good to go so that's don't ever think that you need specific things to something to come out right I would never just show you a recipe that you would need like to go out and find one of these which by the way I just buy on Amazon because it's easy I find everything on Amazon all my work surface I'm going to flour this generously with flour because our dough is very sticky you get this out of here I'm also going to flour my little dough scraper and get this all out of here flour at the top and then you're just gonna knead this for like two minutes just to pull it together and you see what I'm doing with my dough scraper I'm kind of picking up a little flour picking up a little bit of the dough just making sure nothing is really sticking much you don't want to add so much flour that you get a really heavy dough you don't want that you would just want to add enough flour to make things a little bit easier like that's looking pretty perfect for me you can see it's really supple still I'm just going to flour right there because that's what I'm going to place it for now I'm going to take my flour and sprinkle it over my pan that just gives you really good look to the baguette and then just you can use a scale but I don't do that I just use a little bit a little knife and just cut these into threes as equally as you can manage so what if once slightly smaller than the other I'm not coming over I'm not going to know and then you're just going to take this a little bit of extra flour and you're going to roll this into a rope you see that those imperfections create the best crust on a baguette in the entire world so if you're thinking to yourself look so ugly uh-uh that is perfection just trust me honey don't worry about it it will work out so then just do the exact same thing on the other two you can see this once would be a little bit bigger than the first one but that's that's okay with me if it's okay with you okay I'm in there nicely then I take a knife but I'm just going to make a few slits at the top just like that I usually do about four and three on that one sprinkle a little bit of flour like that and now I'm going to cover these with a like a lint-free towel I have a couple here there you go and I'm going to place this somewhere warm now at this point I'm just going to place mine on top of my stove just because it helps just get things to rise a little bit better and this doesn't fit my microwave that's the real story otherwise I pop it in there what is it okay I'm gonna let this ride until it's about doubled in size I'll show you what it looks like when it's on in the meantime this can take anywhere between 30 minutes to an hour in the meantime take a cast-iron skillet place it at the very bottom like take your one of your shelves out of the oven in place at the very bottom it'll go take a cast-iron skillet put the cast on skill on top of the rack and get that really nice and hot pre-heat your oven to 475 it'll take a good half-hour to preheat always mine does maybe a little bit less whatever so in the time in that time while this is rising bring your oven with a cast-iron skillet it'll all make sense in a little bit I promise that it's exactly what you want to see now I have my oven preheated to 475 it needs to be really hot I've got one on the show on the very top it's a tough you know as high as it'll go and want the very bottom and as low as it'll go at the very lowest shelf I have a cast iron skillet preheating in there alongside with the oven for about 30 minutes or so this took about 35 minutes to rise because I have my oven on so it definitely helps I'm going to pop this into the very top rack as soon as I'm done doing that I'm going to then pour a cup of cold water in the cast iron skillet that's going to create steam therefore giving you the perfect crispy exterior with really chewy interior that you're looking for when it comes to a baguette so in they go these beautiful babies were in the oven for exactly thirty minutes never fails I love love love this must be this why use a baguette Pam just because they look more like a baguette but totally not necessary let's just give this a go it's been cooling for about like ten minutes listen to the crunch just listen okay are you feeling me yet do you see just want you to come so close I want you to feel like you're inside a piece of bread look at that crust okay look at that lovely interior I know that I sometimes can be a little bit impatient and dig right in but I really want you to see how perfect these come out every single time and they are so easy home run so unbelievably good I mean really hmm these are incredibly good they're easy to make just a few steps which you as you can see there are a few steps involved but they're very easy easy steps that really just require a little bit of attention from you and the rest is secure itself go to Laura in the kitchen you're confident at the written recipe I hope you enjoy spending time with me and I will see you next time bye-bye you you", "WFTrx2QXTDk": "let's look at our ingredients for this we're gonna need three cups of bread flour we're gonna need half a teaspoon of salt fine salt your choice one teaspoon of active dry yeast I use the red star brand and we're going to using 14 ounces of water okay so this is just regular water from the faucet at room temperature and we're going to also use this which is a perforated baguette pan link is in the description below this is 16 inches by three sets of three inches so you can get up to three different loafs this is going to help shape and form baguettes so first thing we're going to do is we're going to mix our dry ingredients so we're gonna add the salt we're gonna add the yeast and then we're gonna add our 14 ounces of water but first we're gonna make sure we combine everything really well just like you're making cement you want to make sure that everything is well combined before you add the water in there otherwise you're gonna get clumps of yeast and salt not evenly distributed throughout the flour okay now that's evenly just give you that we're gonna add 14 ounces of water let's just mix this up I use a wooden spoon so I can cut through the dough while it's very sticky now this is gonna be a very very sticky dough use a spoon to work the dough and work the dry flour from the side and all we're going to need to do is keep mixing this until it becomes a big shaggy sticky mess in the middle again trying it every little piece of dry flour in here until you've got this very sticky consistency it looks like porridge not gonna be easy to handle it in this form so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna leave it now overnight or if you're gonna go to work you can do it first thing in the morning and do it when you come back and we're going to leave it for a good seven to twelve hours it's very forgiving this dough so you can actually leave it in the time between them so what I'm going to do is I'm going to be good to bed tonight we're gonna put some cling film over this and then we're going to leave it in a in a dry place with no drafts like I put mine in the microwave it just keeps it safe and it doesn't really get disturbed so let's wrap this in clean up and we'll come back first thing in the morning so it's the next morning I've taken out my bread dough from the microwave and it's cling film off and as you can see we've got a very sticky dough it's doing its work puffed up lots of air in there so it's nice and airy let's get this flour plenty of flour we don't want this to stick it would be very hard to handle this dough so you get a little bit up planea flour let's just work this down we're going to move it around get some flour on it so we can get it into a position where we can handle a ball better okay so the flower set up a little bit at moisture on the top it's very hard to handle isto but keep it moving keep the flour on it and you can bring it together so next thing we're gonna do is we're gonna separate this and to make two baguettes so we're gonna use a scale just so we can measure it out by weight so that's 850 grams so I'm gonna split that up when you believe it almost spot-on okay so now we have two equal sized pieces of dough push this one to one side we're gonna start shape so right now I'll form we go keeping those and floured we're gonna start to shape my dough so the technique I use is stretching and slightly rolling so we're basically going to create sticky to get in we're gonna make sure we definitely keep it moving definitely keep those hands flowers until you get your basic chick and you go try to throw it over onto your pan like I said these are 16 inches in length so you form it out do the same thing second piece lift and stretch a little bit of a roll lift and stretch okay what we're gonna do now is leave it for the second rise cover with a tea towel and then we'll come back and see what's happened so once the bread has been proofed for another hour and that's what I am at right now I've just left this for another hour you'll see that we have expanded a little filled up that mold again still roughly the same size we've got another couple of things to do pre-heat your oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit once your ovens preheated I put one of these in or a ramekin we're gonna put some water in here and this is what this is gonna do this is gonna create steam this is what's gonna give you your very crispy crust on your baguette and get that nice snap when it's finished as the bread breaks it's gonna actually expand as well so what we need to do is we need to score it well you can use this tool now basically it's a literally a piece of plastic with a razor blade on it you can get them in wood you can spend a fortune on these this one's very cheap description to go into the description you'll see there's a link for it you can get them on Amazon traditionally doing baguettes you do four scores at a 45 degree angle across the bread what I like to do is I like to go length ways as I say there's a lot of open spring on here and I don't feel that the four give you what you need so we're going to cut that now and make sure you go nice and deep do they're also very sticky but make sure you cut it nice and deep now you do this just before you put it in the oven otherwise your breads gonna sink my oven is already preheated my water bath is already in there and I've got a nice deep cup for the oven spring all right let's put it in the oven and see what happens next okay so the bread has been in the oven now for 25 minutes I've taken it out off the form placed it on a wire rack and let it cool completely do not try and open your bread until it is cooled absolutely completely otherwise it's just going to tear it up when you open it so as you can see you've got some oven spring here and that's why we put the slip right down the middle so it's kept its integrity at the sides I'm telling you if you don't make that split you're gonna have some splitting at the side as it expands in the oven so let's crack this open and we can have a quick look at it all righty don't if you can hear that bland crispy crust okay as you can see we've got a nice light airy crust and a very crisp you can hear that a really crispy crust on the outside perfect for sandwiches perfect for just cutting up as a small piece of bread this is a perfect loaf if you've got any questions drop me a comment in the description below also in the description there's a link for everything I've used here today few tips and notes first this was 25 minutes in the oven your oven may be a little different so you're gonna have to experiment and keep an eye on it second proof times are always different depending on where you are I'm in the desert so it's a little warmer here so my proof times may be a little shorter from somebody that's in a colder a colder area anyway perfect French style baguettes if you liked it please leave a descriptor the comment down below thank you very much", "HdrYBUaKL50": "hey everybody this is kit and by popular demand this is my very first cooking video and i'm doing it on baguettes crispy on the outside melt in your mouth soft on the inside it is not hard to do but it's not exactly easy either but if you come on this journey with me i promise you it is so worth it so let's get started hello hello hello this is my version of lazy man's baguettes quick and easy minimal kneading of the dough the only thing you really need is a lot of time because this is a slow row slow rise recipe and you need about anywhere from minimum six hours i don't recommend it uh really it should be 12 hours to 24 hours but uh let's start so the most important thing is that you have to measure your ingredients and then from here we're gonna mix it for maybe about a minute or so and i'm telling you this is all that you really need to do just don't even touch it right when it starts sticking to the sides and then after that just clean off the dough off of the hook and you're done cover it and let it sit minimum six hours again i don't recommend it should go at least 12 maximum 24 hours all right at this point your dough should be ready this dough was able to rise for about i'd say 17 hours or so and if you look at it it's very loose and jiggly and if you smell it the fragrance is almost smells almost alcoholic because of all that fermentation okay so before we get started i want to go over some of the tools that you need you want some kind of flat surface you want some flour you want a bread scraper i like the curved edge here just a plastic bread scraper will do there is a razor blade for later on when we score the bread this is a baguette flipper i know this seems ridiculous but this is a huge help all these tools you don't really necessarily need them you can find workarounds every little one of these things ups the quality of your baguette you need some parchment paper a pizza stone but you you know you use this to slide pizza in but i use this for the baguettes this thing is called a koosh it's basically a very thick piece of linen this actually helps to not trap all that moisture in there and it lets the bread dough breathe a little bit this is called the pre-shaping i do one direction and then i do a half hash direction so that make sure i get even coverage this is a 70 hydration dough so it's very it's very moist as you'll see okay so we want to dust the top of it and i know from past experience that each we're going to divide this into three each of these three segments has to weigh 285 grams if one loaf weighs a little bit more than the other then what happens is you get an uneven cook time on each baguette use the flat edge and we cut so that one is good all right so this is called pre-shaping the more rectangular the shape the better um that will become much more apparent later on because if you have an a an uneven shape the baguette will actually be too bulky in the middle and it won't cook properly and then the ends will get burnt so again uh as rectangular a shape as you can roughly kind of like an elongated rectangle shape and then fold it up and in on itself like that and that is ready for pre-shaping and at this point you want to cover it with a piece of cloth and let it sit for 30 minutes at this point you should set the oven to 475 degrees now and here's how you should set the oven up if you go on amazon you can buy these pizza stones that are basically kind of uh it's like 14 inches or so by about 10 inches they run about 30 bucks or so but you need to get two of them a reason being is that the stones capture a lot of the heat and it helps to maintain the oven temperature when you open and close it so you recover the heat very quickly and what this also does is that it blocks all the direct heat from the burners from actually getting under the bread so you get a very gentle baking method and also uh the bottom stone what it does is once you put the the dough onto the stone you get an immediate uh cooking process that the the dough jumps up and that's how you get that spring they call it and then finally all the way in the bottom here you want to put a pan something that you can dump the ice in that steam that fills the oven that'll help create that nice uh crackly crust that everybody loves on the baguette this is what it looks like 30 minutes later this is basically one of those things where you just got to do it a bunch of times to get a feel for it lay the dough with the powdered side from previous down dust it [ __ ] so pat it down really good and here is the key you fold you're gonna do four folds the first one is gonna go just like that and then you push with your fingers towards the back and i use the finger my fingertips to seal that all right and then we're gonna do that again for a second time now you see the baguette starting to take shape what you're doing when you're pushing it away is that you're creating tension on the back side and that helps again to give it uh the spring that you'll uh that you'll get in the oven when you put it inside and the air traps the air bubbles inside there and makes the bread really puffy right here is the third time and then once you get to this point you see how i use my thumb and i push and i roll and i push and i roll and i seal it all over again all right and here is the last one you're going to take the far edge roll it out to where it meets and then with your heel see how i'm pushing with my heel my hand and then with my thumb i'm doing kind of a pinching rolling motion pinch and roll pinch and roll all the way to the end the reason you want to again pinch and roll is that you're creating tension on the outside of the dough and that is how it goes here it is from the left side pound it flat roll a quarter of it roll it one more time again pinch and roll method my thumb goes underneath it this is the third pinch roll like this and here is the final all the way to the edge pinch roll with your hand [Music] and there you go you see how you have roughly a kind of pointed edges here that's ideally you want it thick then tapered off to like a rough point here it is one more time from my point of view dust the surface [Music] oh yeah all right here we go so remember rectangular shape that is important get all those air bubbles out and then fold see how my thumb is right here fold push and then i curl over with my other fingers like this pinch and roll see how i get the seam right there pinch and roll oh you guys are killing me and finally here get it all the way seal pinch and roll best you can alright see how it's nice this is the seam we're going to go seam side down and here is another thing that you can do if you take your hands put a little bit of pressure on your thumb i'm sorry on your pinky and you roll it and you can stretch it out a little bit and you can put a little bit of pressure on your pinky and you can actually you can create like a nice little point that's kind of an aesthetic thing you don't necessarily need to do that because the the dough is so thin right here you'll end up actually getting a much crispier piece whereas if the dough were the more if it were more blunt so the sharper it is the harder and crunchier it's going to be the more blunt of course you'll get a more moist result on the inside all right so now we're gonna go to the koosh this is the koosh and we'll start by laying in some flour here drop it inside and you can see it's starting to take shape just like that right again flour this drop the dough in like that last one drop the toe in like that you slide them [Music] on so with the rolling pins i tuck it in on one side and make sure that the dough gets a lot of pressure so that it rises upward not outward so that one's tucked back over there and you see it's nice and snug now we're gonna let this rise for one hour and here is what it looks like one hour later all right so you see the loaves spaced out we'll pull it together like that set the baguette flipper there a little dusting never hurt nobody we're gonna roll it onto the pan like so and you see it you can lay it down gently that's why i like this baguette flipper i used to do it by hand and it was a mess little flower roll it onto the pan gently again it's very sticky and you want to maintain that air inside that's what's going to give it a nice puff and you see the seam we're going to put the seam side down roll it onto the pan i got flipper a little sticky there all right here we go finally all right so here we go with the scoring of the bread what i found is that with these loaves i grab on either side i grab with my two fingers and then i pull this way with my fingers and pull this way with the razor blade and i just it's just one of those razor blades that i get from home depot and i wipe the the grease off of it and i make sure that i move very quickly you don't want to snag the end of it because that will just tear it you want to do it firmly but very quickly quickly is the key so here we go just like that right if you do if you don't hold it here here's what happens when you don't hold it you don't get as much of a like a deep deeper cut and it kind of pulls the bread that way but you can get fancy with it if you want you can do one straight down the middle let's try that and see how that looks right okay we're gonna spray it now with some water and this is going to go quickly so let's do this okay open and it goes i usually just use this to pull this out trying to move quickly here and that's it alrighty moment of truth and looks gorgeous check that out so ideally you want to put it on a wire rack so that the heat is allowed to kind of escape from the bottom because if you put it on a flat surface the bottom will actually get soggy so you want to let it cool on a wire rack and technically it's still actually cooking on the inside so you want to let it sit and cool down completely that's what a lot of the bakers say to do but there is nothing like having fresh hot baked bread because it just basically melts in your mouth so that is it basically if you start this recipe at about five o'clock p.m the night before you want the bread you wake up at about 5 a.m and then start the process at that point you can have fresh bread on the table for your kids to go to school by about 7 30 or so so happy baking and good luck", "nadcrWzKQ80": "[Music] welcome back everybody so today we're making no-knead baguettes which are very easy to make the first thing you'll need is 500 grams of white bread flour then you'll need 1 packet of dried instant yeast and 1 teaspoon of salt then mix your dry ingredients together and add 380 mil of lukewarm water so baguette dough has more water than a typical bread dough and that's really important the added water makes for a more elastic and lighter dough with more air bubbles and the great thing is about this though you don't have to knead at all or use your hands you can just mix the dough with the pork and here I'm just testing the consistency of the dough with my fingers and seeing if it's too moist or moist enough when a dough comes together put a towel over the fold and then it's ready to rise this will take about 4 hours which is very long but at least it's no effort after four hours you can lift off your towel and you'll see that your dough has at least doubled in size this long fermentation is really important to develop the dough especially because you're not kneading it and it creates an elastic and light and a very tasty bread dough then put your dough on a work surface and divide it into two then shape your baguettes try not to use too much flour just dust your hands with as much flour as you need and put enough flour on the work surface so the dough doesn't stick too much when shaping the baguettes try to keep the dough as tight as possible you want a nice tight baguette shape but don't worry if the shape of your forgets isn't perfect mine aren't and they still turn out really good and baguettes on the floured baking sheet now I'm putting a container with water into the oven to create steam which mimics a professional bread oven place a container with water into the oven while you preheat it to 240 degrees Celsius when your baguettes have rested for half an hour you can score or slice the baguettes this is to prevent the bread splitting in unexpected places during the baking process it also makes the bread look really nice and gives a nice crunch to the finished product I also spray my baguettes with water just before I bake them to give an extra crunchy crust so you want to bake your baguettes at 240 degrees Celsius for about 25 to 30 minutes and after that you just take the baguettes out and let them cool off on a cooling rack now don't these look great they smell fantastic and I'm sure they'll taste amazing I really hope you enjoyed my video if you have any questions leave me a comment and I will see you next time but for now enjoy the sound of these amazing baguettes", "N1-Ck-vIgkY": "[Music] hi guys it's katya and today we're making baguettes at high altitude first we have one and one fourth teaspoon of yeast one and one half cup of water we're going to pour it in and whisk it until it's all like dissolved and then we're going to cover it and set it aside then we start with two and one third cup of bread flour in our stand mixer we have one teaspoon of salt and one tablespoon of honey we're gonna skip that in so we're going to add our yeast to the flour mixture slowly as we stir it and you're gonna need it for about seven minutes [Music] compared to our pizza dough and our bread dough it's going to be very a very wet dough now we are going to oil our ball this time it is [Music] now we're going to cover this and let it [Music] grow for about two hours this is what our day looks like after um two hours of rising and we're going to sprinkle our surface with flour [Music] now we're going to put our dough on the floured surface [Music] um so this is really sticky like it should be so we're going to sprinkle flour on top of the dough and i'm going to put some on my hands and we're going to try and just um get it into a nice rectangle [Music] [Music] oh now we're going to cut it right in the middle and then we're going to take one side and put it over to the side we're going to flip these this side see the seam right here i'm going to pinch it closed and then put it on the bottom [Music] we're gonna spray our loaf pan and grab that guy and put it right there we're gonna let this rise for another hour or or two while they're covered lightly in plastic wrap [Music] we're gonna get our baguette cutter and just kind of don't deflate it too much but just kind of slice it now we're going to just spritz it with water and this is important to get a good crust we're going to spritz the bread again and then put this pan of water into the oven at on the bottom rack and the pan of water is first um like steam and then we're gonna put the baguettes on the above that we'll cook these for 20 minutes at 500. [Music] [Music] ciao", "-LRRtJB7TwQ": "yo yo what's good fam it is your boy artisan Brian and today I'm gonna show you shaping sourdough proofing it on the couch and baking it at home you already know so you can see the dough it's nice and bubbly and if you get some big bubbles you can chop them chop them up applying a lot of tension here this dough was pre shaped after a five hour bulk fermentation you can see it's very very healthy very active I'll show you a couple shapes here it's the same shape I do I just flip over both sides then I rotate it give it a couple of pet pat down pets down sorry to D gasps it a little bit and then apply tension with the outside of my fingers and yeah I got a nice tight dough whenever you're proofing on a Koosh very important you get some good tension to make sure your dough doesn't spread out if you're using a banette on or a basket that's fine obviously those are more forgiving when it comes to shaping but the Koosh will not forgive you if you're shaping is not what it needs to be so yeah hopefully that helps you can also check out the slow motion shaping video that I put up on my Instagram that kind of shows that same shaping technique but yeah here we go here's toosh here is the couch I don't have any rice flour right now because flour is very hard to find in these times but you know I'm using some whole wheat flour on the couch because it's a little bit coarse and it will not stick or burn as bad in the oven in my humble opinion so yeah your boy is putting sink this is a sheet pan it fits in the home oven a sheet pan that fits in your fridge and I put the couch on top of it and I put six loaves at a time and here's my magic trick there's my secret weapon here and I'm saying it is a rolling put the rolling pin on the side there to make sure that there is some additional pressure and structure applied to the fish so yeah that's the trick there they are they go into the fridge for about 15 hours you know 12 to 15 hours 10 to 10 to 12 hours whatever it is that you're gonna be able to do I always I always shoot for about 15 hours and you can find the recipe for this in my sourdough guide on my blog yes so here we go it's time to bake our sourdough it's what everyone wants so I have the Challenger bread pan there it's been preheating in the oven for about 45 minutes maybe less maybe longer definitely the longer you pre-heat the better because it will be super duper super super hot for your bake so here we go I use some parchment paper as you can see here I've got some parchment squares got a little bit of semolina or corn flour or whatever you need to use just to add some additional texture and prevent the bottoms from getting scorched so I flip it out with the peel that that that peel actually comes with the bread pan and then I give it a quick score nothing fancy very you know when you're scoring you just got to be confident you know what I'm saying you got to make sure that you are not fearful of your dough everything's gonna be fine and yeah that's it that's local number two I'm baking three at a time so if you got three cast irons by any chance for three bread pans or one it's fine I happen to just bake a lot of bread now that might be baking more bread than you guys so yeah here we go last loaf for this batch added a little bit of semolina on to the peel just to make sure doesn't stick these were seam side down by the way seam side down so here we go got the last one loaded in another quick score a tip if you have a gas range of it a gret gas range stove put some cutting boards on there so that you're not scraping against the metal of your stove definitely very very helpful here we go now it is 25 minutes later I put them in the oven I turn the heat down to 475 and after 25 minutes if you see the steam escaping there that's why we're taking off the lids and I've got a beautiful little mid Big Shot here I am very very happy with these guys they are lovely they're great I can't wait to eat them because that's what I'm gonna do with them 15 more minutes twenty fifteen to twenty more minutes and we've got a beautiful color here I was actually man I mean the color was just phenomenal I love dark bread and I made some dark bread caramelized crust super straight up fabulous and delicious man I hope you guys enjoy watching this you know inside look into the home baking process in terms of shaping proofing and baking nothing complicated guys I don't do anything that complicated it's not it is bread it is rustic bread and I hope you guys enjoy whatever bread that you're making at home I let you boy I'll attack you boy peace you [Music]", "co4XtuvuaOY": "[Music] hello everybody this is natalia from the indian trails public library branch today i will share the recipe and show the process of making the french bread at home the home ovens usually won't fit long french baguettes so instead we will be making two heavy baguettes the french bread that i will be making requires only four ingredients flour yeast salt and water i tried recipes with bread flour and unbleached all-purpose flour and i personally prefer to mix them together to achieve both chewiness and light crumb texture i prefer the king arthur brand for all purpose and bleach flower but i don't really have preference for the bread flour so today i'm gonna be using a pillsbury brand also i will be using instant yeast and water that was previously boiled in the kettle and cooled off because i just like the taste better than the tap water the total time to make this recipe is about 18 hours because first i will make a starter and leave it to ferment overnight and then tomorrow i will make the main dough using the starter and bake the bread this recipe utilizes polish which is a type of starter often used for french bread baking and it has a high ratio of water to flour the advantage of adding a polish to the dough is that it greatly improves its flavor and texture the polish is mixed together from flour yeast and water at least 6 hours and up to 12 hours before making the main dough so i would recommend doing this the night before you plan to make your bread i will be weighing the flour and water using the kitchen scale which is more precise but i will include the recipe with measurements and cups too let's start i'm gonna be adding 45 grams of bread flour and 45 grams of all-purpose flour then 1 8 of the teaspoon of yeast and now i will mix the flowers and the yeast together and add 90 grams of room temperature water so i measured my water it's about 71 degrees right now now i'm gonna mix it all and then just clean the spoon this is how polish looks now and now i will cover it and put it in a draft free place i usually use the oven overnight now it's the morning of the day 2 and we'll start making our main dough let's take a look and see how the polish looks after fermenting overnight you see that it's nice and bubbly to make the main dough i will combine two flowers bread flour and all-purpose english flour and sea salt that i use and then i will combine the polish the yeast and warmed water i just warmed it to 90 degrees in microwave okay i'm trying to make polish loose here so it will be easier to mix it in the flowers now i will add all the wet ingredients to the flour mix and mix with the spoon the mixture will look kind of rough and shaggy at first our goal now to make sure that all the flour will get wet now i will go and put just some tap warm water in in this bowl and we'll be starting to knead the dough with hands and we'll be waiting the fingers just to help us so the dough doesn't stick that much i'm doing just i'm just pinching the dough trying to make sure that all the flour is wet make sure that the salt is spread evenly that the yeast is spread evenly through the dough so again just uh nothing very rough just pinch it divide it um in those like small bowls and we'll do it just to combine all the ingredients well with your fingers again a little bit now we're gonna do several stretch and folds so to do this you grab the dough you can look at the bottom stretch a little bit and fold it on itself and we'll keep doing it for about a minute or two we're just trying to help though to develop the gluten and the dough is still like sticky and kind of shaggy but you can feel that it's getting more elastic like while you're doing it so you see you can stretch it a bit longer already okay now we'll just let the dough rest for 10 minutes i'm using a piece of plastic wrap just to cover the dough so it will rest for 10 minutes now i'm going to prepare the bowl that we're going to be using for all to rest the future by lightly oiling the bottom and the walls of the bowl now i will lightly flour the work surface and move the dough from the bowl to the surface so we can do a series of stretch and folds now i'm flowering my flour in my fingers so the dough doesn't stick too much okay this recipe is a high hydration recipe so the dough is wet and sticky so to help you stretch and fold it's better if you use the dough scraper okay so i'm gonna do a series of stretched folds again we're doing all this trying to build more gluten and make the dough nice and elastic after a couple of sets you'll notice that the dough is now tightened up so now we're gonna put it in the oiled bowl and let it rest for 40 minutes cover the bowl with a lid or with a plastic wrap and let it rest now the dough rested for 40 minutes we'll do one set of stretching folds we'll get the dough again on our work surface it feels much more elastic now and less shaggy around just in case and again we pull stretch the tone one side fold it over do the same on the opposite side fold it over then stretch this side and do the final stretch of hold now we'll flip the dough and put it back to the bowl and cover it and let it rest for another 40 minutes now that they're rested for 40-45 minutes we'll do the third set of stretching folds again i will invert the dough on the work surface and you'll notice how soft and rested it feels now it's really elastic and smooth okay and now we'll flip it over and pull it um to rest for another 40-45 minutes now we'll do the fourth and final set of stretching folds you can see that the dough looks puffed up and again elastic we'll stretch fold final time and let it rest for another 40-45 minutes the dough now looks very puffy i will get it out to our work surface and divide it in half now i will pre-shape each piece of dough into a bowl spread it out a little bit and then fold it on the inside now we'll flip it over and then pull it a little bit towards yourself kind of tighten in the top layer and let it rest we'll do the same with the second piece spread it out a little bit very softly then fold it over onto itself and then pull to tighten it now i will cover those balls with a loose piece of plastic and then we'll just let it rest for 15 minutes while we wait let me show you uh how we're gonna be proofing the final baguette i usually use cutting board and a cotton towel that i cover with flour so you're supposed to use for real french bread you're supposed to use it kush so very very thick linen clothes but i'm just using the towel i also use those uh two pieces of like leftover from the plastic wrap just to help me to keep shape of the baguettes now that the dough has rested we will shape the packets i will fold the door as an envelope very present very lightly now we will roll the packet it's very important to make sure that the dough is sealed now we have this log and i'm gonna roll it into 14 15 inches half again roll lightly but firmly okay now i will place the baguette on the towel and make the second one so you can first firstly fold it into an envelope and then i will fold it like this first time we go there is about one inch left here and the second time we fold it all the way you can check check the sim make sure it's completely closed and now we'll transfer it into the towel and we'll let it rest for about an hour an hour and a half we'll check on the proofing process in the middle to see how it is going now we're ready to leave baguettes to proof i will put some flour on top and i will put the baguettes into a plastic bag so they won't dry and you can leave them just here on the table or you can put them in the cold oven just to keep them keep the environment draft free it's been about 40 minutes the loaves rise quite a bit but because now the room temperature is pretty cold we'll give it another like 20-25 minutes but at this point i will start preheating the oven to 480 degrees while the oven starts to preheat let me show you the setup i have in the oven to add extra steam to the oven i got this pan filled with lava rocks and when i will put the baguettes in to bake i will put some hot water like boiling water here to add steam to the oven i will be baking the baguettes using the special french bread pan but you can just bake it on a regular baking sheet just putting a piece of parchment paper on top i will also be using this aluminum pan to cover the bread to make sure that the steam doesn't escape in the first 10-15 minutes of baking this will help bread to puff really nicely to score the bread it means to make the incisions on top of the bread i'm using just a regular razor blade i tried using a knife but it doesn't really cut smoothly let's check the baguettes have proved if you press lightly the intention should go up just halfway it means it's proofed really well now i will transfer the baguettes to the pan using this uh board it's just like a piece of cardboard wrapped in masking tape that i made you can use any flat surface so maybe like a flat cookie sheet will be good so i'm flipping the baguette on the board and then carefully transferring it to the pan and now we'll do the same with the second one now i will score the paquettes the cuts will be about a quarter of an inch deep and they will overlap a little bit those cuts will help the steam to escape when the bread will be rising fast in the oven um now i will just cover the baguettes right away for the aluminum pan and then take it to the oven and then slide the baguette pan off the cookie sheet i'm placing the pen into the hot glue and now i will add water hot water onto the lava rocks i'm placing the towel just to prevent the water spilling on the glass here we're getting a lot of steam right away now we just close and we'll bake the bread under the aluminum pan for about 15 minutes then we will remove the pan and bake for another 10 to 15 minutes now that 15 minutes has passed i will remove the aluminum pan and take a look at the baguettes look how well they puffed now we'll just close the oven door and leave them to bake for another 15 minutes it's been five minutes and i noticed that they're getting quite brown in there so i will go ahead and flip them so they will brown more evenly it's been 10 minutes since we removed the aluminum pan and it looks like the bread is ready so i will get it out of the oven now let's take a look so it looks so nice and puffy and brown now i will just let it cool for a little bit and then i'll show you how it looks sliced it's been about 25 minutes uh the bread is still warm but let me cut it to show you how it looks on the inside look at this large chrome it's acrylic crust is really nice and crunchy on the outside but inside the crumb is light and chewy look at this i hope you enjoyed this video i was really happy to share my bread baking experience with you if you have any questions please email us at the branch and i will be happy to answer your questions thank you for watching and please subscribe to our youtube channel [Music]", "iDPLkP2Z-_A": "record number hi and welcome to the first rap kitchen we are going to show you how to make sourdough baguettes today here we go to show you what the long braid looks like inside it's got lots of nice holes and there it is yes there too okay so watch our video and we'll reveal all our secrets you this dough has been in the fridge overnight you can see it's got some nice bubbles on it it's nice and shiny when I make it into a rectangle and I now need to divide it into 8 equal pieces so it's about 200 250 gram grams each you that I've divided the dough I'm going to preciate them into things to rest this is called a crush this one comes from Ile de pan it's just a nice piece of heavy canvas cloth which is well floured so that the the dough doesn't stick to it and when you put a little bit of flour on my service I'm not using Deathmatch if the dough is all cold so it's not it's not that sticky okay pull it out on both ends all the one end halfway in the other end over roll down the top all the way so that it looks like a nice little panel shackled ah okay then out fold in one third over again use your scrape if it gets stuck folding the top over and then the bottom just holding my seam in it / stick just so that they don't dry out too much there now they're gonna rest here for about 30 minutes now if will be the very hard part of making burgers the final shape make sure it's well floured so it's a careful balance between not having enough flour and having too much flour in mind I'm not a professional Baker so each one is not perfect but I find they're good enough for my home and practice makes perfect I'm just going to thank you flatten it thank you from the top fold down and push it away trying to create tension down again ah away it's nice tension now I'm going to just close it here with the back of my hand and you want it to be roughly the length the width of your Koosh and again and again you use the back of your hand to seal the seam make sure the seam is sealed we're going to do the baking of the baguettes now which the logistics of which are quite tricky so you need to have everything really organized before before we bake Ivan about an hour before I'm ready to bake to the highest setting which is 260 on my oven and although I've preheated on fan I put it on to conviction before I bake I do not want the fan on when I'm baking these baguettes because the fan hardens the crust and prevents it from getting a nice open blue I've done many tastes and certainly in my oven having been it just doesn't work for bread baking I have to boil the kettle because one of the key things for the nice opening of the baguettes is to have enough steam in your oven the baguettes you can't bake in a Dutch oven so you're gonna have to make steam in your oven either have a baking tray with water in the bottom of your oven or get a whole lot of tins and put boiling water in them and line them in the bottom of of your oven I have a wonderful metal steel plate in my oven that I had made because I make baguettes a lot and I have this thing called the t-bar which comes from ILDA pan and eiszner it's great it stays in the bottom and I just when I'm ready to bake so to transport fur your loaves from the couch into the oven takes quite a bit of practice have a board or just a regular chopping board that's the same length as the as the book gets handy because you're going to have to take them from the couch onto your onto your baking paper so that you can transfer them into the oven if you don't have a steel plate in your oven you can preheat trays like this okay so my budgets have been proving for about an hour and a half they have expanded in size if I press them they the indent comes back quite slowly so I would say they're ready to go so I need to transfer the baguettes from the Koosh where they seam side up onto my transfer boards and my baking paper and seam side down so I'm gonna take the my little board that I've floured well and I've got my little scraper thingy and I'm gonna use the couche I used this little scrape if I just see that it's sticking a little bit just to gently loosen it and I'm gonna roll that over using the fabric sticking a bit I didn't flour this crews enough I thought it was well-seasoned but they're sticking of it anyway I just very janky I don't want to deflate them at this point very gently just used my scraper to get them off and and then I just put them onto my board and you can use your scraper just to straighten them out if they're right so I've got my baguettes on my and they're now on my baking paper so they'll be easy to kind of slide into the oven in the ovens hot and ready the waters ready now I just need to score them so to score them I hold the the sharp knife or the lamb at about 45 45 degree angle and I'm gonna make three kind of slashes down the middle of the baguette you can just do one slash if you want to it's not an exact science and I'm certainly not an expert but this works for me so I'll start on this side and just do it very quickly one two three make sure your blade is sharp I kind of overlap a little bit so I'm ready to transfer my baguettes into the oven see they're on a movable thing I could have them on a pizza peel or on another type of board but they are on baking paper so first before I do anything I'm going to make steam in my oven I really have a timber worth with hot water in the oven but I'm going to put boiling water into the tray or the tea bar that I've got in the oven just to get that C going in when I'm finished okay so I'm going to take these and just slide them in okay 2:45 for 15 minutes and then I'll turn it down to 200 degrees for a further 10 minutes you you", "w65gUy-yKL8": "to bring the delights of a French bakery in Turin kitchen without having to leave the house we can and all you need is flour yeast salt that probably would have sounded propagates we're using a pre ferment that we call a Polish starter which is basically just a simple mixture of flour water and yeast it's allowed to ferment for a few hours and then added to the bread dough you can make the bread without it but the flavor the texture of the bread is almost impossible to achieve with any other method so for the Polish starter place 60 grams of strong white flour 10 grams of dark rye flour a 1 gram dry yeast into a bowl add 70 grams of warm water and then mix everything together to a very sticky dough then leave the Polish to ferment for about 4 or 5 hours or overnight in the fridge and then once you see the yeast working its magic producing all these little bubbles it's ready to go in a separate bowl add 260 grams of strong white bread flour 3 grams of dried yeast the Polish ferments 140 grams of lukewarm water using a dough scraper mix all the ingredients until they just come together the dough doesn't need to be super smooth at this stage then cover the bowl and leave the dough to rest or water lease this has a whole host of benefits like allowing the flouds hydrate fully the gluten begins to develop which reduces the kneading time you get a better color flavor aroma basically don't skip this step as there's so many benefits and you literally have to do nothing once the dough is rested add a teaspoon of sea salt and work that in then turn the dough out onto your work surface and knead that dough for about 10 minutes I started my dough on a wooden board but it kept slipping and moving about as a real painting ass so I moved it to the table to finish the kneading we're kneading the dough try and avoid adding extra flour unless absolutely necessary don't be afraid if it starts off a little bit sticky the more you start to work it the firmer it will become when it comes to kneading you can use any technique you like I like to push the dough away with the palm of my hands fold it back on itself then rotate the dough and repeat this process over and over again you'll no doubt find a technique that works for you but as long as you're working the dough and developing that gluten that's all it really matters once the dough is smooth and springy place it into a bowl cover and leave to prove at room temperature for about an hour or until doubled in size once approved turn the dough out onto your work surface and divide it into two pieces shape each piece into a ball and cover with a tea towel and leave to rest again for another five to ten minutes while you're waiting lightly for our tea towel with a little bit of rye flour put it onto a baking sheet and we'll use this in a bit to shape the baguettes take one of your rested dough balls and gently press it down and stretch it out into a sort of oval shape if it feels tough or springs back when you try to do this it may just need a little longer to rest once you've got your dough into an oval white shape then starting at the top of the dough fold the long edge into the center and then press down with your thumb or the heel of your hand to seal the seat turn it around and repeat this process on the other side then turn the dough around again and then fold the long edge of the dough into the center pressing down with your thumb creating more tension in the dough and then turn the dough again and repeat this process a final time turning the dough over so the seams on the bottom gently roll out the dough from the center outwards stretching the dough as you go and tapering the ends once you get to them just to create that classic baguette shape let's have a look from the top and go through it again gently press the dough down and stretch to a sort of oval shape start at the top of the dome called the long edge into the center of the dough pressing down with your thumb or the heel of your hand to seal the seat then turn the door around and repeat this process on the other side then turn the dough again fold the long edge of the dough into the center pressing down with your thumb creating that tension in the dough and then turn the dough once more and repeat this process a final time then making sure the seams on the bottom gently roll out the dough from the center outwards stretching the dough then press down on the ends just a tape of them and then boom you've got a baguette now this is where that floured tea towel comes in handy place the sheet baguette on the tea towel and then pinch the towel up around the dough to provide a bit of support this just helps them keep their shape during the proven and that rye flour just stops them from sticking to the towel cover the baguettes with another tea towel and leave to proove for about an hour until the baguettes have doubled in size now is the perfect time to preheat the oven to maximum and place a baking sheet in there to preheat as well once doubled in size the bread is ready to cook so remove that preheated tray from the oven and transfer the baguettes onto it you can do this by hand if you're careful but I like to use this makeshift peel I use for a tart tin just to provide a little bit of support to the dough and move it without knocking out any of the air or ruining the shape the hot tray helps simulate the base of a bread oven creating a better spring when you cook your bread now it's time to score the baguettes now I would definitely recommend a lane for this but I've lost mine somewhere I'm not sure where and so I'm gonna do it with a razor blade instead but if you don't have either of these a good serrated knife will do the job hold the blade at about a 45 degree angle and then make four to five diagonal cuts down the length of each bit yet then no more hanging around Kelly who gets into the oven for about 20 to 25 minutes until they are rich a golden brown all over a little tip if you want to create an incredible crust that never gets thrown a good splash of water in the bottom of the oven when you put them in just to create a little bit of steam this helps develop a nice thick crispy crust on those baguettes and that's it delicious French baguettes that taste as good as they look and sound even better [Music] and that's it thank you so much for watching the video if you liked this recipe let me know by hitting the thumbs up down below and if you're new here and you like what you see why not consider subscribing as well if you make this recipe why not hit me up on Instagram or Facebook I would love to see your forgets right I will see you [Music]", "olV9u4HZyVE": "ciao so finally this spaghetti video which has been really uh a tough a long process to make anyway uh it's gonna be it's gonna be like a mish mash a mix of multiple uh shots that i made of the recipe but uh each i'm gonna edit it in a way that hopefully is understandable so enjoy the sourdough baguette video and uh yeah have fun let's go [Music] [Music] is good can i make a video about baguettes i'm gonna write here the ingredients of the recipe the cat is a delicate preparation because you want to have the right proportion between the strong proteins of the bread flour and the weaker flour so to create that crust that is crunchy and breaks nicely while the the inside is is fluffy and airy and soft we start the preparation now in the afternoon but so tomorrow is going to be the more complicated steps this recipe is based on the perfect loaf website recipe but it's tweaked with some changes i needed to to make to adjust it to make it kind of simpler among the ingredients that you need is this barley mold extract or something similar malt syrup malt extract because the original recipe is using um malted flour which i don't have so i'm going to use this so i'm using this 50 hydration starter which normally allows for a lower acidity in italy for example it's used to make the big brioche kind of cakes like pandora or panettone but also for black sourdough pizzas in this case we need to bring it to 100 hydration though here is the formula that i'm using but if you have a hundred percent hydration starter already it's going to be easier obviously because you can use x grams of the starter x grams of flour x grams of water and you still have 100 hydration one and it's going to work perfectly fine that's it so let's try and make baguette madame zuma la baguette should i make a baguette burger oh i'm crazy [Music] pretty nice [Music] it also smells nice 60 grams let's see 60. beautiful water maybe 80 grams of water [Music] flour 60 grams so this is the same amount of flour as the starter [Music] okay it's done now this needs to wait for around three hours three and a half hours bucket okay so let's start as you can see we're starting like in many other bread recipes with very simple just flour and water this is the ratios for around four baguettes four small baguettes that can fit in your house oven 355 mils of water and this is 560 563 grams of flour this flour is actually a mixture of several flowers you can go for half bread flour and half all purples plain flour so the purpose is to get to around 11.5 percentage of proteins just gonna be classic automates so it's just water and flour i'm mixing by hand but you can use a spoon if you prefer it now this is just you just need to mix the ingredients until until all the water is absorbed okay we're almost it's basically there it start again we don't really need to do any any kneading now we'll cover this and just leave it there a nice spot in your kitchen for about an hour by the way you'd better have a baking stone because that really helps getting the baguettes nice and crispy so an hour has passed so here i have my starter the salt 12 gram i'm going to use a teaspoon of malt malt extract the remaining water 50 grams so the starter as i said it's 72 grams to be very precise it took me a while because actually i was cooking something else there and making a boldness i'll show you here it is it's cooking i need to stir it maybe a video about that another time oh now very easy we mix all the ingredients put the salt the sourdough starter yeast and salt are not super friends but this is really if you leave them together but the commercial yeast is more sensitive to salt i'm gonna use just really a regular teaspoon it doesn't need to be so precise it's very sticky extra water i'm gonna not put it all in one go now just take your hand and start mixing it hand like a claw and it's quite fun actually stick your hand in this the dough was pretty stiff so now i need to break it down and manage to let it absorb the rest of the water that we're adding is going to be way wetter this kind of dough the ideal way is put it on the counter and do some energetic kneading i'll finish the water you can see here that's the the dough now is this kind of texture okay now away the bowl i'm gonna start doing some slap and fold which is this smash it down the counter you fold and then you take it like this 90 degrees and so then you rotate and again don't be afraid to use your strength initially it might stick a little bit but that's fine we don't want to add flour and you see how the the dough already looks much smoother but still it's gonna always be sticky and see it's sticky so it again smash you kind of pull fold and you take it 90 degrees on the side smash fold i should do it for around five minutes okay now my hands are wet it's gonna help that's enough back in the bar so let's cover it and we'll do something else very short needing folding in 30 minutes and yeah okay so 30 minutes have passed we're doing the first stretch and fold which is the thing that we also do for bread just dig down pull a bit and fold it over rotate let's say 45 degrees so we'll do several pull and fold over and again stretch and fold and again stretch and fold until you basically do a full circle and that's it first one we do this three times every 30 minutes see you in 30 minutes hey siri 30 minutes okay 30 minutes of counting so this is the last stretch and fall the third one and we just repeat the movement stretch and fold quite gently but firmly now i'm going to just leave it out for 10 more minutes 15 minutes and then i'm gonna put in the fridge and it's gonna stay in the fridge for 12 up to even 18 hours so good night baguette though okay so a day has passed more or less a little bit less like 16 hours probably now from this moment on the baguettes should be ready to bake in around two and a half hours so you know can make your consideration about when it's more convenient for you the first step is gonna just be dividing the dough into four parts and then we're gonna leave it there for half an hour to start warm up a little bit before the actual shaping into the baguette the final baguette shape you don't need really you shouldn't need flour because the dough now is pretty stiff and cold it's not very sticky you can use your dough scraper and it should be fine divide it into four parts [Music] and try and weigh 250 seems about right so right now just try and shape it into a bowl something like that a little disc that's fine trying to touch them not too much because of the fact that so it's so sticky you can probably use some some flour if you if you prefer okay now they're not even evenly placed but that's why i'm going to leave them here for 30 minutes and we're not going to cover them they're wet enough actually if they dry a little bit it's going to be better it'll be a little bit easier to work with them now during this 30 minutes we have time to prepare our cush which is the place where baguettes can prove rest and get ready for baking so before we get to the final shaping of the baguettes one of the most important things is preparing the place where you're gonna have your baguettes in their final shape and proving we're going to prove them for around an hour and 45 minutes now there is the the exact technical piece of equipment that you need is called kush which is a pretty stiff fabric that you can shape in a way that has sort of undulation so you can put the baguettes in the creases of the fabric now i don't have that not yet at least so i might i might buy one but in the meantime i managed to find this which is bathroom mat which is just plain cotton but it's pretty stiff and and thick and so it holds the shape to uh now to avoid using putting the the baguettes directly on this kind of uh material which is you know it's like a towel so even though we'll put flour it still might stick i'm gonna have i'm gonna use this uh cloth this uh napkin uh which is pretty smooth uh again this is just cotton napkin then to create nicely the shape another thing that i'm using is these two rolling pins probably you can do without or you can use something else just to give the initial shape now this is only if you um actually want to use this trick you can try and make something yourself so basically what i'm doing is i'm just rolling a little bit of the uh of this towel on one of the rolling pins so now i need to create basically four slots so as you can see i'm doing something like this uh i'm just creating these creases and there it is three the fourth is a little bit more complicated here but and still do that they're gonna be pretty skinny baguettes are pretty skinny and if anything you normally risk to have a place that's too wide so the baguettes will kind of lose their shape so if it's a little bit too narrow uh it's fine now i'm gonna put the napkin that's also a bit tricky now i'm gonna sprinkle flour on this and also use a good quantity of flour because you definitely don't want to have the baguette sticking if you have the proper one the cush it would be obviously better in the meantime i'm showing you this kind of creative trick that you can try and use [Music] all right so half an hour has passed and now we need to shape these baguettes um now flour is gonna be definitely necessary because these things are pretty sticky so let's just start flouring the board here we're gonna need some some room now shaping a baguette takes a little bit of exercise but it's not impossible moving out of the way let's flower this this one side and then i'll flip it over now we're gonna do it first first we're turning it into a little roll so fold it once turn it over [Music] fold it again seal now the typical part of the process it's we lift side and we we fold it and we use our palm and bring it down and we repeat the process on the other side so and some flour because it's sticky fold and close like this okay seal and now we put our hands on top and we start rolling to the desired [Music] length i'm not considering i'm using a normal oven i'm not gonna do it too long and also i'm trying to flip it so actually this is the length that i'm gonna and then i'm putting it in the kush i'm gonna show you in a moment okay number two and let's start with the with this little game it's a little trick full with your thumb just try kind of taper it a little bit and so on see you these are more than me button that baguettes that's fine that's done and as you can see baguettes now we're gonna cover them with the other napkin that i'm using and we're gonna leave them there for about an hour and 45 minutes might depend on the temperature in your kitchen but after that time if you can touch them and the dough seems kind of puffy they should be ready for baking [Music] they just need to have this kind of soft touch they should rise in in the oven i'm going to transfer them to this tray with a parchment paper on it the oven is hot i have a fan oven and it's set to 220 degrees celsius it's a fan oven so that's why the temperature is like that otherwise if it's not you would want to use a higher temperature they're gonna bake for around 20 minutes 25 minutes this is a small baguette so i think 20 minutes gonna be enough uh the setting of the oven is is set and we have a as you can see there is a baking stone there is a baking stone and um a tray underneath and we're gonna we're gonna pour hot water in the tray because we need humidity when the baguettes are baking 220 is actually 448 twenty eight five minutes okay 450 is fine if you don't have a fan convection whatever oven okay now delicately put the baguettes make sure that they are the right size so they will fit in the oven just delicately lift them don't worry if the shape keep them straight you want the sneaky or maybe you want a snakey baguette i don't know now the last thing we have to do so we need to score them and immediately put them in the oven i'm having some help which is just good otherwise try and do these things quickly there's water going on going in the oven [Music] which will create the steam that we want i think that's plenty now traditionally you score the baguettes with like diagonals uh so three or four diagonals that kind of overlap and so let's go with the scoring so scoring blade as usual four i'm silently concentrated parchment paper is here because hopefully i'm gonna put them like like like i was putting a pizza in the oven okay and now around 20 minutes baking time and we'll see how it goes the guests look pretty good and we'll soon see if they also taste good and they have the right crunch which we want from la baguette okay let's see sounds pretty good [Music] not bad at all add butter to this dough [Music]", "ofDzwfDt84o": "[Music] you you [Music] doh loses its stability during freezing that is why you need to use flour with high protein content East will be damaged when frozen you need to double the east of your recipe it is important to avoid fermentation before freezing make sure you use cold water or milk of your wet ingredients like I said before avoiding fermentation is very important at this stage put the shape Duval's into the freezer as soon as possible once the dough balls are frozen you need to pack it as quickly as possible into the zip bag this is to prevent from the cold damaging the dough to prevent freezer burn squeeze out as much air as possible before sealing it freezer burn is commonly caused by poor packaging or leaving food in the freezer for too long never keep your dough in a freezer more than two months these dough balls have been in the freezer for seven days line them up on a tray cover with plastic wrap to prevent drying and cracking of the dough surface every room temperature is different condensation occurs during defrosting when you leave a frozen product in room temperature it will damage your dough for home users or beginners the best is the defrost frozen dough slowly in the fridge overnight to prevent the dough from rising and cracking now the dough balls are defrosted you may follow the step to reshape your dough before proofing [Music] you you", "0vzTUi5L5FY": "okay well it looks ridiculous sounds good hey guys welcome this is the backstage pass in this series we sort of look at behind the scenes of how we go about making recipes um i am the brother chef and a lot of times we sort of recipe testing on new recipes and this is for sourdough baguette and in this video i'm going to share with you the mistakes we made and maybe perhaps for my mistakes you can learn a couple of things previously i released a video on how to make a bruschetta you can go ahead and check the link in the description below and in that video we actually made a baguette and this is the behind the scenes of the baguette the failures and the mouth success that i got enjoy so what i did there is just to make the fly in the water which is about 85 percent bread flour and 15 whole wheat just that it makes uh and rest for 30 minutes for auto lease before adding the levant the lavan is about 15 which is what you used to and comfortable with and then mix on the mixer for about five minutes before going through a series of stretching full [Music] so i'm doing the stretch before until the dough can reach a window pane stage as you can see it is not quite ready at this stage yet [Music] so what i'm doing here is dividing the dough into six portions each about 150 grams which is what the legend patrick ryan from i love cooking island tells me it's perfect for the home oven size and here it is and just gonna give a dough a quick pre-shape into a ball and then from a ball to a sort of a longish kind of baguette shape so i don't have a proper crush for this so i just found the thickest t-tower i can find and just just fold it to shape and let the baguette dough go inside and hope for the best so i went to the backyard making feeling quite confident because i am used to making high hydration sourdoughs sourdough's bread as high as 80 percent um so went into this with 77 hydration which is a big mistake for baguette because it is very difficult to maneuver now this is where things really screw up one of the key techniques which i learned from making this is that on how do you move the dough from the place where it's proofing and to the baking sheet because this is so high hydration and i realized that by now they actually have some kind of petals to move it around any movements to the dough will sort of distort the shape and you can see here i destroyed all three doughs in this move [Music] oh i give it a quick score and in it goes to the oven okay so i just put it in the oven uh as you can see it's a total nightmare it was sticking to everything i couldn't get the shape in place but the good thing is the battery totals professional series oven has a steam function so uh it's actually rising quite nice except the ship is the french gods are rolling the grave right now but come take a look it is not a beggar but maybe a danish pastry okay so our first bag the first time making baggage and they are out and they look nothing like baggage in fact they look like that french baggage trying to be italian shepherds um yeah [Music] you know the best part these are all stuck uh let's try again the next time round okay well it looks ridiculous sounds good [Applause] and the next try i actually dropped the hydration down to 65 percent um it is much more manageable you can see there's a lot more um tension in the dough that allows me to move from place to place without distorting the shape so once again doing a quick pre-shape here before i do the final shape and here with the final shape you can see the dough is a lot more dense and he has a lot more strength to it that i can actually roll it and actually make the shape with the back at the ends to be pointy and nice what i also learned is that if you use too much flour before you do the rolling it will not roll it will slide around instead of rolling so don't put too much flour when you do the final shape otherwise you can get that nice roll that you want to achieve that nice pointy end and after proofing for an hour it's time to move them to the baking sheet and this time round you can see they are holding the shape much better they are not too loose and they have enough strength to be moved by hand give it a quick score and into the oven [Music] [Applause] and here it is our homemade sourdough baguette i attempt number two i wish it had a much larger girth but we all do but it is what it is we're just gonna make do and make the best of what we have and this background we have to do okay [Music] and thanks for watching hope you enjoyed that if you enjoyed it do subscribe and give a like to the video and see you around [Music] you", "iHnekFzoHMc": "Put water in the bowl

"KspoWmDNt08": "so I have my polish ready this is I prepared last night and has been proofing for about 13 hours you can see it's ready because here on the sides is starting to collapse so this is where you can understand that you know the Polish is ready so this is our recipe I I'll be making a making bread with this polish which represents 4/5 of the water for compared to the original receipt and I want to explain you a little bit how the math works so so here is the original quantities of the recipe right so you have flour 700 grams and water for unwanted grams which represents 70% water or flour so if I want to do a Polish with 4/5 so it's it means that you need to take 4/5 of the water of the amount of water and reserve it for the Polish so 4/5 of 490 is 390 which means that the Polish will be made with 390 grams flour 3 and another grams water which is 100% polish is 100% agitation and then 0 1 % yeast so which means is about zero 4.0.4 grams so you mix it together you let it proof for about 12 hours until it gets to this point as I said before right so where the you know the it's starting to collapse so the final dough then will be the whole amount of Polish then you need to have the remaining flour which is fundamentally 700 minus 390 which is 310 grams and through many water so is for 19-3 90 which is Holograms so there's an option to add 0.5% of yeast on the other flower so it's really optional or it it kind of you know boost the proofing time and it adds a bit of feel as trying to the you know to the proofing to the yeast which is already in the in the polish so I'll Bernard in this 0.5 grams so this is related related to the Holograms here so it's 0.5 of the added flour so that it doesn't really skew the amount of years that you add so what I'll do now is to prepare you know the remaining flour water and yeast and I'll mix it in so I have all my components ready so I have bullish water fresh yeast this is the amount mold and salt I forgot to mention before that I'm gonna out of course you know salt which is 1.8% on top of flour she's about twelve point five grams and mold which is one percent of the total flour sin hundred grams which is seven grams so I'm gonna mix all the ingredients now and yeah I'll see how goes so I will add my foolish to the flour so the flour isn't right here check his patois and everything out he smells incredible this was a strong flower is not an all-purpose flour just to make sure that you know he could withstand the long cooking times about 13 hours and said then a lot water mold and yeast mixing so I know add the salt and mix it a little bit as you can see it's coming together there are a lot of netting to be done so now that is my hand so it's it's already coming together and as you can see man it's pretty right here is actually quite not ready yet but what I'll do now is to put it in a recipient let it rest for 20 minutes and then give it a first gold and I'll do this several times every 20-30 minutes until the dough really comes together so here's my initial dough in a recipient it's a plastic recipient that I greased a little bitter with some olive oil there so I'll now put a plastic wrap and let it rest for about 20 minutes and then I'll I'll make a first fold and then I'll keep on folding and every 20 minutes until you know the gluten is really formed so 20 minutes have gone so what I'll do is I'll make one first fold so I'll take do you know fold it and fold it it's pretty difficult here to do one hand only hold it hold it hold it put my phone here keep on holding it until I do a complete turn you can feel under your hands that is taking little Stratton already okay see you later you so after the last fold I let it rest for another 20 minutes so it's now time for preciate so the total book roofing tile was about two and a half hours I folded six times 20 minutes or three times an hour and now I let it rest for 20 minutes so yeah two and a half hours book proofing time so let me take this out so what I mean there you go so this is just full of error very very nice so let me preciate this into a bowl and I will yeah this is the way I do it just fold it and now let it rest for I guess half an hour just for the gluten to relax and then we'll do the final proofing a final shaping and I let it proof for another hour hour and a half or so C and half an hour", "EyMPWY3v8_8": "we're going to make an artisan baguette and this is the demonstration how to make it uh on the recipe you'll notice it requires a poolish and this here is what a poolish is so this is made up 24 hours before it's a mixture of flour yeast and water and it's left to ferment overnight you add this with the other ingredients into the mixer and mix it until a dough is formed okay so once your dough is out of the mixer it'll be a little bit sticky what you need to do is you need to get one of these white tubs sprayed with some spray this kind of trend wax so it doesn't stick and basically put your dough into there and leave it to ferment for an hour okay for the artisan baguette what we need to do is we need to prepare the tray ready for after we've molded it out we can then put it into this cooch cloth so these are cooch cloths the piece of material that the baguettes go in to prove uh we need a tray normal sized baking tray i'm gonna roll out the cooch cloth so that we have an end slightly overlapping the tray and then we'll roll that out there and then what you need to do is you need to get some semolina and basically sprinkle that over the couch cloth okay so our baguette has been fermenting now for an hour uh what we're going to do is we're going to put this onto the table scale it off and then we're going to process it so what you'll need to do is a little bit of flour on the table tip upside down and because we've greased it it should fall out uh without anything in the kind of box so it's really important that you grease it properly and then what we're going to do then is we're just going to scale this off at 350 grams so ideally what you want to do is try and keep this dough flat and then we're going to kind of cut it out into strips and then scale it on some scales okay now we've got an idea of how big it needs to be uh we can kind of look at the rest of the dough now and decide how we're going to cut it so what i'm going to do is i'm just going to make this slightly thinner and out of this amount of dough should have enough to make three baguettes okay right we're going to do now then so we're going to first mold okay so uh what we need to do is kind of this end here needs to come up and over and make a seal line so we've got to be really gentle with this because we've got some um fermentation in there with the air bubbles and we need to make sure we keep that intact because we want our baguettes to be nice and open so what we're going to do is just fold it over and then basically make a new seam on the other side all the way along to the bottom and then what we're going to do is using this part of our hand here we're going to seal it okay so just go down just seal it so i'm not hitting the whole baguette just the seal that i've made just just to kind of make it nice and sealed up so it doesn't split open and all i'm gonna do now is roll it out gently okay so uh when you roll in the ends just try and get them nice and pointy and that's uh what we're doing now is going to transfer that over to the cooch cloth so move it over there into the pooch cloth and now we can see this is in the coupe cloth now uh the baguette is there put it right up against the end of the tray and then what we're going to do is raise this up so we kind of form a barrier and then the next baguette will go in here so i'll just show you again make the theme seal it and then basically roll it out nice and gentle another key thing here is to make sure they're all the same size transfer it over into the couch cloth so now we can see we've got two one there the little barrier for the cooch cloth and then another baguette again make a barrier start again so make a theme seal it then basically we're gonna roll it out nice and gently make sure those ends are nice and pointy and then once again transfer into the couch cloth now once we've got to the point where we've made all our autumn baguettes we've got no more dough left over we need to do is we need to cover them over to stop the skinning so this end which you had overlapping the tray that comes over the top there and then this can go over as well to meet it okay that'd be nice and safe now it won't dry out we're going to do is put these underneath table for about 45 minutes to an hour and then once they're ready we're going to bake them on the oven bottom right so our baguettes are now approved we'll just let you have a look at this so you can see how big they are now um so we've got three baguettes in there all going to do is going to transfer these over to a tray so we need to do is you need to get a tray with a piece of silicone paper sprinkle some semolina over the top but the really important thing is that the tray has the open end at one side this is important because when we put this in the oven we're going to slip these baguettes off using this open end so make sure it's an open-ended tray next thing you need is one of these wooden buttons this is what we're going to use to transfer these baguettes over to that tray there so what we're going to do is we're going to put the button between the cooch cloth and the baguette use the cooch cloth to flip it over onto the button and then basically transfer it over onto the tray like that so we do it again on there flip it over transfer it over there and obviously just be really gentle with this so that we don't knock any of the air out of it okay pooch cloths when we finish with these cooch cloths they need to be rolled up properly so you need to roll them like that so roll them up so they're ready for the next person to use don't fold the cooch cloths because it damages them and it makes it harder for them to be used next time you make baguettes so now we see that we've got the baguettes on the tray uh what we're gonna do is i'm just gonna use this to kind of make sure they're straight and separated and even across the tray so not too close to the edge uh and we can just use that like that so freeba gets to a tray you can see they're all the same size all the same shape and what we're going to do now is we're going to crush these baguettes now the key thing here is that it goes long along the baguette so we're not cutting across the baguette we're cutting at an angle and down so i'll just demonstrate how we can do that so you want one one two three four five okay okay so we can see the cuts are down the biggest they're not um kind of horizontal they're more vertical and there's four to five cups in each biggest but really now i'm gonna stick these in the oven so we'll show you how to do that obviously the oven is set up as per your instructions what you do is the open ends towards the oven and then basically we're going to put the tray in and pull it out really fast so that the tray comes out but these baguettes stay inside okay there you go perfect let's play away shut the door press start and that's them ready and thank you",

to freeze and defrost little small rolls like this one I made last week let's find out shall we hey you guys and welcome back to the bakery Jackie YouTube channel where i share little bit my bread making expertise every single Thursday is that's your cup of tea in your new if you like what you see and you want to stick around consider pressing that subscribe button let's get on with it I don't care what anybody says fresh bread freezes really well and it's the best way to keep it as close to fresh as possible if you bake it let it cool completely and put it straight in the freezer that's the best way to keep it as close to fresh as possible Plus is 2019 we live in in this modern age and everybody's got a freezer these days right this way everyone Scrolls down to comments box and starts typing in stuff like oh I haven't got a freezer because I live in a cave so anyway I made these little lemon shaped rolls last week in a video that went out last week and I thought let's freeze them down for the following week and I can show them exactly how I did it and the best way we can find out together of bringing them back to life after the best way I find a freezing bread like that is to put them all together in a freezer bag like this one a resealable ziplock freezer bag so you can take them out as and when you want to and seal it back up again afterwards you can even or in Southeast bags dry them and re-use them just make sure you pop the date on there when you made them so you don't forget and ideally what they are in the bag before you freeze it because I'm one of those people who goes our while remember what that is in there and I never remember what that is in there use reusable bags and label them nicely and make sure that they are sealed air tight if they're not airtight and a little bit of air gets in you get what's called freezer burn which is when your bread goes a little bit why it's where it's exposed to the air which right is still edible but it just goes all a little bit weird for this video I try four different ways to resurrect the freshness of these rolls that had been previously frozen and I think the same principal will apply applied to any small role that you put on the side of a suit for example any small Krusty role or even a small baguette you might have to adjust the timings depending on size the bigger it is it might take slightly longer it's a bake fruits at the middle the first one it was an overnight defrost I took the bag out of the freezer left it on the kitchen side of room temperature overnight to let the frost nicely in the morning and this is how it came out okay it's defrosted it's quite soft which means it's going to be quite chewy there's no crust the present is all evened itself out thanks to that plastic bag we lose the definition of the crust and the crumb that's the first one I tried the second one I upped the game a touch bread roll number two is the same principle I took it out of the freezer left it on the side in the bag overnight exactly the same as the other one but after that I then put it in an oven that was pre heated to 200 degrees C this 392 degrees Fahrenheit gas mark 6 I popped it in there for 10 minutes and take a look at SRI oh nice and crusty listen yes there is an element of crust falling off here detaching itself and I'm gonna talk to you about that later on because that happened in almost all cases I'll tell you exactly why that happened at the end of the video oh I know what this one came out really nicely as well crust you had to preheat the oven and then 10 minutes in the oven and they come out just like this in the interest of convenience I wondered what it would be like if I took it straight out of the free zone popped it straight into the oven and that's roll number 3 this one here which is really nice and crusty as well listen was put into an oven that was cold I put it straight out of the freezer into the oven on the oven shelf in a cold oven then I turned the oven on and it took around 17 minutes for this to get completely baked outside and inside in 17 minutes and my oven reached about 180 degrees C that's 356 degrees Fahrenheit gas masks for gas masks gas mark 4 or 5 or something around there this one come out real nice and crusty and was super easy I'm not kind of open here we can see it right it's nice and fluffy inside it's crusty on the outside it's just nice I like this and it was so easy the fourth and final bread roll came straight out the freezer but this time into a hot preheated oven at 200 degrees and this is what came out like this one is really nice and go on the tree but it's really properly crusty this one took 12 minutes to bake through to the center which means the outside is really quiet crust in 12 minutes at 200 degrees that's really quite across the outside of my cut this won't open - this one's got the crispiest crust by fires properly solid on the end but it's nice and fluffy and bouncing in the middle exactly the same as the rest so I thought there's a pretty thorough test for different ways to test how to defrost bread frozen you know what I've been the best one for me was number three it all depends on what you fancy was convenient to you number three straight out the freezer into that cold oven turn it up 17 minutes it's ready no preheat in the oven no waiting for that to happen real nice and crusty on the outside absolutely perfect that has got to be for me the best way isn't it nice when the most convenient way turns out to be the best way that's really nice when does that actually happen ever so remember I mentioned about that detachable crust you may have been noticing that little shards and fragments of bread crust shrapnel has been scattered all over my lap for the duration of this video and that's down to one thing that's because I baked these rolls fully before I froze him and that's because I wasn't thinking ahead I baked those rolls are fully last week froze them down and I thought let's use it for another video next week if you were thinking ahead and you were baking to freeze I wouldn't recommend part baking your bread to avoid this that means baking it so it's baked to the middle but with minimum color on the outside that way when you bring it back again it won't be over baked on the outside and that crust should maintain in contact with the rest of your roll and there you have as always I hope that helps you out remember baking times always vary depending Ivan it requires a little bit of trial and error but get it out of freezer straight to the oven turn it on 17 minutes is what took me might take you a little bit more taking over less but that was pretty wicked results thank you guys so much for watching my video every single Thursday this

salt safe ins to East fresh water and diastatic malt powder which is optional so I used 500 grams of flour 15 grams of salt she's full enough safe hands to East like I said this is optional diastatic malt powder I got flour for my sandwich bread but I do think it helps the texture the shelf-life okay that's all you need so you just really need flour salt and yeast I've already measured my water it's 310 grams cold you want it cool turn it on dough slowly add the water until it comes into a ball you don't want it to wake you don't want it to dry obviously it comes into a ball you're gonna process it for 45 seconds that's the ball 45 seconds from now take out a thermometer oh my gosh I knew I was cold it's only 60 degrees in my house once you get to know this recipe won't need to take the temperature you're shooting for like 78 79 80 at that point this takes too long trust me I'm at 78 right now if I left it in for a couple more minutes it would be 80 just the way it is now you don't have to do this I like to because it makes me feel like a real bread maker you can make this whole recipe really without ever meeting the doll so that's what you do put it somewhere you can put a cover on it and let it rise for an hour and a half okay I'm back it's been all right I'm gonna turn your dough out you need a kitchen towel my bread didn't rise very much because it's really cold in my house if you remember Steve read yourself I'm in a hurry because I have to go to a soccer game so I'm not gonna worry about it because it will rise in this second rising room so you can divide this bread into three sections or four and divide it into 4 more or less equal sections be anal about that so what we're doing here is shaping them into loaves Matt and I push it in the middle pinch up if you can see that I'm gonna wait to roll that all of it I said I'm gonna roll pinch turn it around roll pinched kind of a log down the middle pinch to see pull it up from the side Spanish wrong okay not home they roll it as long as my cookie sheet make a little tray for it dogs the nature branded plastic the dusty cover it up let it sit in a bag covered for 45 to 90 minutes depending on the temperature of your kitchen and pre-heat your oven to 500 degrees in my oven I have some baking stones they're old and broken but I just have them going across one rack and I have a temperature gauge so that I know exactly what the temperature is and then this bread pan filled with nuts and bolts is what I use to create steam I just heat it up in the oven and I pour water onto it right before I bake you can also use just uh like a roasting pan at the bottom of your oven it helps with the crust of the bread you can use it if you want it's very easy otherwise you can just fergal that stuff you might not get the same rise and right before you're ready to bake transfer the loaves to a baking sheet and score with a sharp knife after your bread has risen for anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour and a half you're gonna want to score the loaves you can use just a sharp knife put three or four diagonal lines across them and wait for a half a cup of warm water into the container at the bottom of your oven and then immediately turn your oven temperature down to 450 degrees for the remainder of the 10 minute cooking time and there's the finished loaves is where your scores were they should have a minimum temperature inside you can stick an instant-read thermometer in of 205 degrees", "LwSGCI1sVwQ": "hi everybody this is number five there'll be probably one or two more of the videos to finish off your french baguettes so yesterday what we did was we did our french dough we had made our fermented dough and this is the dough now i have left that dough sitting out at room temperature overnight so this is what you're going to get this big bubbly dough now if you have a look at the bubble structure you'll see it's got masses of air pockets beautiful and soft and really shiny on the top that's what you're looking for now if you've left yours just for two or three hours um what you'll find is that it will be much much less up the ball okay if you've left it in the fridge you'll notice it's maybe not climbed quite as much either but it will still be moving shiny and full of bubbles okay so this is what we're going to do next we're going to put down a little bit of rye flour now if you don't have the rye or you don't have anything else you could use with a whole meal um i quite like to just use the rye and i also put a tiny little bit of white i'm going to use my scraper and the first thing i do is go around my bowl just to release the dough from the corners of the bowl and then what i'm going to do is just work the dough out onto the floured area only remembering that when we need we don't use flour anything that's left in the bowl around your bowl and give it a good clean off remember that's always added extra so once we've got it literally out onto the worktop you'll notice it'll have flattened off so now what we're going to do is we're going to actually stretch the dough okay stretch out both sides and you're going to fold one on top of the other okay next part you're going to fold this length into the middle and this one back and then all i do is just tip it over so instantly you should have what looks like a little rectangle or a pillow and then what i do is i divide now i'm going to make this into four rather than three larger ones i'm just going to mix four slightly smaller ones okay now once we've done the four cuts and you've got your four little portions we're going to just let them bench rest again just for five minutes i won't do that so as to show you the process but you're going to let yours sit for five minutes now whether you want to put them back with the bowl over the top while they're sitting having their five minutes of rest time that's up to yourselves now what i'm going to do is just show you the next part of the process so yet again a little bit more flour and if they're sticking to the work surface just use your scraper to lift them smooth side to the top goes down and all i'm going to do is just flatten them okay now you can stretch them out again and fold them and each time you're folding them it's just adding extra strength to them now this time round i'm gonna roll it okay so that's one next one over and then all i'm gonna do is just stretch them out almost like they look like little dog bones into the center this end back into the center and then i do either side okay and this time around i like to roll okay so you'll end up with a nice little neat roll okay next one if they're sticking too much again just put a little bit of flour down so stretching out folding into the center stretch out fold either side stretch out and you can roll up okay now last one if you're doing three that's absolutely fine okay so over it goes stretch it out to the middle stretch out back over the top of it again if it's sticking just keep it moving hands center and roll okay so you'll end up with four little rolls now this time round you do have to take a break pop the shower bolt the not shower cap that would help pop the bowl or your split your shower cap and put that back over or a little poly bag whatever you want this does need to be rested you really need to give this a good five to ten minutes okay every time we allow the dough to have this bench rest what we're doing is allowing mother nature to just let it settle okay it improves the structure and you're also building each time on the lovely strength that you get so 10 minutes and then i'm gonna do the last part where i'm going to shape them roll them and we're going to then put them into our baguette trees so we've got doubles we've got triples we've actually got quadruples we also have cush cloth and we have things like flipping boards for doing baguettes but if you're at home a cotton tea towel can do the exact same and i can show you how to do that if you've got one of these or you want to order one today ready for tomorrow from amazon nine pounds maybe if you want bigger one maybe 12. a good investment for every single time you're doing french baguettes see you shortly", "xcWF8LI-nIQ": "hi everyone today we're making chicken tikka sandwich baguettes delicious chicken tikka inside a baguette style sandwich paired with delicious green chutney now the sandwich is super easy to make so let's get started first we need to make some yogurt honey yogurt is simply yogurt that has the way removed from it so for this we need 3 tablespoons that's 3 heaped tablespoons of yogurt regular unsweetened yogurt [Music] we're gonna add this to a clock strainer like this or you can use a cheesecloth and it needs to be hung so that the way drips down we're gonna hang it for 20 minutes I'm gonna leave it over a strainer like this so the way can drip down and after 20 minutes it should be ready okay now we can marinate our chicken now in this recipe the chicken is marinated in two steps we have 600 grams of chicken breast here large chunks and for our first marinade we're gonna add 2 teaspoons of lime juice and 2 teaspoons of ginger and garlic paste that's the equal proportions of fresh ginger and garlic that has been ground to a paste and to this we're gonna add 3/4 teaspoon of salt just gonna rub that in and marinate it for just 10 minutes meanwhile we can get ready our ingredients for the second marinade you can either mix this all together in a bowl like this or you can add it directly to the chicken that has been marinated for 10 minutes for the second marinade you need 1 tablespoon of minced red onion for the authentic flavor we're also going to add 1 tablespoon of mustard oil but this is optional and then we're going to add half a tablespoon of dried fenugreek leaves or kasoori methi just crush it with your hands and add this as well [Music] 3/4 teaspoon of thunder tea masala powder you can check the description for the recipe a quarter teaspoon of any garam masala 1/2 a tea spoon of kashmiri chilli powder quarter teaspoon of cumin powder half a teaspoon of coriander powder and for that authentic flavor we're going to add half a teaspoon of black salt or you can add regular self [Music] and to this we're gonna add another two extra teaspoons of ginger and garlic paste you can check out my video on how to make ginger and garlic paste at home our honey yogurt is also ready see how it's thickened up after the way has been moved so we're gonna mix all these ingredients for the second a marinade into the chicken piece as well and now we're gonna place it in the refrigerator for a minimum of three hours it must marinate well for the chicken pieces to be nice and tender so three hours you can marinate it longer if you like so when you're ready to make the sandwiches you need baguette style sandwiches or any type of rolls dinner rolls make sure they have a nice texture there and that they're fresh because stale baguettes or rolls like this tend to be really hard to bite into and eat so make sure they're really nice and fresh so that they're slightly crisp on the outside but nice and soft on the inside so when it's time to cook our chicken pre-heat your oven to 180 degrees Celsius now I've lined the baking tray with parchment paper you can use foil paper also and I'm using a double layer of wire mesh I'm using a two wire racks here so that the chicken pieces don't fall through the wire rack place them evenly spaced so that they're not touching each other and make sure that the wire racks are lightly greased ahead of time so that the chicken does not stick to the wire rack during the cooking process so we're gonna place this in the oven 180 degrees Celsius on a lower or middle rack and bake this for 10 minutes [Music] [Music] after 10 minutes we're going to turn over the pieces and base the pieces with melted butter [Music] make sure to add a good amount of butter for all the pieces and now we're going to return this to the oven to broil so we're gonna place this on the upper rack of the oven closer to the heating element from above so that the chicken pieces gets broiled and place this under the grill to broil for six to eight minutes until the chicken pieces are nice and tender don't over bake them as they will get dry and lose flavor so to make your sandwiches is simply slit open the set add the bread and brush lightly with melted butter I did warm up these breads lightly in the microwave prior to making them don't heat them too long or they tend to get hard so to this we're just gonna add a delicious amount of that green chutney some chicken pieces maybe three to four pieces per sandwich some sliced onion and lettuce and more chutney your delicious chicken tikka sandwich a baguette is ready slice through the center and serve don't forget to check out my delicious green chutney recipe hope you try and enjoy the recipe thanks for watching bye [Music]", "RjEslbtFJGM": "good evening is Jeff I'm over here at Bagram and I'm talking about the Ryanair soy and it's going to be raining all day tomorrow they reckon so I'm going to make some bread tomorrow and tomorrow I'm going to make some bad it's some beautiful French baguettes so the first thing I'm gonna do tonight is make them that foolish which is French to polish and I'm using 1/3 of the flour that are many years in the in the mixture so in this case I'm using it's 350 grams of flour and same weight of water so we've got 350 mils of water that's just tepid water and I'm going to put about a quarter of a teaspoon of active of instant dry yeast put that in there and all they do then it's just mix it all up and then put a cover on it let it sit overnight because this poolish has been going for about ten hours so you can see it's bubbling nicely the ingredients for this bread is one kilo of good quality bakers well 750 mils of water 2 teaspoons of salt and 2 teaspoons of instant dry yeast so this is a 72% hydration dough I'm going to need this by hand now needing such a high hydration dough point hand can be quite challenging so I've got an answer to that so so because I've used 350 mils of water and 350 grams of flour on requiring another 370 grams or mils of water so what I'm going to do is put my yeast make up the remaining yeast in there that's 1 and 3/4 teaspoons in that you're gonna put myself in my flour so what I've got here is 530 green - flour here and 120 grams there and that makes up a total of 1 kilo but I'm just gonna combine the salt in this flour combine this yeast in with the water mix it up roughly I'm just gonna add the water to the Polish I'm just gonna mix that around I'm gonna add the other 530 grams of flour and turn this into a bit of a dive so what I'm gonna do is put some of this flour on the bench here so the idea of putting this flour separate as part of the mixture is that I'm keeping my 72% hydration you know I do now just turn it over and then needed to prevent 6 minutes now the idea now is to just people are adding this play out to it we're not start kneading and I'll get it all out of my fingers and years that three hours to clean my fingers up and put it back into the diet so and also here is that flower to clean up the rest of it you put on in the bowl and the eventually I'm gonna have to get my hands in here I know you say up there but that water and boost out and just sort of gently leading it over and working that rest of that flower in there so just put it on the surface there and slowly working again with a little bit more lift and I've removed all the dye from yeah and you can see it you don't want to push on a very hard what was happening it would just break out yes very hard very very watery then you kind of give it it there the six minutes me just kind of there's a list of s wherever I might just put it on me just kept my fingers fairly clean using the usual mice contacts I have some extra flour there in case I do need it but I know years as little as possible of extra flour so want to keep that 72 percent hydration and those spending our beautiful what I'm going to do is give my my bucket that little scrape some cooking spray my dough in there it's a very watered so he's going to spray on top of there and I put my teeth terror on top of that and I sit in a warm each spot and let it double or even triple in size okay say that da have said and they doubled its size or more so what I'm going to do is put a little bit of flair on us on half the surface here and just kind of let it roll amp wonder that yeah but a bit of competition we've got some blue faced honeyeaters outside so what I'm going to do is just do a couple of Falls then put it back in for another day a lie when I said that is risen again that's been one hour so I'm just going to do the same as last time little that good another stretching fault looks fantastic Oh give it another air and then come back make our baguettes well the other side we're ready to make our baguettes yeah beautiful seventy-two percent hydration dough so just put a little bit of flour on my hands just kind of zooming that's what do you do one night to do is what they call sky sky all the dough now see how much we got then I'll work here and want to make six baguettes edited about my scallops on Zuni snowman these at 280 would have to 81 280 so now I've got my weight my baguette scale I'm just going to pre shape them and just black putting them on here and they kind of let it rest for 10 minutes time that for me our baguettes as you can see the dough is sticky so you are dearest little bit of flour on your hands the idea is to have that role get out of that two thirds plus and do the same on this side I'm going to says and then with your thumb just sort of hold your thumb in there and bring it around and with with you think just just like that and you can do the same again with you something there and then and you're saying yesterday pencil that down if that save at the bottom me and what you do that way out you just a bet performs you bag it but all you do is just yeah our oven nothing allow us to make real big  so what I'm doing is this is the brought sois this rice talk is just the right sauce what you can say my wedding in at rest that it doesn't want to spring back so we're going to do then is take it across yeah but more yeah my couch he told catch just take out the the heaven but any yes quite a bit of wood bit of support its here like that and I put a bit of plastic under there stiffen up the tails and you just sort of moved about that suggestion supported and do the next one", "6sDM6_JqiG8": "hello everyone today I want to share with you my favorite recipe for sourdough baguette this bread is made from only water and flour and a little bit of salt it is super fun to make and it tastes amazing let me show you how I do it always use the sourdough starter at its maximum rice and we'll need 160 grams of active Sardo starter the easiest way to measure the ingredients is to put the bowl on top of the measuring scale that way you won't have to use any extra containers set the scale on 0 and measure 160 grams of the starter I always recommend to use warm water to speed up the fermenting process and the best temperature would be 90 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit I'm setting the scale to zero and a measuring out 220 grams of warm water add 400 grams of white all-purpose flour give it a quick mix and add 1 teaspoon of salt now I'll be mixing until the dough will start to change the structure it will be kind of tacky and wet if you have a stand mixer you can always do this with the mixer with a dough hook and this is what we need you can see the dough got kind of wet the structure changed that's perfect cover it with a damp towel and let it rest for about 1 hour best ways to put the dough in a warmer place like in the sunlight or in a closed microwave somewhere where the dough will rise faster but if you have colder temperature in your house it might take you a little longer and you can see the dough that riced a little bit maybe 40% and now I will do the stretch and fold basically you take a side of the dough and you fold it inwards toward the center and the purpose of doing this is we're trying to trap more air and the oxygen will help the dough to rise so try to create as much air bubbles as possible cover the dough with a damp towel again and let it rise for another hour and you can see the dough did increase in size maybe 40% and now we'll do the coil fold use a little bit of water on your hands to prevent the dough from sticking so we're stretching the dough upwards and folding the dough on itself and then turn it sideways and do the same on the other side we're trying to create more air bubbles so the oxygen will help with the fermentation and then turn it over and do it again on the other side [Music] and then I will turn it again and do it one last time so usually takes about three or four turns and this is how it looks from the side you can see those rolls the dough is rolled under itself that's what we need we need those air bubbles cover the dough again and let it stand for another hour and now I'll do the shaping I'll need some flour on the surface where I'll be working with the dough and you can see how beautiful the dough looks all those air bubbles energized about half of its size try to be gentle with the dough you don't want to pop those bubbles that we created earlier I know two different ways how to shape the baguette and I will show you both this one is the one I use stretch the dough on one side and fold it toward the center and then do the same on the other side then from top to the center and then from the bottom to the center then I'll kind of seal it and then stretch and roll it over itself and then seal it again [Music] this helped to create a lot of air bubbles inside the dough and now I'll stretch it gently to the sides of the baguette I wonder half and now I'll seal it one last time I'm using 22 inches ration basket and are flowering the surface to prevent the dough from sticking and also lightly flowering the baguette now gently transfer the baguette to the rattan basket and you want the stitches to be facing outwards lightly flour the top of the baguette cover it with a towel and let it rise until it doubles in size and this is the other way how you can shade the baguette I find this way a lot easier but I find better result with the first method gently stretch the dough to about 10 by 10 inch square and now you'll roll up the dough creating the stick this method also traps air bubbles then seal the dough [Music] the baguette double in size it's ready to be baked I'll put some water and heat-resistant container and I'll put that inside the oven preheat the oven to 460 degrees Fahrenheit the oven is now hot and I'll transfer the bread to the baking tray I'll be using always score the bread because it will help to release any tension and also will help the bread to expand when baking at home you always want to create as much steam in your oven as possible add half of a cup of water to your oven this team will help the bread to rise more bake at 450 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 minutes [Music] I really hope that this was kind of helpful and don't forget to subscribe for more recipes coming soon thank you so much for watching I'll see you soon", "9ye6a11NkzM": "in this video today I'm going to show you how to use a simple white crusty bread mix to make some French baked items we will use the dough to make two demi baguette rolls some pretty pan lunch rolls and some twisted dinner rolls - let's begin you will need your bread mix and 325 mils of warm water not cold water or boiling water it has to be just warm and this is because we need the yeast granules in the flour mix to activate and not be killed off we also need two baking trays baking paper and a kitchen knife are your hands washed have you got an apron on well let's get going empty pack of flour and yeast into a bowl make a well in the center and add the warm water use your knife to gradually mix this water and flour together when you sufficiently combined then you can move it onto a board and begin the kneading process it will take about 5 minutes because what you want to do is have it all nice and smooth and you can be quite happy with it but you want the final result to be smooth this is the smoothness that I'd like you to achieve I've already cut this into the four sections with two of them also been cut into four again so these two here will be for the demi baguettes and you've got the pen rolls and the soft twisty rolls so if I show you I want the baguettes to just simply roll it and you can stretch it it's quite playable so interesting and then you would make it a little bit longer now with the deme but put your pants alright put your pen just squeeze and smooth better Jeff and I and then that would go on a separate tray because you would have made the other larger roll dough into your Danny baguette the same here with the others I'll leave that and move on to showing you how to make soft twisted roll so just simply roll it and make it thin as you can stretch it roll it I don't find it too difficult to actually twist it so I'm going to take the ends and pull it through hey presto best I can do now when you've got all those rolls made up along the tray the next thing would be to leave them to prove so these are some that I made up earlier a bit too long but it hasn't done any harm has it because look at the size double in size so I think they've been sitting in the kitchen here for about 60 minutes now you don't want to overdo but certainly what you'll see is that they have this mean size before I get them to proof I actually cut some little slits in the top of the Danny baguettes I did with the patty-pan too but they've risen so much they've disappeared if you find that the twists in those roles and time and not is true tricky just make a design up of your own so once they have risen to double in size then you put them in the oven at gesso not guess not the temperature would be depending what sort of oven you have so you might have a gas oven you might have a electric oven so please just check the instructions on your bread mix and they go in the oven as I said for about 15-20 minutes and then this is some here across here we are look at that all those rolls from just one bread mix amazing I think and you'll love doing this making bread is very therapeutic so enjoy and don't be afraid to be hard on that bread dough when you're kneading it", "JGR7VY-T5FE": "[Music] if you think of france you probably have fromage or cheese effel tower and baguette in mine exceptionally for you and only for you we're going to see how to make baguette from scratch so you start by combining 300 gram of cold filtered water with 500 gram of organic flour so very small tip here it's always to pour the water before the flour [Music] so so far you're doing very very good once it's done you will have to cover this and let it sit for an hour [Music] well not everyone has saradou at home so what you could do is ask your backer and they will sell you some this is where this very typical french sour taste from every baguette you're going to buy comes from that's a secret so you just need to add sourdough salt and yeast just make sure you're not putting the salt and the yeast together otherwise the yeast is not going to work properly so if you are using sourdough you will find out it's quite splashy so i would recommend to place a cloth on top of your mixer so next step now is to add all the basinal that makes about 20 milliliters of water that's going to bring a bit more hydration to the dough and guarantee you a open crumb [Music] once the three minutes are over the dough will be around the hook and you're going to just rest it for another hour after an hour you're just going to give it one spin that's it and that's it your dough is ready you just have to transfer it to a large bowl job is done i hope you have a lot of patience because now you need to leave the door sitting in the fridge on its own for a night you had a great night's sleep dude had a great night sleep too look at this it tripled that's amazing just dust with a bit of rice flour that's going to avoid bringing more gluten into the dough and you just transfer it to your work surface and now what you're going to do you're going to press gently to remove all the gas accumulated during this cold fermentation so now the part coming here it's not going to suit everyone you will have to be very precise imagine coming into a bakery and each baguette will have a different height that doesn't work like this be precise [Music] and bear in mind that each gram count so you might have to remove you might have to add until you reach the desired grimage so now come the pre-shaping part so pre-shaping will be actually allowing to create tension on the outside of the dough you start by pulling a corner away from you and you bring it in a center by pressing with your opposite hand and you repeat so you will see here that the seam is up you just have to flip the ball to put the seam down on the work surface using the palm of your hand you're just going to create a ball that's going to create even more tension [Music] on the dough if you would decide to do breadwall you can just stop there job is done but we're making baguettes we need to flatten this dough [Music] so once you've done all this you're just going to let the dough rest for another 30 minutes this is called benching in french in the meantime you can prepare your baking parchment pepper so you just cut about 20 centimeter by five and that's going to allow you to transfer the dough from the work surface to the cloth and then to the baking tray very convenient so talking about cloth in france they call it a cush it's made of a thick material that's going to allow the dough to be kept in shape while proving not having one you probably don't have one either we're just going to use a simple linen cloth don't be surprised if your dough is sticky so you take one bowl put it upside down dip it in a little bit of rice flour and you're going to start folding it so folding a baguette it's simply pressing down and you're going to fold the first top one third press it again for the other one third and then the last one and that's it using both hands you can just roll it roll it and that is going to bring you the beautiful shape of the expected baguette let's do it again slowly [Music] looking at it i realized i could have done a much better job but you will see this though it's quite sticky and not necessarily easy to handle so just do not worry it's going to still look great at the end as long as you keep the seam down that's a secret so you know what there is this little guy remaining of 36 grand you're not going to waste this yes he deserved to be shaped as a baguette [Music] too i'm sure you won't be surprised at that stage and i'm going to ask you to let the dough rest for another hour start your oven at 250 degree and then you clean your work surface using a door scraper prepare a baking tray you can use a bucket tray or just a normal baking tray prepare use rice flour some water spray and a blade for scoring can you believe that since yesterday you've been waiting for that moment you're transferring your baggage-shaped dough into the baking tray your oven is hot you're going to spray some water on top that's going to give you this shininess of the crust and you're going to dust some rice flour to give it this authentic look it's really a personal choice i love baguette that looks authentic is just a plus and then using your rather blade you're just going to score the top of the dough but this might get stuck so you just have to be very quick and do like small cuts don't try to spend too much time on each cut check check check check check check and so on so you might be interested um to know what's happening inside the oven so the starches are going to gelatinize the sugars are going to caramelize and the proteins are going to coagulate so i'm parbaking those baguettes for 11 minutes if you want to cook them longer and cook them through to be ready for your meal right away i would cook it for 18-20 minutes now one of the first mistake you do as soon as the bread comes out of the oven is you just want to open it don't just don't be patient again you've been patient already so much don't ruin it last minute you know why because you still have a lot of moisture inside your bread and you want by cooling it down allow this moisture to just evaporate so now we're going to do is we're doing another type of baguette exactly the same way by spraying water but i didn't spread i didn't dust any flour on it this is why you have a bit more bare look so it's ready to show you the two differences it's really a personal preference here i prefer the authentic look with the flower that really looks almost like a bakery once it's cooled down put it in in a ziploc bag you need a baguette you just take it out of the freezer place it into the oven cold oven 225 degrees for about 11 to 15 minutes depending on how golden you want the bread to be and that's it you can eat so as you can see here the dough is higher ready that's why you have a lot of tiny bubbles you can serve it with butter or simply with a soup it's really up to you or even a chocolate has not spread i really encourage you to try this recipe it's just amazing it doesn't mean you're not going to go back to a bakery again but you can definitely give it a try and eat your own baguette thank you bye", "5NEvO2ok-NU": "hi my name is Alison Erie kraler and today we're going to make mini baguettes now I like to make mini Bega's because it gives you many more chances to perfect your technique and also they're much easier to handle so to make the baguettes you start with you need some flour to dust your work surface your portioned baguette dough and I like to keep a scraper on hand in case my dough sticks to my work surface now hmm I make a little line of flour on my work surface this is to dredge the tops of the baguettes once they're formed and then I very lightly flour my work surface here I have my baking tray and a towel it's important to use a non fuzzy towel and I've just floured it and here I've already formed two baguettes and it has a little fold in the towel to keep the baguettes separate well they rise for the second time which is called proofing to form a baguette if it sticks at all you just use your scraper to divide it you take your portion piece of dough and put it top side down on your work surface and you just press it into a rectangle it's roughly a third of an inch thick now to form your baguette you take one long side of the dough and you fold it into the middle and using two hands one to fold and one to press you press the seam all the way down to your work surface and then you repeat this with the second now if your fingers stick like this just dip them lightly in the flour brush it off and continue you don't need very much flicker now you continue to fold and press until your baguettes about 11 to 12 inches long and that'll take five to six folds now if your baguette sticks to the work surface you can use your scraper to loosen it and then you can just run it around the work surface continue to fold and press which just elongate the shape of the bed so I've for my baguette and it's um it's 11 inches long and the next step is to dredge the top which is currently down you have your seam side up in the flying of flour and then you flip it over and lay it on your prepared towel floured side up and make another little fold to separate it from the next baguette once you've shaped all your baguettes cover them with a clean non fuzzy towel and set them aside to rise until they're about doubled in size it'll take about an hour to an hour and a half", "vjuagPNaxtg": "hey how's it going guys Phil here and this is a review for the Hamato French baguette pan this is the baguette pan it is made of carbon steel alloy and has a nonstick coating the pan measures 15 inches by 13 inches and 1 inch tall it has 4 wells that measures 3 inches across so you can make four buckets at a time the small perforations in the pan allow moisture to escape so the loaves brown and crisp evenly this will give you the light airy interior and a crunchy crust signature - French baguettes so let's try it out I'm going to use a no need dough recipe I'll start with the quarter teaspoon of dry active yeast then add one and a half cups of room-temperature water and give that a little stir next add 1 and 3/4 teaspoon of salt and stir again then add 18 ounces of all-purpose flour slowly incorporate the flour by stirring it with a wooden spoon you'll be surprised how quickly the dough comes together when fully mixed it'll pull away from the bowl and you don't need to over mix cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap and set somewhere warm like a turned off oven for 12 to 16 hours here's what the dough looks like after about 16 hours flour your work surface generously and dust your hands with flour because this dough will be very sticky using a stiff rubber scraper remove the dough from the bowl and place it on your work surface flour the top of the dough and deflate by punching it down now you can divide the dough in half for two large loaves or into quarters four for smaller loaves I'm going to make four small loaves flatten each section of dough into an oval or a rectangle then fold the dough in half lengthwise and press to seal the edge do this a second time now with the seam side down roll the dough into a 15 inch log don't worry if they're not all the same size and shape I've transferred the loaves to the baguette pan and lined it with parchment paper since the dough is pretty slack and I don't want it to get stuck in the pans perforations cover with plastic wrap for one hour and allow to rise next pre-heat your oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit on the bottom rack of your oven fill a tray or cookie sheet with three cups of hot water to create steam in the oven just before putting in the oven use a razor blade to slash the tops of each loaf three to four times then generously spray or brush the tops with warm water bake for 20 to 25 minutes until golden brown on top at the five-minute mark you can remove the parchment paper and sprayed the loaves with water again for a crunchy air crust here are the four finished baguettes this recipe makes for small one and a half inch baguettes or two larger two and a half inch loaves they have a lovely crunchy crust which you can hear when you cut it the inside is light and fluffy although the holes were not as airy as I would have liked so next time I'll do a longer second rise it is super crunchy though and pretty delicious and I think the pan did a nice job helping me make these baguettes I hope you enjoyed this review you can ask me any

making some sourdough baguettes this is a formula which is actually in the professional section of our website but i've adopted it thank goodness for you and i working at home and i think the results are really good so stick around for the video [Music] do [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] do so [Music] so [Music] do [Music] do [Music] okay looks pretty good it's uh the color is good it opened pretty well i really like the texture on the exterior i dusted the koosh the cloth the linen with a little bit of that freshly milled coarse sand or kamut and when it bakes it toasts a little bit and also gives it just this extra added little hit of texture i think it looks pretty good let's see what it looks like inside which is kind of like the true test yeah we're not going to argue with that that's what it should look like this is kind of what we strive for little fingertip size bubbles throughout what that does is it really opens the texture it changes the eating quality so that when you're eating it's almost like lighter it's this like airy pocket held by crumb and a crust on the outside it's it's really what makes baguettes delicious exterior looks really nice and crusty almost like eggshell like like really thin and and crisp [Music] plenty of crust the acidity is really light it's there but it's not like a sourdough it's just sort of a little bit of brightness and a little bit of like extra bready flavor super nutty i need to get some butter yeah so there it is a nice uh crusty sourdough baguette and stick around and we're gonna go through the formula cheers [Music] okay so let's go through this baguette [Music] so before we get into it i wanted to just show you that if you come to the king arthur website and you type baguette in the search window there are a lot of options you don't have to make the formula that i made in the video what i want is mostly for you to just see the methods and techniques that i use which can be applied to many many different types of baguettes so on the website lots of options shapes and sizes different flowers now the recipe that i used is in the professional section so down at the bottom of the page for professional bakers bakery formulas and sourdough baguettes now this is sized for a bakery that's making larger batch sizes it's also with instructions that are for commercial mixers and those things so what i'm interested in are the ingredients the percentages the quantity of pre-fermented flour and maybe dough temperature also also bulk fermentation how much bulk roughly so those are the things that i'm going to sort of take and then i'm going to put them into excel this is where i end up so i brought the percentages over 90 all-purpose 10 percent fresh mold core sand you'll notice in the bakery formula that it has high extraction flour i don't have high extraction and it can be harder to come by so i used some chorus sand which i'm able to get in bulk at the local food co-op whatever but you could also use bagged whole wheat flour i used that at 10 percent i like the core sand because it's really yellow it's actually the cousin of durum which is used to make pasta so it's very yellow and super flavorful ninety percent all-purpose ten percent fresh milled coruscant 73 water the 73 water could go up a little bit just depends on how thirsty mostly how thirsty this fresh milk core sand is or the whole wheat flour that you use is and for that ten percent you could use a lot of different things you could use medium rye you could use whole rye you could use spelt you could use um just about any type of whole grain flour that's going to add flavor so 73 and like i said could go up or down depending on how thirsty your flour is 2 salt a little bit of sourdough culture and a small amount of yeast you know some people are going to quibble about it's a sourdough baguette you can't add yeast no you can it's okay there's yeast in the sourdough culture sourdough culture has yeast in it it's a symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast so adding a little bit of commercial yeast is not going to hurt anything it's only only going to help ensure that things ferment at a steady rate it's okay don't be too uptight about that so total formula is here my batch is five baguettes at 300 grams for a total of 1500 grams so you'll see some of all parts right here 1500 grams it has a liquid le van and that's 15 percent of the pre-fermented flour 15 of the pre-fermented flour a little bit of sourdough culture to get things started we mix that and let it ripen overnight 12 to 15 hours and then it goes into the final mix so let's look at the method so set the preference and then the mix is mix flower salt yeast which is optional you don't have to use it if you decide not to use it make sure that you have a nice healthy 11 going and you may need to add a little bit of time to your bulk fermentation you're just going to have to kind of feel your way through that and look for signs of activity so i mixed to combine i'm hoping for 74 75 degrees fahrenheit if you've got a cold house you're going to want to watch that bulk fermentation because if you get a 74 or 75 and the room is 62 by the end of bulk you may have a dough that's only 65 degrees or cooler so you want to make sure that you leave it in a warm place and don't let it lose too much temperature or you're going to need to extend bulk a little bit okay i was able to do three hours of bulk fermentation and i just did three folds i say three to four here um trying to find the balance between developing strength and not having too much strength and in this case i only ended up needing three folds i needed three folds only i did try it with four and the structure wasn't as good it wasn't as open and so i went back to three and i got a better result you may find in your house with your hands and your flower and your activity level of your 11 that you may go up to four it's okay so after three hours i divided and pre-shaped the cylinders and then rest for about 15 minutes until they felt like they would be extensible and then shape and at the shaping you'll see me roll it through some of the freshly milled chorus and i really like that texture on the outside and i mentioned it in the video it adds flavor it adds beauty it adds texture it's all the things that i want and then i baked after about an hour so actually a quick tip here so i allowed the doughs to rise for about an hour and then i put them into the fridge for about 15 minutes or so just to cool them down and it helps to make them score more easily if they're a little bit cool so i gave them a little bit of time in the fridge right before baking and that's a good tip for baguettes and for some other things too so those went into a 500 degree oven for about 20 25 minutes depending on you know your oven and always with steam always always with steam so that's pretty much it sourdough baguettes you don't have to do this one you can do the formula that is on the website my hope like i said is that you can use the methods that i showed you on the video like how i shape how i divide how i shape the cylinders before shaping how i score that you can use those techniques and apply them to many of the baguettes on the website baguettes are about as hard as it gets for bread at home so be patient with yourself keep practicing and i wish you lots of luck and delicious crisp crusty flavorful [Music] baguettes [Music] you", "rydVDNbtzzU": "when it comes to making baguettes with a light and airy crumb there are two major things to keep in mind the first being to create a strong dough with as much extensibility as possible and to be very gentle with the dough throughout the entire process so that's the philosophy I applied with this recipe and you'll see how those principles apply along the way now a quick disclaimer this is a relatively advanced recipe so if you've never made sourdough before I'd recommend starting with my basic sourdough bread recipe which I'll link in the description below and for this one I'm gonna assume that you already understand the basic principles of bread making so I'm not gonna explain every step in depth but I will still talk through the reasoning behind the decisions that I made so let's get into it [Music] if you're new here my name is Charlie and on this channel I show you how to create delicious food using simple ingredients and techniques so that you can become a more confident home cook so let's make some baguettes so as usual with sourdough bread the first thing we'll need to do is mix the levan in this case I'm mixing 30 grams of mature starter with 100 grams of flour and 100 grams of room-temperature water for the flour I'm using my usual blend of 50% whole wheat flour and 50% all-purpose flour but you can really use whatever type of flour you want personally I do like to include the whole-wheat though because the rest of the recipe will consist entirely of white bread flour so including a little bit of whole wheat here will just help with the fermentation since it provides a little extra nutrition for the yeast either way you'll just want to let the levan rise until at least doubled in size which for me takes about 10 hours at room temperature but again it all depends on your environment and the types of flour that you're using so I usually let the levan rise overnight but also link my sample baking schedule in the description below so you can see the exact timing that I use so here I am about 10 hours later and my levan has doubled in size so I'm ready to start mixing my dough so get out a large bowl and add 250 grams of room-temperature water at about 70 degrees Fahrenheit which is about 21 degrees Celsius then add 200 grams of your levan which should be pretty much the entire thing considering that some of it will stick to the sides and the bottom of the jar then stir that into the water until it's fully distributed now add 375 grams of unbleached bread flour and stir with the dough whisk and or your hands until all of the flour is fully hydrated like I said we're only using white flour in the stress be in order to make the baguettes as light and airy as possible and to create a mild but very aromatic flavor anyways once the dough is fully mixed we're gonna perform a 45 minute Auto leas which I realize is in a traditional auto lease since it includes the levan but it serves the same purpose we want to perform the auto leaves at about 75 degrees Fahrenheit which is about 24 degrees Celsius so I'm just gonna set my proofing box to that temperature and throw it in there for 45 minutes now after the auto leaf sprinkle eight grams of salt over the top of the dough along with an additional 20 grams of water and fold it into the dough to get it evenly distributed then I like to transfer the dough to a clear rectangular container for the bulk fermentation but you can also just leave it in the same bowl if you prefer so this dough has a total hydration of 78 percent which you can see broken down on the screen this is a bit higher than some baguette recipes call for but the high hydration will create some extra extensibility in the dough which will help us to achieve a really nice open crumb but if you do like a denser crumb or you just want to make the dough easier to work with you can reduce the water content and the recipe and it'll still work fine also keep in mind that all flours are slightly different so feel free to use your own discretion and adjust the water content and the recipe to achieve your desired result now since this dough only contains white flour we're actually gonna perform the bulk fermentation at a relatively lower temperature of 75 degrees Fahrenheit which will allow the dough to ferment more slowly creating some extra flavor and this also gives the gluten in the dough more time to develop which will help the baguettes to maintain their structure while still achieving a nice open crumb so for most you you can probably just leave it at room temperature or if you have a proofing box like me just set that to 75 degrees Fahrenheit I made a tutorial on how to make your own proofing box for relatively cheap which I'll link below for those of you who haven't seen it anyways once the dough is fully mix just throw it in that 75 degree environment for another 30 minutes now for the book fermentation we're gonna perform a total of six sets of folds spaced out at 30 minute intervals so we'll be performing three sets of stretching folds followed by three sets of coil folds so again I'm gonna assume you're already familiar with the folding process and if not feel free to check out my basic sourdough bread recipe for more detailed instructions but basically for each set of stretching folds I perform eight folds along the perimeter of the dough stretching as far as it'll go without tearing and for each set of coil folds I perform or folds lifting the dough up then letting it stretch down under its own weight and folding it back over itself these folds are especially important for baguettes since they're so delicate and they need plenty of gluten development to hold in the gases necessary to achieve an open crumb so once you've finished the six set of folds just place the dough back into your 75 degree environment for another 60 minutes then after that 60 minutes it's time to divide and shape the dough so be sure to coat your surface with a good dusting of flour and turn the dough out with the top side down then divide the dough into two equal pieces and shape each piece into a taut ball using your bench scraper to develop tension I didn't do a great job of dividing evenly here as you can see but if you really want to be exact you could even weigh out the pieces either way go ahead and dust the dough with a bit of extra flour to prevent any sticking then cover it with a kitchen towel and leave it to bench rest for about 25 minutes and after that 25 minutes it's time for the final shaping so one additional piece of equipment you'll need at this point is a sheet like this which is known as a Koosh since baguettes are obviously too long for any type of proofing basket we'll use this instead so you'll place the baguettes between folds and the Koosh and the material will support the sides of the baguette to make sure it rises up rather than rising outward now of course you can also just use a kitchen towel if you have one that's large enough but the nice thing about the couch is that it's made of a very sturdy material so it does a great job of supporting the sides of the loaves so if you plan to make a lot of baguettes I definitely recommend getting one anyway just dust your couch with some flour to prevent any sticking and I like to use rice flour here just as I do with my Banton's when I use those and now we're ready for the actual shaping this is the part of a gap making that takes the most practice when you're first getting started so don't get discouraged if you mess it up the first few times you'll get better eventually it just takes some practice also just keep in mind that you'll only want to make the baguettes as big as your oven can handle so I baked my baguettes on a pizza stone which is about 16 inches long so I'll aim to make them about 14 to 15 inches long to account for a little bit of expansion so I actually like to keep a ruler on my table as I'm shaping them so I can make sure that they're the right size so to shape them start by turning one of your loaves over so the unplowed side is facing up and be sure to dust the flowered side with plenty of flour so it doesn't stick to your surface then gently stretch the top portion and fold it over about three quarters of the way down the loaf then turn the dough around and repeat that same process with the other side remember to be very gentle throughout the entire shaping process to preserve all of the airiness that's developed but you do want to pop any particularly large bubbles that form on the outer surface now little by little grab the dough from the top and stretch it all the way down to develop lots of tension then pinch it down with your fingers to seal it off once you've made it across the entire length of the dough rotate it set the seam side is facing down and gently work the dough back and forth with your hands like so to develop some additional tension as you start to stretch the dough lengthwise after you do that a few times go ahead and start rolling out the dough starting from the middle and gradually tapering out toward the edges try to do this in one smooth motion if possible to avoid handling the dough more than necessary and deflating it then just free up the bag out with your bench scraper making sure no parts of it are still stuck to the surface and gently transfer it to your Koosh creating folds on either side to provide some support then just repeat that process with the second baguette and place it directly next to the first I also like to play some heavy objects on the outside it's like a large book to create some extra support now just cover them up and let them proof for about one to two hours or until they spring back slowly when poked during proofing the dough inflates where the gas is produced by fermentation but meanwhile the gluten network is gradually weakening so the goal is to bake the loaves when they're fully inflated but before they've lost a significant amount of their structure so you can see that at the beginning of proofing when the dough is at its strongest it springs back right away but as the gluten structure gradually breaks down the dough springs back slower and slower until you get to this point which is the perfect level of proofing if it doesn't spring back at all that means it's over proved so just make a note to use a shorter proof next time but of course you can still bake the loaf in that case it just may not rise to its maximum potential so the proofing time will be highly dependent on your environment but for reference my room temperature was about 75 degrees Fahrenheit or 24 degrees Celsius and I proofed the loaves for an hour and 15 minutes this time and about 30 minutes into the proof you'll want to start preheating your oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit which is about 260 degrees Celsius to get it as hot as possible before baking now like I mentioned I bake my baguettes on a pizza stone and I highly recommend that you do the same because the stones ability to retain heat is gonna help the baguettes to cook all the way through and get nice and crispy on the outside but even more important and that is to create steam in your oven during the first few minutes of baking obviously these baguettes won't fit in a Dutch oven so we'll need to use a different method which involves using a cast-iron pan filled with lava rocks or pebbles along with the disposable pie pan and some ice basically before you pre-heat your oven you'll want to place the baking stone on the top rack then on the bottom rack place your cast-iron pan filled with lava rocks then take your disposable pie pan and poke a few holes in the bottom and right before you bake the bread place two cups of ice into the pie pan and set it on top of the lava rocks so this way the ice will slowly melt causing water to drip down into the hot pan and since the lava rocks are slightly porous they'll help to slow the release of steam even further so once your baguettes are fully proofed and ready to bake get out a flat baking tray or pizza peel and line it with a piece of parchment paper then very gently transfer your baguettes onto that sheet i'd highly recommend using some sort of transfer board for this which could be as simple as a cutting board or sturdy piece of cardboard like I'm using here so just gently flip the baguettes one at a time onto the board then flip them back over onto the baking sheet now you'll need to work quickly here to prevent the dough from flattening out so fill your pie pan with the ice and throw it into the oven then score your loaves for baguettes of the size I'd recommend making two slashes along the length of the loaf not straight across but just at a slight angle also make sure not to score too close to the edges and don't score too deep either you only want to go about a quarter inch down finally to achieve a nice ear on your loaves you'll want to score at an angle to the surface of the loaves about 30 to 45 degrees from parallel and it's especially important for our baguettes to use a very sharp razor when scoring it seems like a lot to think about but it'll become second nature once you do it enough times anyways as soon as those are scored head over to your oven and slide the loaves off onto your pizza stone and the parchment paper should make this really simple if you worked fast enough there shouldn't be much steam generated yet so quickly close your oven and reduce the temperature to 450 degrees Fahrenheit which is about 230 degrees Celsius and after another 30 seconds to a minute you should see a significant amount of steam start to pour out of the oven then after the loaves have been in the oven for 15 minutes remove the cast iron pan to prevent any more steam from being generated which will allow the crust to become browned and crispy now the remaining cooking time will depend on your preferences so just keep your loves in the oven until they're brown to your liking about another 8 to 15 minutes I also like to rotate them after about 7 minutes to make sure that all sides cook evenly this time I left him in for ten minutes which was just about perfect for my preferences then once they're done remove them to a wire rack and let them cool for at least an hour before cutting into them to make sure the inside is completely cooked and that's all there is to it I know it's not the most simple recipe but if you made basic loaves of sourdough bread before the process really is pretty similar with just a few minor adjustments so now that you know how to make baguettes if you want to learn how to make some other delicious baked goods be sure to click the playlist on the bottom right corner of the screen so there you go I'll see you all in the next one", "HT3-T_xEqlI": "hi it's Katie from Katie cooks and crafts and today I'm making pretzel rolls these are really fun and delicious and it's also part of a bread collaboration so be sure to check out the other videos in this collaboration Alison and mommy land is making kaiser rolls and Margaret Beeler is making pita bread so that's three new bread recipes for you this week and two new great channels to check out I'll put all the links in the description box to make the pretzel rolls I'm going to start with one and a half cups of warm water and to that I'm going to add two and a quarter teaspoons of active dry yeast that's the same amount that comes in the little packets if you're going to use the packets and my yeast is fine so I don't bother proofing it but if you're not sure about your yeast go ahead and proof it to that I'm going to add one tablespoon of sugar and two teaspoons of salt next I'm going to start adding the flour all together I'm going to add four and a half to five cups of flour but I'm just going to start with the first two cups and I almost forgot it in the microwave but make sure you're adding two ounces of melted butter or margarine once I have that all in the bowl I'm going to just stir it up and give it a quick mix just making sure the salt and the sugar and the yeast is getting dissolved and evenly distributed and you're going to have a really wet runny batter I'm just going to add the rest of the flour a little bit at a time so add a little flour and mix it in completely then add a little more flour and mix it again soon your wet runny batter will turn into a proper dough and at some point I'm going to abandon the spatula and just use my hands and I'm going to knead this by hand for eight to ten minutes or until it's smooth and elastic now this dough is dense and sticky so even after ten minutes of kneading it's still a little bit sticky and it's not going to spring back the way a lot of bread dough's will but as long as it's smooth and elastic it'll be fine if you're not sure you can always call in an expert for a second opinion she said the dough is fine so I'm going to go ahead and move it into a clean container and I'm gonna oil my dough ball and that's just going to keep it from the surface from drying out so you don't get little or dried out bits in your dough so I'm just going to drizzle the top of the dough ball with a little bit of canola oil and then just toss the dough ball around just to smear that oil all over the surface of the dough and I'm going to put this in my microwave to rise I've showed this before but I just microwave a little cup of water till it boils and steams and then I will put the dough in with that cup of water and I don't turn the microwave on I just let it sit in that hot steamy environment and then as little as an hour later it is nicely risen just like that and I'm going to turn this out onto my countertop and a lot of times bread recipes will tell you to turn your dough out onto a floured surface and flour your hands but this dough is pretty sticky so it's really easy to add too much flour to it so instead of flouring my hands I'm just going to add a couple drops of oil to my hands and that will keep it from sticking I'm dividing the dough up into 9 equal portions and I'm going to go ahead and start to form them into the roll shape I'm going to start with sort of a hamburger bun shape and I'm just making a round disc and then I'm taking and pulling from the top and pulling it underneath itself and sort of pinching it if you watched my whole-wheat hamburger bun recipe video it's the same concept just pulling a nice taut top nice smooth top top and pulling it underneath of itself and pinching it the only difference between this recipe and that recipe is this dough is softer and stickier so you just have to handle it a little bit more gently but this kind of roll is really great for hamburgers or any kind of sandwich really ham makes a really good sandwich on these pretzel rolls like a ham and cheese sandwich really good so I'm going to make four of that shape roll and with the rest of the dough balls I'm going to make sort of long skinny rolls more like hotdog bun shape but it's the same concept just pulling the dough from the top pulling it underneath itself and sort of pinching along that seam and these are great for hot dogs bratwurst or Italian sausages or just about anything that looks like that and each of these dough balls is about a hundred grams of dough and I measured them with my kitchen scale I think that's a good amount because these are sort of dense and chewy just like a good soft pretzel you don't want a lot of bread in your sandwich so you want a nice bread to filling ratio and I think 100 grams is right on for that but you can play around with it make them larger or smaller or you could just make a few rolls and with the leftover dough just roll them out into long snakes and twist them up and just follow the rest of the directions and turn them into soft pretzels so once all of my rolls are shaped like that we're going to move over to the stove top to make an alkaline bath and that's just a scary term that means baking soda and water so that's eight cups of water and half a cup of baking soda and make sure you add your baking soda before the water heats or else it will boil up and sputter and make a big mess so just add the baking soda and start to dissolve then bring it up to a gentle simmer and one by one you're going to dunk your rolls in this baking soda water bath so just turn them around submerge them splash the water up over the soft top so that all of the surfaces come in contact with that alkaline bath and you're going to let them sit in that hot water for about thirty seconds each then just move them to your cookie sheet and give them some superficial little slits there it's really about sixteenth of an inch or less just really superficial slits and those are mostly just decorative then I'm going to brush it with an egg wash that's one egg and one tablespoon of water beaten together and just brush that all over all of the exposed surfaces to get a nice browning whenever we bake these and a final optional step is to sprinkle them with a little bit of pretzel salt for the other shape of the roll it's the same procedure so we're going to put them in the water bath then give them a slit this time just a simple Exce egg wash all over the exposed surface and then finally a sprinkle of pretzel salt and really I just put a little bit of pretzel salt to make them look cool you really don't need the extra salt most fillings you're going to put in these rolls are salty enough so I just put just a little bit to make them look like pretzels then they're going to go into a really hot oven that's 450 degrees for about 12 to 15 minutes and you want to get them a nice deep mahogany Brown all over so you're going to want to rotate your pans halfway through I have a convection oven and I still find it necessary to rotate the pans you can see how much Brown are the ones on the top rack are then the bottom rack so halfway through rotate your pans and then just let them Brown until they're golden brown and delicious now that baking soda water bath does kind of make a mess on your stovetop but it wipes up really easily with just a damp rag when the rolls come out of the oven they look like this beautiful and you're going to want to let them cool completely before you slice them open and fill them with all of your delicious fillings or if you're making these as soft pretzels you can eat them right out of the oven they are delicious when they're freshly baked so I'll go ahead and slice one of these open so you can see what it looks like nice and chewy and dense and perfect so that's all I have for you today I hope you liked this recipe I'd love for you to give my video a thumbs up and I'd love for you to check out the other recipes in this collaboration you won't be disappointed go over check out their channels and their videos tell them I said hi and we'll see you next time guys thanks for watching Oh", "-p9DMWl0qrU": "hey guys this is george from fermented kitchen and this is our sourdough baguette recipe there are two ways to shape it one is this one that you're seeing right here so kind of long thin and crispy or you can create a baguette and ciabatta hybrid that you are seeing right now as you can see this has got it's quite um puffy and kind of reminiscent of what you'd expect in a ciabatta but in the shape of a large baguette either way this is a one of our favorite recipes so let's get right into it you'll need 325 grams of plain white flour 175 grams of bread flour 10 grams of salt 100 grams of active starter and 360 grams of water [Music] [Music] we will do three sets of stretch and fold wet your hands so the dough doesn't stick to you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] four and a half hours it has risen maybe about fifty percent there's clear signs of fermentation lots of bubbles so let's go ahead [Music] we're going to split this dough in four pieces to make four baguettes the total weight of the dough is 970 grams so we need to split it by four pieces of 242 grams each you can do it by eye or you can use the scales next we're going to roll them up into logs and put them on a floured surface burst any bubbles as well [Music] we're now going to rest it for few minutes as we prepare the proving cloth place your proving cloth on a baking sheet or a cutting board use combination of rice flour and bread flour and dust it generously we are using some sort of a tray because at the at the end of the the proof we're going to put this in the fridge for about half an hour so that's why it just makes it easier to transport to shape your baguettes gently flour the surface with normal bread flour and with the smooth side facing down like that we're going to first fold in the top and bottom into itself so you can start from the sides and then from top and bottom and then we're going to grab the dough from the top and pull it all the way over and tie it here at the bottom like so push it down then flip it over onto the seam make sure the dough is distributed nicely shake it out then we're going to move it over to our dusted cloth i'm going to use this cutting board and place it here just to make sure that it keeps the shape and doesn't run away cover it with lightly oiled cling film and a kitchen towel we'll prove it for at least two and a half hours maybe three hours after which we'll put it in the fridge for 30 minutes as we preheat the oven it's been almost three hours as you can see it's nice and puffy we're now going to put these in a fridge while we preheat the oven the baguette doughs are going to be in the fridge for 30 minutes while we heat up the oven at max we chill the dough so it maintains its shape and it also will give us a much better oven spring i also highly recommend using a baking steel like this one it's like a six kilo stainless steel that's been seasoned so this will get really hot when it's inside the oven when it's preheated and it will make sure that you get a really nice oven spring and it also will make sure that the bottom of baguettes is nice and crispy you can just use a normal oven tray but you may find that the bottom is a bit soggy and you might need to flip them around at the end and bake them for few more minutes but highly highly recommend using a baking steel or a baking stone right 30 minutes is almost up now we're gonna have to transfer the baguettes onto something which we can use to slide off the baguette onto the baking steel i've cut out two baking sheets and i'm going to put it on something like a cutting board a flat surface now i'm gonna use another small cutting board to transfer baguettes onto the baking paper i'm going to use the rice flour and bread flour mix but you can just use normal flour and i'll also try to dust off as much excess flour at the bottom of these baguettes as possible let's do it [Music] we're now going to use the lamb to score the baguettes just three diagonal lines per bucket so i've got a tray full of boiling hot water that we've got at the bottom now i'm going to try to slide these onto the baking steel with a sprayer spray some water in there on top of the baguettes keep it on maximum that's 250 c for 10 minutes [Music] [Music] you", "rTOJ15XKQLk": "Put water in the

"cIdiC_al5YE": "hi I'm Paige welcome back to my kitchen you're watching the next episode of doing it with baby tomorrow we are making baguettes with poolish which means tonight we need to go ahead and prepare our preferment now the preferment is exactly the same as it was last week the only thing is the measurements are a little bit different but the Polish will still be equal parts flour and water now speaking of water I know we touched base on this last week but the recipe doesn't actually say what temperature to have your water at while you're making the poolish I always like to stay on track and refer to the temperature calculations on page 21 in your book these baguettes are going to be a little bit more advanced than the rustic baguettes that we made in the first chapter of this book with all that being said I'm really excited to try this recipe with you guys so let's go ahead and start weighing out the ingredients for our Foolish we're gonna start off by weighing out our all-purpose flour yeast and water we're then gonna add our yeast directly on top of our water and whisk that up until it's nice and bubbly then we'll add our flour directly on top of this mixture now last week I mix this by hand and it was a very very hydrated wet mixture so this week I'm using a rubber spatula and I'm just gonna mix this up until it's really smooth once everything is well mixed I'm gonna go ahead and cover this up with a kitchen towel now if your bowl has a set of lids and you want to cover it with a lid go ahead and do that just make sure to very lightly place the lid on top of your bowl the air bubbles from the Foolish will create a lot of pressure and you don't want your lid flying across the room last week we let this ferment for about 13 hours I'm gonna really push the limits on our poolish this week and let this permit for 16 hours this time when we come back and check on our poolish in the morning it's going to be filled with air bubbles other than that we're all finished up I'm gonna go ahead and enjoy the rest of my night I'll see you guys in the morning hey we're back our poolish has been fermenting for about 16 hours let's go ahead and see what it looks like as you can see it's really bubbly it smells very yeasty and fermented so it's definitely ready for us to go ahead and start making our bread so I'm doing things a little bit differently this week I actually made our poolish in a really really large bowl what I plan to do is add all of our other ingredients for our bread directly on top of the Polish that minimizes dishes that I have to wash later and it just makes everything a little bit easier for me so I'm gonna be doing it that way today with all that being said let's go ahead and start winging out the ingredients for our bread we're gonna start off by laying out our all-purpose flour water salt and yeast so I'm gonna go ahead and add my yeast directly on top of my Polish and then add my water into the same bowl and I'm just gonna jump right in and start kind of swishing this all around with my fingers and just try to get this all dispersed and bubbly now we're going to let this sit for just a couple minutes so that the yeast can activate now we're going to add our flour directly on top of this mixture and the salt on top of the flour we're just going to jump right in and start mixing our dough by hand just make sure that you're squeezing it scraping all of the dry ingredients off the sides of the bowl and just really trying to get all of the dry ingredients well combined now I think a common theme among new Baker's is not mixing your dough well enough if you're mixing and you pull your dough up and it just breaks right off that means that it needs a little bit more time mixing so just continue to mix the dough well until you can get it really really stretchy like this we're gonna let this rest for about 40 minutes so that the flour can absorb some of that water all right it's been about 40 minutes our dough is done resting we're gonna go ahead and start kneading it now if you guys watched last week you remember that this dough is very very hydrated so I'm adding a little bit more flour than usual to my counter tops today I'm gonna start off by turning my dough out of the bowl onto a floured counter top and I'll just use my dough scraper to release the dough from the bowl I'm also going to add a little bit more flour to my dough and you guys know the drill when we start kneading all we're gonna do is push the dough forward with the heel of our hand pull the dough back give it a quarter turn forward back turn board back turn we're gonna continue doing this for about five to ten minutes until the dough has tightened up and it's not as slack now I did cut the recipe in half today if you watched last week you know that I was dealing with an incredibly large amount of dough very difficult to knead I'm not looking to make as many baguettes as this recipe makes today so I did cut it in half and that is going to make an eating mesto way easier for me so as you can see I'm just continuing to just push the dough forward pull it back and just give it a quarter turn all in one motion now I like to avoid adding too much flour when I need I feel like it really dries out my dough and it affects the final outcome of my bread so if it's super sticky like this if you're a new Baker just try not to get intimidated by this I know that's really hard to do especially when the dough was getting stuck to your hands like crazy it's just kind of a weird and uncomfortable feeling but as you continue to bake you will kind of get over that now my method for meeting it may not be what every other Baker does but I like to knead it until I really just can't need it anymore it's just really flat it's really stuck to my countertops and then I will use my dough scraper to release this from the counter just kind of scoot it over a little bit REE flour my counter tops little by little and just start all over again you can probably tell our dowith started to tighten up it's definitely not a slack as it was when we first started meeting it so what that means it is almost done being needed I mean I need this for another minute or so and we'll be done now that our dough is done being needed I'm going to go ahead and pop this back into the bowl we're gonna let this rise for two hours and we'll come back into a set of folds at the 1 hour mark so I'll come back and check in with you guys then our dough has been rising for about an hour and here is what it looks like we're gonna go around the dough and give it a set of folds and all we're gonna do to do that is start from one side stretch it and fold it to meet the other side we're gonna go all around the dough doing this we're just gonna go around one time and then we'll continue to let this rise for another hour we're gonna cover this back up with a floured kitchen towel and we'll come back and check this in another hour all right it's been about 2 hours our dough is done rising and here is what it looks like so we're just gonna turn the dough out of the bowl I'm gonna lightly flour my countertops very lightly and get this divided I like to start off by getting it all into one sort of uniform rectangle shape and make cuts from there we're gonna go ahead and divide our dough into probably four to six equal pieces now I personally am terrible at getting these all the same size especially when I'm trying to cut them into each pieces just try to do the best you can we'll see how this goes as anticipated my dough is all cut into different sizes but we're gonna go ahead and let these rest for about 30 minutes on the countertop just like this and we'll come back and get them shaped now before we get our dough shaped and tip against I want to briefly talk about shaping baguettes are a little bit more advanced this is not something that we've covered in the previous recipes no I've tried this recipe about three times and I still haven't nailed the baguette shaping I'm gonna try the best I can today to demonstrate this for you guys if this is your first time doing the recipe just try not to be super hard on yourself just try to look at any mistakes that you might make as a learning experience for next time alright it's been about 30 minutes our dough is done resting it's time to get these shaped into baguettes so I'm gonna clear up my workspace really quickly I'm just gonna kind of scoot these over a little bit and we'll get started alright I'm gonna add a little bit of flour to my counter tops because your dough's gonna be a little bit sticky I'm gonna take one of our pieces of dough here turn it over so the sticky sticky side is up facing us we're gonna start with some letter folds we're going to take the far side form I press this down to meet the middle the side closest to us and do the same thing use the heel of your hand to seal this scene we'll do the same thing from this side if you need to start from one side work your way down you can also do that again feel that theme we're going to do this one more time so now we're gonna roll this out a little bit add a little bit more flour to your hands if you need to we're going to start in the middle gonna add a little bit of pressure towards the middle of the dough and work that out now as you get towards the end you can taper these kind of make them a little bit pointed if that's kind of what you're going for something like that now if they get done with each of these I'm going to transfer them over to a piece of parchment paper so again you're gonna start doing letter folds for both sides so bar the side for me close the side to me seal the seam can even pinch this you need to and then the rest of the letter folds are only going to be from this farthest side so we'll do two more I'm going to do one more fold and then another fold and then one last time start in the middle add a little bit of pressure just kind of roll these out make the ends as tapered as you'd like them to while our dough is proofing I just want to talk about how I'm proofing these a little bit differently than how the book says to do it the book says to proof these on a floured kitchen towel with creases in between each baguette I'm not going to be doing that method today because I don't have a pizza peel to transfer the baguettes into the hot oven I have found from doing this recipe a few times that letting them proof directly on the parchment paper and transferring these over to a preheated baking sheet has worked just as well so I'll be doing it like that today while our dough is proofing I am gonna go ahead and preheat my oven we're gonna cook these very similarly to the focaccia that we made a few months ago we're gonna start off by putting a roasting pan inside of the oven that has about an inch of water in it and we're gonna let that preheat with the oven I'll also preheat a baking sheet on the top rack when our dough is done proofing we'll just easily slide that parchment paper with the baguettes on it onto the hot baking sheet and let these bake our dough is done proofing in our oven is done preheating so we're gonna go ahead and score our baguettes so I'm just gonna hold my mom at a 30-degree angle for my dough and just slice these about three or four times I took my baking sheet out of the oven I'm gonna go ahead and just slide this parchment paper really really gently over to the baking sheet we're gonna pop this in the oven and bake this with the roasting pan inside for about 10 minutes and then we'll remove the roasting pan and bake these for an additional 10 to 15 minutes so we'll come back and check them in all right our baguettes have been cooling on a wire rack for about 30 minutes I'm so excited to try these it smells so good in here so let's go ahead and do a taste test so the baguettes turned out so good as crazy as it sounds I really think that three extra hours of fermentation time that we did this week really improved the flavor I'm also trying to decide which baguette is my favorite they're all shaped a little bit differently but I think overall I like the skinniest one the best I think my husband is saying that this one is his favorite but I think it's this one oh the other one you may redo it I live my husband says this one's its favorite even way they all turned out super good and I hope you guys enjoyed this video really quickly my dog is a really freaking out because the bread is done we're gonna give her a taste test because she's losing it this is Dutch she loves bread I don't know what got my hands full with that one now be sure to tune in next week because we are making a bride with a big ax which is a different kind of pre ferment very similar to foolish I'm super excited to try that recipe with you guys because it's been a while since I've tried it if you like this video be sure to give it a thumbs up be sure to subscribe and thanks again for watching and doing it with PG I'll see you guys next time", "na44gfgryeE": "this baguette is alight with a crusty exterior and a very tasty soft and chewy interior a simple long thin crusty loaf of bread the baguette is traditionally made with only four ingredients flour water salt to taste and yeast as a leavening agent today I'm so happy to share with you this easy method of making this beautiful French baguette in your own home kitchen you after 2 hours the dough has risen well and let's keep the dough in refrigerator and now the first part of making a packet as done let's do baking the next day keeping the dough in refrigerator well slow down the fermentation process which will enhance the gluten formation as this is and no need a bread recipe and also this will import loads of favorite object and also it will make it easy for us to handle the dough now after one day take the dough out of the fridge and scrape down the sides of the bowel and turn it on to a lightly floured work surface and this dough is sufficient to make 5 packets of 250 grams baguettes are best when they are fresh out of the oven and so here I'm baking 3 of them today and keep the rest of the dough in the refrigerator to use later you now after 45 minutes take out the dough ball gently pad on the surface of the dough and fall down the top part from the sides and from the center and fold it again to create a tensive outer surface and use the heel of your hand to seal the edges if you feel comfortable you can rotate the loaf and again fold it from the top side down and then seal sprinkle the work surface and the loaf with enough love to make sure the dough doesn't stick to your hands and then use the palm of your hands to gently press and roll the loaf into a long baguette form start with your hands in the middle of the loaf and gradually move them towards outer surface of the baguette as you roll roll until the back at ease as long as your pan and transfer the shaped baguettes to her baguette pan or on to a homemade Coach like this to rise you and the loaves are ready to bake when they look puffy and ballooned it will take about one hour so after the final rising let's transfer this onto a baking tray if you find it difficult to transfer it with your hands you can use a something flat like this this is just a cardboard aligned with an aluminum foil this will help you to transfer those puffy long a dough into a baking tray safely [Music] with the help of a sharp knife or using a blade you can score the top of the ellipse by scoring like this we are creating a weak spot on the surface of the love and thus preventing the love from a bursting a twig points created during shaping now if they are ready to go into the oven bake it at 450 Fahrenheit for 20 to 30 minutes or until they are golden brown in color professional ovens have a provision to create steam inside the oven so to replicate a professional oven as closely as possible place a pan of hot water on the bottom rack of the oven and spray some water on the top of the buckets and inside the oven the steam will create a moist environment which is needed during the initial few minutes of baking and help to get that crispy crackling trust after baking you will get those beautiful golden colored packets which are nice crispy on the outside and with a very tasty soft and chewy Crump inside let stand for the zone - a cooling rack and let them cool down completely before slicing I hope you will try this baguette recipe at home and I'm pretty sure you will love it and I hope you found this easy in no need baguette recipe helpful and if you liked the video please give a thumbs up and please share it with your friends and family and please don't

that i'm not going to use it back into my bowl and this is the 1i enmity use for now when i wrote get a good role here i zoomed in so you can just see what i'm doing here more power sticking and then i'm going to take this one this half of our using her down and i'm going to divide it into three you can see tonight to divide it into three chunks I had chunk that's bigger than the other you can just take something from one and put in the middle of the other like this one looks a little bit big so i can go ahead and trim and stick it right in that of there now what I want to do is make sure that when I fold this I'm folding the sticky part in so I just hold it in like this sticky part in seal it here goes yeah sure count it down and that's my free roll well I'm going to do for this step and I'm going to set it on this wax paper here that's been lightly floured for a resting time just going to sit there I'll get to the next one Afghan what you want to do is just fold in the sticky part like this fold it in seal it off and lay down on that increased side that this part has 26 parts as it was my middle so one of them i'm going to get really flour so it's no longer sticky cut that part really flower than this other sticky edge I'm gonna fold it in just like I did on the other one seal it up roll it so pretty sleepy down there the reason you don't want to really sticky on the edges is because it we'll stick to the wax paper and kind of ruin your your for that you want here so good sure okay it's ready stick it on the wax paper then I take another piece of wax paper and I cover this at here and i could tell on it and then we let this rest for 20 minutes before we roll it out for our Beckett's", "rEpedY__hsM": "I'll explain all that in a second I'm going to go ahead and set up with the toosh and then I'll demonstrate and I don't know if Jesse states exactly like I've learned so he can do a couple and then that everybody should jump in and do it I don't know there was a couple of the Baker's I invited over because I think it's one of the most interesting things it's seeing I got wrong everybody kind of a lot of people just do it different so I told George to come back from essential so when we work together a lot of times we'll just well I guess it's just two people that we both shaped and we do we push your own by got in the middle but if there's like three or four people then many times always have one person who is doing the cushy and everybody's shaping and then kind of tossing them over and one person's put them in so that person gets to be called the couch monkey yeah you can go ahead and open started number two and then here sorry number three and go up to see there's a lot of stuff coming out huh so you have to choose the ones are a little bit more relaxed so anyway as you can see they're already kind of tubes in a way and what I like to just think about is we were just turning it over giving it a light tug right you can even kind of squirt if you want I fold just down to the middle there all my all my hand all my fingers are kind of putting equal pressure I'm not doing the piano I'm kind of doing equal pressure and you can see tension when I push down a rock back and kind of see a stretch right there right so I go get the flower I want come back then I come back over right so and then I go back to equal measurements or go back to square there is going to be a spot in just a few minutes can I throw them in the walk-in and then yeah yeah so what's it yo happens tell her what - okay so once we get to that once you get to this point look how it's even all the way down that's the same mass and all we have to do is then is turn it into a baguette by simply we're folding over so and I kind of stand off to the side because when I push down I want my hand to hit flat you get your if your bone hits you know the bench if you do it here you're having your bone data if you stand off to the side you can kind of you can and I'm just touching on the edge and I'm sealing that down okay so what I've done is I've got a straight seam right there right and so I just just release it from the table and find out where you where you need to where you need to put your pressure and voila you got a straight a straight baguette you go straight down the center and then up we're pushing a seam side up so we're going to come over here so this is you little flower I'm gonna go right inside and remember that they are going to expand by time so we need to make sure that they have just a little bit of space to expand what we do and that's that so again so that we can pick up the speed I know that there's other bakers they're going to come in here and they canned and sometimes they don't they don't seal like that matter of fact if you're if you if we were Jesse and I were shaping and and we had a couple hundred to get through I would probably just I probably end up going down like this I don't like this table I'd probably go down like this and I probably go right down like that and I probably do this and toss it to him so I mean to know if we had to do this definitely like critique this he was showing us a quick wave yeah you do it in today okay thanks the but you know the other watch it to make then you kinda kind of skip that that's enough let's see Jesse Macklin so shooting for exactly what Michael did I just have a different style so I fold this into the center and I actually use the edge of my home for everything and this really is sort of misleading because it's going to look like I'm smashing the bread and I'm not smashing the right we just seal that middle through there flip it around now you got a nice straight edge bring this side back to the middle again I always pick it up in between each stage and just let it be as long as it wants to be and then on the final one seal the edge and then maybe taper the edges a little bit by doing it that way it's already long enough I don't have to stretch it and tear the gluten and you can see all the gas bubbles are still intact I didn't dig a sit at all basically exactly what Michael does except I use my hands a little bit differently so YC side up we're going to flip these and that's just totally a matter of preference some bakeries do them see them down and then they double flip them when we're unloading these with the transfer peel we'll just be pulling them off on there and then set them on the field like that for your motor that's why I like to do them upside down because unloading or moving them from the couch to the loader is so much faster see one more and then you should jump in otherwise behind can we make one then yes thanks to the main things of it I think I have both done is it watching me at every stage baguette is almost equal down right and then it comes down then he folds in half and it still has equal it's still you know it's not like a it's not like it's not like a dog bone right and we're not trying to make it I gotta put the dog bro yeah so many bakers will spend a lot of time stretching and rolling and that's just tearing up your baguette and wasting your time as far as I'm concerned I mean I'll do I'll do one like that so skip everything and then just sit here in in left hand is nice just here in your image him so well face him and he'll do one right Hannah yeah you know it looks nice but you could see that you D gasps that one more I dig a state more and there are more big holes yeah so when you cut into it there's gonna be some ridiculously large holes compared to some flat from right I also like tour it a little bit it's just I'm got got you on camera here so one thing is really we are assignment right not any place oh you did I'm sorry I looked at it it didn't that's tough it's a perfect bag so you kind of tuck it into your and ceiling they want one yeah right on the edge that's pretty good go ahead release it and go ahead and roll it out you have to roll that one a little bit oh really all right that's pretty good so so you don't do too much roll here no no is to get the bag out right at the right time where there's not any rolling really necessary okay you know if you get a relaxed bag at I always go e square it up a little bit try to try to square up I go to the middle right yeah before you do that let's go to help okay George these longer axle early so then I come back to the middle again stretch again I like to just stretch out I don't like to roll the bag out so much always so and see that's equal going down and then then I seal just like so we're a little short right I'm not sure if there's enough yeah it's just it's just in what I would say this does was a little bit strong so record holes tried a bit so mom this is a double vanos trunk but don't run too bad so I don't know if anybody you guys met George today you", "SiVHzrdGx-w": "okay so today we're gonna try and make that gets at home in front of you I have water bread flour whole wheat flour yeast salt malt powder and polish now that foolish is roughly 200 grams there's just equal parts water flour and a pinch of yeast the first thing I'm gonna do is combine all the ingredients together and put it in the stand mixing bowl without the salt what I want to do first is actually pour a little bit of water into the bowl the poolish and scrape the sides now what ends up happening it makes this much easier to release as it's easier to go into stand mixing bowl so you see us floating there you go scrape out the sides just add a little bit more water and do that once more can can see it's released okay so first we're gonna put our pool dish with water into our stand mixing bowl okay add the rest of the water yes a week long bread flour Makar in a stand mixer fitted with a hook attachment I can turn on low speed for 2 to 3 minutes until it comes a saggy mass so after 2 minutes or so you stop the machine it looks it should look something like this and we're just gonna let it sit for about half an hour so after half hour you doesn't make sure you scrape down the sides a little bit we're going to sprinkle the salt going to increase our speed to medium and then mix for 5 to 7 minutes what you want to do now is check the dough and see if it has developed enough gluten so what you want to do is basically the windowpane tests you want to stretch it I think that's pretty good you name that distress for half hour so after half an hour I just want to a series of stretch and fold submit quit my hands a little bit not pull and stretch it back on itself whole stretch back on itself whole and you're going all four directions like that and then that's it I'm gonna rest for another half hour so after half hour we repeat the same process it's just in full so when you get my hands a little bit wet and reach down pull up push pull over come all four sides this is gonna continue build strength in your dome like that that's it rest for another half hour we're gonna do two more these bolts for a series of four in total and it's gonna go to fridge to call from it between 24 hours to 72 so you can bake between those times [Music] transfer go into a stainless steel bowl wrap it it goes in the fish to coal format for 24 to 72 hours after a cold fermentation to go out of the fridge yeah unwrap it which cannot quickly the gas a little bit and then we want to divide this roughly ah so first we're gonna see how much is on here so roughly 780 grams looking up about 390 she's gonna cover it and let it sit at room temperature for 45 minutes after 45 minutes of resting and divide this into three so roughly a hundred and thirty grams each doesn't have to be exact after 45 minutes arresting and when I shape them into a rounds a little bit of flour flour on top fold in bring all the sides into the center okay here we go stop and then it's going to shape it like that so we are ready to shape our mini baguettes so what we want to do I'm just gonna dust our Baker's block generously with flour so it doesn't stick half an hour is up I'm gonna shape the baguettes this world just wanna have a little bit of flour for dusting I'm gonna flip this like so and then just over a little bit more flour as well up pat it down and stretch it after that and a full up third down now rotate it this way then throw its weight down after that you take your four fingers you're gonna curl the dough under and have your thumb underneath tucked it you're gonna Pat it down and you're gonna continue this from one side to another roll tape same motion what I'd like to do is just kind of pinch the seam as well I think it's crucial yeah and after that we're gonna roll this out just like that hold it wait oh there you go one two and three and I'm gonna put on the biggest clock and it should have seemed sites down this one doesn't have that much flour okay like so and we arrest it for 45 minutes to an hour 45 minutes is up we're gonna transfer these mini baguettes on to HT pen with a piece of parchment I have inverted the sheet pan so it's easier for us to slide through and then what we have is also a cutting board so we can actually transfer so what I want to do is gonna just release this yeah and then I want to lift up as part of this and then flip it over gently transfer it over like so again lift up it's a little bit sticky I should have put more flour on like so and then one more like this that dot and that's very it's a very wet dough so that's why it's kind of like that so you can give it a little bit of final reshaping and we in a school I'm gonna put it in the oven for 15 minutes so what we want to do now is score it and then transfer this into the oven on the baking steel or baking stone at 500 degrees we're gonna bake with this lid on for the first 5 minutes we're gonna take it off and then wait bake for another 12 to 15 minutes I have my plate here I suck at scoring and it's also weird for me to score these baguettes properly I think the baguette knows I can't score properly so", "1ebKpEG0tBM": "hi welcome back to the bread lab today we're going to be showing you some techniques for scoring baguettes we shape these baguettes in a prior video now they've gone through their final proof and we're gonna put them into the oven so we're gonna use alarm to hold our double edge razor blade if you don't have the LOM a popsicle stick whittled down to hold the blade works great that holds it on a little bit of a curve for us and now we'll go to the bread to score so as a righty or a lefty I'm gonna hold towards the back of the LOM that way my blade can glide through the BLET the bread and not jab into the bread so holding towards the back the key is to have a flat blade and your filleting the skin that's going to promote that ear to stand up so with our guideline dividing the bread into thirds you see we're going to try to overlap these cuts we're not scoring across the bread we're still square thing about scoring down the bread so with our blade tilt that wrist back so I can read the top of the blade think about gliding into that skin two three four five okay so more things to think about I like to be eye level with the bread if I can supporting my weight with my other hand tilt that wrist back and then gliding in I'm not tracing a line as much as as thing about pushing into that bread as I score not following a straight line thing but arcing in slightly as I cut okay common mistakes common mistakes that you'll see are starting and stopping a score at the same place starting and stopping at the same place that leaves no room for expansion at this point all the way down another mistake is cutting too far across the bread okay that leaves no room for expansion at these points as well by cutting straight essentially straight down that read that's breaking it in right down the middle allowing it to expand the full length of the bread okay we're going to get these in the oven we're also going to leave one unbaked to see the difference in volume see the effect of these errors as well okay here are baguettes out of the oven first we have our three demos of what we don't want to see in our scoring this is our bread that we scored directly across you can see how that stunted its its expansion here we have the one that we started and stopped the scores that tore at each one of those places into one giant score and then our kind of tight stick that we didn't score so we definitely lose some volume by not scoring and then we have our three properly scored okay we want to see is a straight sides straight size we see that here popping up it just takes a lot of repetition to get those scores even even length sometimes the bread will corkscrew if you're kind of scoring in the staircase manner across the bread but there we have our final our final bake", "l0f3szSBh3U": "[Music] hello and welcome to foodtech 101 now i recently learned how to make french bread amazon french bread for the very first time and it came out incredible better than the dense shop bought and so simple you'd be surprised once i show you how to make this french bread yourself a hole you may never buy it again from the shop stay with me let's go before we get started just give me a quick favor click that subscribe button and hit that little bell icon so you'll be the first to know whenever i upload a new video okay let's get to it for this recipe you will need 500 grams of strong bread flour one teaspoon full of salt two teaspoonfuls of sugar one tablespoon of vinegar one seven gram sachet of active yeast two tablespoons of oil give all the dry ingredients a good mix using a table knife mix in a liquid until it is combined into a dough turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about five to ten minutes [Music] or until the dough is smooth and stretchy and pliable [Music] oil a bowl as this makes it easier for the dough to turn out after it has been proved cover the bowl with cling film and later prove or raise until it has doubled in size dough can also be left to prove in a fridge overnight the extra proving time helps to develop more flavor after the dough is doubled in size turn the dough out onto a floured surface and divide evenly into four equal portions [Music] for more accuracy you could always use a digital scale to make sure each portion is exactly the same weight this stage is called reshaping [Music] [Music] after pre-shaping leave the dough to rest for around 10 minutes this allows the gluten in the dough to settle and will help make shaping the baguettes easier [Music] take one portion of dough and fashion it into a rectangular shape then fold the top part down to about halfway flip it around and repeat [Music] this process is meant to improve the texture of the bread by creating what is referred to as tension in the dough when rolling place your hands in the middle and apply reasonable pressure slowly with your hands towards the side make sure pressure is even as this will help create an even shape to help maintain the shape of your baguettes when proving for the final time professional bakers use a heavy piece of linen called koosh using a sharp blade score the top of your baguettes this helps to create a controlled point at which steam can be released when baking and also helps create the classic baguette pattern placing boiling water in your oven creates steam which helps form a great crust when baking [Music] don't they look good you thought i was kidding didn't you these look absolutely amazing no lie my very first attempt at french bread and wow boom smacked it first time these look awesome [Music] man these things sound crunchy that water that steam in the oven's really giving these things a really crunchy crusty outside that's fantastic let's see what it tastes like [Music] these are nice these are every bit as good as if a professional person made them so there you have it step by step how to make a french baguette i told you it was easier than you might have thought so once again thanks for watching foodtech 101 don't forget to like share

easy it is to make bread from your own from your own kitchen by simple technique I'm going to show you how to mix and world the door my way not the way that you've probably been taught the English Way will you put on the dough and you've got tons of flour everywhere to make it unstick this way is just your ingredient from the recipe there with one kilo flour my salon gram of water my yeast and my sort and which is going to work the dough lifted up the board make it come alive and unstick from from from the board just by incorporating air into it and give it a lot of fluffy nation and a lot of life trying to do that I got my flour working there I put my fresh yeast into my flour and when crumble the yeast in my flour if its freshest it will crumble very very quickly and become tiny tiny particle result and just disappear all nicely and you see you can't see it anymore and if you use dry yeast I do the same as I do with fresh cheese I just make it disappear into the flour I don't mix water with yeast and a bit of sugar for for the Secretary to just cut cut the middleman go straight into it and I put my 20 gram of salt in there ready together make sure you don't mix your yeast and salt too close together that's why Daniel I sing together there it's ready Drive my water into it just show you that I don't put any flour in my board and you put your water into it and I use my magic Spanish plastic scraper to help me to blend and mix all the anger and together and I'll put my hand in there just right now just in case you the fun rate you know blend everything and geez all your water has been absorbed by the flower you can see my hand still pretty clean at that spot tiny bit more water in there use a strong white flower to start with you give you good result for your baking you can see everything your hat tiny drop pick up the rest of the flower bottom weather water because I find it more accurate and if you got a scale it's try to try to do it you just get several milliliter of water and compared with several gram of water you always find a tiny difference it's just more accurate way of wearing your water okay now I've got like a thick sticky porridge in my work everything is coming off the board that's ready to go onto my board and just make you look any flower you can see just here we go okay our first touch is done now got something very wet and sticky and as you will pray would in your in your in a yawn the British method makes making but you put add flour now and ready add more more flour than you need to enter into the recipe which is not part of the recipe so what we try to do now is to make have a lot of air going through so by doing that I'm going to do some very slow motion start with join region where you pick up your dough sing of your hand that's to for coin under your door pick it up pinch it there and snap it a little bit there then you stretch your dough up for it over to trap some air inside every time you do that a lot of air get trapped into it and they pick it up again slap it again do it again stretch it don't worry about stick it to your hand and if it will come off as he goes and keep it working out and the softer you do the easier it is to work that method you can hear or the air get trapped inside you do that until the door will become smooth come off your hand cleanly without any type of flour or oil or any other help the only help you can have is if you struggle it a bit scrap the door with your scrapper that's all right put the second speed on there should slap it down don't you go too fast but just be consistent on your movement I can feel the door become more supple and such a get-together and bounding and becoming alive very quickly your seeds coming up coming of the your working surface see and start to see the doctor for me that at that stage the dough is where worked when you do then tell me the flower put your door upside down like that like so and then fold it onto itself a few times and you end up with nice even if you worked light neither very responsive support that's about 70% of water for 4 for this recipe which is much higher than you would do for probably British bread if you can see the dough just really really alive it's beautiful and that won't let you down it's more hairy but by the way that we work the door trap every movement we're doing we chair inside that's a key of that and then written to the ball to rest there and these you can keep it now for an hour to rest a rigid to be absolutely perfect there okay my dog's been resting now for an hour and tiny bit more shake we're going to do is turn the dough over and there's very lightly floured surface you can see I don't pull the dough down like that because you need disorder or the structure what I do begin with my little scrapper I just help the dough to come down very gently let's lie down you can see with a beautiful strand smell is fantastic just what the family is starting to really really get into your nose make you drunk almost she's a nice piece of dough we're going to do now my next step is before I divide the dough for whatever we go into the recipe is to heat some strands just by very simple folding technique before dividing what I do then is add a bit of flour so you got almost square that you work with your hand just take the top there fold it over there press it gently with your finger over the back of your hair bring this in here so same in the center and do it again like so this technique will be repeated throughout the book quite often it is the backbone of your that scene of the your back spine that's where your strengths will be arrested if you do a French tip if you do anything that is always on the center and you fold it again like that there already you got something much stronger full of life and beautiful that's ready to be divided nice and neatly we just creeper again divide this four scales in here for you jitter some French take for example just try to get nice and neatly nice piece of dough like that divided to 250 put them would like everything if you just do it by hand if you use to it you can judge know your piece of dough roughly or the same samsaya if you're not used to it you might up with a small one a big one and all seal but baking is being consistent always you're what you're doing your patient will be different if it's a big piece and a small piece and just you want everything to look look a bit the same here we go now I've got all my pieces of the nicely divided so the next step again is to give bit more strands into it just give it a little primer Lane let me move that to show you what I mean tiny bit of flour you don't want too much flour at all to set of it if you did more for a round shape or bore what you need to do is to bring your dough into the center again same technique so what I do is bring the dough and show you super slowly and push it in turn it over do it there you can see start to shape there and the strands the backbone is there for in in in and with practice you'll become very quick that then you got your little boy you just tuck it in like that oh nice and you can just finish it off with your own you see the rough be that that's your same what we put the same just tuck it in just beautiful ad so you need it he got something nice and springy a lot of strands if we mold a French take for example again tell you the flower not too much what we do again same technique taught to start with a nice and even little square or rectangle bring your dough the top over fold it press it down like that again with your finger or the back of your hair and you see a genuine strength just say there will be there will become the top of your French stick underneath every time you press down that's where it is then turn it over this way down and do it again on the middle like so then you seal it way that you got the top of your your braid will be there and the seam is there to get more lines left for French stick for example you start again with the seam on the top press it down and repeat the same operation by twisting the dough and following the two edges together there you got this just there what you just did now just to finish it off just get a little roll you lift it up from the the ball a bit sticky just roll it to the final shape like so if you want to be a flower and you can see that the seam is there she's always in control you know where everything is ER and the top of your bed will be there when you put to rest in your tea tower you either pre down this way we don't twist it or of any shape I just keep it nice everything else if you did a loaf for Pat in for it over some as we did earlier and again and again sit there and then you got a little love nice and strong on the top and again your seam is there and I'm going to show you how to finish off your pie yet and what we call the AP little ears cut with a pair of scissors the bread now has been proved for about an hour just under the just on the double in volume he's ready to to be done there a lot of my bread is rested approved on it plated Tower this allow you to to put them next to each other and keep them separated what you don't want to is to put them together and then you're going batch and it'd be very hard to separate them first I'm gonna demonstrate to you the AP by gently I don't be scared the dough is strong it won't deflate or if you're not okay then you put it on the tray big enough to take it if you didn't stick and then you give it a nice cut like so there to your nice ears and that's beautiful bride to put on your table for lunch okay for the French did you get your play on top of a tray or wooden Peter like so and then at what we use in France we use a razor blade like so and what we call a lamb I've got this one since I'm 14 to do that you just get your razor blade and slide the handle into it like so and this would either your pen that's how you sign your bread in France in the bakery every Baker would have a different way of cutting and very often your your birthday Baker we know who will cut the bread just by the way it's being judged it's what we call the signature of the of the Baker like linea okay to do so because it's very sharp you've got to really be quick and assertive what you do it you don't drag the the bread on to it you go very fast at an angle and that's what that will help your bread to develop in over and when the gas expand inside the your of it will burst the way weather cuts out and just give you a nice crust on the top she cut this way like so exactly the next word I'm going to show you is the fou gasps the fugacities the variety to all my bread classes while we just put your smile on your face it's a very striking good looking bread it doesn't ever involve any molding or shaping of the salt you just cut it with your again your friend scrapper maybe the flour and just slide it in your oven on a hot stone and just become beautiful leaf shaped bread to do so very easily flour your work surface quite everyday and again and turn your dough over very very gentle so help you though all the way down we don't you dare fret to defy the dough we want to keep it nice and lively lat you've urgently flour the top also returns you sea salt or the bubble the ever balls come in there it's beautiful though what you want to do for this bread just both get a piece of dough and be firm we cut just in a rough triangle shape like so and then what you do see there's no more link so far with that your edge of your scraper just cut through there without going all the way to the edge and then with a smallest side just cut three nice diagonal cut just add plenty of flour then you just need to open it up it'll be that as simple as that and you will see after a bit of practice and a bit of self-belief or so that you become a great Baker you can really get on with it and make some great buy the home you you", "3Abk2WWuoao": "so somebody told me josh this one's too easy for you gotta do something else but you know it's not always just about winning sometimes it's about making a [Music] [Applause] [Music] point [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so welcome back to but better episode number every single episode i forget so we're making subway meatball sandwiches now let me just quickly point something out here i believe technically if there's meatballs in a sub sandwich it's technically technically a hero so it's a meatball hero the the words meatball sandwich don't really roll off the tongue but when you do it properly in my opinion this is one of the greatest sub sandwiches on the planet so with all that said let's make this shall we i like how whenever you look up subway you're just surrounded by them this person grabs the bread rips it open rips like there's a piece of it like missing left it like that the the meatballs just get like thrown on tears the cheese it throws the cheese on she's like you want to judge it puts it wraps it up and throws it in the bag i mean look at the way it's bent look at the way this is bent bag is so steamy why it's like a swamp eww my hand immediately becomes moist what is that people actually begged me not to do this recipe where's the cut mark is it here or is it here does it happen this is the appetizer nope it tastes like meatballs with hot salsa it is iconic it does taste the same as it always has but but look at this that's not right i think we should show them how it's done let's start with our bread get the bowl of a stand mixer or a regular bowl people are always complaining josh not everyone has a stand mixer yeah okay use your hands pal and add three and a half cups or 500 grams of all-purpose flour do a flip to celebrate not spilling any flour 1 tablespoon or 13 grams of granulated sugar and 2 teaspoons or 5 grams of fine sea salt give that some whiskey bits until thoroughly combined now from here you're going to add 2 tablespoons or 30 grams of room temperature lard bacon fat or shortening obviously bacon fat would 120 slap then using two forks blend that into the flour to get fine little crumbs in there separately you're gonna get one and a quarter cup or 295 milliliters of warm water at around 100 degrees fahrenheit and you're gonna mix in one tablespoon or 10 grams of instant yeast now assuming you know that your yeast is live you don't need to let it sit pop your dough onto your sand mixer with the dough hook attachment begin mixing on medium low speed add your yeasty boys to your flour mixture then just let it do its thing mix that until it forms a nice beautiful dough after that well just let it keep mixing and kneading the dough for about three to five minutes or until it's nice and smooth once you get a smooth chunky little man gently form that into a nice top ball plop it in a lightly greased bowl cover with plastic wrap and let it rise at room temperature for one hour or until doubled this is very basic you guys have heard me say this a billion times now that your little man is all grown up punch him down lightly flour a work surface dump them out and then divide into two equal pieces to shape these you're just going to take an individual piece pull it into a light ball and then begin rolling it into a cylinder slowly working your hands out to get a nice tapered about 12 inch long log place one on a parchment line baking sheet at a diagonal because it's a bit too long you're going to need two different baking sheets obviously drape it with a damp towel and let it proof for about 20 minutes now once that's done take a sharp knife a razor or lame and score it lengthwise at a 45 degree and go all the way across the entire length of the dough optionally you can add a little grating of some parmesan or some grana patano whatever hard nice cheese you like now to bake this you're first gonna get a 10-inch skillet fill it with just about an inch of water bring that to a boil and as soon as it comes to a boil you're gonna open your oven which has been preheated to 400 degrees fahrenheit put in your dough slide your steaming water on a rack underneath your dough close the oven close the door and let it steam bake for eight minutes after that eight minutes is up immediately and quickly remove your steaming pan close the door and let it bake an additional 20 to 25 minutes or until you get a beautiful golden brown sort of sub sandwich bread then let it cool until completely room temp now let's talk about our meatballs i really prefer meatballs with a little bit of pork and a little bit of beef so for the beef i've got one pound of chuck roast here which i have grinding and half a pound of pork boston bud to equal out to one pound of ground beef and half a pound of ground pork obviously you can get it pre-ground but you know you won't be fully flexing if you do once that's ground just knead it a little bit kind of like a dough to get that fat nice and emulsified in a separate bowl whisk together two eggs to completely combine then add a third of cup or twelve grams of grated parmigiano-reggiano one teaspoon or two grams of finely ground fennel seeds one tablespoon of finely chopped fresh oregano leaves three slices of finely chopped broshuto i don't know why i did that optionally a little bit of fresh grated nutmeg mix this together till combined add some fresh ground black pepper and a generous pinch of kosher salt then add three quarters of a cup or 42 grams of panko bread crumbs with a tiny little splash of milk just to help that hydrate then add in your ground meat knead mix until everything is completely homogenized emulsified and beautiful now good meatball mix is almost bouncy right watch me drop this in the bowl and it bounces it's got some buoyant you know what i mean now this next part is pretty straight forward you take your meat and you make balls we don't need to do anything fancy okay just use your hands and cup your balls it's not too hard now if you shape these evenly sized as much as possible you should get around 24 total beautifully round meatballs all right folks we're almost there so start off with a large skillet here i have a 12 inch saute pan fill it up with about three and a half tablespoons of high heat oil set it onto your stove at medium high heat once extremely hot add in your meatballs let them sit and sear for about two to three minutes until you get a beautiful deep brown crust now some people like to sear every single side personally i think two solid good sears is plenty fine but if you want to get every single side that's fine too now when they're done they'll probably still be raw on the inside so it's not really snack time yet okay once you're done searing your balls remove them and set them to the side we get a really simple saucer you're gonna need four ounces or 120 grams of pancetta ideally thick cut and diced reduce the heat to medium and toss that in your pan then just let that saute stirring occasionally until the majority of the fat has rendered out and you got some nice little crispy jewels then add 5 cloves of thinly sliced garlic let that saute for about 20 seconds or until fragrant then add a 28 ounce can of crushed san marzano tomatoes season that lightly with salt and pepper bring that up to a light summer over medium heat add your meatballs back and then let that simmer until the meatballs are completely and totally cooked about 8-10 minutes taste and adjust the salt and pepper levels if you need more now to assemble the sandwich take half of one of your loaves and you're going to cut through the center to open this bad boy up but don't cut all the way through leave that back end piece intact it's the traditional way place it under your broiler for about two to three minutes or until nicely toasted now optionally while that's toasting you can mix together a couple tablespoons of olive oil and a couple grated cloves of garlic maybe some flaky salt in there a little bit of black pepper then when it's done toasting just brush it with that garlicky olive oil that we're really just trying to maximize this sandwich experience but you don't have to do it if you don't want to rot brother the next part is in rock and science get your balls and put them on the bread all right that's the last of those jokes all right i'm sorry that's it's stupid cover with a little bit of the sauce top your meatballs with as much sliced provolone as your heart desires put it back under the broiler just until the cheese is melted like so then add a generous fresh grating of parmigiano-reggiano then finally top this beautiful beast with some finely chiffonaded fresh basil and that is a beautiful meatball sub ah wow just by looking at it oh big meaty balls we got our homemade meatball sub this extends way beyond butt better right the meatball sub could have been a standalone recipe as is oh yeah i can't [Music] put that do you really we won all right obviously we're gonna do a taste test but this is like the crunch you can taste every every little component olive oil garlic got the two different kinds of fresh ground meat prosciutto we got all the herbs got this beautiful tomato sauce wow sorry okay so sandwich number one sandwich number two my vote is sandwich number one i like the first sandwich which one so why why do you like number one more i liked the crunch of it i thought there was more flavors that were going on happening and then sandwich number two just tasted literally tastes like anything this one is just like a higher quality sandwich this one left a bad taste in my mouth i'm excited for people to try this at home like and make it i don't do it justice but do you want to know what else will take you to a delicious meaty land b-roll all right guys and that is it so we made subway meatball sandwiches more specifically we really just made a meatball sandwich i don't know i don't even want to compare this to a subway meatball sandwich all right that's it's it's in a different galaxy it's not even in the same fabric of reality to me this is a perfect testament of attention to detail and making sure every single layer is attended to and loved and cared and kissed so one quick thing that i wanted to mention uh we we haven't had one of these talks in a while it's been so busy um i'm getting out of a bit of a whirlwind from work and i've been thinking about this really crazy project i've been working on i know a lot of people have been asking about aprons a lot of you now i was considering releasing them the other apron with the smiley face again i'm not really sure if i'm gonna do that because we're working on a very very special secret project nobody knows about but long story short i'm making something that is never existed before i don't want to get too much in the conversation about it because it's supposed to be a secret right now but it's a big deal it is a big deal and we have a huge team of people working on it and that's all i have to say you might want to wait for that but anyway with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time my voice cracked apparently i'm 12. [Music]", "9dCcTK7oJLA": "this ciabatta bread is one of the easiest breads that we can make at home to make this bread we'll need only four basic ingredients and we don't need any special equipments to make this bread and I tried to simplify this recipe in such a way that we don't even need a proofing canvas which we usually don't have at home and the process of making this bread is so relaxing and satisfying and the resulting bread is a circle with that crispy crust and with that light and airy soft crumb inside all that we make use in this recipe is a good technique and some time so let's see how to make this rustic artists and ciabatta bread in our own home kitchen [Music] say let's start by preparing our bread dough into a bowl add in the water he refused lukewarm water which is not called in our heart but just slightly warm then add in salt and yeast and mix until they get the salt and then add the flour and combine everything together here I'm using the very end of this pudding spoon to mix them together and that's it our bread dough is now ready so if we need to prove our bread dough for two hours so wrap it with a plastic film and keep it in a warm environment or on the countertop usually to give more structure to our bread dough we need to knead the dough but as this is a high hydration dough we can't knead the dough by hands but during this proofing time we are going to do a magic which will transform our dough into a well-structured dough so we are going to stretch and fold the dough in every half an hour which is so satisfying to do so it's been half an hour and we are going to stretch and fold the dough to align the gluten strands and now we can see if we touch the dough it's too sticky to handle but here we have a simple trick when our hands are wet the dough won't stick to your hands and it will make it easy for us to handle the dough say don't forget to dip your hands in water before we do this stretch and fold so stretch the dough and fold it onto itself and turn the ball 90 degree and repeat the same on all the four sides and you may see the dough may tear at some parts but that's ok it's because the gluten strands are not developed [Music] here I'm doing the same steps once again so that we are doing double folding in this first round [Music] and now cover it with a plastic film and keep it in a warm environment or on the countertop so it's been another half an hour and you can see our tool has risen slightly and that Luton stands are now more uniform and more aligned and now we are going to stretch and fold it once again so we did our second round folding let's wrap it again and leave it on the counter or in a warm environment for another half an hour and now it's the third folding or the final folding [Music] and now it's been another half an hour and a duel has risen well and now let's transfer this duel on to a well floured work surface and remember until is still very sticky and at this point to prevent it from sticking to the surface we need to test the work surface generously with flour and again just the top of the dough with some more flour and now we need to stretch the dough from underneath and shape it into a rectangle and we need to take care no to deflate the air pockets completely and it's totally ok if we happen to dig yes a few air pockets here and there [Music] and now we need to roll it just as we've all had jelly roll and pinch the edges to seal and now divide the dough into three equal parts and transfer each portion into another well floured work surface we need to give enough space between each dough as it will expand during this time and dust the top of the dough with some more flour so that it will not stick to the cling film and now we need to prove our shaped dough for 45 minutes which is the final proofing and after the final proof in our dough has risen well and let stands with its own to a parchment paper [Music] and while transferring this dough gently stretch the dough to make it an elongated rectangular shape and now our dough is ready to go into the oven so carefully slide the parchment paper with the loaves on to the preheated baking stone if we have one or we can also use an inverted baking tray and just as after in here and immediately spray with some water and close the oven door and bake it for 50 fan high preheated oven for 10 minutes and then reduce the temperature to 400 Fahrenheit and bake for another 12 to 15 minutes [Music] and after baking will get beautiful ciabatta bread which is a golden brown in color with that crispy crunchy crust and with that crumb which is super soft full of air pockets and the bread is ultra light and airy and it's so good to slice them and to help them with some plain extra-virgin olive oil or to slice horizontally and to make a sandwich and whichever way you decide to enjoy the bread I'm sure you will love the texture and flavor of this bread and I hope you will make this at home and I hope you will not only enjoy the delicious bread but also the process of making it and if you like this video please give your valuable thumbs up and please write to me your valuable comments and please

[Music] [Music] [Music] you", "9d6gXUr9n2Q": "seventy-five and want to be really careful with this pile of goop because the first few go flying all over the kitchen until about 100 hundred French folds a five minute rest and another hundred French folds and then the bulk ferment will begin so let's start very slowly I'm not going to walk you through his last time how I did that I'm just going to do them you can see you in a matter of 10 French folds how the dough was already starting to develop and I went up to 20 we'll cut away and I'll come back a toward the very end here we are in list 20 French folds and you can see the dough is now school with over it has a really nice and pillowy feel a little bit sticky but white flour for a 73% hydration this don't feels great so just going to finish it up with another 10 French folds and then go into bulk from it and at the 30 60 90 minute walk when you do three-letter folds that's it I think though Trisha is incredibly extensible so another thing I want to mention is I've never worked with this dough before so it's like the proverbial box of chocolates from Forrest Gump I have no idea what I'm getting into because I've never done it before I'm gonna do it again fold it out again and one last time that's it that's the first letter fold it'll be two more one in 16 minutes and one at 90 and then a 15 minute rest before it goes into overnight though over it it looks and it feels really great smooth that's one yeah let it drip down get that stretch of the gluten and I think this one I probably could roll one more time so there you go you can see it's already starting to rise that's after two there's one more to go and then a 15-minute rest before it goes into last fold JooJoo long when a strict that though as far as I can without breaking any of the gluten strands this dough is incredibly extensible it feels great he's time I'm just gonna roll it up that's what it looks like we this is very very sticky bill at this point so shaping will be an issue you see how it's sticking to the bench barely gonna be able to roll it this is a very difficult though that work with I've had worse most recently with the truth for diem flour baguettes but this was quite tacky a bit of a challenge to shape as you can see it didn't get any easier I guess it got a little easier across the floor baguettes that I shaped but it wasn't a delightful experience now here I am trying to remove the baguettes from a very heavy flour booth you can see how moisture and tagging is having them stick and actually wasn't too bad to screwing them in terms of the actual scoring but by the time that I was done it seems as though these were not going to open well I just had that feeling this was not gonna be a good bake and I wasn't in in that since I wasn't disappointed so here are the four baguettes and what we'll see in a minute is how they looked upon emerging from the oven I post pic analysis and notes most of the time I worked with in the mid-sixties hydration to the low seventies hydrations with majority of my baking happens to be baguettes I worked in the low 70s to the mid seventies range and still within my comfort zone so 73 percent hydration dough should not have been a problem but for a 73% hydration dough so to this with this very low percent of pre fermented flour four percent the bulk rise yields a somewhat billowy dough with a luxurious feel to it it was really beautiful to work with and we're four-post I found the dough to exhibit both the denseness and tacky feel versus dough the first one into there's significant difference for the feel of the dough I've shown in the shaping segment it was a surprisingly difficult out of shape after only a short 10-minute rest I probably should have given it 30 and I did on the second run even with indefinitely for me copious amounts of flour on the work bench and especially on the couch that that wasn't commonly reluctant to release from the couch was difficult I also found scoring to be a bit of a challenge whereas most of the time by far it is never an issue with me my scoring is pretty darn good all things considered I was surprised at how well and that's in quotes how well the scores did wind up opening but the baguettes are disappointingly flat were little oft and while they have a lovely coloration they didn't assume a richer deeper brown color that I particularly happen to like the Crump is such a flat loaf is surprisingly open where it isn't dense the crumb is creamy colored and sweet the crust is thin with the crisp snap to it it definitely is a delicious bread there's no question about that it's its delight baking it for 13 minutes with steam continually 13 minutes without steam after rotating loaves and three minutes more of venting the next run should yield a better result even before the spread came out of  for baking I decided to do another one I dropped the hydration from 73 percent to 70 as you can see everything before that's the same in terms of the fermented so here I am shaping shaping the baguettes now these are three percent lower hydration but for some reason maybe it's just the experience of working with the stove it was a lot easier to deal with the second time around you could see it's not sticking to the bench although this still is way too much flour on the work bench for my liking and still again on the couch also there's still sheds a lot of moisture and it still was somewhat tacky but much better to deal with I'd also left the dough out for 30 minutes between three shaping and shaping and I think that helps somewhat and I may continue doing that in the future instead of my standard 10 minute time frame between between pre shape and shape so all in all this was a much better shaping experience than the first no question about it very comfortable go to work but this time around those but this one on the second one is actually pretty easy to deal with especially if you're connected first you'll notice that my shaping routine is different than most people's family almost everybody else's Plame shaping something I've kind of developed on my own over time I've never quite understood the fuss about taking and doing a fold socially living now then flipping the dough over and doing another fold and then continuing and sticking your thumb in the middle it may work great for some people it may even work better for me so this is my method and I'm kind of happy with it when it came time to take the dough out for actually baking and now they're shaped you can see how easy it is to remove them from the couch it was actually no sticking this time at all again the couch is heavily flour not quite too much of the first time but they released quite easily and Here I am scoring them scoring also was a little easier this time and so I feel that pretty much everything about this bake from the time that I did to divide and reshape up until this moment squaring was a significantly better experience than the prior day here's what it looked like with the scores after 13 minutes I release the steam remove the parchment paper and turned them around that's what we're seeing there this is the finished product overall a significant improvement over the prior day quite quite a difference these look great compared to the previous days I'm quite happy with them and looking on the inside a very creamy interior nice and lacy different kind of laziness that I've seen with other people's particular Maurizio's the the creamy color reminds me almost of a semolina this is Alfonso's baked of Mauricio leo from the perfect loaf calm his levan baguettes", "cqh1oeOWgP8": "so I'm going to show you how to mix baguette dough by hand and you start out with baguette dough doing in Otto Lee's and in oddities is essentially a way to help the gluten in the dough form and so I'm taking 72 degree water and I'm going to scale out 850 grams of it now into the water I'm going to scale out what is called polish and polish is a pre ferment and in bread Baker's language a pre ferment is any kind of dough that's fermented before the main dough is fermented so a sourdough starter is a pre ferment a poolish is a pre ferment a sponge is a pre ferment all of those things that you do ahead of time with any type of yeast are called pre ferments and so this polish is equal parts flour and water with the tiniest tiniest bit of fresh yeast and so I need 700 grams of Polish in my recipe and what I did about 12 hours ago was I mixed 500 grams of bread flour with 500 grams of 70-degree water with approximately like I didn't even scale out the yeast I just used a very very tiny tiny pinch of yeast and so that ferments you can see it's really ripe right now and I need 700 grams and so I'm going to scale this into my water great and if you can see this polish is floating in the water and that's a sign that it's well fermented because that carbon dioxide helps it to float and so then into this I'm going to pour in 1400 grams of all-purpose flour and I like to use all-purpose flour instead of bread flour because the all-purpose flour helps with the fermentation it ferments faster because the protein content isn't as high it doesn't take as much for the yeast feed on it and so now I'm going to omit my salt in my yeast for the moment and I'm going to just sort of with my hands just these three ingredients combine them and you just want to hydrate the flour I'm just going to keep my one hand free for now and my other hand I'm just sort of using a circular motion to incorporate the ingredients and then I'm going to sort of start to squeeze the ingredients together I'm only using a metal bowl right now because it's wide and it's easy for me to use but you can use any type of bowl this makes a lot of dough this makes about three kilos of dough and so you want to use a big bowl but it could be a ceramic bowl or any type of earthenware Bowl is fine so I just want to hydrate my flour and it's going to be a shaggy mess when I'm done because I'm not going to need it right now I'm going to let it rest for about twenty to thirty minutes during an auto leas period and during that period of time my gluten will form and it will be easier for me to finish kneading it so this Jackie bit of dough should look just pretty much like this you don't have to go any further with the mixing I'm going to clean my hand off and then I'm going to sprinkle my thirty-six grams of salt right on the surface and that sort of helps the salt to start to dissolve but it doesn't interfere with the gluten forming process and then I'm going to hold back my yeast and so I'm going to let this dough sit for about thirty minutes okay so our baguette dough has been resting for twenty to thirty minutes and now we're just going to sprinkle the yeast on and that's eight grams of yeast and so I'm going to use my hands to get it going and then once I feel like the gluten has developed I'm going to knead it on the surface of the table once it feels like it's not quite so sticky I'm going to transfer it to the table okay so I'm going to move it to the table I'm going to add a little it's sticky right now so at this point I'm just going to get a little flour underneath just to help get it going and now I'm going to start kneading it and so I'm just sort of going to take my hands and I sort of rotate it as I go and I'm going to knead it until the gluten is developed until it passes the windowpane test and is about seven minutes so I'm using a lot of pressure as I need it and I sort of want to make sure because my salt still needs to be incorporated so I also want to make sure that my salt is incorporating and if it sticks to the surface just use your bench knife to get under it and add a little bit more flour this bread doesn't take multiple days to make this bread you can make the same day you need to mix your poolish the day before but we're going to make this bread all in one day after we're done kneading it it will ferment for two hours and then we will divide it and shape it and proof it the proofing time on the spread is really fast it's only about thirty minutes and then we'll proof it and then we'll bake it", "GC7420pA8zk": "[Music] first up we add the dry yeast to the water [Music] give it a whisk and allow it to activate for a few minutes and then we add our strong bread flour give it a nice big whisk until nicely combined [Music] cover with cling film and leave in the fridge for 10 hours or overnight [Music] the next day our polish is looking beautiful nice and active and bubbly [Music] and here we go four basic ingredients we've got our flour our polish our salt and our water first up we add the water to the bowl and then our beautiful polish the flour [Music] then finally the salt get yourself a spoon and give it a nice big store [Music] scrape down the saudia bowl cover with a freezer bag or cling film and let it rise for about 40 minutes [Music] here's our dough doubled in soyuz now rub a bit of water on the table this is to prevent the dough from sticking as you slap and fold [Music] all right now wet your hands lift the dough up and let it fall down on itself this technique is called the slap and fold method slap and fold slap and fold nice and easy [Music] let the dough do the work for you [Music] then we throw that back in our bowl and we're going to let it roast for another 40 minutes and again cover with a freezer bag or cling film [Music] and here we are 40 minutes later bit of flour on the table then our dough and a little bit of flour on top all right i'm gonna weigh these off now at 300 grams you'll get six baguettes [Music] [Music] and there you go six equal pieces 300 grams each a little bit of flour on top knock a bit of the arrow stretch and fold it in on top of itself you just want to tighten it up a little bit then give it a little roll and here we have it from another angle stretch it out fold it into the middle [Music] push down fold push down fold and give it a little roll and tighten it at the same time there you go done okay these are the finished pre-shaped baguettes a little bit of flour and cover with a freezer bag for about 15 minutes [Music] now get yourself a nice tea towel and give it a good sprinkle with flour lift up the end and stick it against the side of the wall [Music] roy here we go time to shape the baguettes a little bit of flour get our baguette knock the air out pull the sides into the center and fold it down on top of itself fold press [Music] seal then give it a little roll and afterwards you transferred it to your tea towel [Music] now you pinch up the sides you want to create a space between each baguette [Music] use a tan or something to keep it in place and then cover with a tea towel for 45 minutes to 50 minutes [Music] like no room for this one so here's a little close up [Music] and that's it you just want to roll it in nice and easy and seal it and give it a nice roll at the end [Music] preheat your oven to 230 degrees celsius at least 45 minutes before you bake now i took these a bit too early they only had about 25 minutes [Music] stick them on a lightly oiled bacon tray [Music] get a blade or a knife and give it a few slits [Music] now place the baguettes directly on your pizza stone and bake for about eight ten minutes throw in a glass of water these are 10 minutes more proving time so they're ready when they look like this [Music] bake directly on your pizza stone and remember to throw in a glass of water this will make the baguettes nice and [Music] crisp [Music] and that's it chris's french baguettes we're poolish beautiful look at the [Music] all right folks that's it please remember to subscribe to the youtube channel for regular updates and i'll see you next time there we go", "VuIT0RJDdZ8": "here's the dough after two hours and you can see that it kind of looks like it did at the halfway point but maybe more volume than before even so this is ready to shape so we'll just divide this into two equal pieces you want to make sure that you don't have a lot of flour on your work surface so if you do you might want to brush that away you can get a little flour on your hands and we're going to just sort of tuck the dough underneath itself to give us a nice smooth surface on the top and now to shape this I'm going to hold my hands on either side of the dough with my thumb's on the surface good idea should do that too and I'm going to just rotate the dough back and forth using this part of your hand to sort of cup it and tuck it under once you get faster at this you'll see that it's a pretty quick motion back and forth and that will tighten that right up the next thing we're going to do is we're going to get our dough into these Banat ons or broke form is another name for them they're just a coiled willow basket if you don't have one of these at home you could certainly use a bowl with a kitchen towel lining it with some flour on it we're going to take our beautiful bowls here and place them in the lightly floured baskets with the pretty smooth side down right in the center we're going to let these rise for about an hour and a half to two hours and you can sort of check with your finger to see how far along they are if the impression just sits there they're probably ready to bake do you bake the bread in these absolutely not no if we baked the bread in the baskets they would catch on fire in the oven and burn definitely don't want that it wouldn't be good for the bread either no so we have our oven preheated to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and I have a pizza stone in the oven which is a good way to bake sourdough bread and I'm going to transfer the breads into the oven using appeal and this is a peel here I like to prepare it with a layer of cornmeal or semolina flour and then you can use her trend paper parchment is a great trick to use if you're not comfortable with cornmeal or semolina which can be a little bit tricky and the parchment can go right into the oven on the stone it's not going to burn so it's a nice way to transfer it and then once these are risen we just turn the dough out onto the peel and once we have it on the peel we're going to slash it the reason that we slash is during the bake there's a lot of steam that's being created in the bread itself as it's going through the process of baking and we want to tell that where to go we don't want it to try to escape through the path of least resistance which is usually the side of the bread so by using either a knife or this is called alum this is a great tool to use as well and you're really only going to work with the corner here of the lum you don't want to drag the whole blade across the surface we're going to make just straight cuts that will allow the steam to escape through a path that's a little bit more decorative it takes about 45 minutes for the breads to bake but they're going to be gorgeous at the end of that delicious mm-hmm definitely our bread is out of the oven and it looks great I mean I can tell it's done usually by this technique where you just sort of tap the bottom make your little narrow hollow this is a hollow thumping sound but you can also tell by just looking at the color it has a nice deep color it's been cooling for about 30 minutes so we can cut into it now all right makes that nice sound when you cut into it is I love crusty bread I mean this bread takes a little bit longer but look at it it's so worth it isn't it it's definitely worth it I can already smell it we have these beautiful characteristic cell structure that you get this open structure has that nice tangy aroma mm-hmm definitely mmm it actually does smell really good well it smells and looks wonderful do we get to taste it now oh yeah let's all right mmm great flavor really kind of nutty and tangy at the same time", "2QZMs02cMzA": "i'm going to shape a round bowl and also a baguette so there's my dough i'm going to cut it in half and first this is the pre-shape of the round bowl and i tuck the sides up and then just flip it over and tuck a few times and that's it and this is the pre-shape of the log or oval for the baguette i'm gonna go toward the center a little so that i don't end up with a shape that's too fat on the ends so toward the center and then i'm just gonna roll and i'm gonna move that bit toward the center and roll and there's my log shape and i'm just going to tighten it once or twice and now these two will sit until they relax so now i have my pre-shaped round and i'm going to to preserve this nice smooth top i'm going to flip it on its head and then just reshape it into a tighter round ball so onto its head smack it again to get the gas out and then again the sides come up and you flip it right side up but this time i'm going to keep tightening it and tightening it until i have a nice tight round ball i'm using both hands to stretch the top you can also use that motion where you push on it and it catches right here with the friction of the table and it stretches i have a little bit too much flour down though and so if i push on it it's just gonna slide um but if if you are more careful with your flour than i was you can also use that pushing motion on all four sides to as a different way to stretch it but because i have too much flour i'm using two hands instead so you just keep shaping it and ideally you shape it as tight as you can without it starting to rip so sometime you can just experiment by continuing to tighten and tighten until it rips and you'll see how far you can go but i'm going to stop right about here and so now i'm going to move that over to a surface to proof now i'm going to um take my pre-shaped baguette which is sort of a log right here i'm going to flip it over so that the top surface is um going to go down in the flower and that's going to end up being the outside of the baguette so flip it upside down and now smack it a few times to get the gas out and now i'm going to do the series of three folds to make the baguette so once you're done i have a seam right here so i'm going to kind of roll it right side up so that seam is on the bottom now this is a pretty short baguette depending on how you're going to bake it and store it you know you might want it longer or you might prefer short so it fits in your casserole or whatever you're using better so to make it longer there's a few things you can do one is to continue tightening it using both your hands like that you can also use friction with the table again i have a little too much flour down so it probably won't work but you sort of push on the baguette here and you should feel it catching on the other side and stretching over the top you can also pull it toward you but because my table is so slippery i'm gonna stick to the two-handed method and i'm just stretching the top of it and as you do that it'll start to get longer and longer and finally if you're happy with your baguette but you just want it longer you just can roll it like that um but that's the basic idea if there's a this looks pretty even but say you had one end that was too fatter than the rest you could just do this more there do this motion more at the fatter place and kind of stretch it out so now you just pick it up and move it to whatever surface you're going to let it proof on", "ww78_SfGyQE": "hey home bacon is Jack here our bank with Jack Coe got UK bring in your weekly bread making soup every single Thursday today I want to talk to you about shaping bread because this has come up a couple of times from a couple of people one from and Instagram one from Kim in a class a couple of other people in a class has mentioned that when they're making a loaf of bread look around loaf like a Cobb loaf or something and they're proving it on a tray or in a basket when they turn it out of that basket or when it's on that tray proving it spreads sideways you spell it being nice and full and plump and it's a real shame and I believe it's down to the shaping technique and I'm going to show you I put some dough here can show you what's going on and I'm going to do two different ways of shaping one is in real nice way to build tension and it's really important to build potential we must build tension across the top of the dough and I'll speak about it all the time I did touch on it on another shape in the loaf recipe video it's all about tension you've got two sides here so you've got a sticky side and a nonstick side the top is a weak nonstick the underside is always nice and sticky right because the underside is sticky you can make all your fold in all your joins there which means they all stick to each other and the seam is hidden underneath the top of your though the nonstick side is where you build all the tension you make it real nice and tight across the top it's almost like there's a thin skin on the outside nice and elastic and you tighten up real nice and a hose a real nice shape I'm going to show you what I mean I've got a dough to show you what I mean the second though I'm going to do I'm just going to roll it up into some sort of balls and see what happens right see which one comes up nice and tall and prowl and see which one spreads all over the place I'm pretty sure I know and if this is happening to you this should get bottom of your issue as well I'm going to get the dough okay so I've made this dough right and this pretty straightforward recipe and it's a standard though I've needed it I've worked it let em rest for about an hour hour and a half and now it's ready for shaping up cut into two pieces right I'm going to do one bit one piece I'm just going to fold up like this a little bit we're just going to I can't even do it I'm just going to roll it into a ball cut it up into a ball shape like that I can't even I can't even do it just going to Pat it into a ball something like that maybe I don't know this is like a to the extreme example of something that is not the right thing to do right so that'll do I leave on this approve right I leave on this approve I'll get a perfect shot on the soil on the side and chill out for it right this one I'm going to show you how to do it little bit of flour now this though is already upside down so the top is underneath is always nonstick always check is not sticky now to make this into a nice tight ball I'm just going to take a piece here this so I pull over towards me like that stick it down give it a little turn so this point of it give a little turn take this bit give it a little turn take this bit and you can do this over and over what's that a test lost count nine ten and the more you do it the tighter it becomes on this side which is the top now so the tighter it becomes and the trick here is to pull a big piece right I'm just listening to the dough and feeling about what it's telling me right you just take this piece and bring it over and you can take less and less at a time as it becomes tighter and tighter and tighter and tighter right nice tight ball like this now at this point you can do a little bit of this if you like just to find enough a little bit extra trying to go too tight and it'll split on the top and you get a big crackle on the top get your train now you can see nice and tight on the top it's real response has been bouncy and strong and I can confidently put that on a tray thus the Vitara flower and that's going to come up nice and tall and proud right because of the tension on the top there are loads of ways of doing this those are ways but the tension always is across the top keep it a nice scent tight somewhat like it like I said earlier it's like a skin on the top it's almost like an elastic a skin on the top keeping it nice round ball so that's that one there one here and it's spread out already see how its spread out already just rest them for that minute or so I'm going to put a cloth on the boat like this let them rest for a bit we'll come back another look at a minute later and see how they're getting on so your dose sort of structure now right after you finish kneading you're developing that structure the elasticity developing the gluten giving that those strengths and building that structure right so that's why it's important now it's not as simple as just roll into a ball and putting it on the tray or putting in a basket you really got to treat it in the right way to keep the structure that you've built already and sign up in the right way so it goes exactly where you want it because if you just do roll it all up into a ball it will go wherever it likes you have to create some sort of like restriction on some sort of boundary so it can only go on one way which is up which is nice and tall and proud that's the only check back to this in a minute hey so time has passed hey hey time is passed and like those nicely written and this is the difference between the two okay so number one now I just rolled up into a ball this is what looks like it's still going to be nice it's still going to be delicious all is not lost it's going to really pop up in the oven as well just a little bit flat a little bit see where I got away with it right it's not perfect this is the one where tightened up the tension on the top across the top into a nice round ball and this is what it looks like here's a difference yeah look at that bad boy it's just been proven on a flat train and it's how it's shaped it's nice and proud and round and that's going to go in the oven when it's going to get a little bit of a boost as well it's going to get a bit of that oven spring when it hits that heat and it's going to come up a little bit further which is wicked hopefully keep it nice and round due to that tension and I'm going to put a couple of pictures on here in a minute and a sort of semi montage for you to see the final baked products anyway I hope this has helped you out pitch the montage is coming right now [Music] I hope this has helped you out if it helps your life comic nice and proud found me a picture because it never gets old I love it you can hashtag me into a picture on Instagram

[Music]", "VSNK0hEqQ7g": "hello everyone and welcome back to Ben's pantry today we're talking about bread not just any bread tiger bread here I made a large loaf but if you wanted to you could make smaller rolls we all going to be doing this recipe in two parts the first part before the dough for the bread and the second part will be for the topping which makes it nice and crusty you first want to start by adding 500 grams of strong bread flour to a large mixing bowl and to that you want to add 7 grams of fast-acting dried yeast and one and a half teaspoons of sugar one and a half teaspoons of salt and you just want to stir that through making sure it's all combined once that mix is all combined you can now start by slowly adding 350 mils of warm water to the bowl once you have added all that water if you are using a stand flick so you may need to scrape down the sides of the bowl to ensure the dough mix properly if you are doing this make sure you turn the Machine off before doing so otherwise you could hurt your fingers if you've got a stand mixer you can now knead the dough in the mixer on a medium speed for about five to six minutes if you are doing it by hand you have to knead it for about 10 to 12 minutes you can start kneading your dough once the dough is smooth and once you press it it bounces back immediately if it doesn't bounce back immediately you just carry on for a few more minutes until it does once the bread has been kneaded we're now going to prove the dough this enables the bread to have a nice bubbly airy texture to it inside you now need to get yourself a large mixing bowl large enough for the dough to double in size and you then need to spray some cooking oil inside to ensure it doesn't stick when you take your dough out you can now take the dough out of the other mixing bowl and put it onto a lightly floured work surface and you can shape it into a rough ball shape and then you can put it straight into that oiled Bowl now we need to grab enough cling film to cover the top of the bowl but before you put the cling film on top of the bowl you need to ensure that you spray some oil onto it to ensure it doesn't stick when the dough Rises then you want to place the cling film on top of the mixing bowl and place the bowl into a warm area for about an hour or until their dough's doubled in size once the dough has doubled in size we now need to flour the work surface and we can take the dough out of the bowl and we want to knead it three or four times we now need to shape the dough into an oval shape and this would be the final shape so whatever you shape it as now will be the shape you get out of the oven here I've just flattened it out slightly and folded the top of the dough into the middle and rolled it over and this will create a log shape once you've shaped the dough how you like it you now need to get a baking sheet with some baking paper on and you can place your dough directly onto the baking sheet we now need to prove this again until Dublin size this could take between 30 minutes and an hour depending on how their conditions are with a humidity and the heat and again we want to get enough cling film with the oil on to cover the dough so it doesn't stick we're now that we're making the topping for the bread and this is how it gets his name as Tiger bread because this topping cracks in the oven and makes different shapes so you will need 90 grams of rice flour three and a half grams of fast-action yeast a pinch of salt one teaspoon of castor sugar half a tablespoon of toasted sesame oil and ninety milliliters of warm water to a mixing bowl combine the rice flour the yeast the sugar and salt I use golden caster sugar instead of the normal white castor sugar but either of them is fine and then we can have the wet ingredients so we can add the toasted sesame oil and the ninety milliliters of warm water you can now pre-heat your oven to 180 degrees fan assisted or 200 degrees conventional once you've added all the ingredients into the bowl we're now to whisk it to ensure there's no lumps left in there and you want a consistency which is spreadable a bit like double cream so once your dough is now doubled in size you can now take the cling film off and we need to get our topping paste and we should want to pour over and spread it evenly across the dough just like this one you now need to place the dough into the preheated oven for about 35 minutes or in two it sounds hollow when you tap it from the bottom of the bread if it's not quite done just put it back into the oven for a few minutes at a time and today's cool now just look at the patterns on that bread what do you guys think is it Tiger Shroff leave a comment in the comment box below if you liked this video please give it a thumbs up and if you want to see more videos just like this please subscribe to my channel and to never miss a video I upload just press that Bell", "GIb5UlbYsW4": "and you'll feel behind your hands the surface tension getting that's an important step conceptually what we're trying to do is this nice delicate area low for our dough we're trying to just surround that with the talked surface we're not trying to why a lot of people when they're shaping want to do this and just get this thing so wound up tight that it's not going to go anywhere well we I just does six hours of spent you know inflating I just took all that gas out so there are you know their third there are ways that this is successful it's not how we do so okay so take your piece and with your fingertips at the back just lift up when you get a little bit of a lip up push forward and you get a little bit forward come down and back and then tuck in and so you feel you'll feel it you can do a couple tucks right there just to feel I get tight tight behind your hands good yeah and then I still have a little bit of a flap so I'm gonna do that one or two more time probably just one more time for me but you might have to do two more you don't have to start as far back for the second roll you can start right on top and then you're going to get it up on to what it's called the seam where the two ends meet well I'm just watching your hands coupons see if I can help you though you're getting it so the seam before we move on this scene needs to be sealed and there's a couple ways to do it the simplest way is just to pinch right along the surface and pinch it chef a better way to do it because you can add more tension to the dough is to is to seal it against the table and so either using this part of your hand the the line of your pinky and your palm and pulling towards you or using the heel of your hand your thumbs and pushing away from your probably shoes thumbs with this size of piece you're gonna pinch right along that seam you're gonna pinch that against the table just a little bit of don't you should feel that same kind of tensioning happen behind you pinching seal that helps to maintain yours your circularity in the piece and then so you won't have enough pressure going down to roll it you want to then gently be coaxing it out to the side to lengthen it and so I achieved that you're kind of making my hands go in a capital M so I start together and I go out and then back like that and then I repeat out and then back and most of my pressure is pulling to the sides just enough downward pressure to roll you can pop bubbles we'll start surfacing at this point you can pop the surface bubbles that's not a big deal and then you want to point your ends you want to taper them to a point and you just angle your hands down a little bit and just just you can put some downward pressure there to do that and get the points the purpose of the points is to focus the rise so this look want start this slope is going to rise from the center out and by by putting a point here there's a point of resistance for the rise to go this way and so it forces the rise to go to toward the middle so that all of the energy of the push or force of rising dough goes this way out and up so you get locked loftier low so we have more volume you get everything going you", "Q_RKmbYjq2M": "hello everyone good morning good morning good morning this is your homie malty oh we and today we're coming with so i come off with my car my cat is there um that is only me now people today we have the nice and the cbd uh products that and last night we done the from the goods and today we have from the goods as well onion the last night was more um concentrate site uh you know a beautiful and uh grounded purple uh shuttle it's really good um and of course ours and the little um a little vape pen uh what it's delicious as well this is blue dreams that if someone is interesting on that side um check my last video um or go on the straightaway to plays with cbd products people today we're going a little different way we go help our way and as well i wanted to discuss what i think about company how i see in the website and all that you know by the way i'm not sponsored by this company all this product was by them by from my pocket that i'm not related this is pure pure pure pure my review and my opinion with no you know influence from another people uh people say that today we'll be having the disability uh little pineapple express pereirol uh 30 percent of cbd or 14 protein of cbd that people what i do i change our view um i do little close-ups that you can see in the bible how it happens and we open this and later yeah you know i light up and smoke and i tell you my faults what i think it's good or not it's i think have little different approach uh this company for anyway if you change the view up here you go people pineapple experts coming out to but anyway um first i really like um how you know a company really make packages uh it's look amazing i like it it's really in the top top quality uh at least in the packaging and i'm not saying that there is bad boys it's under five star um now with this one it's in the 14 percent of cbd okay that is that is cool and now ingredients why i say this company have literally different approach look at that people organic pro property theory i'm sorry if i butch this world herbal blend what i think it's really don't use hemp it's use this and blendy use this on the use this blendy blendy blendy blendy products you know [Music] what you can use to um to mix with your normal and the wheat what is quite cool i try and it's quite nice um i try this in the holland anyway go back to this little bad boy and what has happened and the art and the cbd isolate what is in the from help and the tapes and minor cannabinoids that can include in the cbg and cbc um that and a lot with previous and products that people yeah quite interesting but let me open this it's safety card we like that let me smell this bubble what's this inside kind of sweet and tiny that really shoot exactly and smell and here we go and that is cool this this is glass it's glass people this is good it's glass tube that that is big shout out um no plastic you know cool nice glass tube uh that people yeah look i was saying they look nice i will if so use and the own papers what we have as well and at some point i'll be delivery of these bad boys uh don't you order it those people yeah this look nice smell quite okay not anyway we got we changed our view and i light up this bad boy but we here you go we go it's time to try this little bad boy uh people uh coffee is check uh lighter check and of course our spiritual check yep that here we go ready to go people i smell very piney and heavy piney what is correct because and the pineapple excess should have little tiny sweet piney healthy flavor however we see how gold is it's quite moist very mellow it smell the pine on you not every day you take kind of sweetness almost nothing almost go tasteless and i think if i'm honest i like these blends for you on the sleeves instead to use tobacco because it's almost tasteless and you have your whole almost whole spectrum and the real deal stuff now i don't say it's bad because it's not however to compare to two flavors what you have from this uh flavors what you have from that uh yeah this little lay down however you know it's nice ben honestly it's good quality and the herbal mix that uh you know it's how it is and i tell you that we go um it's more it exactly taste better than ham flour that i think i like this approach i like this approach to use herbal mix and infuse with with cbd isolates well that is done um i think it's better idea to do it and instead to have perroll hem however i think price of this is about 10 pounds it's 9.99 um it's a little too much i know and they give me and the nice and the glass you know jar and that that it's all cool and that i think it's a little too much uh it's only that my opinion um if i much prefer add you know another tenor and have this bad boy and i have 300 parts and it i i must be picky i'm sorry um overall it's no battery it's very mellow almost you smell it tastes nothing that as the art medicine for you yeah i think in the cook yeah it's not unpleasant what sometimes can have unpleasant than the smell that it's it's okay i mean i think it's still uh it's still um little down compared to these products that people anyway i still be smoking this and now i'll be quickly jumping to show you in the website how look um that you can see um and decide for yourself now people change the quick review and i show your website and we'll be done now people check there you go people website it's let me underscroll it's really uh look nice i like how look look uh cool now you have quality control the premium and the line of cbd infused products and the lab tested that it's so good you know explain you everything nicely a winner so 2020 i'm not surprised um that people yes i think it's this is the herbal mix uh and it's done that i if i'm honest it's better by this uh it's better by honestly by this you you come better and that now you have a vape pants what i really like and enjoy um of course in the shutter uh it's quite good uh as well lovely i never try on the

this is only my third rest of the products that i say uh uh and the shutter and the vape it's spot on five stars this one i like idea and don't usually help me to use and the herbal mix and the infuse and the stuff i think this is better approach um overall i think it's great company people and i don't say that because it's uk one uh it's a really good company i i like and the how that profile look and and what the guys and sell and that yeah it's and of course we'll be having these little hand papers at some point in the review uh that people thank you very much hopefully you like and enjoy in

water the first thing you need to know is we are now using our hands everything is done with a fork so you don't get your hands dirty see I'm beautiful and dressed up ready to go out and I'm making the bread before I go out so let's put flour in there not all of it just play about 10 percent of flour now let's put your water I'm using warm water ok warm water from the sink it helps to combine all the ingredients together then at this point I've got the East you can use dry yeast if you want got a stand a break taste inside and I want the east to melt you can get a fork to help you I love having ciabatta with my like a panino I like to make the size of the panino so I can do anything I want in size that's our like to eat ciabatta if you find it easier you can use a spatula ok the spatula can also help ok now this is done so at this point what I'm going to do I'm going to add two beautiful tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil one teaspoon of sugar and 1 tablespoon of salt at this point again with my fork and mix all the ingredients and I start adding the flour a little bit at a time add the flour so we can combine the ingredients together you need to understand that this recipe this dough he very wet we're making a very a bear I'd rated spread today okay so you don't really want to use your hands because your hands cannot do much so it's a no need recipe even if you use a stand mixer try to do it a little bit at a time it takes more time for this to be done in less than five minutes look at the time here you can tell you can tell are quickening as promised done in less than five minutes what we're gonna do now we are going to cover it with cling film plastic wrap the reason why we cover the bread is because we don't want to dry up the dessert the top part so the bread is carpet is safe and now what I like to do I want to pull it inside the oven the oven must be off of course just inside the oven close the door and this way I know that the temperature is going to be the same for the next two hours oh the smell of bread guys look at is wonderful though it's very sticky and that's the way it should be and it is perfect for our beautiful ciabatta now what we do we want to be very generous with the flour so proof flour here and then what you didn't do to take the flour knead the dough out from this you can use a scraper oh what you do just wet your hands with water so here I have some nice warm water and I'm going to wet my hands okay and now I'm going to take this out this is the only time I make my hands dirty you don't have to if you actually want you can use a spatula just like this see again well weather in the water or extra virgin olive oil if you want yeah yes hello who we do now here I've got some extra virgin olive oil okay I like to just put some extra virgin olive oil on top just spread it and rain force the sides here okay just try to reinforce the sides just like this one and two just wanna do this so I make sure the dough is reinforced now to weaken irons a little bit dirty come on will I wanna do it okay so here we have a beautiful dome as you can see it's very very soft which is what you want now you can't really lift this to pull it on a baking tray it's very difficult to do it so this is what we're going to do now what everywhere on top just make sure you put flour every way flour is your best friend right now okay guys you really need the flour on top so now be ready get a tray and put baking paper on top all right this is the most important podcast what we need to do here we need to create the ciabatta shape so let's put some flour here at the front okay now what we do is we cut a piece that can be the size that you want roll it around get your hands from both sides and we're placing our bread here on the baking paper so I gotta show you who we do here we cut roll see here we have the ciabatta bread so now you use your hands just like this and pull it on the tray in the meantime guys turn on the oven at 230 Celsius degrees put water in a little baking tray like this because the water will keep the oven humid and the bread will stay nice and moist now we are ready to put a bread in the oven at 230 Celsius for 20 minutes okay after 20 minutes we got beautiful yeah mmm oh the bread how we gonna do it turn around careful not to burn we remove the water and we cook it for five whole minutes so we can create the crust on the bread guys no W that ah huh after 25 minutes we have the ciabatta bread now well that's what Jess you guys is to get like a something like this we hole at the bottom and we put the bread right on top straight away the reason why we do this it's because we want the bread to the crunch at the bottom as well otherwise it will become soft so this is very important that you do it now we wanna wait until the bread cools down before we cut it okay this time final arrived we now need to try we need to see but first before I try wanna make sure that our bread it's nice and crunchy so let's listen sounds crunchy to me so let's cut let's cut it enough this is a cron job this time we're going to over you know look what we got inside moist on the inside crunchy on the outside that's what we want I'm gonna put some extra virgin olive oil here and yeah and I'm going to put four oh shoot - it's a lie on the inside the first I want you to listen to the crunch artisan bread Tom and may no need no thank you so much for watching being Chancellor spite we will see you in the next we change us play video recipe mayority manager being chainsaws plate [Music] you [Music]", "DuLa6-Bqhss": "all right what we're making here today is a small batch baguette or fisal recipe which will make a singular baguette or two free cell this recipe was posted on the fresh loaf forms but was attributed to youtuber mukbling whether it's an original recipe of theirs or if they found it elsewhere i'm unsure but nonetheless i'll link their channel below for credit this recipe begins by making a poolish the day before you want to bake a poolish is a type of pre-ferment essentially making a small amount of dough and leaving it to ferment at room temperature overnight to develop flavor we don't want to do this with the full amount of dough as dough becomes much more slack and liquidy as it ferments which would make it extremely difficult if not impossible to work with and shape additionally the rise would really be impacted as the yeast worked through their available food sources in the dough over the for 24 hours uh the poolish is made with 68 grams of water you could round it up one if you wanted the funny number and to that we are going to add a pinch of instant yeast not active dry yeast instant yeast also advertised as fast rice yeast and you can whisk or swirl the bowl around to get that dissolving and once we have it that way we will add 68 grams of flour plus or minus a gram at your discretion so equal parts by weight of water and flour and then just a pinch of instant yeast and that is going to come together into the consistency of a a very thick batter you want to make sure that there are no dry spots flour get every bit of it moistened and other than that that's really all we have to do we're just going to cover this up and let it rest at room temp for 24 hours and 24 ish hours later this is what you have you can see that the yeast had quite a lot of activity and the texture of the poolish is much more liquid and sticky than it was yesterday and that's the texture of dough as it ferments like i mentioned earlier we're going to add in 100 grams of warm water to this and try a little bit in vain to mix the poolish into the water and i'm using the handle of a wooden spoon for this to try to also in vain to cut down on the amount of dough that sticks to my utensil and to this mixture we're going to add a gram of instant yeast if you have a regular kitchen scale i wouldn't try to weigh this as most gram scales are only accurate to plus or minus 2 grams they don't do well with such small weights so unless you have a milligram scale and i'm not going to ask any questions if you do i would actually measure this volumetrically it's a good heaping quarter of a teaspoon and then we're going to add a 159 grams of flour plus about seven grams of salt this is more salt than the original recipe calls for and it's more than the sort of textbook standard two percent by baker's percentage of salt that almost all breast bread recipes utilize i personally like using three percent salt and all of my lean doughs i find that it does actually make a noteworthy flavor improvement in side-by-side comparisons it doesn't make your bread saltier it just makes it tastier and once i'm certain that all of the flowers work then and no dry spots remain i'm going to stop working it here this dough is not very cohesive right now it's really just a sticky mass of wet flour and i don't like working with wet flour if we just leave this to vibe for half an hour it'll come together into a much more cohesive dough and we'll really be able to do some stretching folds and get some gluten developed all right the top of this dough is still a little cracky but as i stretch it you'll be able to see how it's come together much more than it was earlier and i want to talk a little bit about stretch and folds here because very often on other youtubers and even more often when i watch novice makers i see people performing stretch and folds so delicately just pinching up a little bit of dough and flipping it over for a quality stretch and fold one that's meant to replace kneading for gluten development you really want to grab a hunk of the dough and get a good stretch looking to at least double the length of the dough if not triple it with your stretch and for higher hydration does like this you want to work with wet hands to prevent the dough from sticking to you and then just grab your dough stretch it up to double or triple and fold it over rotate 90 degrees stretch it up fold it over rotate 90 stretch it up fold it over and rotate 90 stretch it up and fold it over and then i wind up doing a couple of more here just because the dough was feeling a little slack for me and then i just pick it up and bring it together into a little bowl and then we're going to cover it again and let it rest for an hour an hour later we wet our hands and do one more stretch and fold all the way around the dough is a good bit puffier here and it is extremely aromatic my kitchen smelled fantastic if your dough is fairly tight and not wanting to stretch the sort of wobbling motion that i'm doing here really helps out with getting a good stretch in you can tell that the dough here is a lot stronger than it was before that hour rest during my first stretch and fold it was pretty soft and slack earlier once you get all your stretching folds done all the way around the perimeter same as before form it into a ball cover it up and let it chill out for another half hour this is the pre-shaping stage and it's where you decide if you're going to make a single baguette or two fisell the recipe is or the process is identical you would just split the dough in half for the fusel and it's right here in post that i learned that this camera angle was not nearly as excellent as i thought and you all get a lot of really scintillating elbow footage but regardless the goal here is to pat out your dough fairly flat tug out the corners into a rectangle shape fold over a lip at the top of the rectangle there and very tightly roll the dough down you want to think of this as kind of building tension in the dough really getting good stretching in as you wind it almost like you're winding a spring that tension is what winds up giving it a really good rise in the oven once you get it rolled tight just toss a little flour on your board and leave it seam side down for 20 minutes final shaping is really just more of the same including more elbow shots you flip your dough over seam side up onto a floured board i visibly skipped that step do as i say not as i do pat it out flat and once again roll it tightly down it's going to be a little trickier than in the pre-shaping stage since your dough is probably longer than it was and the gluten is stronger but it should come together just fine once it is fully shaped you can just transfer it to your pan and let it rise one final time until doubled once the dough is doubled we will score it with long thin loaves like these you do several diagonal slashes lengthwise across the loaf and once scored you'll put it into an oven preheated to at least 500 550 if your oven goes that high covered or otherwise utilizing your preferred source of steam for 15 minutes and then uncover or remove your source of steam for another 10 minutes of baking and 25 minutes later at max heat we have a wonderful baguette the ends aren't tapered because i don't like that so don't try to yell at me about authenticity in the comments tapered ends burn unpleasantly and so this is mine and unfortunately the only crumb shot i took is this photo still because i ate it in a furious rampage that would stop for no b-roll but really the texture is wonderful it has a thin and brittle crust almost glass-like but in a good way and the crumb is strong and toothsome it's just a fantastic baguette", "nWmWfT4P-6Q": "hi guys I'm Rick welcome to my kitchen today I make a French bread pizza alright I'm starting out with a large loaf of French bread use any kind of bread you like just make sure it's a large piece and I or watch look I'm going to slice this in half and I have my oven preheating at 400 degrees I have an introduction setting okay now I'm going to take the two halves and cut them in half again and if you have a regal oven it's going to take a little longer than a convection oven but it's all good knees up and I'm going to spread some I pasta sauce here you can also use pizza sauce but I couldn't find it in the store and this is only 95 sentiments big cans so it was a better value alright I finished spreading the sauce on all of my French bread pizza I'm going to top that with some Italian style cheese it's blended Italian cheeses and this is much easier than getting all the cheese and grating it up yourself or you can buy yourself pizza cheese it's just the same works just as well so I'm going to top all these off and this is a three cup package of cheese it should be enough to do two loaves I bought a second loaf I'm going to have to wind up making that into this won't be enough for up me and the kids and wife there's a hand in gonna break all right now that I have these all topped with cheese above that one I bought some pre sliced pepperoni you can put whatever you like on these just watch simple with some pepperoni if you like pepperoni then don't put none on all right I finished topping all of my pizza bread with pepperoni and cheese I'm gonna put this in a 400-degree oven my guess for 10 to 15 so the cheese is all melted and bubbly the pepperonis cooking the bread little crisp up all right my pizza bread baked for about 15 minutes and I just got out of the oven let's go slice it out on a plate this pan out of the way now you know what time it is it's time for the money shot all right there you have it quick and easy french bread pizza give this a try I think you'll like it until next time I'll see you you", "KSilDnUJ7Bw": "hi everyone welcome to best recipes with Sharon this is one of the best homemade French bread recipes it's so soft and tasty you serve it with butter or turn it into a delicious appetizer and everyone is sure to love it and it doesn't take all day to make it either it only takes just a little over an hour and you're done from start to finish so this recipe is for French bread so you start by pre pouring a bunch of your ingredients and bear in mind that you will need boiling hot water for this recipe but you will also need lukewarm water for the yeast to rising so altogether these are the ingredients that you will need to have on hand you will need to have quick rice yeast warm water hot water sugar salt vegetable or canola oil flour and an egg and the egg is just used to do an egg wash on top of your loaves so let's get started here are the recipe amounts start by adding a quarter of a cup of warm water to a bowl and then sprinkle a little bit of white sugar from your pre poured sugar maybe about half a teaspoon this just helps to activate your yeast then add 1 tablespoon of quick rice yeast to this and then set it aside for about 10 minutes to soften then we'll take a separate mixing bowl and start mixing up the dill now this part begins with one cup of hot water then add one teaspoon of white sugar and now half a teaspoon of salt two and a half teaspoons of vegetable oil and finally three cups of flour now go easy on the flour I don't always add the full three cups because I tend to be big on liking my dough to be a little bit sticky until you go to knead it out and that's where I add the extra flour if it needs it and before you mix it too much add the softened to the yeast mixture and of course with the dough hook on your mixer mix it until it's really tacky like this you really have to mix it a fair bit at this point it's great when it's nice and elastic like this and as you can see it's still a little bit sticky that's good so I'm going to cover it for about 10 minutes and let the dough rest for a little bit then you prepare your cookie sheet with a little bit of parchment paper and once the ten minutes is up you can see that the dough is still very sticky so just take that now and turn it onto a floured surface and this is where you can add as much flour as you need to to make it into a soft dough just enough to make it easy to roll I also find it helps to flour your rolling pin a little bit so now to work with the dough it helps to flour your hands as well and then just knead it a little bit and just keep adding enough flour to make it easy to roll out now I'm gonna cut this into three so that I can make smaller loaves now this is entirely up to you you can make just one large loaf or you can cut it into whatever sizes you would prefer the baking time may change based on how large the loaf is though either way you take the dough for each loaf and roll it out like this and you make it into a bit of a rectangle shape this method helps to avoid air pockets in your bread now take and roll it up jelly roll fashion [Music] then pinch the ends and tuck it underneath elope then take a sharp knife and score the top three or four times take your beaten egg and brush the top of your local [Music] then place a loaf on the prepared baking sheet [Music] now do the same with each piece of dough that you have rolling it out into a rectangle and then taking it by the long way and rolling it into jelly roll fashion and placing it on the parchment paper and then of course taking a sharp knife and scoring each loaf like this and the egg wash on top of all three loaves and I like to sprinkle the top of each loaf with a little bit of kosher salt now then you let this dough rise uncovered for about 30 minutes at warm place then pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees place the pan in the oven for about 10 minutes then remove the loaves off of the baking sheet right on to the oven rack and then continue baking for another 10 minutes and this will help to brown up your crust a little bit better and if you want a crispier crust you can place a pan of hot water on the rack about 4 inches below it while it's baking now I didn't do that but I did spray the tops with a little bit of water just to help make a little thicker crust and this turned out really well this bread is so easy to make and so delicious that you're really going to need to try this and remember it's your kitchen you can make the lows as large as you want them to be or as small as you want them to be depending if you want to use it for appetizers or on the side or if you want to make a sandwich out of it go ahead it's your world but cut this while it's hot and have a piece while it's fresh out of the oven there's nothing like it thanks for watching now go make some", "5USW0q1AU4o": "okay after 30 minute the dough are basically had the rest that though the gluten is much more relaxed and now it's easy to shape your bread first we pre shape it then you let it again rest for another five minute and then you can easily roll it out like this length so the first item we are doing is Einstein caption you just prayed it together like that iron strong exception and another kind of Einstein Gyptian one to and sorry here's just a normal roll and a French stick and then you can make five the same size blown and braid it together to itself this would be three on the right side and two on the left side so first you parade the right side and then you just turn it over you flip it over and you played that other side this ensure the whole top is even deeper aided and that's all out of one pocket Oh bread dough okay the last few finish you turn it to the side and finish so and last but not least the bucket now the dough is very nicely relaxed to make it flat turn it to the house make it flat and then you scratch it out to a pocket the ends slightly narrow and finishes your breakfast", "BAFhNmYPm08": "[Music] [Music] you", "fJjPPMGN9b4": "making bread yeast risen bread here's your flour this is a bread flour or high gluten flour water which is temperature controlled it needs to be between 100 and 110 degrees Fahrenheit for the active dry yeast here to become active salt and some flour to dust your work surface with so active dry yeast goes into the warm water it's very important that the water is temperature controlled if the temperature of the water gets above 110 degrees Fahrenheit you run the risk of killing the yeast simply dissolve that in the water and then you'll let it bloom for about 10 minutes making sure the yeast is active before you mix it with the rest of the ingredients so about 10 minute later you can see this yeast is definitely active it's created a large amount of foam on top of the water salt goes in with the flour never in with the yeast and water salt inhibits yeast kills it so the water in the yeast go in with the flour in the salt now it doesn't look like there's enough water in there for how much flour but if your recipe or bread formula is correct and you've scaled all your ingredients correctly the flour should be able to drink up that amount of water just fine so what we're doing here is we're just kind of mixing it into a coarse ball of dough more you squeeze this the more water takes more flour from the bowl is going to become part of the coarse ball of dough so you'll dust your work surface with a little bit of flour that's probably a little bit more than necessary so kneading you'll fold it over onto itself and press that seam together and then you'll turn it 90 degrees and then up towards you turn the fold towards you and then fold it over on itself turn it 90 degrees up towards you fold it on itself press the seam each time and you'll continue this action until your course ball of dough becomes a smooth ball of dough it doesn't need to be completely smooth at this point there's still a few more stages left before the loaf goes in the oven what's happening here is the glutens are being stretched folded if you can imagine a rubber band being stretched folded and then stretched and then fold it on itself many times essentially the same thing is happening to the strands of gluten or proteins in the flour there's much more science involved in bread making than could fit in one instructional video so this is about where I'd want to need it - you're gonna want to protect it from the air you can either spray it with some oil rub it with some olive oil then cover it with plastic wrap I usually just cover it with a mixing bowl just like that let it ferment for about an hour hour and a half this one's been sitting here for about an hour and 10 minutes you can see all the gas is built up t gas it or punch down basically knocking out all the carbon dioxide that's been produced by the yeast and then you'll read it again this time it should get even smoother than the first time and you'll want to finish with kind of a pre shape for whatever you're finished loaf shape is gonna be since this is going to be a baguette I'll start it as like a little oval like a football shape traditionally in France it's called a batard and that kind of gives it a little head start into becoming the shape that it's going to be now you let the glutens relax for about 10-15 minutes Houten's have relaxed you can see it's risen a little bit again if I were to try to roll this out without letting the glutens relax the it's just going to want to stretch back to its batard shape so now that they're relaxed I should be able to just roll across it in an even motion maintaining the same diameter as I go slowly bringing my hands to the outsides of it and then tapering it off at the ends do that until you have the length desired so this pan is specially designed for baking baguettes or French bread it's got a curved surface what's the bread retain its round shape as it proofs and bakes so just situate that right in the pan like this this is a la Mei it's a special knife with a sort of curved razor blade on it designed for making the scores that you see in the tops of loaves of bread you should be able to just drag it swiftly in a straight line across it the curve of the blade lets it cut around the round shape of the top of the loaf this will allow some of the steam to escape during baking it'll also give it a nice attractive appearance the next step would be to proof your loaf we have a proofing cabinet here off and on switch current temperature inside the cabinet the red dial controls the temperature this switch will switch its function from proofing bread or holding food or say a catering you can put trays of food in here and keep them hot for service if it's on proof this moisture reservoir there's an element under it causing water to evaporate up into the cabinet you'll want to proof bread in a hot humid environment so ideally the temperature of the proof box would be around 90 92 100 degrees a good amount of humidity so this is a steam injected oven very similar to a convection oven your thermostat set here timer this particular model has a roast and hold function which will roast or bake something and then when it gets the timer finishes it'll hold it at a certain temperature the steam button very important for bread and lights so the breads been proofing for about 35 minutes and it's definitely almost doubled in size from when we put it in there you can see the scoring done with the LeMay very clearly let's put that into the oven and steam it for 20-25 seconds the steam reacts on the surface of the bread and as the dextrans are evaporated it gives it a nice brown crust here's the finished loaf here still hot so we're not going to cut into it as you can see it as a nice crust sounds hollow fairly attractive scoring that's it local bread", "fAGMxuGuAHg": "so when I Covidien showing how I form these baguettes so what would you at first as we I roll these out lengthwise get all the air out of them like this mmm stretch them a little bit fold them in half like this and I stretch them the other way and then I roll them out you want kind of a rectangular type shape then on these you want to roll them really tight getting the air out will cause the crumb to be more even and fine when it proofs up again and I I like to roll away from me but you can roll towards you and what I'm doing is I'm picking up stretching it and then tucking it there's a little bit of stretch before I roll it here and then I just keep that tension on there so what you're really looking for is kind of like a hotdog shape this should be round cylindrical so there and then what you do is you're gonna roll it between your palms just to seal the ends there and that's about and these will expand you know I'll grow out to be like maybe that long and that high about a hundred grams each fold it in half roll it the other way lots of ways to form baguettes this is just one way that I've found out that works well they don't using a bench flour so it's able to stick this is some granite tile that I'm using so now you've got like a rectangular shape it doesn't matter that your ends aren't square because as you're rolling these up you can kind of control you can push the dough around see all I'm doing is I'm I'm stretching it rolling it tight and you want to roll it tight like that without breaking the skins than you have then you can tuck the ends and if you want now don't put like that that's it", "j7Vlo1Me4gs": "hi its Martin in Harlow and today I want to spend some time talking about shaping and showing some shaping if you've been following the videos you've seen Arlo sort of getting his hands dirty he can appreciate pretty well and today we're gonna work on baguettes a little bit there's gonna be a fair amount of watching him watching me and we're gonna get him involved some too but we're gonna try and keep it kind of short so let's just jump in all right I've got a bunch of dough at least for our house it looks like a bunch of dough I've got about maybe 10 kilos which I hope feels like a lot that's quite a bit of dough right now going over 20 pounds and I've already pre shaped everything today because the pre shaped form is basically the same whether we're making a tube or mid-war or we're making a round it's very similar to the way that I do final shaping and I think that for the sake of keeping it as straightforward as possible I'm going to stick to those basic forms should I say before I start maybe I should say that there are a lot of ways to shape and if you've watched any of these videos and you've watched me shape you have heard me say that shaping is a destination how we get there you know you can take the scenic route you can go as fast as possible my experience has been in the professional bakery and so I tend to take the shortest route because in the bakery we try and get as much done in the shortest amount of time it's just the nature of bakery work is that we work with a lot of no we move quickly so all right so I have some baguettes which are divided and already pre shaped and I did two different styles of appreciate I did a round pre shape and I a more tubular or rectangular appreciate you can go either way in my experience I think it's easier sometimes for people in the home environment to work with a wround appreciate for Baggett's as opposed to a rectangular appreciate and if you have questions about that you can jump into the comments and myself and a bunch of other people who are experienced bakers are watching the comments and we're trying to be as helpful as possible as we can but a lot of baking involves actually doing it and so it's important to sort of get your mental game that also just get your hands in there and make some mistakes which I have made plenty of so this is a like home size baguette it's about 250 grams give or take in the bakery environment a lot of baguettes are in the 400 gram range so these are kind of short okay so come on in here Anthony the first one I'll do is as I said a baguette and this bag app was a tubular pre shape it was a pre shape that I made almost like you would make a pan loaf and you're gonna see me shape some of those so if you're wondering how I made this appreciate stick around okay so I put the dough on the bench the bench is lightly floured people have been asking questions about surfaces what's the best surface blah blah blah wood is my favorite surface what is for me like the surface that goes with bread and that having been said you can shape on just about anything I don't care for working on a surface one of our bakers who's answering questions on the hotline Jonathan Christic said any surface which you can use a bench scraper on and I thought that was brilliant so yes any surface that you can use a bench scraper on is a good surface for working on my favorite of all is wood but I don't have wood today so we have lemon so let's make a bad guy maybe I'll just do it without talking once maybe that's impossible maybe I have to talk okay I'm gonna fold it like a letter I'm basically folding it like a letter there's my letter and if you look you can see that I'm trying to maintain straight lines here I don't have something that looks like a wave I want it to be as sort of architectural as possible with square lines if I can start here and make things even then when I get to the final phase of elongated it it's going to be even so I made my letter and now I make a little divot and then I bring it to the leading edge and I pressed a seal that's one way to shape and that's the way that I've shaped more baguettes than are worth counting once I get to that point I roll for a second in the middle until it's down to about the diameter that I want and then I go in with both hands and I just roll until it's tapered I gave through a little bit of flour if you've got a little bit of a scene that's opening that's good and then we're there that is about as long as I can make in this home oven I think it's in there like yeah it's like 12 inches that's about what I can do at home and bakeries we're usually doing about 26 inches you know 54 56 centimetres somewhere in that range you can see that I don't have a bunch of flour on the bench you cannot shape on that much flour it does not work for good bread for some things which are not tapered which are just cutting divided it's okay but you just need a sheen of dough okay this one was around pre-shaped and you can see that I've got a little bit more space to work with here I've got a little bit more space to work with here when I'm doing my folds and I find that some home bakers find that a little bit easier so I Pat it and I'm gonna do the same one that you saw me do before if it feels like it's sticky a little bit just pick up the dough piece and find a little bit of flour and bring it back so here's my letter kind of in the same place I was before now because I have a little bit more real estate here I think that I can go down twice and so let me show you what I'll do I've got a little divot in the middle we're not gonna come down all the way the first time now I am so come all the way down I press and seal away turn the dough over and if it's a little sticky I go find some flour and I come back with that same motion hand in the middle fingers and heel my palm against the bench you want to hear that swishing sound when you're rolling baguettes if you don't hear that swishy sound you know that your hand is just floating and if your hand is just floating all the pressure of your hand is going on to the dough and we're not trying to match anything here it's really more a motion of rolling it back and forth so there we are seam is right there seam is there faintly visible and I'm gonna put it on my Koosh seam up I have some Baker's linen kicking around that's what that gray stuff is if you've been watching I also have some lengths of this canvas which is just painter's canvas from an art store and it works really well for holding baguettes let me do let me see here maybe I do one more of each kind yeah one more of each time briefly okay so here's my round pre-shape little pat and make a letter and one thing I'll say about sheathing is that you should pretend that you're good at it like even if you're not good at it and there are days where I'm not good at it there are days where I make shapes that aren't as pretty as they could be but it's one of those tasks and you'll find this is true when you're scoring loads as well it's good to pretend that you're good at it believe that you are and you'll shoot better and you'll score better too okay so I've got my little letter form divot in the middle and then all the way to the leading edge roll it back and forth and a little bit of taper yeah if you see some little inconsistencies in it don't worry about it remember that this is like a balloon that hasn't been blown up and once the gas begins to fill that structure it blows up and it becomes a more uniform shape so don't don't freak out I always say that baguettes are like the triple salchow of baking because they sort of combine everything that we want to be good at and it can take time to get to where to get to where you feel confident I'll show you one other way to do this and we call it I call it stitching or like the sewing machine method and you'll see this out there if you look at some of the videos on the King off their YouTube page a lot of professional Baker's like this method and I like it too I tend to move around and shape different ways depending on what the dough feels like it needs so this is like a sewing machine method where the thumb goes in and this and the heel of the palm seals and I just go down like that like I said lots of paths to the same destination I think if you go through a board of baguettes I don't think you're gonna be able to pick out the ones that I see it well did I shaped like that all right so there are some baguettes no okay two more pan loaves okay so if you were wondering how we do the tubular pre-shape this is how we do the tubular appreciate but I think this is a good method for anybody who's shaking pan bed pan bread like if the first bread that you make is dope that's going into a loaf pan I think this is a pretty good way to do it so dough is on the bench and what I like to do is begin by bringing in the sides and if you've watched our video Arlo and I did a video on our Jeff bread which is like a pan loaf you'll see me shaping this exact same way so I bring the sides in and now I have a nice square form and I just start bringing it down press in to seal away fold press it push it away like that you see how that's getting some tension all I'll come over here once you do one okay okay so there's the first one put them in the pan this is a some people asked about these pans this is a Pullman pan it's the shorter version of a Pullman I think it's I'm not gonna say the size because I want to secure it up and then that's not what he used this is a Pullman pan you'll find them around it's not a full-size Pullman it's a shorter Pullman that's about 900 grams there okay come on your buddy did you watch me do that yes have it memorized you want me to stand over your shoulder yep yeah and then press down like you want it to stay there yeah and you want to see if you can make those sides as square as possible yeah man now from the top and member hands his paddles like don't get no magic fingers Kansas battles it's a little sticky right yes a little sticky come up and press and steal away yep that's good and you don't have to press like you only have to press with the amount of pressure that it takes to seal it you don't have to stick your fingers into the dough so up and press and seal yep keep doing that until you're all the way down yeah or you can just take your heel and seal your the heel of your hand and seal it so turn over here and then just go in there and just seal it like that yep just as hard as it only as hard as it will take to see looks like if you pressed too hard it will get sticky you see what I mean yeah there you go you see how that you got a lot more tender with your touch that was perfect yeah and then drop that sucker in there get it in there is it stuck a little bit it's okay so you're putting it in there seam down which is perfect now once it's in there it's looking their anthem you see how it looks a little lumpy it's not quite right right do you see how the ends coming up wait you train on there so she can see do you see how this is up watch this just fix it and then get your knuckles in there and press it down no one's gonna know the difference between our love's promise you it's gonna rise and be perfect okay I'm gonna do this last one quickly cuz I'm trying to make this video a little bit shorter okay so one more time pan low I've got kind of a round massive dough I come in from the sides press and seal I'm degassing as I touch it just a little bit and then I come down from the top root if you see these rounds at the end some sometimes those aren't that attractive but what you can do is just come down with your hands and kind of just give them a little bit of a chop and everybody's gone you're good to go boom dough goes in the pan and I give it a little bit of a press just to make sure that it's nice and even in there and then I set it aside to proof okay next flour I'm flowering this Koosh because it hasn't been used that much and so you want to make sure that you have some flour in there otherwise that you were going to stick set these guys aside okay so what I want to do is show bool and batard did I see bullying batard yes bullying Betar okay so I don't we bring two more of those over here and just handle them gently because at this point we're trying to be real gentle with them and that boards just kind of balanced on there so be careful okay if you've watched us shape roles if you've watched this pre shape around you'll recognize what I'm gonna do here so working from the outside folding to the middle outside to middle outside to middle and I'm just going around until I feel like there's some tension at and then I turn it around or over and then I give it a little bit of tension nice round form do a couple more outside the middle hold on one second outside the middle outside two middle turn it over and round why don't you start on that one or low and then do that one and then I'm gonna start I'm gonna do avatar I'll do some photographer quick if you are watching the video and you're thinking man I'm glad they covered that but I wish they would tether that other thing I wish they would do a video about that other thing or that other dough or that recipe or process for shaping technique or whatever it is please list it in the comments and we're listening and we're looking for ideas because we're only so creative here okay now you're good yeah you did there now I want you to do this I want you to do this shape that we've done a little bit more you pull towards you okay try this try this well you make the little dents and you turn it you want to try the you want to do the other one okay that's good let it move a little bit in your hand just a little bit as you're turning it so as you're pulling it let it move around see how it's rolling in my hands just a little bit try and keep it to where the seam is on the bottom but you can really move like that yeah you feel it feel the tension of the surface definitely yeah okay so keep moving it and let it travel a little bit watch me let it move something yeah yep and if you're having problems with that technique so set that one aside you're having problems with that technique do this one hands as a fence pull it towards you until you still see it start to tension and then turn it like that give me a nice strong form okay all right there are those now in the left here what I want to do is I want to show you I'll show you the target so we've done pan low we've done some baguettes kind of like this is like a quick hit on each of these shapes don't Pamela we've done some baguettes we did some fools here and now I'm gonna show you a guitar okay so lots of ways to shape a petard I just like with everything else let me show you one method and then maybe I'll do a couple repeats so you can see it so batard I start at the top and I come down press gently to seal now I have these kind of dough shoulders that I bring in like that press to seal I have a relatively uniform form it's kind of a mirror of itself on either side which is what I want and I start at the top come down press the seal press to seal press the seal and so I kind of got this tubular shape right now which is what I want and now the only part that remains is to give it a little bit of taper that wasn't my best one let me try another one it's gonna come out in the wash you won't know that that one wasn't my favorite one no one will know but I will know so no one but me okay you might know too huh all right top down shoulders in bringing this head down sometimes if it looks a little flabby here I'll fold it in and I'll turn it over basically I'm trying to get to that tubular sort of form that's okay we've got a bake all this bread getting that and wound up okay I had that kind of tubular form and now I just tension it some flour on it before I put it on the Juche and we're good to go let me get a couple more here okay here we go tubular form then I just tension it I think people are gonna tell me to slow down I should try one slow except like I said with shaking you kind of have to pretend that you know what you're doing because it will enable your hands to move at a pace which is appropriate for shaping if you move too slowly when you're shaping you're gonna find yourself getting stuck in the dough the good news here is that baking is fun practice is fun and even though or bread which doesn't have as much beauty as you might like is edible and it's good exactly who cares okay so I got that kind of tubular form I start in the middle and I taper there we go and I'm gonna put it on the couch with the seam side up and these will be ready to load and maybe an hour or so we gotta fill this stuff any other okay I hope that was helpful it felt like a little bit of a sprint but maybe that's because we've been making longer videos if there's something that you want to see or something you'd like to see again or slower or in a different way or explained differently just speak up we're here we're not going anywhere as it would seem so we're glad that you could join us today and we look forward to seeing you back here again soon Cheers", "UgbxPUBUrYo": "[Music] [Music] of strong red flower so we can put this off in which is 2.5 grams mix that in alright when we mix it [Music] until tomorrow it will me to finish your packets already wet your hands a little bit so you can scrape off you might make it the dough from your spoon and what I'm gonna do is now mix it all by hand okay say up spoon lemme know that I'm the man the man right papa as you can see that is basically it I'm gonna wet my hands so there it is so that is your initial mix that is your first mix okay so let's go over this start tapas Pelican akansha after 30 minutes all right so 30 minutes yes sure what we're gonna do it's stretching food at one end stretch JP and fold it onto itself and then get one hand stretch gently and fold it onto itself just don't stretch it too far now what people need shop okay and then stretch it again and then fold it to itself and stretch it again and fold it onto itself if you want to fold him on a smaller just at the end let me do so better than mug for my ball it's not needed really but I do this Kisei so I can flip the door over like that Oh a couple a muffin on smooth surface it's a lot smoother no man then third year you back so that is the first fold the bar mother allow let's cover it again set the time up I'm gonna do this for an hour test a melamine salmon Belle Epoque single one thirty minutes is good enough so setting time Urkel here we are stretching for the cake opinion it's a lot smoother now yeah ma ha relax machine yeah no no don't cheese nice they're over again we set that in your timer to another 30 minutes yeah the lips come back for it later on simple and cutting boiled flour surface okay and then just slightly dusting it we can stretch this you bar if you're very specific like running without your friends we've this one I don't think I'm playing sighs now but get snow in my case no just I'm just going to eat this by myself if not with my husband so I'm just gonna slice this into half alright so I've divided this into two now let me show you my shaking just make sure you have enough power on the side again so you can just touch it okay so I have two pieces of five the flattened collection and again I'm using my fingers the big circle what the flick totally just okay so you just roll take that you press it the parama lock [Music] stop doing that fashion opinion down this is my pre shaping it's pretty simple nothing fancy the opposite to you mom open recess I just crimp it then just spread the floor like that but I need a shot to make it so let's do the other side okay it's just rolling press roll and press I just gonna add a little bit more flour so it won't stick to the bottom a little bit reason for that is because and reset my timer 20 minutes after 20 minutes that Vito II should shake the latitia so this is what you call pre shaping and then we'll come back after 20 minutes okay so it's ready [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you you hey so adding crimps new cream so with just a regular tea towel let's just dust this generously with flour I don't have any do nothing eat more on the sides and in the middle okay so we're gonna transfer it here pour on the side but I need to make it just let it open so you stock cream on the side and then all we have to do is lift this up in the middle pull that one and this one and go make C Pitka you can do that to hold the shape but I don't want that I just need to offer that and then give this again for half an hour so let's set a timer to half an hour and then let's come back for that so that's 30 minutes there [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "M1v6DuozTlg": "a stand mixer is a must-have for any serious Baker here we'll show how to use our kitchenaid professional 600 to make soft and delicious mini French baguettes to make baguettes you will need just four ingredients two and a half teaspoons of instant yeast such as Red Star quick rise found at Whole Foods one pound or three and a half cups of all-purpose flour 12 ounces or one and a half cups of lukewarm water and one and a half teaspoons of fine salt step 1 make the dough add three and a half cups of all-purpose flour to the bowl of a stand mixer add one and a half teaspoons of fine salt it's two and a half teaspoons of instant yeast give it a quick stir fit the stand a mixer with the dough hook attachment start the standing mixer on low speed slowly add to the flour mixture one and a half cups of lukewarm water if after all the water is added you see that the flour along the edges is not being incorporated simply stop the mixer and use a spatula to push the flour to the center of the mixing bowl this is sometimes necessary when using the KitchenAid Pro 600 because the large mixing bowl is designed to handle a much larger quantity of ingredients than we are currently using start the mixer again and increase the speed to medium when most of the flour has been incorporated into the dough ball it's time to need increase the mixer to high speed and knead the dough ball for six minutes during the knead the dough will become very sticky if the dough seems a touch too sticky feel free to add a bit more flour at the end of the knead the dough ball will be still sticky and partly wrapped around the dough hook like this time for the first rise transfer the dough ball to a well floured surface pull the edges of the dough to the center like this a nicely shaped dough ball helps us get a good rise flour the dough ball on both sides then transfer to a large mixing ball seam side down cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel plastic wrap works great for easy cleanup place the dough in a warm or sunny spot and let it rise until doubled in size this will take one to two hours after doubled in size it's time to shape the baguettes many recipes call for transferring the shape to baguettes to a well floured towel or a baguette tray we find parchment paper to be equally effective and easier for cleanup cut a large sheet of parchment paper and make a fold widthwise every four to five inches this creates space for each baguette to rise without risking getting stuck to its neighbor with your parchment paper ready let's begin transfer the dough ball to a well floured surface flour both sides well and divide the dough into six equal pieces for each piece of dough shaped like this flatten the dough into a rectangle about a third of an inch high pull the edges of the dough to the center repeatedly alternating sides stretching the dough lengthwise it's actually really fun and surprisingly easy when you get the hang of it to make shorter baguettes as shown here stretch the dough until it reaches a length of seven to eight inches we love shorter fatter baguettes which are great for sandwiches and have more of the soft chewy Center for which the baguette is famous but if you prefer longer thinner baguettes stretch the dough until it reaches 10 to 11 inches flour well and transfer to the parchment paper here's an even closer look [Music] repeat until you have six perfectly formed baguettes you may even want to divide the bagasse between two cookie sheets cover the baguettes loosely with plastic wrap or you will flower towel and now it's time for the second rise let the form two baguettes rise until doubled in size about another hour after the second rise transfer the baguettes to the cookie sheets you plan to use to bake since handling and picking up the baguettes tends to result in them deflating using parchment paper is also a great way to separate and transfer the baguettes without touching the actual dough using the parchment paper you can simply cut around each baguette and position using the parchment paper without touching the actual dough finally it's time to bake score each baguette four to five times with a sharp knife in a preheated 500 degree oven place a dish below the rack or racks where you intend to bake the baguettes immediately after placing the baguettes in the oven throw two ice cubes into the dish the ice cubes will produce the scene necessary to create a chewy inside any crispy outside close the oven door and drop the temperature to 475 degrees bake for six minutes then flip the baguettes if you're baking two cookies she's over at a time now is also the time to swap the cookie sheet positions on the wraps remove the top cookie sheet to the bottom rack and vice versa to offer even cooking as you flip the baguettes the parchment paper will likely come off and that's fine just remove it from the oven bake the baguettes for another five minutes after the five minutes the baguettes are considered par baked which means they are baked enough to freeze after cooling or you can even eat the baguettes par-baked if you prefer the baguettes softer as we do if you prefer your Bhagat's crispy turn them over one more time and bake directly on the oven rack for five more minutes if baking par baked frozen baguettes finish them off by baking them directly on the oven rack at 450 degrees for 10 minutes enjoy as a gourmet sandwich bread or as a side to soup or pasta [Music]", "bxEn57Ke-mg": "[Music] hello everyone welcome back to my channel and today yes i do have a dough it's a bread dough and we're gonna make some french baguettes so i do have a dough that's mixed and i will have ingredients in description below if you would like to see how i mix them together and before the dough is proofing you can refer to one of my previous videos which is bread rolls or bread sticks and i have also the artisan bread um so right now what i'm gonna do i will um divide into the equal pieces with my scale and process with the baguettes so here they are i have divided um my dough into three equal sizes and they are 280 grams each usually the french baguette it's about 250 grams or so but since i have more dough i'm gonna go ahead with 280 each and i will go ahead and start rolling baguette so what you do actually you take one of these um little dough balls and then you just stretch it a little and then you go ahead and start rolling and pushing this end in so it forms [Music] into the tight tight dough baguette and then what i do i actually pinch the seam on the bottom and i leave it like that so i'm gonna go ahead and do that with every single one so here we go [Music] we are stretching the dough and then once you do stretch it a little you start [Music] rolling in and pinching and pushing back so that's where you have that tight baguette on the end i'll just go like that [Music] and now i have my baguettes rolled and what i'm gonna do i'll take one as you can see and start stretching so i'm pushing from the middle to the edge so when i take this whole baguette i'm pushing from the middle to the ends and [Music] you want to go ahead and stretch baguette depends on the size of the baking on the sides of the baking dish and here we have one um and i'm gonna go ahead and put it into the onto the paper and then i'll do the second one so same way stretching from the middle towards the ends so you have to go ahead and stretch it [Music] and always make sure that your seam it's on the bottom once you um put it on the onto the baking dish and here they are after you form the french baguettes you're going to go ahead and put them and put them into the baking dish so what i did um i do have this flat baking um dish that i'm putting always on for a bread or any rolls or cookies anything like that but this is what i want to show you if you do not have one of those pens that they're specifically for french baguettes you can go ahead put the parchment paper and make this little um dividers once that's a very simple thing to do you just put your paper in and then once you put your baguette you go ahead and make these little dividers by moving the paper forward and then after they proof for 2 30 to 40 minutes i'm gonna go ahead um we do have to uh score the baguettes and um 30 to 40 minutes after proofing i will go ahead and bake them and i'll show you the next step so basically they are going to proof right now and here they are after 40 minutes of proofing they are ready for oven make sure you score them and also i'm gonna use and brush them with water and i'll put them in the oven to bake at 4 25 and i will let you know how long they have baked so i'll see you later and here they are the baguettes the french baguettes are done they're right out of the oven they baked 27 minutes i will put the temperature down in the description below and they're very very hot but they're perfectly baked and i want to show you since i cannot hold them up they're so hot after i'm gonna go ahead and transfer them to cooling rack but i wanna just for you to hear the sound and it's nice crust around and very soft inside so i will actually slice it in a half once they cool a little bit and i'll show you inside as well so now i'm gonna go ahead and transfer them to the cooling rack [Music] and after 27 minutes of baking we have beautiful french baguettes here they are so beautiful as you can see and thank you for watching i'll see you next time make sure [Music] you", "C9Lde75WiMk": "[Music] get a flower on top of the dome spread it a little bit you gotta be aware that the dough is pretty sticky at this stage of the five days so you have to be very quick from handle a little bit of flour helps of course so double fold and the third one come in on top of it seal it and just roll it out job done it was points so you start rolling in the middle pushing it outwards and there does lovely forget point at the end put the seam down with parchment paper and that's it [Music] okay pre-shape in the bucket into a sausage shape use the spatula or your hands by tucking under this wonderful the dough is very lightly and quite fussy okay next one so just quick little calendar and the least sausage shape that's ready okay let's shake the baguettes you turn it upside down and then you spread it a little bit you see it's not sticky at all because of the cheese and the oils in the cheese there we go so over your thumb this gives you a nice tension as well as really even fold it okay over your thumb get the point there and then another form here and that's it get rid of the bodies and then quick stretch out [Music] next turn you forget upside down what make it to square make sure it's quite even even they spread the tension and then you just fold it over your thumb like that ok 1 2 3 [Music] [Music] they say no stickiness at all and now just stretch it out Li to be starting in the middle and moving outwards and then make that point when we get there and that's [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "tEKUizxH34w": "hello everyone chef Kim here today I'm going to show you how to make French bread in a food processor now this is pretty simple but it's important for me to show you what the dough should look like so anyway let's start with warm water it should be Oh about a hundred and ten degrees which is a little warmer than your body temperature and then we're going to sprinkle not just dump but sprinkle the yeast and and just regular use do not get the instant use use a whisk or a fork and just stir it up now a lot of yeast breads you have to wait until this mixture gets foamy but you don't when it comes to making the French bread in the food processor I have bread flour very important do not use all-purpose flour your product will come out very inferior so invest it's not any more expensive in the bread flour I also have olive oil and salt that's it a true French bread just has that no sugar at all in it now let's go ahead and we're going to add the yeast mixture now in the recipe I will always say two to three three to four whatever always start with the lesser number you can always add more flour but it's hard to take it away you can fix it if you add too much but let me tell you it's easier to do it the other way so let's turn it on then we're going to just add our water and a slow steady screen let's just whisk it just a little more sometimes some of it gets stuck at the bottom the rest now listen you've got the right amount now the machine is doing the kneading for now it doesn't always work perfect for the video now let's stop it and let me show you okay now look at what it's doing to my hand see how it's sticking it's still too sticky it's it needs to have a little more flour added to it so that's okay but we're pretty close to the perfect amount but when you have any residue on your fingers that means it's a little too wet you need to add some more flour so add like a tablespoon or two at a time and repeat let it go for a little bit you can tell when it's closed you can hear it boom boom and see it there's no residue in here on the sides I think it's about right now look see nothing that's how you can tell it's soft but it's not sticking to my fingers I think that was from before okay I'm back let it go for another 30 seconds and you can see the dough isn't Isis nice and soft and it's not tacky tacky means it's sticking to your fingers but it's not okay so what we're going to do now is take a greased Bowl I just use olive oil or the pan spray just roll it make sure it gets coated and then we'll wrap it either with a warm towel or some plastic wrap and then keep it in a warm place for about an hour so the bread dough has been rising for about an hour in a warm place and as you can see it is doubled so we are ready to finish it make it into a loaf so take it out onto your counter here's what we're going to do we want to make it into a rectangle okay doesn't have to be perfect but like that so once you get it into a rectangle very important the way I do this next part you don't just roll it up because when you bake that bread and cut into it it's going to be full of holes so this is very important and it takes practice so you want to start rolling very tightly go from one end to the other and then go back okay and I'm kind of rolling and pinching as you can see okay and don't worry if it's not exactly even you can kind of stretch and pull and tuck in the ends okay here's the bread or the dough still getting ready to put into the oven as you can tell it has risen if you look at the slits you can see how they're spread open more okay so my bread is nice and golden brown now way you can test it to to see if it's done obviously it looks done on the bottom too but tap it should sound hollow now it's not perfect I told you it's been a few years since I baked a loaf but I betcha it's going to taste great and I'm sure yours will too so thanks everyone for watching the French bread recipe demonstration I hope you're going to try and make this bread I know it's so easy to go to the store and you can buy a loaf of French bread but maybe some time on your day off with your significant other if you feel like playing around and trying it out it's a pretty easy bread to learn to make so anyway good luck thanks for watching happy baking you", "o4ABOKdHEUs": "let me show you something this is what pizza dough looks like if you age it in the refrigerator for a week and this is the loaf of bread that I just baked with it my kids call it pizza bread it is insanely crispy and flavorful sure people have been making something similar for centuries using a sourdough starter or biga or some other kind of pre ferment but the thing is none of that is really necessary anymore in the age of refrigeration the easy way these days is to mix up some dough throw it in the fridge and forget about it for a while just as the easy way to make and run a website these days is with Squarespace the sponsor of this video to get your website fermenting go to squarespace.com and when you're ready to take it out of the oven and published it use my link and code down in the description you'll save 10% I'm gonna show you how pizza dough changes as it ages in the fridge day by day for a week and how that aging will get you different baked results got to start with a giant batch of my standard pizza dough recipe half a cup of warm water with two teaspoons of sugar and two teaspoons of yeast stir it around and let it bloom for five minutes just to make sure the yeast is still alive if you want to live dangerously you can skip this step all right four cups more water go in two more tablespoons of sugar two tablespoons of salt big glug of olive oil maybe a quarter cup stir it around that's trippy then I'll start with ten cups of bread flour anticipating that I'll probably add more flour as I knead bring it together as far as possible with the spatula and then I'll get in there with my hand pizza dough has a better flavor and texture when it's really wet and sticky so I'm just adding just enough flour to make kneading possible yes I'm exploring options for no-knead pizza dough recipes and just haven't gotten one to work yet to my satisfaction not chewy enough you want to knead this until you can stretch it thin without it tearing like that that took me seven minutes all right eight sample containers glass is best it will not leach out chemicals during the long rise a little olive oil and each may be more than the pros would use but having a dough that's coated in oil will help it Brown at home oven temperatures that's also why the sugar is in there to enhance browning and this is one of the rare times that I will use a food scale zero out the weight of the bowl then weigh the dough and divide by eight circa 300 grams of dough is good for one 12 or 13 inch pizza or one pizza bread which is what we're making this time I normally don't bother with weighing things but this is where it really helps you when you're cooking at an almost commercial scale our human brain has a great intuitive sense for small quantities but when things get big not so much hard to eyeball I'll use each ball to oil its container the soiling itself in the process cover it can be sealed the east' have enough air in there and let's label them samples 2 through 8 goes straight in the fridge sample number 1 let's just let it rise on the table for two hours and then let's take it out and bake it straight away this is the bottom side of the dough which I've now got facing up on the plate and note how it looks exactly the same as the top side very smooth and here's how you make what my kids call pizza bread coat the surface with plenty of olive oil grind on pepper Shaco ver plenty of garlic powder and then sprinkle on a good amount of really big crunchy flaky salt my pizza stone has been preheating for half an hour at maximum convection oven temperature my pizza steel tends to burn this bread and I just pulled the stone out of it and drop on the dough bake it until it's brown 7 or 8 minutes pull it off with tongs onto a cooling rack and there it is bottoms nice I cut it once lengthwise and then into a bunch of little strips note how big those bubbles are on the inside remember that it tastes ok but the flavor is just kind of bland and the texture is very soft and pillowy it's not crispy and it's only a little chewy this is an inferior product 24 hours later the dough's in the frig have risen a lot despite the fact that we threw them in there straight away some people say you got a rise them at room temperature for an hour or so before you refrigerate but that is manifestly not necessary don't um Bert ooh comes out and look at the underside it's a rougher it's kind of bubbly now that rough surface holds more oil and goes crisp in the oven olive oil pepper garlic powder salt dropped the dough on it's so much easier to handle when it's cold it's stiffer bake it at 550 Fahrenheit or whatever your oven can manage until Brown and note the bubble structure this time it's finer a slow cold rise gets you the same amount of air but it's divided among a larger number of all our bubbles and for pizza crust I prefer that texture flavor is still a little bit flat but the texture is a bit less pillowy we're getting a bit of crunch a little bit of chew sample number three forty-eight hours of cold rise dough is a little stickier and it's starting to smell a bit like beer stretch it into a little oval top it throw it on the stone you want to be careful about not letting the garlic powder burn which happens really easily and it tastes nasty if I see a few grains turning black out it comes cut it up texture is still a little pillowy in a bad way but the flavor is now improved getting that yeasty fermented flavor sample number four 72 hours of cold rise dough is getting really sticky and look at how uneven that underside is nice bubbly surface that'll hold oil and bake up crisp you gotta bake this dough bottom side up plop I usually drop it on rather than deliver it with a pizza peel because the oil tends to make it stick to the peel out it comes and you can hear the surface is getting much crispier I would guess that this is due to the starches breaking down as it ferments breaking down into simpler sugars that caramelize more readily in the oven but that's just a guess it's starting to get that glassy top though love it it's hump day midpoint of the experiment Doe number five four days of cold rise and this is when I start to notice a delicious smell like ripe banana both when it's raw and when it's cooked oh that looks like the Millennium Falcon don't sue me Lucasfilm sample number six five days cold rise and look how gooey that dough is looking if it wasn't cold it would be all but impossible to handle I undertake that one a little bit but the flavor is still insane it's got that ripe banana note funky complex great stuff the penultimate example six days of coal dries out it comes and that top is getting so crispy it's also notable how much chewy or the interior is with a wet dough given enough time gluten kind of develops itself basically needs your dough for you some more in the fridge and now the finale a full week of cold rise dough is super gooey and sticky it would be impossible to handle if it weren't cold underside is now the top look at how craggy it is oil just soaks in there careful about the pepper you can really taste its spice in this don't use more than you'd like good coating of garlic powder you could use fresh garlic but that'd just be a different flavor the powder gives you more of an umami taste I think and you got to use some big flaky salt the texture is amazing with that at this point the dough is so soft that is hard to handle even cold at stuck on the way down there you go seven or eight minutes later out it comes underside is brown my pizza steel tends to make it black I prefer the stone for this and you want to hear how crispy that top is now let me get the mic nice and the flavor I mean you could say that it's like sourdough but as a matter of semantics it is sourdough right could you get a similar result using the traditional sourdough starter probably but do you want to get a starter going feed it once or twice a day for a week and then have to keep it alive in the corner like a goldfish in perpetuity or do you want to mix up some dough throw it in the fridge and just forget about it for awhile I'm going the easy way and while I could also code a website by hand I have some

today we're going to talk about making baguettes uh baguettes french bread um what we're making is not a whole lot like what you get in the store that's marked as french bread uh this is a little more rustic it's a lean bread which means it's flour salt water and yeast don't have eggs milk butter anything like that all right i actually started this last night with a pre-ferment what we call a poolish because it's very liquid poolish when you're working with bread when at all possible time is your ally so use it well uh this is the poolish from last night so what i've got is a 210 grams of purpose flour i could also use a bread flour 210 grams of cool water and a pinch of yeast i use instant yeast there are different kinds you can use but i would not recommend using rapid rise because it works fast and then dies out so you don't get the flavor i'm going to add to that for the final dough here i've got 490 grams of flour 7 grams of yeast 14 grams of salt salt strengthens a dough some people use kosher which is a larger granules i would recommend weighing it rather than going by volume just for that reason and some people say that they can taste the iodine in iodized salt so that is your call whether you use that or not personally fancy bread salts really don't do anything for me himalayan salt is just there someone's getting your money so mix in the drive parts first then put in the pre-ferment again and see how bubbly it is the yeast has really been working there um 10 to 15 hours on that should be sufficient and top it off with about 270 grams of water i use filtered water because the water out of my tap is well water and it's about hard enough to chip your teeth again to some extent water is water but prefer not to use chlorinated anything that's been treated that can cause problems with your microflora which you're trying to be good to your yeast here this is a very wet sticky dough depending on the conditions in your house you may need a little bit more water you may need less something you can do is pour most of that water in start mixing it and then decide whether you want to add the last bit all right now i'm going to turn out this very sticky mess get my dough scraper here if you don't have a disc scraper that's fine just use whatever you have in your kitchen but those scrapers are very nice i've got a couple of them that i use uh you can get a dough scraper for somewhere between five and ten dollars probably um if um if you're doing a lot of baking i would certainly recommend it because i use it a lot most every time i do any kind of baking i use one sometimes i use two but one's fine all right now what we're doing you've got several proteins that are being broken down by the water and mixing around puts two of those proteins together and to form what we call gluten the gluten is what makes the dough sticky and it creates fibers that when the dough starts filling over there rather than letting the air come through it just expands into little bubbles that's what makes the dough rise if you have a gluten allergy or following a gluten-free diet then this is not the bread for you there are gluten-free alternatives but honestly i've never used them pretty much anything with the wheat in it is going to cause you issues all right you see hopefully that it's it's still very sticky but it is getting a little tighter and what i may do although is not recommended is put a dab of flour in there the reason you don't ordinarily want to put flour into the recipe is because that changes the recipe everything ideally has been put together at the right amounts but i put a little too much water in there so it's not coming together so let me just put a little more flour in there not enough so that i have to add any salt but enough to make it a little less sticky now for a very wet dough it's a very light dough very wet dough so what i want to do now is uh kind of folding where kind of flip it out like that roll it over and go over here on the left side lift it out flop it down again um and just keep doing that what's that's doing a couple things one it is mixing and strengthening the dough two it is rolling some air in there it's folding in air which the yeast is going to use in its respiration and make it easier to rise my bread teacher taught me how to do this would fold it 100 times or more um this one i will probably have to do something like that and it is firmed up considerably but it's still very sticky oh and from the left and you have to keep moving keep it moving so come in from the left throw out roll up and just keep doing that cleaning up under it occasionally so that's incorporating air scrape it's a very tactile sort of exercise feeling the dough in there bread making is alchemy you take some powders some water thyme and a little bit of elbow grease here add heat and get something that is utterly unlike the bits that you put in so it's it can be a very meditative sort of practice someone can get lost in it it can certainly be calming and gives you a sense of accomplishment when you're done [Music] see how it's really firmed up i mean it's still sticky but it is coalesced very well as the dough gets stronger and when i'm done with that i'm going to leave the yeast to its own devices yes much better okay i'm going to put it in a bowl you can spray some oil in there if you want but that's hardly necessary put it in there and i will cover it up you can use plastic if you want um i use this use a bowl and then put some maybe put a cloth on top of it just you don't want air moving around in there and drying things out so we're going to leave it here let it do its thing for about an hour and a half of rising halfway through i'm going to pull it out and fold it a couple times just take the ends and put them over each other uh maybe do that the little folding flip like i was doing uh but that'll be about 45 minutes in and from there and the rest is up to the east time has passed we let it sit 45 minutes uh and then uh shape uh folded and then sit 45 more minutes then i brought it out and pre-formed it i cut it into four pieces and put it in a general in a bowl and just let it sit for about 20 minutes and now we're going to shape it into an actual begging you want to be fairly gentle with the dough at this point you don't want to take out too much of the air that's in it flatten out just a little bit pat it down and then fold about a third over kind of like you're folding the letter a little bit do that again remember fold pat down a little bit all right then and i usually want to do this towards me but since i'm in the way i'll do this towards you [Applause] um just thumb in fold over hold over turn it over just push in a little bit fold over a little bit and pinch it sharp we're talking probably about va white is about the length that this back end will be so to get this right you don't want to push it and pull like this and roll gently in the middle so it flattens out a little bit not much very gentle and you put the other hand in there and your hand cut not pushing down much pull it back and forth like that and get it about what ends here i like to have them kind of pointy because it's nice and crispy i like that it's my favorite part of the bread what i've got here is called kosh uh it is made from flax you don't have to use something like this all you really need to do is to have something that kind of keeps the bread towards in the shape that you need to be in [Music] and gently put it over here and then fold that over it's a fairly stiff canvas do the same here it's still a very sticky dough sometimes you're more sticky than other times that's where the scraper comes in very handy i've been uh making bread for probably my first bread uh it was actually french bread i made it using a betty crocker recipe and that was 94 1994 and it made an excellent doorstop so in other words it was not edible i started making decent edible bread a couple years later and i really got into it probably 2005 or thereabouts and i got a couple of good books teaching how to do this this particular recipe uh i for father's day this was i was given a uh horse with uh king arthur not to plug them but oh they are good and they um taught me how to do this it really it took my bread making to a different level taught me some really good tricks and confidence to actually make bread [Music] that's a little more fancy than what i had been making i don't remember how much one of these cloths cost but it's not a lot um but again you don't need the cloth to make bread really you don't need much to start uh apart from the ingredients uh you make if you get balls you can get some bowls cheap and the pastry scraper here the dough scraper didn't cost a lot but you don't even need that it's just terribly useful one of the things about the flax here is you never wash it it washing it ruins it but you can clean it off but really up to a point the more flour you get on there the more i guess kind of seasons it you know so being pretty gentle with it not mashing it over much just patting a little bit pushing and folding um the folding that we're doing here is supposed to tighten the skin on it got the skin you can see some bubbles popping up um that helps it with spring up later [Music] now we'll cover this up uh spray some water on it just to keep it nice and moist and we go for about 30-40 minutes and the oven i will heat up to about 500 degrees all right so the time has passed and uh they've gotten a little bit bigger so that's good all right now you want to be really careful you don't want to mash them at all at this point so be very gentle i typically use parchment paper you don't have to but uh i would use something uh cornmeal on the bottom or something to keep from sticking uh and i use a peel that's this thing but you don't have to you can put it on a cookie sheet if you want and these guys are going to be too long but you can wing it fold around if you want it's gonna be your bread do what you want with it it's gonna taste good regardless all right then you'll want to score it put slashes on it uh that breaks the the outer sheath of the hardened dough here and that will allow it to expand when it's in the oven you want to slash it in about half an inch maybe to an inch you can use a sharp knife you can use uh pretty much anything with an edge i just happen to use a razor blade because they're cheap and because this is a particularly wet dough it's still kind of sticky what i'm going to do i'm going to boil about a cup of water i've got the oven up to 500 degrees and underneath the the stone that i'm going to put the bread on is a there's a pan that's i'm going to have the boiling water you'll want the boiling water because it creates steam and that will help the bread rise more it'll it'll give it some time where it's still elastic before the the crust starts hardening off let go for about 25 minutes keep an eye on it all right now one of the things that is really fun with baguettes as they cool within a minute or two after they come out they start to crackle i like to just kind of lean forward and listen to them crackling um when when i took the baking class there was maybe 10 people there and all the baguettes when they made them brought them out it was like rain falling smells good too these are pretty dark i personally like them that dark nice caramelized the um the sugars that are released from the flower when the yeast gets to work in there that's what gives it that dark crust and they're nice and crunchy on the outside and very tender on the inside you don't have to get them this dark but i particularly like them just like that", "NDudQazrvb0": "welcome to cooking with Chef Tuan and today we are going to revisit a recipe that I did earlier in the year about the Vietnamese baguette now this is a great recipe to have not just for a Vietnamese sandwich but any sandwich altogether now this bread is very easy to make it only has a few ingredients salt sugar yeast water and bread flour now my water is about a hundred and five degrees I'm adding the sugar and the yeast and it gives something for the yeast to eat now wait for a few minutes and you're gonna see your yeast bloom just like that that's one of the coolest things that you'll see that shows that your yeast is alive and per usual all the ingredients will be listed in the description box down below now I'm just adding all the ingredients to a food processor you can do this in a stand mixer if you want and after about the first 30 seconds I like to stop the food processor and scrape down the sides of the bowl to make sure everything is evenly incorporated and if you are making this with the food processor you want to stop it every 3040 seconds or so and check the temperature of the dough you do not want this thing to get too hot because it'll kill your yeast so I pulsed this dough accumulatively around three to four minutes total until it's nice and soft and elastic and you can see the dough is pretty smooth I'm just taking it out here and just meeting it and making it into a nice smooth ball then after we're gonna take a bowl and spray it with some oil and then we're gonna put our lovely dough ball in there and also spray the top of the dough ball with some oil so funky skin doesn't form then we'll put a cloth in it and put it in the oven for about an hour hour and a half now I put a pot of boiling water inside my oven to create a really nice humid atmosphere and environment for my dough to rise now I like to portion the dough balls into a hundred and fifty gram portions that gives a nice solid eight-inch roll but then again you can portion it to any size you want but I find 150 gives really nice manageable sandwich sizes and as you can see this dough is not sticky it's very light and soft and supple and it's easy to work with so all you have to do is just pick up your dough balls tuck the bottoms in just like this put it on your work surface and then just roll it around until it forms a nice tight ball just like this now all you have to do is just do this for the rest of them and let them sit on your counter for about ten minutes just to relax the gluten and then to shape this all you gotta do is flatten out the dough a little bit and just give it a couple whacks on the table until you see a triangular shape just like this and now when you're rolling them down keep the center of the dough as you can see nice and bulbous you're only working the end now roll it down till you see a seam and you're gonna pinch the seams closed and then roll it on top of each other like this and then with your hands with the palm of your hands just angle the edges I'll show you again so you slap the dough a couple of times pull it out like a triangle and just roll it down seal the seams and then with the palm of your hands just taper the edges to get a nice loooong like kind of a torpedo shape now just do this for the rest of the dough's and then when you're done place it onto a baguette pen if you don't have a baguette pen you can use a lightly greased sheet tray or sheet tray with parchment paper now this is gonna go for another resting period this is a perfect time to pre-heat your oven to 475 degrees I also put a cake pan filled with water on the floor of my oven to create a nice steamy wet environment for the baguettes now after about 30-40 minutes that these beggars have rested I scored the baguettes and then I sprayed them with water as you can see in there I have a pan of water going on and sliding in the baguettes this will bake for 12 minutes with the water and then after 12 minutes you're gonna remove the water pen and let them go for another 10 11 minutes in dry heat to get the color that beautiful dark golden brown car now these will go into the oven for another 10 11 minutes on dry heat now after about 22 minutes a total baking time this is the result beautiful crispy light fluffy baguettes that can be used for a bun me or any sandwich you want guys thanks so much for watching I really appreciate everything please like and subscribe and as always peace", "efBuDdl7X2U": "that's Hatfield here and I'm gonna make a french bread dough for you today then it's so easy it's delicious and you don't have to need it to have a crusty chewy beautiful bread that's got a great flavor so we're gonna start off by making the dough so the dough doesn't even made the day before and we're going to start by using a cup and a half of room-temperature water now I'm using instant nice today if you're using us these two you don't have to bloom the yeast warm water if you're using dry active yeast then start with some warm water around 100 to 105 degrees now I'm adding 3/4 of a teaspoon of the yeast 3/4 of a teaspoon of kosher salt and I'm not adding it to the water because it needs to bloom it's just easier to stir it up a little bit to get it more even now next I'm going to add the flour and this is a bread flour but you can use all-purpose flour or bread flour a high gluten that you want to stay away from the cake flour it's just not going to give you enough gluten for development so from here we're simply stirring the dough together I got a visitor in the kitchen a night Louise with us he always liked it would dad mix bread so we're simply folding this mixture over itself all right we don't need to knead it we're just developing the dough mixing those wet pockets into the dry pockets and kind of pulling that all together so kind of a fold over itself if you will very simple just like that all right so one or two more folds and that dough if you can see is pretty much ready to go now not too much hard work on that one we'll be right back for the next step and we're gonna let this one rise for about three hours covered in room temperature okay be right back with the next step for the next this dough was mixed together in rows for three hours at room temperature and then it went in the refrigerator overnight that's really important because that's where the gluten develops the hydration of the flour actually develops the gluten or the - or the protein the structure of that dough all right so I pulled this out about an hour ago I like to work with a cool though and from there we're gonna get a little flour on our hands so loosen that dough up the bowl okay it's got some gasses built up in it right now that's good and we're gonna we are going to deflate those gas because we're going to need to shave the stove and we're going to make a classic French bell today and we're going to start with this really wet dough dipping it into the flour on one side and then we're simply going to take and we're going to use this rounding motion where we tuck it around the other side or the other side with our fingers okay kind of tucking one finger there I'm not pulling too hard okay you guys start to see some bubbles form on the press down here that's good don't go too far or they'll start to start to burst a little bit okay and that's safe right there is really nice you see so it's holding its own shape we've trained that gluten if you will to hold its shape a little pinch on the bar and then that's going to go onto the tray to bake on some parchment now I like to sprinkle a little bit of bread flour over the top of that that's gonna act like a warm blanket for that dough and so that dough is going to rise for the next two to three hours this size dough is gonna need about two two and a half hours at a nice 70 degree temperature okay so we'll be right back to put that dough in the other night okay we're back and we have our dough that's risen this is about a pound though making that's a size that my family likes make larger or smaller goes out of this so from here this snows been rising for about two hours and we're going to take and we're going to dock it with a knife now there are no docking tools a little razor blades on a stick you can use those I actually prefer to do a serrated knife it just works for me well but I'm going to make some hash marks on top of this dough and you'll notice that as I do that it starts to open up a little bit okay it doesn't need to look perfect because this is going to bloom and expand as it's in there in the oven okay so this allows that dough to really open up your oven spring as a break Baker would say now next I'm going to show you how to start that in the convection steam oven so that you can get the best oven spring out of that a really beautiful glossy crust okay so now we're ready to put our French bread dough into the convection steam motor so we're going to go in the number two position of that rack in the center and this is the first model that will put out a convection steam oven on this model I can go two ways I can go two more and do auto steam bake and I like my French bread nice and crusty so I'm going to go around 425 and I'm simply pressing start and then I'm going to set a timer okay for about 35 minutes okay now I'm gonna stop I'm going to show you a little little warming feature on this oven as well so we'll push off we're gonna go into that gourmet button in the middle and we're going to click it and we're going to start to see a 1 a 2 a 3 when we go to a 10 a 11:11 spread okay that's using the auto steamed baked mode as well and we're going to click on that medium brown lightly brown well brown I don't like it nice and crusty well Brown so it's asking me if I'd like to start yes so that's going to bake the bread for about 47 minutes no preheat involved at all and in a few minutes you're going to know this white have been a moisture build-up to where you really can't see inside the oven when you turn that light on it'll be full of steam because that's actually steaming the dough for six or seven minutes before it goes into the dry mode yeah that might seem a little odd if you're not familiar with what a professional bakery makes their artisanal breads like they start with a steam jacket and then they go into that dry mode this ovens programmed to do that for you you don't have to set anything other than that mode and the time and it takes errand for you okay the result is because this is going to give you a really nice shiny crusty bread and if you don't have a convection steam oven you want to play around with your range oven or with your M series wall oven I would suggest 400 degrees on a convection mode and if you want to mist it with some clean water out of a food-safe squirt bottle to give it a little bit of extra waster on that press before it goes in that would work well as well okay so we will be back in just a moment and I'll show you the finished product okay we're back and we have our finished bread loaf out of the oven Oh as you can see my kids could not help but cut into that when it cooled off but I want you to notice you see the open air pockets in that bread that's where that yeast has done its job and let that open up in the oven and just develop that that beautiful grain inside this is not going to have a sourdough flavor necessarily it's going to have a fermented flavor more substantial than a dough that's done the day off okay and I want you to notice also okay do you hear that crust really nice and crusty okay and if we go in the cut it this has been at the oven for a couple of hours now okay we've got this really beautiful crusty bread that's just wonderful it gives you the opportunity to do some great bread in your home for ingredients you don't have to get a workout kneading that dough just make that dough the day before and that dough is good for I found up to five or six days I can pull a chunk out cut it off shape it and let it rise and I've got fresh bread that day so whether you're making that one-pound batch or you're gonna make a batch with multiple loaves for the week either way wish you happy baking and visit us at instagram raw living lifestyle or roth living on youtube thanks a lot have a great day", "7RDFEWFW2cM": "good morning my favorite carbajal axe it's Henry with Henry's bread kitchen bringing you another episode of cook a new day I like that quarantine think most bizarre quarantine anymore so just how about bake I like to welcome all you new members not the goodness you got surprises every single week with where you're from what you're doing with your level of expertise congratulations you guys for joining we've a single one of you it was wonderful time having Steve here last week Steve Schwartz is a character I just really like hanging out so Steve if you ever want to come back and do something else let me know because this could be a thing all right today mission our French baguette now we have to be careful when we talk about bad guys let me just talk about bad guys for French baguettes are probably the most popular brand in the world because they are eaten all around the world and as a result the recipes for them have changed a little bit to suit the different cultures [Music] the Bauman's one French occupied that area for a while and besides of random architecture they left a French baguette which is called now a bond mech it's a smaller version of the baguette a little bit different recipe but if you're making we're making French baguettes today with a poolish but if you're making authentic French baguettes and you're in France then your governor subject to to the mall the blog dictates how much each baguette ways how much passed away what ingredients are in it it has to be only flour water salt and yeast can't be anything more no extenders no bro maybe no nothing that make it so this you know it can be an extremely difficult bread to master particularly when you're doing it the traditional sausage so when you're doing that you've got a double hydration you've got over mate bulk fermentation so it takes about two days to make a baguette we're not doing that method we're gonna get you familiar with the basic and then we're gonna move on from there so that you'll have all the tools necessary to do a good job and if you ever watch The Karate Kid that won't Sauron backs off it's kind of what we're doing you guys I've kind of been introducing more complex shaping and folding so that when it comes time to do more complex bread you shouldn't have any problem with this today so let's get started first we begin is to make sure that we have our Foolish from last night a chalice of flour water kind of a yeast coming together to make whoo see how bubbly that is it was much more I just slammed it down on the counter dog so totally that should weigh 250 grams and and we'll be using lambs today because when you get a bit more complex spreads like this it's so much more important than evening accurate with your weights and measures okay so to this to plead to the poolish that you prepared last night we're going to add 140 grams of warm water and we're going to add I'm gonna have it directly to the poolish come on there we go and that just helps that just helps it to be to release from from the bulb ever see that how it releases now in another bowl we're going to add a dry ingredients and in that bowl we're going to add 300 grams of all-purpose flour 300 grams of all-purpose flowers in here then we're going to cook with that five grams of salt 1 gram of yeast yeast in first that's one gram and if you've got a scale and you don't have a micro scale it's hard to weigh out one gram about 1/8 so it's really hard to weigh out one gram because it doesn't move it's arguably 5 grams but bigger numbers 5 grams of sea salt I'm using a flaky sea salt this my new favorite thing to mix the yeast is it the flour and then I'm going to add the salt and that way they stay separate and the flour begins in a stand mixer I always add the water first if I'm mixing by hand I like to mix with the flour first so I can control how much flour is going into it at a time so it becomes so it's easier to handle so make a little well in the center might be able to see this make a little well in the center this thing I'm using is a is a Dutch whisk you can do this with your hand you can do it with a spatula or wooden spoon and that is your coolest and earrings you know when you're making any traditional French baguette you use in the back which is a portion of sourdough hist\u00f3ria and floured water it's a much stiffer so I'm gonna come in here and start right in the middle mix that adding a little flour as I go and pretty soon it's gonna be too much for this hands dirty and this is not so bad this makes three baguettes and remember we're making these for you know in our commercial our domestic ovens commercial ovens are a lot bigger your back against will be a lot bigger but this is what we got I've got a little bowl with some water because sticky dough wet hands and you want to keep one hand as best you can always keep one hand clean so now I'm just going to go in here and push it just move this around to try to take all this flour now here I'm just gonna I'm not trying to develop any gluten I'm not trying to do anything other that incorporate the dry flour when you need it when you need dough you're gonna you're gonna open up the damp that's what you want to put down on top of the dry dough so what's eatin you've certainly seen this a dozen times what is the reason you don't want to have any dried up remaining in your bowl well that's because once your dough starts to take shape and has been hydrated those dry pieces may stick to it or get into it and for some reason they are resistant to hydrate so they don't want the water and you'll have a piece of bread that has little clumps that tastes like flatline that can be avoided but just making sure there's nothing okay it's not smooth and the thing is is if you if you tear this right now there may be a disappoint development but you see how it tears that's because there's no protein chains yet developed no gluten so this goes in covered for ten minutes and we'll be back and something else i do what's a single tournament good me need so cover that in ten minutes we'll be back to during those 10 minutes in one place because what we're doing is trying to take a lot of hate this a lot of the time it takes to make bread which is why if you've done any research on the internet if you've watched any bread baking videos on the internet you'll mostly see you eat bread and that just means that you're doing what we just did no making sure that there's no flour it's breedings and abbreviated audible ease and automate a uto ly and that's when you let the flour and water sit together for a period of time if you have whole grains let those fit together just the flour and the block 30 minutes you'll add so an auto lease is always done without the salt and without the left your salad or standard so let those because you know especially if you use a whole grains you still got the germ it's still got the infirm it's you know it's still got the whole brain they and it takes a while for the water permeating through those barriers and hydrate the grass and Hydra you know you're done so because it's gonna do he's going to get the hydration somewhere but if you bake it without having done that so you'll notice that your gear your breads are it's tight because they weren't properly always and most home victories don't even know I've been in the world so take your recipe put your flour and water bowl don't have a cup of coffe come back and you will be surprised at what's happened you go then integer something your ear of your starter and then your salt and you're on your way to make sourdough this is another piece of celery I've used some of this this morning some of this starter this morning and it's not a bits normal jar because I like to take it out of this container one day when I feed it once a week and change the container because if you get crud opened I know a lot of had this if you get curling all on the outside of your container and you just keep living like that then you will attract mold bad bacteria and that could ruin your starter so you so miss this morning and I'm good just show you how strong this is and ins Batali that means life-giver if you've got a sourdough starter and you haven't named her yet or he'll name oh now this is the float test this is how I determine whether or not there's enough co2 gas in my starter to add to my bread dough so that it will let me my bread dough make it rise and then I feed it every other day and I'll keep it in the refrigerator and if I'm going to bake with it I've been to these snoring I took it out early this morning and sitting on the counter is I fed it right before I go to bed and it's it's beautiful it slows down but microorganisms it's loads up weight and then you get more flavor but if you're making with if you've got whole wheat or rye flour in your everyday starter graffiti every day if the message went out specifically to make a rye bread or some other kind of bread then it's you know whole week whole braids are gonna burn that so you're gonna get a rise fall much faster than you would if you just use a and all-purpose flour has everything you need to make a good starter so there's no reason why not to do it feed it let it sit on the counter for an hour get its legs put in the refrigerator get ready to use it take it out of the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature and then go ahead and use as long as you fed it right before you know that night so this pretend this is business sitting here for four ten minutes and it won't look much different than this so now we're going to do our terms every 10 minutes all Batsy it is so you know you can see this is your grab us dampen your hands grab one end of it and fold it to this next piece fold it to the middle now this one have developed any bubbles or any you know any sign of little permutation yet what you're doing is strengthening glutens so that when that happens the gluten will be in a position to trap the molecule ah nice ball out of it it's almost smooth but they're areas that are almost smooth but there's some areas that aren't so we're going to put that back in here we're going to do total of four turns then for another ten minutes and I'm going to pull out some that should be farther along forgot my wolf setup here's my work around I was so happy I thought of this I did the script I don't want to tear this so being careful it's gonna tear yourself after your business so now this is all in an hour it's ready to shake I'm gonna put a little bit of flour down because I'm gonna get more flour into the dough that's important we're not going to get any more flour into the dough then did it on the dough that's okay because you food you if you got a sticky dough and you continue to add flour it's gonna soak it up and you end up with a dense heavy bread with no crop now when I turn to spread out just now the bottom is going to be forever the top of my bread that's always going to be the top now because I have a scale I've measured this I should get about 233 on three let's do the booth if there's an orientation to this and it's rectangular just like this then cut with the rectangle because you want these pieces that you're proof [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] notice I'm not degassing this a lot all right so these are all 230 grams over there those now see how puffy this is and that's good we're gonna put the yeast back in tip in touch with its food source but we don't so I'm folding the sides into the middle see that folder the edges into the middle and then I'm gonna take the top fold it to them just make sure to seal this tap it a little bit and then all the way over and seal that in now this doesn't have to be perfect because it's a pre shape we're developing a relationship with our dog we're telling it that's the shape we're gonna be so start getting in line so you take it up fold it into the middle the top to the middle seal the edge we're just getting last one where it needs now these only have to sit for a few minutes this is a dam we I'm just going to let that sit now the reason we do this the reason we appreciate our dough is because gluten in the bread is a lot like muscle when you're lifting way to your and you're curling or you're doing squat to whatever your muscles tighten up after you so who gonna do is give them a chance to relax I'll give it a chance to relax I usually takes about five clips but then you can keep moving whenever you're rolling dough out or handling dough in any kind of way and it comes springing back at you give it spirits and tucked under pies so this is first one idea can you see that so here's what we're gonna do I'm just gonna even it out about flatten it terribly stretch it that helps strengthen the gluten and I'm not going to the middle this time I'm just right here on the edge just so that it'll be sealed later now I'm going from the outside edge to the middle outside edge didn't you see that outside edge to the middle then I'm gonna flip it around nine degrees and do the same thing an edge to the middle and we've done this before we did this with the hoagie rolls and that was to get you ready for this now we're gonna go all the way from the outside all the way to the other end and see I push down with my fingertips to seal it you do the little bubbles pop you'll find more accomplished makers that I do they come in with their hand like that and they they're not hitting the belly now they're hitting just that single that's all they're doing is making that seal tight and once you have that roll it out just nice and easy ten per minute relax it'll be much easier your hands stretch but I can wait right at the beginning I see that is sheer up here and center unit sitting in then from Delta all the way over I see my fingers he is you don't have these little thin spots what your baguettes to be is uniform is possible I'm not going to push it any more than that just going to let it rest until I finish with this one another characteristic of a bad guest is that the ends are pointing and sealed this is doing me started with I have a little weak spot right here that's thinner than most let's see if I can't get rid of it or at least so with my open come all the way up to the ends and then you could go in opposite directions same direction just give me a little point a baker's couche the spell of the sort of coucher but this the baker's couche this is a it's made of like a flax it's it feels sort of like but burlap dough that does it cost 20 but I tried to make my own so what a Koosh does is allows your bread to rise without sticking to one another and it's a wonderful thing when you don't watch you never take if you're honest thing baby there's nothing nothing so there's one there's two see how much easier these go just with that little bit of rest so now on the surface anyway pull it up high enough that when they start to prove they don't proof into each other and you do rightly get donut stuck to one another I usually take a rolling pin and stick it here kitchen I have something holds it nice and tight so those will rest now for an hour now you want to put your oven at 500 degrees and you want to put a pan at the biggest difference between French pets that have made it a bakery and what you and I are doing is that a bakery has steam injected engines engines ovens and that steam allows for the baguette to expand not double crust so if you can kind of get rip it up maybe a cast-iron skillet the bottom of your pan the bottom of your other and put your backs in need up some ice into there or you use a spray bottle and spray the walls spray over your baguettes and close rough that's not a modesty ice in the bottom of it works better but anything is just trying to emulate limiting the professionals so those are proof like this for about an hour and then we're going to score now if you are into baking you will soon find out that there are tons of little pieces of equipment you think you need in order to make your brain better it's like playing golf man if I had that Club oh so you don't need to buy at all a lot of it you do and just you know have to get it all at one time just a little bit of the tasks that might save you some money right here the blade that we used for our bread is called a low and they fancy weapons with blades attached the cheaper you know it's cheap so I've got a razor blade here they're chopsticks take the skinny end and please be careful with this razor it will cut you bend it like I did and come in from the back I'm in the big hole sometimes and a half is these chopsticks beautiful I'm gonna be worried about getting tired so it's back in and back out make sure it's low enough to stay on and now you have a bread lama see that if it's in its curved which is a good thing as its scoring you want to get that first corner of your blade on into the into the surface of the dough and have it fold up a little you never want to catch the dome with the back end and that's what a lot of people do is they end up scoring like this and they catch the bill with the backhand and they drag it pull it and it looks like he pulled it so it takes practice a long practice the other thing about dying yet is according to these paper you're not gonna be able to see this but the other thing about baguettes is scoring now this is the most this this takes the most expertise out of everything else this is somehow the hardest thing people have trouble so a dish baguette the point is that's your bad yet can you see we're gonna score it now traditional French baguettes are scored with five slashes as a matter of fact it's mandated by law but those are big pieces of bread and you can get five slashes on and the tradition is that if you're doing something less subtle or something smaller then we do three slashes we want odd numbers it's not a taste any different you're just trying to protect for perfect something and it's becoming your craft so that's why we pay attention but this is your baguette you want to score but then these two arms see how I made those two inside lines inside lines so now when I score I want to go from here to here I want to come back and over that line and go here come back and overlap by a third and go this submit sense you see that this is the hardest thing to get people to do pay attention because a lot of people want to score a baguette this way and that's gonna make your bread turn out Kenny Wallace it's gonna be all over the place if you're scoring it up in a shallow angle what is there about 30 degrees about 90 to that that much right down the center pretend you draw two lines down the center of your baguette or you know just on the outsides of your back yet and you have to stay between those two imaginary lines that's how you know you've got so because we are short on time we're going to go ahead and score so you can see that so because it's time to bait still another 10 minutes for this let's see it does my hand so much anymore folks it's going from me into the middle in into the middle [Music] that's all I'm doing in this fall and then once I've done it I just typed it up okay we do four of those terms before we let it rest for an hour more place and then we can so let's yeah some people store their breads before they're proof I've never been one of them after they're proved but there's you know there's our mean both ways use your imagination and I got up look this is a baguette trip you don't need this but it's nice you've seen me use the silicon ones too they're not you know absolutely necessary but they're nice they have little perforations you know holes to let the steam get through the heat get through so I'm gonna take and what we would traditionally nap is a board could be a piece of cardboard or it could be a baker's peel it could be anything but you take that board and you sit right here between them lift up and your baguette would come up on that board like that gentle because they're not proof completely in be gentle now with your couch foam back up not tight you don't want to you don't want it with all the lot of creases of that so and that flour stays in there just remember how you opened it when it gets to fold or you got little pieces of dough take it out back shake it downwind let's think about this first we remember our line we're gonna try and stay in there these patties so I'm gonna go here here straight down yeah just imagine those those lines I talked about imagine the lines that are your boundary from your store third fear come back up a third today now these will open up and be very nice okay so I'm going to put these two proofing you can also do these on any cookie sheet or a sheet with parchment paper so just the other the rest of the rest of the method applies you have to have your oven preheated and you have to have you know when your oven dings and it says it's preheated there's that's not for you give it another 30 minutes for to really get hot particularly if you have a stone in there let it get but it come to temperature and as soon as you put your your baguettes in put some spray bottle water in there whisper bit or tile ice cubes into the bottom into a pan or to a cast-iron skillet and you're baking these for about 15 minutes there's somebody did yesterday and so much hassle test so let's see you shouting up doing this live because if it sucks so let's go this way this is not the way that's not good [Music] little holes but this isn't gonna get in in an environment with no seam of it or that's good that's it that's a good that's a good look see the flower I told you that you can sometimes have on top so now when you're serving you need it couples can walk out of the bakery and eat is they're going down the street this is a very blue-collar useful brick cut it like this and you make a sandwich a street vendor and you're off you can carry your own saying you can carry your own food and keep on getting on with your life or you can have you know pieces like this that a perfect for dipping in some olive oil with a little Tuscan seasoning not Tuscan bread test come season see this that's nice it's very nice okay so some questions please comment down below as soon as we get rid of it we'll put it on our YouTube page and for our you two members we were trying to this commercial join us on YouTube like and subscribe but all of the videos that we do and some that we tell are on YouTube on Henry's breakage and if you want to see pictures things that we do that you may not otherwise see direct Henry's breakage on Instagram okay I enjoyed this is good and it's not as difficult is you know I make it sound orderly you could do this it's just technique technique technique practice we're not going for protector perfection we're going for progress listen you should be able to pronounce every ingredient in your bread if you can't then maybe it's not bread but something else altogether alright see you next week be blessed", "bJ_RcDJPTAc": "I'm going to do a windowpane test right now because the auto lease has helped expedite the kneading process so we shouldn't have to need it terribly long and you can see that the gluten is forming it's really stretchy it's partially stretchy because we added polish and polish as extensibility to the dough and you can see we've got a really beautiful windowpane going on and probably you two need it a little bit more but I'm really happy with that so we'll need it for another minute the windowpane test basically is a check to see how the gluten is developing in the dough and if all the gluten is being developed you can really stretch the dough out because what the gluten does is it provides extensibility ie stretchiness and and also elasticity and so it's that extensibility that you're looking for in the gluten so you're checking you're checking to see how much you can stretch the dough so once your baguette dough is kneaded you're going to transfer it into a lightly oiled Bowl and then it's going to ferment for a total of two hours and we're going to punch it down or turn it after one hour all right so the baguette dough has fermented for one hour and we're going to punch it down or turn it and so basically I'm going to give it a letter fold and I'm gonna rotate the bowl 90 degrees and fold it again like a letter and then flip the dough upside down and that's all turning so you can see this has like a nice extensibility to it which is really what you want when you're making a baguette dough it will help with our shaping and then flip this upside down and then I'm gonna let this ferment for one more hour and then we will divide and cheap it you", "oHFYpZaiVn8": "hi home-baked is this jacket bakery ja voll Codel you came bringing you your weekly bread making tips every single Thursday and this week I want to show you five different ways to stick C's to your dough so they don't fall off roll that Fein Choo hello to you and welcome back to the bakery check youtube channel where i share with you a little bit of my bread making expertise every single Thursday if you like the sound of that then you might like the sound of the home bakers bulletin I feel like I don't talk about a home bakers bullying enough you probably got no clue what it even is the homemakers bulletin is a weekly email bulletin arrives in your inbox every single as those they have all my content from the week of this video relevant blog posts social media highlights you might get some value out of will appear in your inbox in the homemakers building every Thursday sign up with the link underneath let's get on with this show where you can't just sprinkle seeds on top of your bread dough and expect them to stick and even if they do stick after you baked your bread they're probably gonna fall off again so this week is 5 ways to stick C to dough so that they don't fall off and the last one number five is one I learned by working part-time in a bakery and master baker Paul when he showed me for the first time I was like huh as always if you're interested I leave the specification of the dough in the comments underneath and without further ado let's cut to the table here we are at the table I'm gonna make these little sort of miniature bloomers like this is woody it's about 170 grams of dough and I've shaped it up you can see the seam they're exactly like they're in the video I did last time how to shape a loaf of bread now this one's gonna happen on the tray the first time around I've got a little pot here with water in it and a brush and what I'm gonna do is brush a little bit of water on top of this lovely loaf now try not to get so much water you don't want anything sort of trickling down the sides because if the dough will then stick to the tray you just want a little bit everywhere like a light coating if it trickles down the edge it will stick the dough to the tray and then it won't rise up a nice shape as we'd like you're the nice thing about this so we just sprinkle over the top here I'm using sesame seeds with this one like that okay a little knife give it a few cuts like you saw in the last video to free pour will do just to make it look nice you should open up nicely Loaf number two we're going to do almost exactly the same thing we're going to pop it there so this time we've upped the game a little bit and I'm using egg wash it's just the beaten egg make sure when you beat an egg you beat it up properly so there's now that likewise not you beating it nobody likes I'm gonna do exactly the same I did with the last one make sure you wipe it off really well so none of those drips go down the side and again a nice light coating this is a little bit more gluey than the water it will stick everything a little bit better and also as little bonus we get a nice glossy finish this time around we go with sesame seeds again or when you do stuff like this on a tray a nice thing to do is to mix up your seat a little bit you can sprinkle a little bit of that a little bit of poppy seeds as well doesn't they look nice and you can do that when you do on a tray like this I'm gonna take my knife again one two three four four little cuts on the top like that onto the next one okay the third little lovely miniature bloomer of the bay here it goes will pop on here this time we're changing the game again check this out this is a spray bottle it's like a plant mister that you buy from a shop don't use some washed out bleach bowl that's a really bad idea just use something properly clean fill it just reporter and we're gonna give this a little spritz this technique I like to call the spray and sprinkle technique because what we do is we give it a little spritz lightly mist it all over grab yourself some seats and have a little we sprinkled the spray and the sprinkle is a little bit more technical than the one with a brush the spraying sprinkler technique and this time we going with linseeds two colors I'd have a little cup with my knife again one two three four like that that will do that'll look nicely let's move on to number four now this is a nice straightforward way of doing things right but as you can see in our literally seeds everywhere all we're over the tray so for number four we change up the game slightly I'm gonna stay on myself a little station here I'm gonna use poppy seeds this time round under spray gun again this is the spraying dip technique which by the name you may have gathered goes a little bit like this we spray the top of the dough we pick it up we roll it in there we get a little bit better coverage this way and I'm gonna pop it here on our tray like this I just put that way around it's probably guarded we get nice coverage here do not be alarmed with this coverage because don't forget this is gonna puff up nicely and then so those seeds are gonna spread further a little bit that makes sense there won't be so much seeds in such a small space using a spray and dip technique over the spray and sprinkle means we get better coverage and we don't get all this wastage going on it's a much cleaner way to do things next up bread number five method number four here you can see makes of a mess okay there's literally water all over the place but don't worry because this is the way I learned at the bakery first we need like a little trap door like this this one perfect and a J cloth I've got some water in a jug I'm just gonna live a really douse this cloth with water make it really really wet really really wet like this right nice and wet now I've got mixture of seeds here which is what I often have I've got loads of stuff left over from class as you can see on that poppy seed one there's a few little stray lenses and bits and bobs that happens so what I tend to do is just mix everything up together that I have left over and this is what I normally use give it a little mix up because quite often those poppy seeds will sink to the bomb because they're small we've got sesame seeds poppy seeds linseed sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds in there this is what we do you shape up your bread like this give it a little roll on here like that give it a little roll on there like that job done see you later pop it onto the tray this is a really lovely way is completely self-contained there's no waste there's no nothing that goes back into the pot for another time that it can dry out ready for another time I'm gonna slash this one exactly like I did with the rest and what's going to slash that one because I forgot done up you know so on two three four this is gonna be a bit more tricky to smash because we've got big seeds on here these pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds might cause us a problem they might be arrived sometimes you get straight through it all like that and that'd be lovely I'm gonna let these prove up fill it well and then bacon and there it is how about that five different ways to stick seeds to your bread dough for you to have a play with don't feel you got to do exactly what I do have a play where your seeds mix up the colors make rolls all different colors all join together that would be really lovely have a little play with the techniques and see what works for you if there's a way that you use that is gold dust that's a little golden nugget we'd all benefit from I haven't spoken

baguettes are one of the most classic artisan bread dough's that you can make and it's amazing how something with only four ingredients can give people so much trouble it's something that you need to practice don't expect a perfect baguette the first time out but I'm going to take you through the steps the first step is to get a pre ferment made this is a starter so we're going to introduce some flour to some a little little teeny-tiny bit of yeast and some water so I have four and a quarter ounces of flour here this is all-purpose flour you can also do this with bread flour if you're going to make it with bread flour then you're going to need a little bit extra water so I'm only gonna put a few sprinkles of yeast in here now I'm going to add four ounces of water there we go and I'm going to mix this up and let the yeast start working artisan dough's only have four ingredients flour water yeast and salt that's it but it's how you manipulate or work with those ingredients that makes the difference between a beautiful crusty bread with nice big holes in it and something that is not quite what you were hoping for so all we're gonna do is combine this and as you can see where you start to see some stretchiness the gluten is already starting to form and this gets covered and the yeast gets to work overnight to start developing some flavor and get our dough started we've given our starter plenty of time to do its thing look at those beautiful bubbles this is all kinds of activity and flavor in this little bowl so now we're gonna build our dough we're gonna take the starter put it in our mixing bowl and we're gonna add water to this and how much you add depends very much on the humidity of your environment flour is like a sponge in damp weather it tends to absorb water so you would use less than your dough in dry weather the flour can be very dry and it could need more water so we're going to use 8 ounces of water right here and I want to make sure I get all the nice little flavor bits still in this bowl so in a way it ounces of water which is one cup stir it around add that to our Bowl some salt and one more teaspoon of yeast we don't have a lot of yeast in this recipe because we want it to work for a longer period of time to develop more flavor the next thing that is going to go into our dough three and a half cups of flour and make sure you measure your flour properly a scale is the most accurate but if you don't have a scale you want to make sure that your flour is not really compacted if you have too much flour in your dough it's not going to rise well and your bread is going to be kind of heavy and tough so you want to stir up your flour sprinkle it into a measuring cup just like this and level off the top and if this is done this way your flour should weigh four and a quarter ounces which is exactly what my scale is showing me now I'm gonna just finish this up using the scale so I want to get to 14 and 3/4 ounces now we're gonna put this on the mixer get our dough hook and lift the bowl and start it on a slow speed and hope it's gonna bring everything together we will give this a few minutes to get the flour evenly moistened and then I'm going to drop the bowl down and scrape the sides of the bowl just to make sure everything is getting mixed properly and as you can see here I've got some dry stuff still hanging out in the bottom and some wetter stuff still on the dough hook so I'm just gonna use the bowl scraper to get all of my dough together in one spot and we'll reintroduce the hook put it back on the mixer and we're gonna let this mix for about six to seven minutes until it's really nice and smooth don't go past the medium speed on your mixer you don't want to pound the dough you just want to bring it together so it's smooth and stretchy one thing that you can do if you are not exactly sure how much flour or water to use is to hold a little bit of the flour back and wait until the dough comes together and if it seems really wet and really sticky then you can add the rest of it and that way you'll have more control over the texture of your dough okay let's take a peek at our dough it has been mixing for about six to eight minutes and as you can see it's nice and stretchy some serious gluten development going on there so this dough is going to rise twice it's going to rise for three hours and then we're going to just very gently deflate it and then turn it over to redistribute the food for the yeast and then we're going to give it another two hour rise but meanwhile we're just going to put our favorite cover on top of our bowl which is a shower cap and we're going to let this rise at a comfortable room temperature for three hours give it a little turn over and then another two hours this is our dough after it's had plenty of time to rise twice it rose for three hours and then we deflated it turned it over and then it had another two-hour rise so it's time to deflate it one more time and begin to shape it so the first I'm going to do is sprinkle a little bit of flour on top to help the dough not stick to my hands and you can see from those nice bubbles that this dough is pretty happy I'm gonna flour my bench a little bit you want to flour it too much because you're gonna need some of that traction in a minute when we go to roll it I'm just going to turn the dough over once or twice now I'm going to divide it in thirds so I'm going to divide the dough in thirds now what I'm going to do is pre shape which means give the dough an idea of what shape I want it to be in afterwards and help it to gather itself so I'm going to make it into a rough rectangle right now just pinch the seam closed and leave it like that and by doing this I'm going to give it a little bit of a what's called the benchrest which means the dough is going to be fairly elastic from having been moved around like this and I want it to rest a little bit so it will relax and be easier to roll out into a bed baguettes shape so just like cranky children sometimes a little ten to fifteen minute timeout can improve the behavior of the subjects so we're just going to cover these with some plastic and give it a 15 minute bench press and then when we come back we'll be much easier to roll while this dough is having us little rests undercover let's talk a little bit about your oven this is one of the things that makes a true artisan dough at home a little bit difficult because the artisan bread dough's that we make at our bakery are baked in a $60,000 huge square of an imported from France that is steam injected so in order to replicate those conditions you need to create some steam in your oven there are several ways that we try to get people to create steam we're going to spritz the baguettes a little bit with a little spray bottle to get started then we're going to put a pan of boiling water in the bottom of the oven and just before the bread goes in and there's enough about a cup of water is enough you don't want a lot of water because you need about 10 to 20 minutes of steam to start the bake and then the steam needs to cook off so that the bread can caramelize one other thing I wanted to talk about is in your oven as far as steam goes if you have a pizza stone you definitely want to use it when you're baking any kind of artisan bread the pizza stone really will soak up the heat and will give the heat back to the bread really quickly and that's important to get that nice fast rise that we were talking about so I recommend you preheat really for a good solid hour to make sure everything is totally totally warm now our dough here has had its chance to rest and now I'm going to shape it now when you shape the dough you're going to roll it out with your hands cupped over the dough so that you're not gonna squish it flat if you've ever rolled clay when you're a kid and you were using your hands flat you know how you had like high spots and low spots and then all of a sudden one piece would break in order to keep that from happening you want the shape of your hand to stay round and what you're going to do is push against the dough with this part of your hand that you'll feel the dough gather itself up underneath your hands and as you go back and forth this way you want to work your hands out to the ends so remember what I said you need to practice this is one of those things to taste a little bit of practice so don't be too upset if it's not exactly the way you envisioned it the first time now I'm going to fold the dough one more time this way and push it back against itself you see how it starts to round up it gathers itself at this point you want to make sure that your bench does not have a lot of extra flour because you're counting on the moisture from the dough to help grab on to the bench and help it gather itself up so and it sees nice little bubbles going on here this is growing nicely so I'm going to take this dough with my cupped hands and work from the middle out and there's gonna be a little seam I'm gonna make sure that that's on the bottom but that's pretty much all I'm gonna want to do to this dough I'm just going to gather this up and lay it out now there's one go one more time the trick is to keep just enough moisture on the bench to keep it to help it round up but you don't want the dough to stick or tear so you're kind of walking a fine line if it's if you have too much flour you can give it a little spritz with some water or just brush the flour away and if it starts to stick then you can just literally just take a little on your fingertips and just rub that spot now we're gonna have one more pretty long-term rise sometimes you'll find that this baguettes and artisan dough's will benefit from what I call benign neglect if you sit here watching it waiting for it to be ready you're just gonna drive yourself crazy this is where you want to cover it up and go away for an hour and a half do something else here are our loaves they've had their last rise but they're not quite ready to bake yet there are a few other things that we need to do before they're ready to get into the oven the first thing that we're going to do is do what's called a release cut now we've talked about this bread and having a big fast rise in a hot oven so what I want to do is help the dough go into the shape that I want to do this is something that I'm gonna use what's called a LOM this is just a curved blade that's got a very sharp edge and this is where artisan bakers really get to strut their stuff some people get really freaked out about this you just you can't think about this while you're doing it you just have to go so one two three four and don't worry that it dragged a little bit just got a run with it if you don't have a LOM a straight razor is fine or a very sharp knife but you can't go slowly because then you're gonna pull the bread way out of shape the next thing we're gonna do is moisten the outside of the dough by giving it a little shower and the next thing is going to be to put it in the oven on the stone and here are our baguettes we've taken out of the oven they've been baking for 25 minutes check them after 20 depending on how much heat your oven is carrying and they may need as long as 30 you want to make sure that they're nice golden brown and you should almost hear them crackling as they cool but this has got a beautiful crisp crust if you remember when we slashed them they sort of collapsed and they didn't look too promising but that nice quick heat in the oven really did its job and now we've got some beautiful baguettes you", "BOiZ82dJnrI": "over here I started making I'm trying to get these Vietnamese rolls and I made two batches yesterday and I just could not get them to turn out right so I'm doing it again I already had this mixing twice and said to let it rest now I'm going to mix it again but I'll take you over here these are the rolls from yesterday this is just the paper that was cooked so the parchment this was my first batch what happened was I had slashed them but I didn't preheat my oven before I did that so they all deflated so they came out very flat the second batch came out better but they're too thin so this time when I make them I'm going to make the portions of the dough larger so they come out bigger but they did coming out nice and crispy I mean they've been sitting out all night these are just going to go to the chickens so um they came out nice and crispy and on the inside cuz I'd want to cut they came out pretty Airy so I am determined to get this recipe done right I put a towel under this because it kept sliding I'm going to mix this up and then going to let it rise for an hour for the instruction this is pretty much just a basic recipe flour yeast sugar water and salt but the technique of letting it rise I guess okay so now I've taken the dough out of the mixer and I've rolled it in some oil I'm gonna cover it for an hour and I will show you when it's done so now my dough has risen so I'm gonna just put a little bit of oil here and spread it out and then I'm gonna gently take the dough out of the bowl you don't want to take you don't want to deflate it so put there then you're going to portion it the recipe says to cut it into six but I felt that by them are too small so I'm going to go ahead and do four sections kind of eyeball it or you can wade out so that they're even okay so you're going to do that now the next step this gets dry out here so we want to take the inside because it's super soft inside so you're going to find that opening over here and you're going to turn it so that all that dry is on the inside and then you're going to turn it over I'm going to pinch these closed then you're just going to shape it into a ball and I'm going to set it aside and do the same thing over here look for the opening and you're going to push all that dry into the inside this is a nice smooth elastic dough we're going to pinch this that's just to seal it in round it off set it to the side again you see that line there that's the inside gently push it so you don't tear it how nice and smooth that is I pinch this okay make a ball set it to the side and finally our last one and we're going to pinch it closed maybe and then form it into a ball now we're going to let this rise for 10 minutes we're going to cover it with a towel move these apart a little bit let it rise for 10 minutes see you in 10 minutes ok so our 10 minutes are up just set your towelettes side because you're going to use that again one more time you're going to excuse me take one of your balls and you see they're nice ok so what you want to do they say is a trick to making these flatten it a little bit now you're going to want to bang it down turn it bang it they say like four times okay and then you're going to flatten it now I put see if you can see this this has like the crust from being on the outside so I put that on the inside so the outside is nice and smooth and then you're going to go ahead and roll this up okay and you're going to want to pinch the seam together okay and then what you're going to do you're going to put your hands on it I can move this number we put your hands on it so your pinkies are on the edges see if I can turn this camera a little bit okay and you're going to put more pressure on your pinkies and not so much in the center because you want it to be tapered so you're just going to go ahead and roll it and roll it over too because you want to get that seam side too so we're going to go ahead and do this okay like so I'm going to put it on the pan and I'll show you the pan when I'm done so this is the dry side so all I do is I run it on here a little bit because I got a little bit of oil on my table here and then we're going to bang it down one two three four again this is the dry side so I'm going to leave that face up because I want that tucked into the roll okay and then we're going to go ahead and roll that up it doesn't really matter if you start at the top or start at the bottom it's easier at the top I think because as you're turning it you kind of want to taper it in okay and then don't forget the pincher seam see okay then we're going to put it down and we're going to roll it so you're kind of going to go outward and then don't forget to move it because you want to get both sides and make sure this isn't too oily because it will be too slick to roll it you want some friction there okay just going to pinch the ends a little bit and I'm going to put it on my tray okay again dry side just going to Pat that down a little bit to get some oil bang it on - they say that this is part of the trick to getting a really good role that they make okay so we're going to go down down down and you're going to apply pressure as you're pushing down okay I'm going to close up that seam and we're going to roll so you want it thinner at the ends and more of a bump in the center so Boop okay put it on our tray over okay okay okay mmm - I do all four sides just rotate it in your hand and then bang it again don't forget to put the crustier part on the inside so come down see it kind of naturally forms that bump if you kind of go on an angle okay okay so then we're going to go ahead and roll it okay we're going to put that on the tray and we are going to go ahead and show you this is what they look like on the tray we're going to go ahead and cover this for half an hour and I will show you when it's ready to go in the oven so I'm back it's been a half an hour that our lives have been proofing so now the recipe says to spray with water but I don't have a spray bottle so I'm actually going to use butter instead because I think butter gives a nice flavor so I just melted some butter and I'm just gonna put it right on top before I slash because I think it'll make it easier to make my slash marks once the dough has some moisture on it because it's going to soften because there's a little bit of a skin now that it's been sitting okay and make sure you pre-heat your oven to 475 before you do any of this because a mistake I did I forgot and then my loaves deflated and they turned into a rock so be sure to do that okay so now that I have that butter on there I'm going to go ahead and make my slash marks so you're just going to go you want to go very quickly so slash slash slash make sure you have a sharp knife or a razor blade I'm going to pop it right in the oven once you have that in the oven you're going to want to put a pan in the bottom because you want to create seen see how hot that is it creates steam in there so we're going to close it so these just came out of the oven and they look really good so they're very light and airy I will take a picture one shot once I cut it but they're very hot right now you", "3sR2EeeD5xw": "I'm making rolls right now half a cup of warm water in a container and two of these packages two of these packages of yeast and then you just wait and I also put like a a teaspoon sugar on top of the yeast I have in here is I have a half a half a cup of sugar and 1/2 a cup of shortening three teaspoons of salt because again that salt will activate the yeast to help it rise one teaspoon of vanilla in it while I mix this up my yeast is rising and then whenever I get it just about good I put my milk in the microwave and warm it dump the milk in and then I'm gonna stir that up and then once I get it pretty well stirred up then I'm gonna add my yeast mixture you're not going to get all the shortening and sugar dissolved or anything okay that is not really the point the next thing you're gonna do is you're going to add your yeast mixture I'm gonna start putting my flour in you want to start out with just a little bit so you can kind of get everything distributed okay and then I'm just gonna dump in a quite a bit I've been doing this quite a bit that I'm gonna need more flour than this otherwise I wouldn't have dumped in a whole bunch but now you can just kind of stir it distribute at that flower even Elaine and I can tell by looking at it it's getting thicker just what you're wanting just still not quite ready yeah I'm gonna add some more flour and I'm not gonna have to add very much and I don't want to add very much out of time because you don't want to add too much flour you're not white we're almost at the point where we can start using our hands all right see how it's kind of fighting back so now it's probably a good time that you can start using your hands a little bit so I'm just not stop working in that flour holding it in scrape those sticky see how sticky it is so I'm going to add some more flour fold that in a sprinkle some on here and just going to see what it's like see it's a little sticky see my fingers that came from that last but I don't know if once I get this flour distributed if it would be fine so I'm still going to continue to go here punching down that dough I think I've decided that so you see my fingers are still still pretty sticky with Joe so I'm gonna add some more I'm just gonna add just a tiny bit you know mortis in it you know a little bit and that's gonna really cool cuz you want that router know if you see that or not so see that nice pretty round flower oh no no that's what's your wedding fitting good I'm just gonna punch it down a little bit but you can tell over it gathers in this beautiful ball of you that it's it's done and I will transfer over to the lid I've got my ball dough my lid has Crisco on it then I'm gonna take my dough put it on my lid I'm not watching it just taking off this flower Chris go on the median okay then I'm going to put this Jo back in here if you want to work it around one more time to get it all pretty you can do that put the lid on and now you wait and how much time you wait depends on how warm it is in your house whenever I have my air conditioner run sometimes it could be four hours it will double its size will actually slip off so my dough is nice and pretty and little it'd popped off of it so I know it's done so what I'm gonna do now is I'm going to punch it down and once I punched that down then I can start making out my rolls I put my thumb down again and so all you have to do is take off a bit depending how big you want them and then I'm gonna I'm gonna fold it into itself until it makes a nice pretty roll on top and then I'm gonna gather all those ends at the bottom so that top is nice and pretty how pretty that top is and I'm gonna put it in my pan gathering up my dough depending how big you want them and then you're just folding the edges down making that top really smooth and then you'll just do that and tell you have a pan full of rolls and you can there's two ways to do it in the pan you can stick them close to each other so that you have to pull them apart or you can spread them out to their individual rolls nice pretty pan of rolls that are gonna rise and my family really likes ham and cheese rolls so I'm getting ready to make ham and cheese rolls I'm gonna set this up again so you can see so I'm gonna it's the exact same thing the roll concept except this time you're going to spread the dough out let's put the dough out and then you're gonna put ham and cheese in there so you're gonna grab a piece of ham and a piece of cheese now if you're my husband he likes extra ham and you're just gonna roll that up I kind of fold it over and then the dough is going to encompass that ham and cheese and it's gonna rise just like the normal rolls tonight sit a map just like I do the rolls I've never had issues with it staying out too long or whatever so I'm going to grab another roll and you can make them as big as you want my husband doesn't like a lot of bread but I like the bread so again make a couple for him and do two slices of ham and I think of Elvita cheese what we use fold that up and then have that dough just encompass the ham and cheese then you just do that until you're done with your ham and cheese so that will be our dinner tonight YUM everybody likes it here's are nice and fluffy reheat and then I will put these little babies in the oven for about 15 minutes or until they're a dark golden brown and there's my ham and cheese rolls yum yum and then we can you alright as soon as you can see nice pretty dark brown golden rolls yum yum yum and then I have the ham and cheese rolls in the oven right now wait for those and then voila you are done", "aDiT8jhSUbk": "- What's up you guys? Chef Billy Parisi here\nfrom billyparisi.com and I'm going to be\nfinishing up our bread series with a delicious Boule, which\nis a gigantic loaf of bread. We're going to be using a\npoolish to help let it rise and we're doing it in partnership with my friends over at Bob's Red Mill. So we are on our last video\nof this bread making series. We started off with the sourdough starter: How to do it in five days. We made two amazing bread\nrecipes using the starter. The last one we used\na biga, and this time, we're going to be using a poolish, which is another preferment\nvery very similar to a biga. The only difference is\nyou use a little bit more of the hydration on the upfront making that preferment\nthan that of the biga. Becomes a little bit more acidy, obviously a lot more liquid in there, some really interesting\nflavor notes coming out of it. It's really delicious and poolish, obviously sounds a lot like Polish, it definitely has some Polish origins but it really became\npopularized in France. Think baguette. This right here is what baguettes are all\nabout, using a poolish. Also, would be really good\nin focaccia bread in Italy. But regardless, I'm so thankful you guys have stuck with me through\nall this bread making. I've got a beard, I mean,\nseriously it's been a wild week. Early mornings, late\nnights, and the poolish is a little bit different\nfrom the sourdough starter, as you don't need to make it for five days but it's almost spot on to the biga. As I said, the hydration\nand the flour amounts are just a little bit different. So without further ado, let's\nget started on this boule. So to make this poolish,\nwhat we're going to do is add some artisan bread\nflour right to a large bowl. I'm going to of course\nbe using Bob's Red Mill. This is a great flour,\nperfect for bread making, loaded with protein. Next, we're going to sprinkle in just a wee bit of active yeast. And then we're next going\nto pour in some water that's in between 80 and 82 degrees. Pour it in there, give\nit a really nice mix. Make sure it's completely\ncombined by squeezing and folding. We need that yeast to be\ncompletely incorporated so that it has time to do a\nlittle fermentation over night. Once it is combined, go\nahead and put the lid on it. Let it sit at room temperature for as little as 10 hours and\nall the way up to 24 hours. As I stated earlier, a poolish uses a higher hydration on the upfront. In the biga, if you remember,\nwe used 45% of the liquid and 50% of the flour,\nbecause we wanted the flour to provide a lot of those\nflavors in our biga. With the poolish, we use 50% of the flour and 62% of that water,\nthat's why it's really runny. You can see that it will literally pour right out if you want it to. Don't let that freak you out, it's exactly where it needs to be. So after you've left it\nover night, come back, you can see that it is beautiful. Looks like a spiderweb, if you\nlook at it through the side. Tons of holes poking through\nhere, lots of air pockets, and if you smell it, really\nthat strong alcohol flavor coming right through that\nleathery sort of smell. Amazing! So now let's get into making this recipe. So what we're going to do is add a bunch of Bob's Red Mill\nWhole Wheat Flour into this. This is just going to provide some great flavors to this boule. Next, we're going to finish off with a little more of that bread flour. We're next going to\nsprinkle in our sea salt. We're going to add a bit\nmore yeast to this mixture. Now, go over to that poolish, we've got some hot water in\nbetween 105 and 107 degrees. Go ahead and pour it\nright into that poolish. This is going to sort of help\nloosen it up around the sides, and then just flip it and dump it right over into our bin full\nof flour, salt, and yeast. And then, immediately begin\nto mix this with your hands. Very vigorously squeeze and pull and fold, and squeeze and pull and fold, until it is completely combined. This should take three to five minutes for it to be completely mixed in. We do have to do a couple of folds, but first let's go ahead\nand set a lid on it and let it sit for 20 minutes. After that amount of time,\ngo ahead and come back, take the lid off, we want to stretch it just before it tears, don't pull too hard, and fold it over. Do this about six to\neight turns and times, put a lid on it, and then we're going to come back in another 20 minutes. Do the exact same thing\nfor the next 40 minutes. So three total folds. Just like all of my other recipe videos, here making bread, I wanted to give you a little bit more baking knowledge. We've talked about hydration,\nbaker's percentages. Now, I'm just going to talk a little bit about time and temperatures. While there isn't a perfect math here, you need to be patient, you have to give this dough plenty of time,\nand not just the poolish, I'm talking about the biga and also the sourdough starter levain. It takes time, okay? It needs to work to ferment,\nto break down the flour, so it gets that good bacteria in there to break down the gluten so\nyour stomach doesn't have to. That's maybe why there's so much gluten intolerance these days. Now I'm not perfectly certain, but I'm guessing that\nis contributing to it. Also, temperatures. You have to figure your water temperatures when you're pouring in and then also a final mix temperature. Almost all of your final mix doughs will be in between 70 and 80 degrees. I like to go a little\nbit on the higher side, simply because my studio\nis a little bit cooler, and I just think that the\nhigher temperature it is, without being too hot, gives the yeast more opportunity to work\nand work through that dough. But, I want to caution here, okay? Because everyone's room\ntemperature is different. If you're in Florida and\nyou like the windows open, I probably wouldn't go as hot as I've been going in a lot of these videos. I'd probably go a little cooler. And if you happen to live in\nMaine or maybe even Canada and you're a little bit colder up there, that's when you want\nto up the degrees maybe by one or two points. So, I just want to give you all that before we move on to the next step. And also, because we're making a boule, you're probably wondering what that is. It's really just a big,\nflattened ball of dough. Obviously, it's French. Think of boulangerie,\nwhich is the bread bakery. This word comes straight from that, or probably actually invented boulangerie. And if you've ever seen those old movies, like I think in Gladiator where\nthey're throwing bread out to the audience that's watching\nthem fight in the Coliseum. This looks like what they're doing. I mean, this thing is gigantic. It should feed you for probably a week. And the other cool thing, before\nwe go on to the next step, sorry, there's so much\nknowledge to be dropping here, a lot of these breads that have the preferments and the sourdough starter, they're a little bit more\nacid so they can last longer. I mean, probably eight to ten days. If you baked homemade\nbread eight to ten days, it's either rock solid or\nyou've got mold growing. This is a great bread that will last you a little longer than the usual thing. So now, after that last turn, you want the dough to rest\nfor another two hours. Giving it a max rest time of three. It looks beautiful, it's\nabout tripled in size. Now, it's time to move\nit over to our peel. So, go ahead and remove\nit from that bucket, on a very heavily floured surface. Now, what we want to do is\nfold it and then form it. So, remember stretch from the\ntop right to the bottom left. The top left to the bottom\nright, fold it over again, and begin cupping it. That motion that kind\nof works from the top all the way to the bottom,\ncupping it underneath, making a beautiful dough ball here. And then, what we need to do\nis move it over to a peel. If not, flip a cookie sheet tray over, if you don't have a pizza peel. We're going to lay down a\npiece of parchment paper. And then we're going to heavily\nflour up the top of that. Go ahead and set your\ndough right over top of it. We're going to sprinkle\nit with a little flour, add a kitchen towel to the top, and then we're going to let\nit proof for about one hour. It is looking beautiful,\nso while this is proofing, go over to the oven,\nlay down a pizza stone right in the bottom of the oven. Push it in, we're going to\nget it up to 500 degrees, just like all the other\nbread dough recipes. And let's stop right there. If you don't have a pizza stone, flip over a cookie sheet\ntray, you can put it on that. It's totally fine, just preheat it, make sure it's very very hot. That is important to this step. What we're going to do is\ncome back over to the bread, take that towel off, you can see this thing is massive already. And I'm going to score it. Feel free to take some slashes, maybe three or four all the\nway through the entire top. Going at about a quarter inch deep or so. I'm going to make little leaves or petals, or whatever I want just because\nI want it to look pretty. So, this part is completely up to you. Now, go ahead and go over\nand transfer the dough right on top of the stone. And for a little trick,\nI've got a huge metal bowl. I'm going to flip it over top\nand put it right on the stone, covering the bread, push it into the oven. We're cooking covered\nfor 30 minutes at 500. We're going to take the\ncover off after that time. We're going to cook it\nfor another 30 minutes, get it nice and golden brown. And let's stop right there because you may not have a bowl this big. What I'm trying to do is get\nsome moisture in the air. Because there's already\nwater in the dough, when it's covered in\nthose dutch oven pot tops, and of course, with\nthis bowl, it's steaming and making that bread really tender moist. Getting that nice crust on the outside. You want to do this\nwith all of your bread. So, if you don't have a bowl this big, no problem, put a pan in\nthe bottom rack of your oven and then when you put the dough in, throw a couple ice cubes into that pan. It will steam that bread,\nget sort of that same effect. It will keep it all\nright there in the oven. Let's take it out and you can see that this thing is absolutely gorgeous. It's gigantic. It is an amazing bread recipe for sandwiches for garlic bread. I mean, goodness, this is amazing! It's got a perfectly\nbrown crust on the outside and it's extremely tender on the inside. Of course, we want to slice it up. You can see those beautiful\nair pockets running through. It's light, it's fluffy, it's tender. It's exactly what bread\nshould be every single time. Cool it for 30 minutes and time to eat. I've seriously been dying to have a piece of this ever since\nit came out of the oven. It smells incredible in here. Oh my gosh. It is just- dude it's everything. It's so good, I want to eat more of it. Guys, I can't thank you enough for watching this bread series. Thanks to Bob's Red Mill for hooking up some amazing flour so I can\nmake this awesome bread. I've had so much fun, and of course, check out all the other\nbread recipes I've made. You will love them, it will change the way you look at bread, the way you make bread, and the way you eat bread. The flavors, ugh, this is amazing! I've got a lot of bread to eat, clearly. We'll catch up with you next week.

what you're not going to want to do is this this amount of flour what's going to happen is as you roll your dough across it and roll your dough together it's going to create two surfaces that will not adhere to each other so you want to be real sparing with your flour this is more of what you're going to be looking for okay okay this is the top of my loaf that's the ragged bottom I'm going to put the top down I'm going to gently D gasp and kind of shape it into a little bit of a circle here what we're going to do is we're going to pull the edges up and we're gonna make kind of a ball just fold it up into itself okay here's the nice smooth tuck gonna be the top of your loaf find a little section of your counter that doesn't have a lot of flour on it lay your boule on it and I've cut my hands around it and slide them towards the bowl I'm going to move the bowl about an inch that's all I'm going to do is what I'm doing is I'm creating surface tension on the top here I'm going to turn it in quarter of a circle do the same again just pull it towards me about an inch you see the tops tightening up here and what I'm doing is I'm aligning all of my gluten strands like how that's sitting up so nice and nice and high now okay I'm gonna just put that and you let this bench rest for about 10-15 minutes and I do the exact same thing one more time the reason I'm bench resting that for 10 to 15 minutes is I want my gluten to relax a little bit before I go to shape it because I vote it will fight me like crazy if you ever tried to make pizza and you're rolling out your pizza dough and it starts rolling back up on your rolling pin if that happens to you throw a towel over it let it sit for 10 minutes your gluten will relax and you'll be able to shape it the way you want and that's what we're doing with the bench rest and ours we're just letting the gluten relax okay we're back how our dough has been interesting for 15 minutes we're going to go ahead and and shape up our bar drool and take my bench knife I'm gonna pick it up I've got a lightly dusted surface I'm gonna very gently you gasp one more time it's how they that's shaped quite well and I'll pull the edges up onto itself and I'm going to do the exact same thing and I move it over to a section of the table where there's not a lot of flour and I'm gonna just very lightly pull it towards I'm not tucking my hands underneath like this I'm just pulling it towards me and I'm only pulling it towards me about an inch just to get a nice tight surface on the top and a nice shape okay I'm gonna check my seams make sure they're nice and closed up take my Banat on I'm gonna put it seem side up in the Banat on seam side up is important because I do not bake in the Banat on what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna flip this over and it's gonna bake with the other side up okay I'm gonna let this rise until it fills the Banat on and it's bubbling over and that's gonna take for this loaf about 60 minutes you", "6zW9LX9ALSI": "heyyo makers is Jack here bakery Jack hold on let me move these pears so it looks like a different week rolling hello there welcome back to the bakery Jack YouTube channel where i share with you live with my friend mike and expertise every single Thursday if that's your cup of tea and you're new here you've got about 120 videos to catch up on and if you don't want to miss the next one click Subscribe I know I've done a video like this before but I'm a little bit older a little bit wiser now I'm continuing on from the back-to-basics yeasted bread trilogy I did a while ago I thought it seemed an appropriate time to revisit this topic and make something a little bit more thorough and hopefully a bit more useful so I want to show you how to shape up loaves for different tins and I hope you get some value out of it cuts at a table okay here we are the table and I've got a range of tins I'll pop the measurements up here and I'll also put them in the descriptions box underneath this is a two pound loaf tin farmhouse stylee it's got stickers on cuz I put stickers on for classes and they just don't come off again that's the first one I'm gonna do a two pound loaf tea and the next one is a 1 pound loaf tin which is roughly half the volume is exactly half the volume actually probably but that's the one pound loading I'll do a couple of those you'll see them after and the other one I'm gonna do is this a long one okay a long two pound oh that's your normal su pounder that's your long two pounder Hayes the dimensions and that's what it looks like it's a long one we treat the dough slightly differently cuz we got to get it to fit inside of that sin I really like this one it makes nice small sandwiches for the kids but though I make him for today's demonstration has the following specification - straight up dough with 400 grams of white flour 100 grams of brown or wholemeal flour 340 grams of room-temperature water 10 grams of olive oil 12 grams of fresh yeast and 8 grams of salt okay the first thing I'm gonna do before anything else is grease up my tins I've done a video on this before you don't have to do it but it's a little bit more risky if you don't you can sort of do it two ways I've got fats of paper here save you can use that inside like this [Music] hope that sounded nice on camera just like that a thin coating or you can just do it with a little drizzle of olive oil like this get your hands in and just wipe it all over the bottom like that and all up the sides just you just want to do to where you want to get anywhere ideally now that's done I'll pop them here to the sighs I know get on lovey don't so this dough is ready to shape okay I'll put the method guide for you in shorthand underneath this video okay I mixed it I needed it I rested it for an hour I divided it and pre shaped it into these lovely balls and then I left them for another 15 minutes to relax and spread you can see it's soft its relaxed it was a firm bouncy ball and now it's relaxed a bit I realize here that FUP again is there might be quite a big piece of the puzzle missing which is the divide and pre shape stages if that's missing for you and you want to see that let me know in the comments and I'll do your video just on dividing and pre shaping it's though as one time's the recipe which means it's about 870 grams in total which is perfect for our to pound tin as a guide I will do a 500 gram of flour dough for a loaf in a two pound tin so this one this specific recipe being 500 grams of flour makes it though around about 870 grams by never work backwards from the size of the tin I just go 500 grams of flour that's enough to make the dough Fritz in and that's it first thing I'm going to do is leave my tin there out of the way give this a little bit of dust on the top remember we've got a dusty side now which is a top side and the sticky sides underneath so I'm gonna get my scraper underneath remove it from the table where it's been resting and flip it up the right way up okay always check it doesn't stick at this point you really don't want things too stiff it sticks now and you're doing stuff too it's just gonna stick even more so if you need to have a little dust of flour underneath but nothing major if you can get away with it now I'm gonna push it down my fingers like this into a circle it will naturally spread into a circle if I'm gentle with it and just push it down like they shouldn't give it a bit in knuckles if you want to just until what naturally spreads into this disc again check it doesn't stick if it is sticking for any reason you can sprinkle some flour on the edge so your scraper and just shimmy it underneath like this loosen up from the table make sure it doesn't stick now I'm gonna make two folds you could put my hair in underneath I'm gonna pull it out sideways like this this is the way I've been doing in my classes for a long time now fold one half over the top and the other side over the top of that one I'm going at the liberal angle and I wanted to show you a few loaves so I could show you this time and time again so you could really understand what's going on here I've gone an angle I want it to be pointy here and wide here but where it is white on this length here to be about the length of our tin no longer right because then I'm going to roll this up in a minute's gonna come down like a sausage and as that sausage comes down it's gonna get longer and longer if this bits already too long for our tin sauce is gonna be too long for our team so now again just checking it doesn't stick underneath push it down like this my fingers and Knuckles back down to where it was again let's at the top piece and make a little fold like that and stick it down okay this is the star of our sausage now as I roll this down I'm gonna give it a little bit of pressure with my thumb's here it's really gentle it's really not much just to plump it up like that a little push to plump this sausage up not pushing on the sausage just underneath where the new seam is coming down roll push roll push roll push push push nice and tight and I've squeezed up that seam into the table with my thumbs like that so it's joined okay now roll over so the tops back on the top and the new seam is underneath I give it a nice dust like this but stuff like this less is more really once you got that little loaf shape you're good to go now like that pop into my team like this give it a little shake just to make sure it's in the right place don't worry about holes like this on the sides it's gonna inflate its gonna feel that on its own don't feel the need to push it down like that cuz you really don't need to let's put this to one side and I'll do it again with a smaller one so this time into one pound tin wishes partha sides got half the amount of dough that's about four hundred and thirty five grams at though which is a dough made from 250 grams of flour I would never do one instant them you'd always use half kilo flour make two lobes you can always put one in the freezer or whatever and dust the top again like before make sure it's a little bit everywhere get my scraper underneath and flip it upside down same deal push down your fingers like this spit when your knuckles into a circle hands go underneath like this pull out sideways fold one side over and one side over the top make sure this with before you commit is not longer than the length of your tin here on the long side okay now fingers and Knuckles push you back down where it was always make sure it doesn't stick pick up a little bit of flour along the way if you need to to make sure it doesn't stick let's take the top bit down to start yourself off roll push roll push pull push pull push pull push pull push all the way to the end like that give it a nice dust-up at this point because that will help stop it from sticking to your tin make sure your seam is underneath like this get it inside of your tin like that okay and that's another one done things like this always worth repeatin up in because you might pick up something I said from the first two that you missed on the first two or something I might say something victim who knows let's go upside down onto the table and push down like this I'm gonna do something slightly different with this one I'm gonna shape it in the same way but I'm gonna do some cuts with a little knife on there okay so hands underneath pull it out sideways one side over one side over the top at that angle make sure that's not as long as your team that's perfect now top it down like that that's me fingers I was getting a bit sticky there you don't want a stick you want minimum say that you want minimum flour but you don't want it to stick if you're sticking and struggling and have a little dust but thus tactically only on that side a little bit on here on your fingers that you can't even see just to stop yourself from sticking okay and now a roll push I'll push I'll push all push off is rubbish I'll brush roll push down to the end squeeze up that seam and now you've got this lovely bouncy sausage shape give it a nice dust all over I'm going to take my knife this time before I put it in the tin and we'll give us some smashes like this one two three four five I'm gonna try and get in my 10 - we're down the top not too bad that should open up nicely I'll put some pictures of the final thing on here later that should open up nicely okay in this knife I've used there's a serrated knife it's just a tomato knife stuff like this when you've just shaped it is easy to cut with a knife like this as opposed to a green yet or to keep a green yet for stuff when it is puffed up but loaf like this when it's nice and bouncy and knife like this is perfect next our next tin is this long a two-pound okay so back up to our 870 grams of dough which is one single batch of 1/2 kilo of flour I'm a duster top slightly flip it upside down into the table and this time I gotta be careful right because if it's too short no amount of rolling out is gonna make it longer it's just gonna get tighter and it's just gonna get more elastic II and it's really not gonna help me out I've got one shot of this on video okay to get this just right we'll see if I can make it happen shall we a little bit of dust underneath okay sticky on the top like this push down a bit more thoroughly this time around because you want it to be nice and big ideally okay now I'm a little look at my loafing okay I want it to be sort of that long so I'm just gonna push it down a little bit more degassing firming up a little bit extra this time I could pull this out if I fold it that over I'm gonna get a bit of a dog bone thing going on well got a skinny middle and fat ends on there so I'm gonna I think I'm not gonna do that okay I'm just gonna keep it like this and then begin the roll from the top all day down to the bottom roll push push push push push up against sticky there it's okay little bit of flour should be okay always check that you're not sticking because the more you push into the table if you are sticking the more you're gonna stick like glue to a table now once we're here I'm just gonna take it bit by bit cuz we're quite a long now rolling on a push and rolling and push one end to the other end and there we go that looks all right to me sew a seam now underneath you can now go into our team about this well yeah okay just like that leaving is natural state if that seam is underneath which is right on the bottom it's okay it's just gonna pop it's gonna fill that space in the gaps all bias out sit there nicely and puff up so there they are these are not going to go straight in the oven now if you in and out any doubts about that I did a video about the process of bread making in the yeasted bread back to basics series it's gonna rest up now for another hour or so before they hit the oven and I'll do them for about 40 minutes 190 degrees today and they should come out lovely I'll pop a picture here and underneath I'll leave the speck of the dough the measurements of the tins and exactly the process of the dough I did up till this point that you missed and there you have it that's how to shape up a loaf in its in I hope this was helpful to you and don't forget if you do think that a divide in a pre shaping video is necessary if that would be helpful to let me know in the comments and I'll make it happen I'll see you next week for another weekly printmaking tip bye bye and there it is thanks for stopping by for your weekly bread making tip and even though this might seem like a sense of deja vu for some of you I hope you've got some additional value now this new updated version don't forget the link to the home bakers bulletin is always in the comments box underneath if you don't want to miss any of my content from the week I'll put it in a nice neat package straight into inbox every single Thursday sign up underneath see you next week", "iasiNuTMghs": "it makes sense to have all of your ingredients ready to go we start with the bread flour dump that right in next comes the 40 grams of whole wheat flour that adds a depth of flavor to the bread salt 10 grams equals one and a half teaspoons i have the diastatic malt powder and the yeast together here one teaspoon each die static malt powder is available online i was not able to find it locally in a health food store or a co-op so go online and look for it other malt powders don't work you do need die static malt powder so mix everything together carefully add your water and then we're going to mix it all up incorporating all of the dry ingredients into the water so there are no dry ingredients left in the bowl this takes about a minute it goes pretty quick um later on in the video um we're using baking stones i happen to use um floor tiles from home depot they were a buck a piece they're cheap way cheaper than a baking stone i've had baking stones that crack on me they're expensive and if these break i don't care that much because they were 99 cents each so four of them in the oven you'll see that later on so continue to fold this in and over on itself scraping the sides of the bowl to get all the dry ingredients incorporated once you have everything missed you're going to place the dough in a greased container i take it out of the bowl where i mixed it um and place it in this eight cup measuring cup um this has a lid on it it's why i use it you're uh free to leave it in the bowl where you mixed it up initially you can um grease that fully with the spray oil or olive oil whatever you want just to line it it helps it so it doesn't stick later on i put mine in here the lid on and it's going to rest so covered in rests for 30 minutes and we'll come back to it we move on to the stretch and fold you can see how thick the dough is here it's the first time we're doing it it gets more pliable and more supple as time goes on four times around the lid goes back on and it will again rest for 30 minutes so there's a total of five times with the stretch and fold with a 30 minute 30 minute rest in between each stretch and fold you'll see here that the dough has risen a little bit you're going to see that it's much more stretchy than it was before and that continues each time we do the stretch and fold so reach underneath pull it up give it a little shake and fold it over the top and four times around is enough to get that some people do eight you can choose whatever works for you four works for me so three more of these to go i'm showing you all of them all five so that you can see how the dough changes over time that has risen again way more stretchy way more supple than it was before when you get your hand in this you'll you'll be well aware of how much it's changed after each 30 minute rest so again reach underneath pull it up shake it and fold over the top back with the cover for another 30 minute rest two more and we're almost done again the dose risen quite a bit way more flexible than it was and run out the final stretch and fold i know some people who only do four i like the fifth one but if you're short on time four would be sufficient it's really kind of nice to see how this is progressing as you go along it's a good feeling so this gets covered and now it's going to rest in the refrigerator for 12 to 24 hours you can see the large bubbles it's been about 20 hours um it continues to rise even though it's in a cold refrigerator that doesn't matter that much i'm not going to flower the bench and um get the dough out of the measuring cup where it was rising on your bowl if you use a bowl so you gently want to pull it out you want it you don't want to deflate this any more than you need to so once it's on the bench you're going to gently pat it down and stretch it out into approximately an eight by eight inch square because we're going to divide it into four pieces so once you're satisfied that it's approximately eight by eight i use a bench scraper to divide my dough it goes through it quickly and easily cut it in half and then each of those will be cut in half again a little more flour on the bench just so that it doesn't stick and it will be covered with plastic wrap and rest for 45 minutes i probably could have used two pieces here instead of one um it does rise a little bit and i don't want the uh four pieces to to get into each other so once it's been 45 minutes uncover it and we're going to pre-shape um the baguette if it sticks while you're doing this just gently tug on it shake it a little bit it'll come off like this the dough is pretty wet this is a 75 hydration rate um it's okay if it does that and i'm gonna this time i'm gonna cover it with two pieces of plastic wrap i really should have done that the first time so one at a time the dough is going to be rolled up on itself it looks kind of like a burrito when you're done a little more flour again so it doesn't stick because it will rest after this so very gently without deflating roll it over on itself and you'll have a little burrito of bread dough same with all four of them once the last one is done you get covered with plastic wrap i went to two pieces here have them far enough apart so they won't stick together and it's another resting period of 30 minutes it's not as likely to stick at this point but again if it does just give it that little shake and it won't gently pull away you do want to be gentle with the dough so i'm going to put an area with extra flour you can see that on the on the upper left there that's just to coat the bottom of the loaf as we start to form the baguettes and a i use a baking sheet and over the top i lay an old dish towel you can actually it's called a koosh and you can actually buy one made out of linen i don't have one i tend to use whatever's around in the kitchen this gets very gently padded down into about a four by six square you roll in one side to the middle the other side back to the middle it makes a little trough this is not like folding a letter to go into an envelope and then my thumb gets placed in between and i fold it over the top of my thumb and pinch it down on the edge the dough is wet enough that it normally will stick fine press it down again with my fingers and once more with the heel of my hand to make sure there's a nice seal there at this point you roll the dough out to get it approximately 14 or 15 inches long i um started this at the end and not at the middle you'll see in the subsequent loaves that i start rolling from the middle and pull it out it goes a lot easier a lot quicker a lot smoother this one is a little misshapen because of that i'm now putting flour on the couch you're going to see later on that i didn't put near enough flour on it i had my baguettes were sticking to it more flour will prevent that the whole idea of the koosh is to make a little trough for each loaf it keeps them separate it supports the loaf while it's rising because there's going to be one more rise of about an hour after this some more more flour to set it in first get it on the bottom bring it over again fold it flat i'm sorry flatten it out first then fold it over to the middle gently press it in we do not want to deflate this any more than we have to you don't necessarily have to turn that around to do it you can do it while it's facing you i just want to make sure that you can see the process of doing this that's got the trough thumb goes back in fold it over push down on the edge press that edge down with fingertips being gentle and then the heel of the hand only on that edge not on the loaf itself you don't want to flatten that out and get any air bubbles that might be building up inside or out the ends stay open so there's room for expansion you can see that when i rolled from the beginning from the middle working out towards the ends works out a lot better it's a lot more even the more you do this the better your technique gets i have not made baguettes for quite a while and i'm a little rusty here but we get a nice finished loaf to begin with and that's what matters so once more pat it down fold it over to the middle hold the other side over to the middle thumb in the trough if it's sticking too much to your hand you can always put a little flour on like i did just there that will prevent it from sticking too much to your hand while you're doing this fingertips pressing down heel of the hand only on the edge and roll from the middle and kind of pull out as you're doing it and see how quickly and easily that goes then onto the koosh make another trough and one more to go i'm coming around the bench here a little bit so that you can see this from another angle i normally do this where i'm at the position of the camera it's a little bit awkward for me to do it from the side like this but i want you to see how this looks from this angle i'm being gentle this whole time it's not um you're not being rough with the dough over the thumb and you can see that it's sticky enough to pretty much hold on its own i really just want to get the edge that i'm handling heel of the hand and then roll it out from the middle working my way out there you go into the koosh make the final trough and now we're going to get ready for the final rest or rising it's going to rise for an hour so once they're snuggly in their troughs i fold the top over the over them all and i'm going to place the cookie sheet the koosh and the bread dough into a bag you want to gently slide this in you don't want it to go flying off the baking sheet i've had that happen pull the bag entirely over the baking sheet tuck it underneath and it will sit for an hour the whole point of this is to keep some of the moisture in there while it's rising and uh also creates a little bit of heat so at this point you're gonna place your baking stones in a pan in the bottom of the oven and you're gonna preheat the oven the baking stones and the pan to 500 degrees fahrenheit which is 260 degrees celsius um you'll see the placement of the baking stones for me which are actually floor tiles the same tiles that are on the floor in my kitchen the baking pan goes on the bottom not on the bottom shelf but on the bottom of the oven you're going to be pouring hot water in that later on that will create steam which helps in the oven spring that's how much it rises in the oven so at this point i want to get the cookie sheet out of the way um you want to be gentle you don't want to knock you don't want to knock a loaf onto the floor um and we're going to transfer the dough to parchment paper so you can see i've torn off a piece of parchment paper and the dough needs to be rolled onto this transfer board i use an uh a cutting board that i have you can actually buy a transfer board you can see how wet the dough is how sticky it was if i had put more flour on the couse that would have come off very easily you'll see that the last loaf that i take off of here did have enough flour on the koosh and it came off very well if there's enough flour you just can you can actually flip it up onto the board you'll see it on the last one how how it worked but because i've uh haven't made baguettes for a while i'm a little rusty but again it does not affect the flavor or the look of the loaf and because it's stuck a little that's not the end of the world it's still kept most of its shape and it will do fine in the oven and it's wet enough that it was sticking to the transfer board so two loaves on each piece of parchment because i'm going to bake on two different shells in the oven this one went a little better but that end is sticking so just be gentle with it as you peel the koosh away from it then also gently transfer to the parchment paper and you'll see on this last loaf that there was plenty of flour under this particular one how nicely it flips over onto the transfer board just a little stick on the end there so the reminder is put plenty of flour on the coos don't worry about it you're not going to overdo it if you get flour on the floor that's not the end of the world just sweep it up later my that was my concern that i was going to have a big mess to clean up and i didn't want to do that so the oven is been preheated is preheating right now it's it's reached temperature and i'm slashing each loaf with a sharp razor blade i unfortunately did not have a sharp razor blade today and mine's kind of dull so it's tearing through the loaf a little bit that's not the end of the world the idea is to these slashes create room for the bread to expand and open up and create a nice ear it's called an ear that um on there where the slashes you'll see that mine didn't do that very well it's because i had a dull razor so you're going to have a half a cup of hot water ready you're going to pour that in the pan that's sitting on the bottom of the oven you can't see the pan right now but i have a round cake pan sitting on the bottom of the oven itself slide two there and two more on the next and so there's i have two 12 by 12 floor tiles that i'm using for baking stones i use the same setup when i'm doing pizza water goes in creates lots of steam and it's going to bake for 12 to 15 minutes it depends on your oven for me this was a 12 minute bake i know my bread is done because of the nice dark color of it i should have switched shelves for the lows about halfway through the bake at six or seven minutes they would have been more even you'll see that the the two on the middle shelf were much lighter in color and it cools on a rack for 30 minutes maybe up to an hour the bread needs to finish baking you do not want to cut into it early um you'll have gummy bread if you do so time to cut in nice uh crispy sound as you're cutting in big holes in the bread this bread had a great flavor i put peanut butter and butter on mine it was delicious absolutely delicious and the point of all this is if i can do this you can too that's breaking bread with d", "fcQfyimnF7E": "five things to do with leftover pizza dough i always make extra dough because it's basically the same amount of work to make four portions as it is to make one things i'm going to show you could work with any dough recipe my standard one is in the description and the only unusual thing about it is i like to knead it up portion it into individual oiled containers and put it straight into the fridge i let it cold ferment for many days maybe a week and here's how it comes out i usually go around the edge gently pulling it away from the glass i want to lift it out while deflating it as little as possible and perhaps the most obvious thing to do with leftover pizza dough is make garlic knots you take your dough try to get it into a reasonably even rectangle and then slice that into strips there's a million ways to tie these but you can simply take a strip cross the ends over send one up the middle and you've got a garlic knot i once saw this young lady making these at a restaurant and she did this rad move where she'd pick up the strip wrap it around two fingers twice and then send the excess through she did like one every second that way not sure i did that right if you're feeling really unconfident you can totally just do this down on the board cross two ends over send one end through and what to do with the other end well you could just leave it dangling out it would cook darker and crispier than the rest which would be a nice texture contrast or if you're not into that you could simply tuck it under oh we should probably place these directly onto our baking sheet as we shape them that's just some parchment paper i have on there not necessary now these are looking pretty big they're going to double in size make yours as big as you want but i think i want little knots i'm going to start cutting these strips in half before i tie them if the dough is sticking to you really bad you could lubricate your hands with water flour or oil depending on what kind of finish you want on your little breadlets i want a crispy brown crust so i'm going to work these with oil on my hands that's what oil will do to the surface in the oven i'm going to need two trays so i might as well put the big ones together and the little ones together that way the big ones can bake a little longer i'll proof those for about a half hour that is give the yeast time to raise them one last time in their final form that'll help them bake up a little area and i don't think they need to be covered that coating of oil should form a water safe barrier to keep them from drying out over that time garlic knots are coated in a heavily seasoned oil or butter some people brush that on before they go in the oven but i think that just gets you a seasoned dinner roll i'm gonna bake these dry at 400 fahrenheit 200 c for probably 20 minutes that's plenty of time to peel and chop like half a head of garlic and a big fistful of fresh parsley a stick of butter goes into that little sauce pan i prefer to make this with olive oil but my wife prefers butter so we're doing butter i'll melt that on like medium high heat scrape in the garlic and then just turn the heat off it does not have to cook very much and you certainly don't want to burn it in goes a bunch of whatever other seasonings you want i'll do pepper a pinch of chili flakes some dried oregano not yet with the fresh parsley i'll give that a taste you might think that it needs salt especially if you used unsalted butter but i say hold off on the salt for now okay some people bake these until they're just set but still kind of pale that will get you nice soft garlic knots i prefer to bake them until they're getting quite brown like that they might seem too hard at this stage and they are but they're not going to stay that way in these go to a bowl ideally while still warm and i'll pour in much of my seasoned butter i'll hold back a little just in case they don't need it then just stir and stir for a minute give them time to absorb that stuff i'll grate in some cheese i do this now so it doesn't get too hot and go grainy likewise i'll put in parsley after things have cooled down a little bit to keep it green and there you go between the cheese and the salted butter i used those are almost salty enough but i'll hit them with some more the butter will make the salt stick garlic knots are classically an appetizer and if you start with breadlets that are baked a little too hard they won't go mushy as they sit around soaking in the butter or oil as people peck on them before dinner you know it's also great to have before dinner and a pair of teeth from house the sponsor of this video house is this really exciting farm to glass aperitif maker in california it's a family business let's see what flavors i got citrus flour that was my favorite last time ooh ginger yuzu aperitifs aren't super common here in the u.s it's something you traditionally drink as you're hanging out with your friends waiting for dinner to be served it's relatively low alcohol and flavored to excite the palette yum great brandy from sonoma county raw sugar orange peel lemongrass yuzu from california just super refreshing and creative that is you can make cocktails with them whatever will the asian flavors in this particular one clash with something like garlic knots no those are like long lost cousins reunited but house is an anytime drink i don't always have it before dinner it's just a lovely thing to sip on whenever the first 100 of you can get 10 off and free shipping on your house essentials kit just hit my link in the description and use my code adamergucia2 thank you house okay second thing to do with leftover pizza dough it's way simpler something my dad used to do when i was growing up just lay out the dough as before and cut it into little rectangles specific dimensions are up to you just remember they're probably double in size when you cut them pull them away from each other so they don't merge back into each other like that and you don't have to do rectangles let's try rolling some into balls again i'll let those proof for 20 or 30 minutes nice and puffy now okay wide pan and in goes at most a half inch of olive oil a centimeter and heat it to medium at most these need really gentle frying not that gentle i want to see some fizzing when it goes in plop them all down flip when the first side is just golden and really the trick here is to not burn them see that one that's too dark that'll taste burnt really gentle heat if you can turn them up on their sides and fry the sides go for it but i kind of like the pale sides heterogeneity and when they're golden and they don't seem to be puffing up anymore i'd basically cook them another minute just to make sure the inside is done and pull them out to paper towels you could sprinkle some salt on them right now while they're still sticky but my dough is already pretty well seasoned give one of those a taste those were dinner rolls in my house growing up they taste strongly of the extra virgin olive oil which is delicious a little crispy little chewy always looked forward to those when i was a kid and here's another thing my dad would do in with the little spherical ones they're not donut holes don't bother trying to get even color on them all the way around some paper towels into a bowl this time and you can see i let a couple of those get too dark while i was moving the camera then cinnamon sugar it's usually about five parts sugar to one part cinnamon dump on a lot of it it's the only source of sugar in this dessert shake those up a little bit my dad used to do this in a paper lunch bag to wick away oil and if you think olive oil has no place in desserts think again my friend that is a phenomenal flavor combination way more sophisticated than a donut and not too sweet okay third thing to do with leftover pizza dough make pizza bread i have a whole video about this in the description but it's just a cute name my kids gave to this very simple thing works best with a dough that you've aged in the fridge for like a week you take your dough out and turn it around the underside has a rougher more bubbly surface you wipe it down with some olive oil and you put on whatever seasonings you want i do black pepper garlic powder and some very big crunchy salt my oven has been preheating on maximum for about a half hour and i'll just plop this down onto my pizza steel a stone works too i wouldn't try to shimmy this on with a peel the olive oil would make it stick i just drop it on that takes seven minutes if the top is not browning you might need to turn on the broiler midway that's just the heat from above the grill don't burn the garlic powder though it burns easy i often need a metal tool to scrape that up off the steel look at the bottom if you just try to bake this on a baking sheet or something you won't get that crispy base and if you've seen me bake this bread before you might be thinking hey that looks a little different on top yes it does because i got a new oven and it's just amazing the extent to which every oven is different look at that glassy crispy top on that just a shockingly good simple thing that never fails to please the kids or adults fourth thing you can do with leftover dough freeze it pizza dough freezes amazingly well just freeze it after it is fully risen when it's ready to bake i could just transfer that glass container straight to the freezer the dough is full of air so it's not like straight water that expands when it freezes and breaks glass containers but this does work better if you pull it out and wrap it in plastic wrap or put it in a freezer bag if the dough is spread out nice and flat it will freeze quickly and it will thaw quickly it's flat and it's full of air bubbles so it'll thaw on the counter in like 30 or 40 minutes 20 minutes if you put it on aluminum which is extremely thermally conductive just flip it halfway when you can feel that side touching the metal is soft 20 minutes later it's ready now has freezing killed the yeast in there some of them probably and that might be a problem if we were making a bread that needs to proof up really big and puffy right before baking but with a flat bread like pizza every single yeast could be dead in there and it wouldn't matter as long as we let the dough rise before we freeze it and what kind of pizza are we making now well this is idea number five use your leftover dough to experiment with something new in this case lauren's been wanting to try this smitten kitchen recipe she saw for a summer squash pizza it's linked in the description if you go through all the work to make dough and you let it ferment possibly for days you're going to be really bummed if you try some weird new pizza that you've never made before and it sucks so i say do all your experimenting with your extra dough especially when you're not particularly hungry then you can't lose this is just a couple of grated squash into which she's put like a teaspoon of salt to witness the power of osmosis just squeeze all the moisture she can out of that and discard then mix in like four or five ounces of gruyere maybe 120 grams we both thought this recipe looked promising but we were worried the flavors would be a little bland it does call for gruyere which is certainly stronger than mozzarella so we're thinking that might compensate for the lack of any strong sauce we had an instinct to use garlic but we figured we'd follow the recipe which also calls for scattering some bread crumbs on the top before baking we're using panko this should brown and make a nice textural contrast my pizza steel has been preheating on max temperature for like an hour and i turned on the broiler halfway through to brown the top looks pretty nice that by the way can you tell this dough was frozen neither can i it's still puffed up great around the rim nice and crispy nice brown bottom that smitten kitchen recipe really is delicious though we do both think it needs garlic and we're not mad because we're just experimenting with our extra doughs we already had normal pizza last night we can't lose and you can't lose if you pre-order lauren's latest novel it's kind of a cheesy love story link in the description hashtag kind of an ad because we're married but lauren's not the sponsor of this video houses and their farm-to-glass aperitifs are just as good with dinner as they are before dinner get free shipping and 10 off with my link and code in the description along with my dough recipe go make some dough way more than you need", "C6dNbYBMeXg": "today we are going to step by step walking through how to make a crusty sourdough roll we start by measuring out everything either on an electric scale or by value it's seven ounces of sourdough starter which is one and a quarter cups thirteen ounces of white bread flour which is around two and a half cups six and a half ounces of water which is 3/4 of a cup plus one tablespoon and then we're going to do half a teaspoon of sugar if you have diastatic malt powder you can use that as well but plain white sugar is going to be fine we mix this up by hand I'm sorry just with a spoon and that is gonna rest for about 40 minutes in a step called Auto lies we can just go ahead and cover it with a damp towel leave it on the counter and we'll come back and between 30 and 60 minutes now once the OTO lies step is done we need to add in our yeast and our salt we're going 1/2 a teaspoon of instant yeast one and a half teaspoons of salt and we're going to knead the dough to work in these two ingredients so we take it out of the bowl and put it directly on the counter or if you have a floured board that's fine - we're gonna knead it by hand for about I would say three to five minutes what we're looking for is to make sure our gluten is fully developed enough so that we see windows in our dough and I'll show you in a minute what a window will look like and that will mean that you've kneaded it enough if you have a bread machine and you want to knead it in the bread machine that would work fine do so we keep on kneading it's gonna start feeling sticky and halfway through the kneading I like to let it rest about five minutes and then come back but that's not absolutely necessary so once it starts feeling really smooth and soft under your hands you can pull off about a little walnut sized ball of dough stretch it out and see if you see any type of translucent area appearing that is what's known as a window that means that your gluten has been developed enough and it is ready to start rising so we see a window we're gonna lightly oil a clean bowl shape our boat our dough into a ball place it inside cover it with a damp tea towel and let it rise somewhere warm for about an hour if your kitchen is not warm you can just lightly heat up your oven turn it off and then put your dough in there sure your oven is off while it's rising or else it will do it so about an hour later or til was nice and puffy we are gonna dump it out and start shaping our rolls I find that this is going to be 8 rolls in this recipe I find that the easiest way to do it is to divide it in half then quarters and then eighths you can also use an electric scale if you want them to be exactly the same size I'm not doing that and they do end up a little bit uneven but that's not really a big deal so we divide it using a sharp knife into eight roughly equal pieces and you can see that the dough is a little bit sticky so it's not super easy to work with but that's fine so don't be alarmed if it seems overly sticky and really try not to add more flour at the stage so now we are going to prepare our baking sheet by putting down a piece of parchment paper and sprinkling it with cornmeal if you don't have parchment you can just do a cooking spray and then really heavily cover it with cornmeal to shape the Loews you want to pinch them from the bottom that's going to round out the top um yep just keep pinching and once they're shaped place them on your baking sheet as equally apart as you can get them once all of them are on we're just gonna dust the tops with flour um you can do bread flour or you can just do regular all-purpose flour it doesn't matter so sprinkle it on and then rub it into the top of the look of the rolls to help it stick then we do want to slash these it's not just for decoration it helps them bloom correctly in the oven and not a rip an undesirable places so either using a special tool for this or just a sharp serrated knife go ahead and make either a slash or an X on the top of your loaves now rolls take much shorter of a time to rise compared to a loaf of bread because they're small so we are gonna have these rise just at room temperature and they're gonna rise quickly so make sure you cover them with heavily grease plastic wrap because if something sticks to the top of these when you go to pull it off it's really gonna ruin the look of your rolls go ahead and set them at warm room temperature in about 20 minutes into your rising period you're gonna want to pre-heat your oven when you pre-heat your oven put in an empty rimmed baking sheet we want that empty baking sheet to get really hot because that's gonna help us create steam for when these rolls speak so about halfway through your rising time go ahead and do that when your oven has preheated go and check your rolls it should have been about a total of a 45 minute rising time and they should look very puffy pour 1 cup of water into that empty baking sheet it's gonna buckle it's gonna be loud there's gonna be lots of steam that's fine stick the baking sheet with your rolls and quickly close up the oven and set your timer for I start with 15 minutes but mine usually go more like 18 minutes this is really it seems like a long time but that steam brings your oven temperature way down so that's why they're gonna bake longer than a typical roll so check it 15 they can go up all the way up to 20 when they're done we take them out in cool", "fD5TiA-izec": "Welcome to The Baking Journalist, I'm\nTony Ganzer. Today's episode is about trying to make a better baguette. I do\nsay make a 'better baguette,' not a perfect baguette, because it might not be perfect,\nbut it still tastes great. We can all get better with practice so this is my step\ncloser to an impressive baguette. This recipe is more or less the same as my basic Salted French bread, you can check that out, but the process has changed a\nlittle, well, okay, it's changed a lot. This is for four baguettes. I start by putting\nmy 1.5 teaspoons of sugar, 1.5 teaspoons of salt in a big bowl. I also put in\nabout 0.75 ounces or so of active dry yeast, then pour in 2 cups of warm water\nand wait just a couple of minutes. My measurements for ingredients are not\nalways scientifically precise. I prefer a casual measuring method to the intense\nalternative, but hey to each their own. Next you'll pour in a cup or two of\nwhite bread flour I use King Arthur bread flour, but just pick a higher\nquality unbleached flour whatever you do. Some baguettes blend flours: don't be\nafraid to explore. Mix in that flour well and then pour in another cup or two. I\ntypically get four-and-a-half to five cups of flour in before the dough is\ndrying out, so do the best you can to find the right amount. I then let that\ndough rise in a greased bowl for about 45 minutes or more. The goal is to get a\nnice rise-- you'll know when you got it. Once puffed, you pat it down and then on\na lightly floured surface split the big dough into four smaller equal parts. You\ncan fold these pieces a little into a tighter blob, you measure them, if you\nhave a scale, and then cover each one and come back in about 15 minutes. I've been\ncovering them with plastic wrap, but that may change, we'll see. Next up we'll shape the baguettes. I'm still learning this, but here's the\ngist: push down on the dough to get any big air bubbles out and then you fold it\nonce over. You seal the fold with the palm of your hand, and then you do it\nagain: fold and seal. Then you'll roll the dough into that baguette shape we know\nand love, and you can try to taper the ends I'm still getting the hang of it.\nI've started to try to use what's called a couche for the next rise, but you can\nput your dough right onto a baking pan. This couche is just a cotton pillowcase\nwith some flour in it, which forms a floury bed for your dough, but again you\ncan do it how you like, whatever works for you. After another 40 minutes or so\nis the transfer. Professional bakers use a wooden baguette board or peel to move\nthe dough from couche to pan or however it will be in the oven. I'm using a\ncutting board; it works for now. Pre-heat your oven at this point to 450 degrees\nFahrenheit. The next step is a scoring: cutting angled lines lengthwise down the\ndough. I'm using a dull bread knife for this one, it's not ideal, but you can get\na bread lame: a razor blade on a stick to cut easier. I've also been spritzing my\ndough with water. Into the oven for 20 minutes or so, and then take a look.\nYou can bake these a little too long very easily and every oven is different\nso good luck with what you have. How do you know if the baguette is a success?\nHonestly it depends what you're looking for. Don't let anybody else's definition\nof success or great bread define what is good for you. One option: taste it! If it tastes great well, hey, that's a success. And another\nskill important in journalism and baking which might help you here: take a listen! Thanks for watching, and happy baking!", "dMHZepJ77rE": "so today I'm going to show you how to shape and fashion the seahorse baguette so we take a basic baguette which is almost at its final stage of molding and halfway up I'm going to elongate the bottom half to form a thin piece of dough and this is going to form the tail so you can see it's actually quite thin and then just up towards the end we're just gonna roll out get a bit of a space for the neck and then I'm gonna chop here and fold it down which is going to form the head and the mouth so if the head and mouth formed we're gonna take the tail and we're gonna twist it slowly up as far as the belly so I'm just gonna push the belly out to accentuate it a little bit and that's basically form of the seahorse if you get before it's proved", "shMscB76K7E": "Hey everyone! Thank you for tuning in!\nToday we're making baguettes at home and before we get started, I do want to remind you\nthat this is a two-day process. To start off, we're going to make our poolish. Which is 2 cups of bread flour, next you're going to add 4 ounces of your\nstarter or 2 teaspoons of active dry yeast. Now we're going to add 1 cup of\nwarm water and make sure everything is mixed well and there are no dry flour\nbits. So our poolish is just about done and we are going to rest this for 12\nhours, covered, in a warm area. After resting the poolish overnight, we\nare now able to start the dough. Of the one and a half cups of water, we are\ngoing to use one and a quarter cups of the warm water first and we're going to\nmix very well. Make sure that everything is incorporated and it's more of a\nliquid mass rather than a sticky one. We're going to add one teaspoon of\nactive yeast, even if you used levain before during your poolish or you used the\ncommercial yeast, definitely still put the 1 teaspoon of yeast. Just to help\nwith the rising process. Add in one teaspoon of salt\nand then a mix of three cups of bread flour and three cups of all-purpose\nflour. At this point you can either use your dough whisk or your hand to mix this\ndough; I like to use my Kitchen Aid with the dough hook attachment. It's a lot\neasier and saves a lot of time. We're going to pulse this a few times on low\nand then we're going to add water in slowly. I like to do it in little\nincrements, just so that it's enough to form the dough. You don't want to add too\nmuch, otherwise you're going to have to put more flour in to build a perfect\ndough consistency. Just keep a lookout. We're gonna turn this up a notch and\nbring up the speed a little bit. After scraping down the dough, I notice it\nneeded a little bit more water just so that the dough really comes together and\nit's more tacky. We want to keep kneading this on the speed level four, just until\nthe dough is off the sides of the walls. Now it's looking a lot better and\nwe're going to stop it. Now we're going to move over to my\nfavorite part, which is the kneading process. We're going to start off with\ndusting with a little bit of flour. You don't want to add too much, as it will\nplay a big part in your dough consistency when you're rolling it out\nlater on. For some that want to know how I knead my dough,\nI do have an overhead and a side view snapshot so you can really see what I do\nwhen I'm kneading my dough this is what I normally do for all of my breads and\nit's also a great way to relieve any stress that you may have. So we're going\nto start off with tucking in all of the corners and then really bring it all in\nand then at the end we're going to roll it into a ball and we're going to tuck\nin the dough by pulling it towards us with the pinkies dragging on the bottom.\nReally tucking that dough in, to form a seam. You know your kneading is\ncomplete when your dough is smooth and soft to the touch, not sticky anymore. Now we're going to drizzle a little bit of olive oil into the bowl, place it in\nthere, cover it and we're going to rest it for one hour. After the hour, you can see that it's\ndoubled in size, which is great! That's what we're looking for! You definitely\nwant to see that it has risen. I have a problem with deflating my dough\nsometimes, but you don't have to it's okay, just scrape it out and we're gonna\nstart dividing the dough evenly so that we can start forming perfect dough balls\nand then making them into baguette shapes. As you noticed, I ever so slightly\ndusted the area where I'm going to put my dough, as well as a small portion of\nflour at the top right just for later on when I am rolling out my baguettes. We\nare going to dust them and then I also floured my digital scale area so that it\ndoesn't really stick so much. So we're shaping the dough balls, measure them out\nand then shape them you're gonna tuck in the corners just\nlike before when you're kneading them and then we're gonna quickly roll them\ninto a ball. You don't need to need them, just basically pull all of the corners\nin and then shape that ball. If you don't have enough room, you can lightly flour\nanother area space or your cutting board and put the dough balls right on there. We're going to lay them all seam side down. So we're going to continue dividing\nthem. I'm just going to gently flatten with my hands and then tuck all of the\ncorners in, flip it over and roll it into a ball. You're going to continue this all\nthroughout until you're done with all of that dough. See, so I ran out of space and I needed\nto transfer all of my dough balls onto the cutting board which I had lightly\nfloured. If you do this step ahead of time, you won't have to do it later on\nlike myself. But I just wanted to show you guys all of the dough balls and how we\nform them and just showing you that the seam sides are down. So now I'm going to\nmove them over and then we're going to start shaping our baguettes. Are you\nready? To start, we're going to have the seam side up at this point. If it does\nget a little bit sticky, it's okay. Just dust your fingers with some flour and\nthen just apply a little bit on to the dough. A very very tiny bit and then we're\ngoing to gently flatten and we're going to take the top portion of the third and\nfold it down like an envelope. We're gonna rotate it 180 degrees and do the same\nthing so it meets into the middle. Now, with my left hand I'm basically putting\nan indent into the middle of that section with my thumb and then using my\nright hand to just bring the dough over it and just seal it again. So I did that\ntwice. I did it one side and then I rotate it did it again. As you can see\nthe seam is pretty much shut, if it's not it's okay, just use your fingers to just\npinch it a little bit. I'm using one hand in the middle to cup and move it back\nand forth and then using both hands to really bring the dough out to create a\nsmall point at the ends which is your baguette and still see that the seam is\ncompletely shut. We're gonna dust the bottom of that portion and when we lay\nout onto our floured surface I like to use like a couche or a towel. We're gonna\nlay it so that the seam side is up. I'm sorry it's not pictured here, but I'm gonna let\nyou guys watch it slowly and zoom in and I won't talk. So here you go. Now that you've watched it the second\ntime, do you think you've got it? I'm going to speed this up a little bit and\nlet's see what you can do. Okay, so the last view I sped it up quite\na bit, just so that you can really see it. If you want, you can absolutely rewind it\nand rewatch it. You're gonna rest this for about thirty\nminutes, covered. You want to rest this until you when you stick your finger to\ntouch the dough it leaves an imprint, but it slowly bounces back. So if it\nbounces back too quickly, your dough is not ready to be baked. But if it comes up\na little bit slower, then it's ready to score and then we're gonna bake it. So my\nfirst tray is actually ready to be transferred over onto parchment paper. It\ntook about 45 minutes to rest. So, I used a paper bag that's folded up, you can use\na pizza peel if you have, but a paper bag works just as fine for me. So I'm gonna\ntransfer it over and I basically roll it over and have the seam side facing down.\nAnd before we score, go and pre-heat your oven. Now you're going to use a really\nsharp knife and score on a 40 degree angle, you want to make sure that the tip\nof the knife really tucks in on that side to cut through and you don't want\nto pause when you're cutting through the baguette. You want to just take one big\nlong slit right through the middle so that it can open up nicely. Watch again. Since I'm just about done, we're going to\nmove this to our preheated oven. I have two baking sheets upside down and I'm\ngoing to lay it in there and I'm gonna spritz it with a little bit of water to\ncreate steam to allow the baguettes to open up when they're baking and rise\nnicely. So I'm gonna put the next one in, spritz a little water. I do have a cast iron pan\nin the oven, I'm going to put hot water right into that empty cast-iron pan and\nclose the oven right away. You want to keep the steam inside. I really hope you enjoyed watching this\nbaguette tutorial. It's taken me some time to really put it together for all\nof you, but I hope you enjoy it. Please like and subscribe and let me\nknow your comments below. Thank you for watching, until next time...", "qwOb-tpdzy8": "hi again everyone how are you doing I hope you're all doing well and we're doing French baguettes this time so we've learned a lot about yeast already hopefully you watch some of the other demos so I'm gonna go through this a little bit faster this one's called a lean dough if you notice in the recipe there's no fat in the recipe at all there's no butter oil margarine or anything like that so it's called the lean dough so we're gonna start just like we usually do I have sugar already dissolved in our warm water I have tested the temperature of the water and it is about 110 degrees member nice warm water I'm gonna sprinkle the yeast in there just sprinkle the yeast on top and then we will let that sit for about five minutes until it gets foamy make sure all your yeast is in the water and not stuck to the side of your bowl okay we'll let that stand for five minutes okay so it's been about five minutes since the yeast was sprinkled onto the sugar water and you should see some foam if you've still got granules of yeast on top give it a little stir and then wait another minute or two and you'll see it should get nice and foamy once you get it all dissolved in so make sure you stir the granules if they haven't gotten wet yet into the water and that will help activate it which is what happened to mine I still have a few granules in there so I stirred it up a little bit got it all wet and then now it's gotten quite foamy and active alright so set that aside for a second we're going to go through your recipe okay so that was 65 milliliters of warm water I am actually doubling the recipe because a lot of you are at home now feeding your families so this recipe in school in class was making one loaf between two people so I my family's family of five so I easily could triple this recipe but I decided doubling it was quite easy so 65 mils warm water I doubled it to about 125 I know would have been 1:30 but approximately okay so about 125 130 warm water eight mils of yeast is what the recipe says I used 15 mils of yeast 3 mils of sugar I used 5 mils of sugar that's what's in there ok your next step so I've done step 1 combine the warm water and sugar in a small bowl I just use my liquid measure okay sprinkle the yeast over and let it stand for 5 minutes until it was foamy okay and then I stirred it all out okay now I'm on step 2 in a large bowl and combining the salt remaining sugar and yeast mixture okay so here's my salt and the extra sugar so keep note there's two amounts of sugar in this recipe there first amount goes in with your yeast second amount goes in now with your dry mixture okay so I've got salt and sugar in here and I'm going to add my yeast mixture now and you see all that foam on the side make sure you get your rubber spatula and scrape all that off you don't want all your you stuck to your liquid measure alright so I'm combining my salt sugar yeast mixture and another amount of warm water so the recipe says 125 okay I'm just using 250 remember to check that it's not too hot that you're not gonna kill your East so nice and warm that water goes in there the extra 125 milliliters or 250 if you're doubling the recipe okay and now I'm going to add the flour gradually stirring well after each addition and just give that a good mix and then I have my precip today our here beat out 440 milliliters of pre sifted flour I sifted it ahead of time and then measure it again so I am using double the amount which is 880 mils of flour and you want to put it in gradually so you can just take a scoop and just Boop that in about a cup at a time or so okay so gradually add this in until you have a ragged dough so it makes you a few times now so you should know what a ragged dough looks like it's still that kind of pulls away from the side of the edge and why they call it ragged dough is it supposed to look like cut-up rags okay so if you kind of look at it closely it'll look like cut-up cloth which is what rags are [Applause] you so at this point we can do our step three okay if your dough is too dry if you've added all that flour in and then you find it too dry you can add a little bit more water if you need to but you want to try and not add water then it gets too sticky then you add more flour then it gets too dry because you know we've all cut our bangs before where you cut a little on one side all uneven cut a little more on the other side and next thing you know you have no bangs this dough will become a monster if we keep adding water then flour then water then flour and it will not be a tasty ball of dough it'll just be flour and water so we want to avoid that so we want to try and just get the right consistency okay so I have a little bit of flour left here I can use that while I'm kneading so if I fly the dough too sticky I'll just add that in while I'm kneading okay so I'm gonna turn it on to a lightly floured surface now so either I can use some extra flour I'll just use the flour that was in my okay so we're ready to do our kneading push fold turn again you want to have flour on the heel of your hand if it's too sticky push full turn look at this mass it's just not holding its shape at all so that's why we need to develop this gluten to hold that carbon dioxide in so it's a dough but it's a very soft unstructured dough so by now you want to see that your dough is smooth and that it is elastic so right now if I pulled on this it's kind of glue like it's not holding anything together okay so let's knead for five to eight minutes okay and see how we do okay so remember push fold turn push full turn more flour if you need it push full turn you okay in about eight minutes now and look how nice and smooth that dough is now hey it's smooth as a baby's bottom they say okay opening up this surface just to see those tiny little blisters see those right there and then another test they use in test kitchens is take yes and it's called the windowpane test it's taking some of the dough and pulling it apart and it should be able to stretch to a very thin dough that you could see light through so I wanted to show you what I meant by that windowpane test so I've changed the angle up to the window here so when I pull on this dough I'm just letting the weight of the dough pull on it and you'll see that this stretches to a nice thin dough so if it can hold the stretched out dough in a sheet that can see the light through it that is good okay so again you see how smooth it is we've tried the windowpane test and now we've got me into a nice smooth ball okay so now's the time to let it rest for one hour or until it gets doubled in size okay so you can either put it into a greased ziplock bag which is what we would do in class and wait till the next morning if you were fridge and refrigerate it if you refrigerate your dough make sure you bring it back to room temperature before you start to try and shape it or roll it or at home we can just put a little oil into your bowl and then take your dough roll it around in that oil spread that oil all the way up the sides of the bowl and then flip that dough over so that it's greased on top then we're gonna cover this with plastic wrap and then let it sit for about an hour in a warm draft-free place okay here is the dough after one hour of proofing look how nice and high it's risen double the size and I have greased the top thankfully so that this plastic comes off nice and easily okay keep the plastic for the next proofing after we've shaped it so I'll just set that aside for a moment and remember we are going to punch down so we're on day 2 where we're shaping it into a cylinder don't forget to punch the big bubble you can see there's a huge bubble there and we don't want that in our bread so we're gonna punch that down see those big air pockets okay being released we'll gather that dough now remember I have doubled my dough see how it's sticking a little bit good thing I had grease on there even with the grease it was sticking a little bit so thankfully I greased it and those little bits are coming off okay so I doubled the dough so I'm gonna cut this in half and then we will shape it so we'll shape two loaves okay cuz the original recipe shaped one French baguette loaf okay now we're gonna do - okay lightly floured surface and you're gonna shape it into a long French loaf now you see this rough side we want to roll that under so that the top side is nice and smooth you see that so just any extra am taking my fingers and tucking in the bottom so that the top looks nice and smooth and then we can roll that out so I'm taking my hands in the middle going forward and back and just gently stretching to the right and left as I'm rolling you now we're just going to put the plastic wrap back over it because it is greased nice and greasy on that side just make sure that grease is all over and then we'll put a tea towel over top of that and let that rest while the oven is preheating about ten or fifteen minutes or so in a warm place hey well I have to admit something they Rose a little longer than I meant for them to rise they rose about this is probably after about 25 minutes to 30 minutes of proofing time after we shaved so the rising look how huge they've got they've definitely doubled in size pop it into the oven at 450 degrees for the first 10 minutes and then we're going to reduce the heat down to 400 and continue baking for another 15 minutes I have put a pan of water into the oven already as it was preheating so if that won't develop that nice chewy crust that French bread is famous for speech requests nice and hollow sounding you look a little bit more like a French loaf so if you want to forget you would make them a little skinnier and longer petite our French bread there's our beautiful French bread we're having for dinner awesome mmm mmm nothing like fresh bread", "PQ7C9UxRxaI": "hey good morning folks getting you up kinda early it's only seven o'clock but you know peg and i were lamenting this week not having baguettes they are such a handy bread to have for certain meals that we really miss not having them so i thought i'd whip up a batch today and i thought you know it doesn't take that much longer to to take you along on this so i thought i'd share this and maybe you folks would enjoy having a crispy baguette with certain meals as much as we do you know we last this week we made soup two nights i made a wild rice soup one one evening and we just thought ah crispy baguette would go so well with this and then peg made a butternut squash soup that was outstanding but a crispy baguette would have gone so well and the nice thing about baguettes versus full loaves of bread is that what i generally do is i cut them in half and then freeze them away and then when you take a half a baguette out which is great plenty for us for to have with a meal they thaw quickly and then we just crisp them up in the toaster oven just put it on bake at low temp and boy by the time your meal is done you have a crispy baguette to accompany it so for making it today i'm going to use kenforkish flour water salt yeast the wonderful book basically it's about making a dutch oven breads like the bowls but i'm going to use one of his recipes to shape baguettes and i'm just going to use the saturday white bread which is a done in one day type bread it's not the fully developed developed flavors that you get with his his white bread with the poolish which is an overnight ferment which would be the ideal bread to make into baguettes but i didn't have the foresight to do that so we're just going to do the the one day deal so what i did is i weighed out 950 grams of just the sunrise heritage all-purpose flour again i don't have their bread flour i wish i did and then i used i added 50 grams which is roughly half a cup or so of the natural way golden white flour which is a whole wheat flour with the bran removed but the germ is still in it and that just gives it gives your baguettes a little bit more of an earthy nutty flavor so to that i'm going to add 3 and 1 8 cups of 90 to 95 degree water so what we're going to do is make a an auto lace which would be a not not a pre-ferment because there isn't any yeast in here but what we're going to do is just hydrate the starches in that wheat we're going to hydrate that flour and what we're going to do is get those enzymes kicking in and what the enzymes will do is start to convert some of those starches to the sugars that will help develop the flavor so this is a step before adding the yeast and the salt that gives us a little more flavor but not nearly as much as a pre-ferment like a foolish would so i just use a rubber spatula and i'm just going to mix it together it's kind of a rough dough just enough to get the water incorporated into the flower and we're just going to then let this sit and do its thing for 30 minutes it's been 30 minutes so for this next stage i like to do this over at the sink so after i add the yeast and the salt i'm going to move us over next to the kitchen sink but first we're going to add one teaspoon of instant yeast just sprinkle it right on top and get it all there and then one tablespoon he says 21 grams and i don't trust my scale to measure that small amount of grams but i use the measurement which is one tablespoon plus he says a scant teaspoon so i basically just always do a tablespoon and a teaspoon of he says fine sea salt this is just non-iodized nothing added canning salt probably not ideal but that's what i have so now we're going to move over to the sink this step involves incorporating the yeast and the salt into the dough so we're going to what he says basically duplicate a a dough cutting machine and use the pincer method we're going to use our hands to do this and the reason i like to do it over the sink is i just have the warm hot water just trickling here so i just keep wetting my hands and i'm just gonna go in and just start squeezing that dough and then folding and squeezing and folding and squeezing and you know do this for a few minutes and you can feel this when the salt granules start to get incorporated you don't feel them anymore so just kind of just giving it a good squeeze and giving it a fold wet your hands a little bit if you need to do it this is going to be the by far the stickiest messiest stage actually it's kind of fun i think so i think it's pretty well incorporated i don't feel any lumps or anything else so just that amount of time is really all it takes so i see some yeast over here yet that's laying there on the bottom yeah in both corners so in this tub that i use is one of these large rubbermaid tubs and i think it makes the ideal bread tub so i got her pretty well mixed together i'll just throw the cover back on this we're just going to let this rest for 20 minutes and we'll take her to the next step it's been 20 minutes so i'm going to get my little stream of warm water going here and you'll notice after 20 minutes how the dough is relaxed and spread out and how it's really changed in texture and we're going to take each corner you know it has kind of roughly has corners and pull it towards the center and we're going to stretch it but not stretch it so much that it it tears so we tear apart the gluten strands and then what i like to do is take it and fold it in half and then i like to jelly roll it this is kind of my deal i don't know i haven't heard ken forkish say anything about doing that i jelly roll and then fold it in half we're basically just kneading in slow motion and maybe give her just give her another jelly roll and end up with a a nice loaf like that and we're just gonna let this rest again for another 20 minutes and repeat that one more time he says this needs two folds so that's fold number one it's been another 20 minutes so this will be our final fold so i'm going to moisten my hands one more time and at this point you're going to really see a transformation in this dough it is just velvety smooth and elastic and really doesn't stick to my fingers anymore we're just going to fold those four corners to the center again and then i'm going to lift it and fold it in half and maybe fold it in half again and just give it a gelly roll kind of stretch that skin and that's it so now we're just going to cover it and let it ferment for five hours that seems like a lot of time but remember there's not a lot of yeast in that only a teaspoon so this is where thyme is our friend to help develop those flavors within the confines of doing this all in one day so again this isn't the best choice for baguettes as far as flavor development that white bread with the poolish is my my first choice for that but this is what we have and it's going to be certainly better than better than you can imagine so we're we're just going to check back after five hours you know so this is that baking bread is just being around at the right times you don't have to be around all the time i can go to town i can go fishing for five hours and come back and check on my dough i'd spend five hours so the next step is to get the dough out of the bin here and we're i think i'm going to divide it into three it's probably going to be a little big for a traditional baguette i'd probably be best dividing it into four but three for us is good i kind of like it a little bigger i like we like it toasted in the morning too so it makes a nicer slice of toast and the koosh that i'm going to use and i'll talk about that in a minute is a little smaller than the one we normally use so four of them might not quite fit but what i'm going to do is just sprinkle a little flour around the edges here of our dough and get a little flour on my fingers and then put some flour on the work surface here and then get in and start to kind of pull that dough away from the sides a bit and the idea at this point is not to degas this thing entirely we want some of those big gas bubbles to remain in there so another nice thing about using a rectangular tub versus a round one is that when you get this out onto the surface it's it's already in kind of a rectangular shape roughly and we're going to divide it into thirds so it makes it a little easier and get us our roughly rectangular shape here now if you're particular you can weigh these and i weigh our container so i know this is 406.5 grams or 14.36 ounces i'm not going to mess with that for this i think they all taste the same eyeballing it is is good enough so i'm going to just sprinkle a little flour roughly where i intend to cut this in the third so i'll i'll move the camera so we can see what i'm doing here a little better before we form our three baguettes we need a place to put them after we form them and what you do at one of the steps of making baguettes at home is is confining them so that they rise to form a nice cylinder shape rather than spread out like an armenian flatbread so what bakers do is they put them in a couch which is french for go to bed put to bed so this is our big commercial quality 100 linen couch that we used when we had the store when i used to bake larger batches of baguettes but most of you aren't going to have something like this so really no sense in showing you how to do it so what we're doing instead is using a we have a really nice heavy dish towel that we got from wildflower farm here in local farm bakery in paposky minnesota really nice quality but they're roughly i suppose 18 17 by 24 or something so we're just going to use that as our koosh now the key to using something like this is be pretty liberal with the flower because not only does the koosh confine your dough and help it hold its shape as it's rising but that fabric also wicks out some of the moisture on the on the surface which kind of helps with that crust formation so now that we have our koosh set up i'll zoom in and we'll form our our baguettes i'm just going to use a dough scraper and cut our dough that way i'm gonna try to eyeball this the best i can keep that flower handy okay let's start out with this one here and i'm just going to like folding a letter fold it into thirds now at that point you'd have a batard but we're going to roll this out now and you want enough flour on your surface that it doesn't stick too much but you want it to stick a little bit so i'm just going to fold it again and i'm just going to roll it and these are you know rustic loaves we're not terribly fussy with how they're gonna look but the idea is to roll out a a baguette that'll rough that'll roughly fit the the width of the koosh that one looks pretty good i'm going to set that one probably about three inches from the end can't see that can you that's better okay i'm just going to go ahead and do my my tri-fold letter there then just start rolling it out shaping it as you go and then this one i'm going to set on the koosh a few inches probably three inches away from the first one we'll get our third one formed here fold it into thirds and just roll it out there are a lot of different ways to form baguettes and i'm certainly not an expert but this is one way to do it and then we'll go ahead and put that one there now slide this over so you can see a little better how we're going to do this so you can see i have the space between them so now we're just going to pull pull the towel up so that they're nestled next to each other we'll we'll put this back over the top here and then with this part we will fold that over the top how are you guys getting ready to go to bed and then we'll just let that rest and rise for about an hour in the meantime i'm going to preheat the oven to 450 degrees i set the timer on the oven for 45 minutes so what i have is i have the tap running here i got steamy hot water coming out of the tap here so i'm just filling a a cake pan we're not filling and i'm going to put you know just half an inch of water or so three quarters of an inch of water in this probably like a 9 by 14 or so cake pan and then carefully i don't want to spill that on the glass door i just carefully put that into the oven on the rack below the tiles remember those tiles they're pretty crucial for making baguettes and we'll talk about those here in a little bit i'd like to put that water in into the oven good 10-15 minutes before we transfer our baguettes into it to let that steam really get up a head of steam so we're going to transfer our our dough onto our transfer board which is eighth inch cardboard 16 by 18 inch piece of it and then a piece of parchment paper i wish parchment came in 16 inch widths but it comes in 15 so i know you can order it but i don't want to pay that much so i cut a piece 18 inches long roughly and it basically covers that transfer board so now we're going to transfer our baguettes onto that transfer board so i'm just going to pull to separate these now we want to just kind of carefully get underneath and without disturbing them too much transfer them to the parchment it really didn't stick at all which is nice look that one a little tight bit there now i kind of want to arrange them so they're not touching each other as they bake okay now the old scoring the baguettes you know that i bought that lamy thing that razor jobber thing and i never got that thing to work very well it just always stick and pull and everything else and i tried i think the best i ever did was using a serrated a really sharp serrated knife to cut my my slits but i've gone to a scissors and i probably get booted out of baguette making school if i did this but it works for me and it i just take a pretty sharp scissors and just snip snip make my diagonal snips about every couple inches and it kind of leaves little peaks but for the most part they'll go away just a quick snip and they're ready for the oven now the beauty of this transfer board being a thin board like this is that it you just kind of give it a shake and just like that your loaves on the parchment are on those hot tiles and we're going to set the timer for 25 minutes we'll check them after 25 and we don't want blonde baguettes we want them deep amber colored develop those flavors so we'll check back on them in 25 minutes you probably can't see this but their steam is just billowing out of the vent out in the oven here so what i like to do is about 10 minutes before the bread comes out i like to take that water pan out i'll try to quickly do this here oh it's steamy can you catch a glimpse of them take a look at them later the reason i like to take that water pan out before the bread is done is because the the steam has done its job and i kind of think it's probably a little bit more of a hindrance than a help towards the end is initially what that steam does is it keeps the outer skin of that bread soft and moist and what that does is help the moisture that's trapped in the center of that dough it lets it it helps it to escape through the skin of that bread so it doesn't crust over right away and then trap that moisture and so you get a crispier crust at least that's what i've read kind of sound like i know everything but i i don't know everything anyways i think at the end the last 10 minutes i want that crust to crisp up in a dry oven so that's the theory behind it so i think we probably have eight minutes or so before we take another look at these loaves and see if they're they're browned enough to come out after 25 minutes i let these things go another 10. so i did a total of 35 minutes because they're kind of big for baguettes i probably get written up by the baguette police actually for making them this big but what i'm going to use is just a cooling rack i'm not using that transfer board to take them out that never gets used in the hot oven other than the initial putting things in quickly but i'm just going to pull them out onto this wire rack and then they will come off the parchment onto the rack oh oh does that smell good now these are certainly too hot to cut into to uh to sample but let me see if i can at least still too hot that they are a nice crispy crust they're they're nice and light i'm sure they're very airy a very good crumb on the inside i think paul hollywood would approve all around i think they're they're perfectly done now what i'll do once they cool is i'm going to cut these in half and bag them in a bread bag plastic bread bag and then freeze them away so like i said earlier when we have meals that just cry out for a crispy hot baguette or not hot but warm crispy crusted baguette we'll just take one of these halves out of the freezer and put it in the toaster oven and just thaw it and warm it or we can let it thaw first and put it in there but that with a little kerrygold butter on there oh my goodness it's so good okay so the tiles are the half inch thick quarry tiles uh let me go get one okay i may have i may have lied let's see there yeah they're like 7 16 of an inch thick but these are the unglazed six inch by six inch quarry tiles that are for indoor outdoor use made in america i think that's important who knows what those chinese put in that stuff i i wouldn't trust it but i put six of the whole ones in and then i cut three pieces that are half a tile so these are three inches cut in half so it takes seven and a half tiles to line up a standard oven and the hat the half pieces go in the back of the oven and then you put the whole ones in first now that's important because if you're pulling things in and out and the half pieces are towards the door you run the risk of these things coming out with whatever you're pulling out and then having one of these go through the oven door which if you're doing this on my recommendation that probably wouldn't make me too popular with you but they're wonderful i you know like i say they never come out of our oven they've been in there for three three years four years never come out and they make it so the oven does not cycle on and off very frequently because they're they're a good heat sink so i'll take you over and show you if i can get close enough to the hot oven without wrecking this camera but it's really a slick way to go for pizzas and for breads and for just general cooking we i think they they help everything that we bake in there whether they're hot dishes or everything so i'll just show you here okay the oven's still hot so i don't want to get too close here if but you can see that there are six whole tiles and then the three half tiles in the back and the discoloration is all from when i was baking quiches and it was a really buttery quiche crust my quiche crust recipe which i did a video on last year before i learned that the butter just drips down on onto the tiles sometimes when you bake them and so i've learned that i bake my quiches now on a baking sheet so no more of that but that's really not that bad for three or three some years old and again we have never cleaned our oven or had to clean it and uh yeah that's just kind of bragging but anyways i am sold on them and it turns our our old electric oven into a kind of a deck oven okay they're not quite cool yet but i'll just saw one end off here just take a look see how we did now you know when there's steam escaping that it's not it's not ready to slice into yet very open crumb crispy some good irish butter on there now this straight dough that's all start to finish in the same day is not supposedly as good as the the breads that have the pre-ferments or the overnight rising but holy smoke is that good it well it doesn't get any better than that and it's easy to do if you have the right equipment and you just can't buy bread like this for one thing it doesn't keep fresh these breads half a day and they start to be not not quite so good so that's why i freeze them and then we just take them out and reheat them right before and they taste like they just came out of the oven but to make good baguettes at home there are two things that are different one is that you have to you have to put them to bed you have to enclose them in a koosh and this this heavy dish towel from wildflower farm i was very impressed for three loaves like that it makes a perfect cush so you have to do that so they they rise and form the nice shape and then you need a steam oven you need steam in your oven and a nice hot deck nice hot half inch thick ceramic tile deck that as soon as they go in they get that oven spring because they're right on that hot surface and taking that water out that steam out 10 minutes before 10 in this case it was 20 minutes before they came out so just remembering those few steps and then i think it helps to start with good flour this is sunrise heritage organic in this case the all-purpose flour so we just feel a lot better about eating it knowing that there's no glyphosate in it and it's a heritage variety that a lot of folks are claiming they can eat gluten again that had gluten intolerance not celiac disease necessarily but they they reacted to gluten and they're finding they can eat this flour so we just feel a whole lot better eating breads made with it so till next time is mark again with backwood basics let's bake together [Music]", "kfSeJSaEOxA": "[Music] so today I've got a much requested and frankly much needed modification for the car I'm gonna be vinyl wrapping the chrome trim it's gonna be gloss black so if you've been following for a long time you might remember I had originally plastidip it on my head that on for about a year but um I think that the vinyls gonna be just a better long-term solution and it's gonna be glossy so it's gonna match the car a little better so yeah let's do it during the garage with my dad today so if you see him working in the back it's one of the reasons I'm kind of excited to get my own house eventually I'm just renting right now so I come over my parents to do these DIYs but he builds these sets for our church I'll show you what the end product looks like so this goes on the stage and it's like a dark auditorium and then they're lit from the bottom with LEDs so I think these are pretty cool but anyway that's what my dad's doing today and we're just kind of working together here all right so first let's go over the supplies I've got this roll of two inch gloss black 3m vinyl an exacto knife with a brand new blade you want the blade to be very sharp for this this regular sort of painters tape I'm going to show you what this is for in a second some alcohol so that you can clean the surface to prep it this handy vinyl applicator squeegee and then just kind of optionally I got these vinyl application gloves it's supposed to be a little bit less friction and it kind of reduces the scratches and stuff in the vinyl um as you're applying it and then every part going to be a little bit different but on the e90 and a 92 this back corner right here is a little bit too wide for that 2-inch roll so I went ahead and got this big roll that I can just kind of lay flat on there and I don't have to worry about it being too thin in some spots so I'm you're just gonna have to look at your car and determine whether or not you're gonna need to do this but anyway all of the links for all these products are gonna be down below if you want to buy them on Amazon that definitely helps me out a little bit or if you just want to you know buy them at the store that's up to you just do whatever is easiest the first step is just going to be prepping the surface by just rubbing it off with some rubbing alcohol that'll clean any oils or wax or anything that might be on there and just a little tip I actually wash the car last night that way it would have overnight to fully evaporate all the water that might be trapped in the seams there that way when we go to actually tuck in the vinyl there's no like water or anything that would have it not adhere the way that I wanted to you so once the surfaces are nice and clean and ready for the vinyl the next step this is a tip that I've seen in a couple different vinyl application videos is you put this on the paint and it makes the paint on the car less tacky that way when you're trying to apply the vinyl and you're trying to kind of maneuver to maneuver it or on these areas it's not going to be just sticking to the car the whole time so let's go ahead and tape up this question all right so let's just hope that the vinyl actually comes out better than this tape job but anyway I'm going to start with this top section here [Music] all right so I've got this top section here pretty much done I just have to trim off the excess and so far what I've learned um this job is definitely going to test your patience it's not as easy as it some people make it out to be but I definitely have a new earn respect for anybody who does vinyl wrapping for a living but anyway the thing that's tricky about it when you're going over these curbs is that the vinyl is naturally going to want to start folding like you can see with this tape how the team starts to fold a little bit like that that's because the tape doesn't have any kind of elastic properties to it but with the vinyl the trick is as you're laying it to kind of massage it in the way that you want it to lay down so that's what's hard about it just give yourself plenty of time to work on it [Music] alright guys so I've got all of these front pieces done the only thing that's left just that bad corner that I talked about a little bit earlier in the video and so as I'm kind of going along you this is my first time really doing a vinyl project like this before and as I'm working I'm kind of picking up on some little tips and tricks so the first thing I would say before you even get started if you've never used vinyl before just peel yourself off a little piece like this and just play with it just like kind of stretch it kind of figure out how pliable it is the weather outside the temperatures gonna affect that a little bit it's about 85 degrees Fahrenheit right now so it's actually fairly flexible you can see I can kind of stretch it but that's the first thing it's just play with the vinyl and just see what the limitations are the next thing um these gloves really came in handy in fact I don't know that you could do this without the gloves your fingers are just too sticky on the vinyl to really smooth it out the way that you need to so definitely pick up the gloves if you're gonna do this project and then the last thing is as you're kind of unrolling the vinyl be very careful not to stretch it you just want to kind of lay it out as it's going along don't try to peel it or pull on it or anything because as soon as you pull on it it's gonna get wrinkles in it and it's going to be a huge pain in the butt so just be very careful as you're laying it down make sure it's nice and flat and yeah those are my three tips so far [Music] [Music] all right so I've got this whole side of the car completely wrapped everything is looking good the last step is just going to be to hit the whole thing with the heat gun and just make sure that we get that really good adhesion with the wrap sticking to the trim and so you just want to be extremely careful using this this does get hot enough to not only damage the vinyl but it could also potentially hurt the paint on the car so just be extremely careful or if you don't feel comfortable with this you can always use a hairdryer but I've got the heat gun so let's do it [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right well that's gonna wrap up this project and once again the links for the tools and the supplies for this are gonna be down in the description if you want to check them out on Amazon that really helps me out and I appreciate that or if you just want to buy the stuff from the store you know just do whatever is easiest for you but if you enjoyed this video you found it helpful maybe this inspired you to wrap your own window shame just give me a thumbs up and I will see you guys in the next video [Music]", "P5SLfdjbPyI": "[Music] so i'm going to talk to you about the history of the croissant and the baguette that is the two most iconic french breads and these are so well known that you might even think that's all there is to french bread history that forever the two french breads have been the croissant in the baguette but in fact even though each goes back over a hundred years they are relatively recent arrivals in french bread history which does go back two thousand years after all so let's start with the quasar and i'm going to start with two things which are not true i'm going to start with them because if you haven't heard them already you probably will one is a claim that the kipfel which is the austrian model for the croissant was invented at a siege of vienna in 1683 and the gist of this tale goes that the viennese bakers were working late as bakers will and they heard turks tunneling under the walls they gave the alarm and they were granted the right to make a pastry in the shape of the turkish crescent we know this isn't true we know isn't true first of all because the kit full had been around for centuries before that and is specifically documented just before that as existing in a number of shapes one of which was a crescent and then perhaps uh more particularly we know isn't true because if you look at any normal history of vienna or the siege of vienna you won't find this story it's only in cooking and baking texts now i actually have a kind of affection for the next myth because it made me a brat historian years ago i was writing a paper on breakfast in 18th century france and i just naturally assumed i would include the fact that marie antoinette had brought the croissant to paris only i looked through all kinds of 18th century documents couldn't find any reference to the quasar or anything like it moved to the start of the 19th century still nothing and finally it was 1850 before i found any reference to the croissant in france and at the time a friend said well you know if it's in print starting in 1850 it probably came along around 10 years before that and he wasn't far off in fact so who did bring the croissant to paris as it turns out a former artillery officer an austrian gentleman named august zhang august zhang was the son of a very famous surgeon and apparently was something of a disappointment to his father and seems to have tried to prove himself to his father even as will happen after his father died he speculated in real estate that didn't go very far he invented a gun actually invented a gun but it didn't have that much success by one account we really don't know if this is true but supposedly he came to paris didn't like the bread and french bread had gone down somewhat since revolution and he thought well what the french need is good viennese bread and viennese bread was very good at this point for a number of reasons not least because it was the austro-hungarian empire and austrian that is hungarian flower was the best in europe but there are other reasons as we'll see so around 1837 or 1838 he and a partner bought a bakery on the rudiri and founded the first bulangeri viennas in paris the first viennese bakery now if you go to the rue de la shirley today it's not that impressive street you'd probably go there because you're on their way to or back from the palais real it runs right along the paleolia but there's very little there besides some corn dealers some wine bars at the start of the 19th century it was probably the most elegant street in paris bolzack had a pieta terre there there was another famous bakery on the street there were music publishers which is how wagner met berlioz on the rue de la silla and it really seemed like a very good place to open an upscale bakery but the french didn't care they showed no interest in such appetizing austrian specialties as the kipful the kaiser sammel which was in fact the kaiser role but back then was a much finer kind of role these were the two main roles in austrian baking not the linzer tort which was already being made and so things looked bad but the bakery was in the same building as la presse which was the first french penny press today we take it for granted that when you buy a newspaper it will be cheap because it's financed mainly by advertising but this was a new idea in 19th century france and emil du jarrada became very rich implementing it zhang took the hint and in uh november of 1839 a very flattering item appeared in la presse regarding the boulangerie viennas it was almost certainly paid although it's not presented as an ad and the next thing you know the bakery was a huge success later the bakery would say that it was founded in 1840 but in fact we know there was a big opening or reopening in november 1839 now the bakery had a number of things going for it one is if you look at old french bakeries here's one from the 18th century you see they had bars in the windows wooden shelves uh they just were very functional looking places and apparently we're still that way at the start of the 19th century but zhang opened an austrian-style bakery with austro-hungarian elegance with marble countertops and brass fittings mirrors mosaics by all accounts was a very elegant place and as french bakers began to imitate his bakery and they actually opened viennese bakery so-called they also imitated the decor and soon other bakeries too had very elegant decor so here we have a 19th century french bakery from afterzhang and you see there's a big marble counter there are very tall windows no reflections of bars here a beautiful decoration of some sort on the ceiling and you can still see some of these beautiful 19th century french bakeries in paris today often they've become clothing stores because the decor is so pretty you won't find many there's still bakeries but there's a few scattered around and this goes back to augusting zhang's bread became so popular that he decided to mark it and so he actually embossed his name in the bread got mocked for this little bit but in fact for centuries french bakers have been obliged to put at least their mark on their bread still people didn't generally put their whole names on it so that was an innovation and uh the bread of the bakery became so popular that soon french bakeries divided their bread into paffrance which was made with sourdough and some water uh whereas the pound of viennois was made with little milk and yeast and these became two standard sorts of bread in paris the big technical innovation of the bakery introduced came from the viennese habit of leaving a little water in the oven after you cleaned it so that steam formed in the oven the steam would fall on the baking bread and melt a kind of powder that formed on the top of the baking bread the dextrine and that created a glaze you probably have seen that glaze you may not have noticed it but if you look at the baguette it's got a kind of shiny surface which is a result of a steam oven and if you look at julia child's instructions for making a baguette she actually tells you how to create steam in the oven which goes directly back to august sang and in fact soon french inventors were creating what they called viennese ovens the viennese didn't and they put steam in the oven he also advertised that his bread was untouched by human hands and one result of that was that he made a bread using the dough from the kaiser symbol and in fact it was the same dough at this point for the kipval but uh in a mechanical kind of rectangular shape now when french bakers began to imitate this they just made it by hand and they made it in all kinds of shapes and they called it a viennese loaf and it became very popular in paris if you were living well you ate pin one but the kipful also became popular and when french bakers made it since it was shaped like a crescent they called it a crescent which in french is quasi it became so popular that when a man wrote a whole survey of local roles from different regions he complained these are all disappearing because today everybody just makes quasa now 1848 came along and uh there were revolutions all over europe including in vienna so freedom of the press came to austria and zhang sold his bakery whipped back to vienna and ended up founding a newspaper with the same name as his neighbor but in german di presa and you can still buy the placa today because zhang transformed the austrian press and in fact one american newspaper called him the father of the viennese press and so the same man transformed french baking in the viennese press which is very impressive don't you think meanwhile the croissant had been made in two different shapes or sizes but it was basically made in the same way as a nice piece of bread with some milk in it and glazed of course because of the austrian steam for reasons we don't know about 20 years before the end of the century you begin to see recipes where you roll the dough out flat and then you roll butter across it and then you roll it up and when you do that you get something called puff pastry or in french leafed dough patriot more technically this is known as laminated dough which basically means exactly the same thing dough in leaves and as they continued to do this they put yeast in this puff pastry and then later added milk and other ingredients so today we call this quasando and it's not quite the same as puff pastry but it's based on puff pastry which for centuries had been a french method it was probably an arab method originally and by the start of the 20th century the croissant was most often made with this laminated dough and there were more and more layers to it which is why we have this nice flaky croissant you know today there were all kinds of ways of making croissant include the old one in fact in the 30s one manual included 30 different ways of making croissants so if you really want to make croissant you can go to town if you read french meanwhile a word appeared which meant light graceful things from vienna like a strauss waltz for instance and this word was we don't know why this word was finally applied to the quasar or exactly one but it was and then other pastries like the palm chocolat which is basically some chocolate wrapped in cuasondo began to be included under this heading and today there's a whole range of vienwazuli you'll actually see definitions of vienwazili which say that it's vienna-style baked goods but in fact it's not viennese style at all the only thing viennese about it is a quasar but the method used for mostly in waziri is french it's the cuasondo which again is based on puff pastry and it's also true that today you can go to vienna and you can buy a quasa and you can still buy a kit full and so you see the french pastry roll whatever next to its ancestor and the croissant originally austrian has become completely french now let's look at the baguette and of course the baguette 2 has its myths most baked goods do one is that napoleon soldiers needed a long bread they could put down their pants legs while they were marching now if you trust this myth at all i advise you to buy a cheap baguette and try putting it down your pants leg you won't get very far uh if you don't want to go to that extent here's an image of some napoleonic soldiers you can see they had rather tight pants not really great for putting baguettes down and when they wanted to carry something long like a sword they used a scabbard not to mention the baguette didn't come along till much later there's another myth which is actually pretty popular among some bread historians and bakers and that's a claim that the baguette is not uh french at all but a foreign innovation and as it happens who do they credit with introduce here why once again august saying this appears to be due to a misunderstanding today's panzenois looks very much like a baguette it's a long narrow bread and of course we know zhang did introduce japan venue but the pan benoit in the 19th century didn't look anything like a baguette there's no evidence that the austrians had anything like a baguette at the time nor that zhang introduced any long narrow breads not to mention that the french had had long narrow breads for a long time before zhang came to paris so let's go back in french bread history and i'm sure you've seen images like this of little spherical breads what the french called the bull for over a millennium french bread was most typically made in this form or when it got bigger it collapsed into a kind of hemisphere but generally sort of spherical hemispherical breads were the norm in france for a very long time there were other shapes but these were the main ones you get to the 17th century and parisian bread at least changed quite a bit for one thing for some reason parisian bakers began to make small luxurious breads using milk and yeast in fact very much like the later viennese breads and these were not regulated in the same way that the standard sourdough loads were so they became known as bendifentazy that is they were made according to the fantasy of the baker and since they weren't regulated the baker could charge what he or she wanted and of course baker's like that and the concept of panda fantasy would last for quite a while in france although i had different specific meanings at different moments now it appears that the fact that more and more soft breads are made because the yeast leavened bread tended to be softer uh the old french bread had been made with hard dough pat ferme and had a very hard inside crumb but now french bakers began to make even the ordinary bread with a bread with a dough that was neither soft nor hard it was a bastard dough midway between the two and when you did that you got an inside that didn't have anything like the same purchase you know something to bite down on that you did with the old hard dough so bakers began to bring the sides of the bread together now another thing that was true is that crust had never been important in french bread when you see earlier descriptions of good bread it never mentions a crust but now the crust became more and more important as the two sides came together and this made the bread hard on the outside where it had been more hard on the inside before by the middle of the 18th century this had become the standard shape for a bread and red writers would talk about the old bull and say was how we used to make bread but today it's a long narrow shape that dominates one of these writers complained that it had become so long and narrow it was like a flute and that some breads were nothing but crust this particular writer was august palma chie whose name you may know because he did of course promote the potato but he promoted the potato largely because he was studying bread and he wanted to try and make bread from the potato failed at that completely but made the potato very popular you get to the start of the 19th century and a food critic praised the flute from a famous bakery and at this point he's using flute as a noun the term would be used all through the 19th century to refer to long narrow breads not necessarily a specific one because a lot of them a lot of them had their own specific names there was a flute a soup which was a small narrow roll all crust which you could put into soup but in general the long narrow shape had become pretty standard now about the time zhang opened his bakery uh a new development occurred and we don't know exactly when or why but parisian bakers began to make very long breads breads and american tourists described as being like crowbars and they were two meters long they were really really long some were wider than others they came in different shapes but one in particular was almost like a giant baguette it was a very long bread with slashes on the front and that is something that only came along at the start of the 19th century didn't used to have slashes on bread in france and uh it could also be made three feet long in which cases look almost exactly like a baguette here we have a young american tourist discovering french bread for the first time what he's holding is probably a jacka now if you're thinking it would have been hard to go do your evening shopping and have to carry this kind of bread home well usually you didn't because since the 18th century there had been these women called portus female bread porters and there were male bread porters but far fewer of them the female bread porters that belted very hard lives and uh they would carry their breads and their aprons and little cards or as you can see here they would carry the really long ones sometimes on a rack and if you're thinking well that looks really heavy yeah it's probably very heavy but nobody cared because these women were treated virtually as beasts of burden never mind what a woman had to deal with trying to deliver bread to single men at the time so meanwhile you did have the three fit three foot long jocko and here you have a woman carrying what was probably a jocko as you can see it looks a lot like a baguette then we have this image of various breads from the 19th century and all the way to the left you have what looks very much like a baguette but in fact is labeled a white bender fantasy a fantasy bread and you're probably wondering well you said that the panda fantasy was a category of breads yep it was but it was also used for a while to refer to a specific loaf it's important to bear in mind that terms for bread in france were not officially set for a long time they just kind of grew up and this is what happens when you let germans just grow up now was the panda fantasy in fact a three foot long jocko maybe i mean that's my belief but i've never seen any specific evidence to that effect so we get to the start of the 20th century and in 1902 an austrian baker named emil bong put out a book on european bread with all kinds of really nice images of breads from all over europe and it includes this image of two very narrow brands and he calls these french sticks regrettably he doesn't give the french name for these but one word for stick in french is baguette which can also mean a baton or a wand and it is very likely that these were baguettes and as you can see they're very very skinny they really are like sticks so one question that comes up is why did french bakers after all this time of making long narrow bread suddenly make a bread that almost literally was a stick we don't know not a clue it's so rarely discussed even as we see the baguette becoming a standard bread it's so rare to see any reference to it at all about a year later a parisian baker also put out a manual on baking and he gives instructions for two different kinds of baguettes one is about 100 grams now that was probably a breadstick because the term baguette was sometimes used for a glissini we call it a stick too breadstick but then there's another that was 200 and some grams and that was probably more like the baguette we just saw a much bigger bread may even been somewhat like the modern baguette for all we know we get to 1913 and here is this image of breads that were popular in paris and you may be thinking that first bread in looks a lot like a baguette because it does but it's not it's a jocko it's the bread all the way to the left the really narrow skinny one which is the baguette and uh again this shows that the baguette was solidly established by 1913 that it was a very skinny bread it really did look like a stick a baguette but it's very rare to see any reference to it you'll see all kinds of references to a lot of these other brands you'll see images of them it's very rare see a mention of the baguette we get to world war one there's all kinds of limits on breads and the poor parisians had to eat dark bread which they hated they didn't care there was a war on they wanted to eat white bread tough luck uh so we get to 1917 and the french not only are eating dark bread they're probably not eating baguettes because most of the long narrow breads were banned at this point and yet somehow a journalist from the new york times got a recipe for the baguette or what he calls the french stick this is certainly the first recipe we have in english it may be the first recipe full stop certainly it's a very rare recipe of any sort for the baguette and it shows that new yorkers cared about the baguette enough that it was worth introducing them to this [Music] recipe it also shows of course that the french were very familiar with it since he was able to get their recipe but again it's a very rare mention in the first two decades of the 20th century of the baguette the war ends it's 1920 but the french still have to eat dark bread until july 1920 when a writer in the figaro exuberantly announced we shall once again be allowed to eat the good white bread and the joy is almost palpable then a month later there's a list of prices of four different breads why these particular breads were chosen isn't really clear because they're not necessarily the most common breads but the fourth is the baguette having a minimum weight of 80 grams and a maximum length of 40 centimeter so this was still a skinny bag yeah it's a very skinny baguette a year later there was another law which defined a baguette of 100 grams still pretty skinny and another of 300 grams which was the standard weight of a baguette for a long time today it tends to be 250. so the baguette was established uh it seems to have shifted in size for a while now we know that after a time it took on what we think of as a baguette shape today and what again looks very much like the jocko of the 19th century in its shorter form why did it go from really looking like a stick to looking more like an old jocko dunno there is no hint of the process and in fact again the baguette is barely mentioned it would be past 1930 before a dictionary defined baguette as a bread already defined as a baton or even as a type of diamond but not as a bread meanwhile in 1922 an american magazine compared a rolled up newspaper to a french baguette so clearly it was pretty well known to americans at this point now we have this image from 1922. that is well after the baguette has been officially mentioned it shows common parisian breads and once again no baguette there is one bread you could imagine might be a baguette but nothing labeled a baguette again why did it take so long to mention this bread that has proved so important in france we don't know but that is how the croissant came to paris another baguette came to paris and i hope you enjoyed the talk thank [Music] you [Music] you", "BsgUcpTLQww": "it's not know about you but things just feel a little bit crazy right now I wanted to show you a very very simple very versatile bread dough that you can turn into sandwich bread pizza crusts cinnamon rolls dinner rolls French bread pretty much you name it this dough can do it and yes in case you were wondering that is not leprosy on my neck I burn myself with a curling iron thankfully I'm much better at making bread that I am trying to do my own hair so here's the quick ingredient list okay so as written this recipe will make one loaf of bread or one 12-inch pizza or one pan of dinner rolls but you can easily double it first thing we're gonna do is add two teaspoons of dried yeast into our mixing bowl okay I'm gonna add two teaspoons of sugar I'm just using a brown sugar here you can also use two teaspoons of honey next step you're going to add one and 1/3 cup of warm water and when I say warm I'm talking like body temperature and yes I always stick my finger in the water warm water is gonna activate the yeast but if it's too hot it will kill the yeast so if you can put your finger in the water and you know it wouldn't burn your baby then you're good to go and go ahead and stir that until it's dissolved now there are recipes that want you to proof this and make sure it bubbles and stuff first as long as your yeast is pretty recent and you didn't buy it ten years ago I usually skip that step and just keep on trucking all right into this I'm gonna add one teaspoon of fine sea salt I keep mine in a bowl because that's what all the fancy chefs do and then crack your egg right into there and mix it in with your warm water once you have this kind of the slurry going on down here it's time to add the flour I'm gonna be using unbleached o unbleached all-purpose flour you could even use whole wheat flour here or a mixture of all-purpose and whole wheat this is pantry cooking so we're just gonna use what we have but I always start with a lesser amount I'm gonna grab a measuring cup I always start with a left turn out which would be three cups and then kind of go by feel after that I'm gonna explain to you in a minute what that looks like okay so I have my three cups of flour and I'm just gonna start mixing it together so this is where we gotta get our hands dirty I have stirred all the flour and I can with my fork but you can see this dough it's what we call shaggy dough it's very sticky it's rough looking it's making my fingers look like a mess so it needs more flour can I go ahead and put a little flour on my counter and dump it out and this is the beginning of the kneading process I'm just gonna start working out flour this might be a little too much flour so I'm going to set it aside I'm just gonna start working it on my counter and getting that super shaggy stickiness to go away and you're going to be surprised at how quickly it comes together it's gonna grab a little that loose flour that still continues to stick to my hands and here's the deal guys people get really nervous about meeting but it doesn't have to be complicated it's literally just working the dough and I kind of have a rhythm I just turn it a quarter turn press it with my palm turn it a quarter turn again flip it over press it with my palm but really it's kind of just as long as you're working it you're probably gonna be just fine I'm gonna do this for I don't know three or four minutes it's going to get smoother and you'll see the dough change from shaggy to smooth it's kind of halfway there at this point I'm gonna grab a little more my flour off the side if I need it I actually really enjoy meeting I have a mixer with a dough hook and I don't use it at all I like feeling the dough it grounds me here and what I'm doing it just feels really good bonus if you're mad at somebody you'll need even better and the more you do this you're gonna be able to start listening to the dough the dough will talk to you so what meeting does in addition to just bringing everything together is it develops the gluten in the bread and gluten is not a bad thing not unless you have celiac disease but gluten is what makes our breads have the bread texture and we have to kind of develop it so in order to get the loaf to rise and well behaved like bread I don't know if you can see this I'm gonna get as close the lenses I can it's smooth and has a satiny finish to it kind of has a spring and an elasticity heart what it's done I'm gonna shape my little doe baby into a ball I'm gonna take my mixing bowl which still has all the flour gunk in it totally fine stick that in there and then I'm just gonna cover it with a clean dish cloth okay now it needs to rise for 1 hour or until it's doubled this part used to really trip me up but it does not have to be difficult here's my best recommendation turn on your oven to 350 degrees let it sit for 2 or 3 minutes and now is the most important part turn the oven off completely off so now I'm just going to take this covered bowl and stick it in the turned off oven for about an hour or until the dough Rises about double well that's rising I'm gonna run outside the kids are working on cleaning out the bar and I'm gonna go help them for a little bit [Music] now here's an hour has passed let's see how it looks what do you think bridge rainy guy pretty good this is exactly what we want it's about doubled in size so we're ready for the next step your exact next step will depend on what type of bread products you want to make I'm just gonna make a simple loaf of sandwich bread so I'm going to punch down the dough stick it in a loaf pan and let it rise for another 20-30 minutes or so but like I said you can turn this into pizza crust cinnamon rolls dinner rolls I've included directions for each of those baked items down below there's all different kinds of ways people shape this for the second rise in the loaf pan I just kind of turn it into an oval lump and call it good all right and it's risen up just above the edge of the pan it's perfect let's bake it [Music] you [Music]", "PTmW6kol4mM": "hi guys welcome back to edges kitchen so in today's video we will be making a very famous French baguette now this is a very easy bread to me because the dough only required four simple ingredients and there's not a lot of need and that's required for this brother you will be needed by the OB in stages so to start off I will be showing you the four simple ingredients I know you see sugar which is a fifth ingredients but I only put that as an option because I needed the sugar to help balance out the flavor so to start out we're just going to mix all of our dry ingredients together using a wooden spoon I usually use my hands and I usually activate my use in liquid too far out into the flour but like I said very different blood and it is big enough friendly that's why I am out in the youth and the salt together and if you are Baker then you know you usually don't a distance altogether because the salt kills the yeast but you're safe to do it for discipline that won't happen let's hope no I'm joking but now after we mix all of my dry ingredients together we'll start and make sure you add your water in stages don't add all your water at the same time because the it will break up the dough and you don't wanna just make sure your I remember this dough is supposed to be sticky and wet looking so don't get alarmed when you see that the dough is all sticky because that's what you're looking for because you don't let this dough rise for 45 minutes and knead it again and we'll repeat that step two times before we actually start the process [Music] after mixing the dog just going to transfer the dough onto our surface and as you can see the dough is very sticky and what looking is not perfect but that's what you're looking for if it's making other breads like dinner rolls you will want the dough to be perfect but right now it's okay for the dough to be sticky looking and I just put some more water on my hands to help with the dome so now we're going to do is transfer this into a different clean Bowl and we will close it and let that rise for 45 minutes [Music] okay as you can see the service surface surface and I'm going to be needing this for about a minute as you can see the dog is still very sticky but that's not a problem because we won't let it rise again and as it keep rising and we keep nearing it the stickiness will go away and it won't come together more now the only reason we're doing this in stages is because I think that by doing it in stages you add more flavour into the back end because remember you use such simple ingredients but you still want your bread to taste good as you can see I finally got my bench scraper because believe me you don't want to make this bread without food so we're just gonna place it back into the bowl and let it rise for another 45 minutes [Music] okay so it's been another 45 minutes and now I am going to fly with the surface and as you can see the door have doubled in size again and at this point the door should come together more if you don't come together then you got a problem but it should just add a little bit of flour on top and you should see that the door should be looking more smooth less sticky once we start kneading it just like I was saying you can see the dough is looking perfect now this if yours making like dinner rolls or like butter rows or any other kind of practices like the texture you will want so just keep kneading and I always do the same needed technique I basically just put another one half of the dough over the other half and this is very simple to do once you get a hang of it you'll see that it's not hot at all and after this we're just going to place it back into the bowl cover it and let it rise for 45 more minutes in total we're doing this process three times since we started what I'm doing here is basically around in the dough and this is a very easy technique as well and then we place it back and that arise again here's the door after another 45 minutes and we will repeat this process again flour the surface take out the dough and play with it now remember this was a trade and last time we will be doing this process and when it comes out the next thing you will be doing is divide it and start shaping it now don't forget to round it again and place it back into the bowl and let it rise for the final 45 minutes [Music] okay so while the dough was rising yes behind me is a pillowcase you could use any power or blanket that's clean but I use a pillowcase because my Despero case is really clean and I use it for pastry so this is how the dough looks after the final 45 minutes it looks very beautiful and I just fly with the surface and I added more flour on top and now I'm just kneading it again to bring the dough together more you remember this is was bringing in those layers of flavor and texture and remember the baguette is supposed to have a very hard skin and this also helps with that so now all your going all I'm going to do is use my bench scraper this is plastic and I'm just going to score it so that I could divide divide the dough into four even pieces I need to sharpen this knife but this is my house knife and I can slice the dough and I eyed it I owe my accent is getting in the way but you go use the scale but I didn't really want to use a scale so now that I divided the pieces I'm just going to start shaping the baguettes and please remember in the pillowcase is very important because it helps to get right in the shape and now I'm basically doing is folding the dough over each like over itself and to give it a shape and then you close off the end and now you're just going to start rolling it to the size that you want [Music] now this is a time where you just promote your packets and if you also want to give it a different shape at this point you honestly can the only reason I'm rollin is because the baguette shape like the traditional French baguette it's supposed to be this long thin bread but if you want to make rolls or anything you can go ahead and do that part I would advise to try this first and now what I'm doing is rolling it and after I ball I'm just wanting to place it on top of the pillowcase and I'm going to repeat this process with the next three pieces [Music] [Applause] [Music] so I'm going to make the last two baguettes a little bit longer than the phrase - just because I wanted to have two different styles of baguettes so the first two I'm gonna make them short and last two I'll make it longer as you can see the Italian dagger is long and all you're doing oh I almost forgot please make sure you put flour on your pillowcase otherwise the baguettes will stick onto the pillowcase and then this whole thing will be for nothing so flour you're set on pillowcase and doing what I'm doing in this video after you place the dough onto the pillowcase fold it a little bit so that you can stay together [Music] so now once we place the last bag onto the pillowcase we will sprinkle a little bit of flour into the baguettes now this is optional I just like it because I want the baguettes to have some flour on it when it comes out the oven and now we will just let this rise for 15 minutes okay the most important thing when it comes to making the baguette is making sure your oven have steam now if you're making this at home you don't have a professional oven just get a pot of water please put a lot of water into it boil it and place it under your oven and make sure you pre-heat your oven so that when you put the baguettes into the oven they'll have that steam to help with the crust while the inside is still moist you can still have a hard crust don't skip the pot of water is very important next thing I did is I took two trays and I dusted it with flour because this is where we will be placing the baguettes and as I said the flour is optional after 15 minutes this is how our baguettes looked as you can see they rised a little bit more and now what we are going to do is we are going to score the baguettes once again done skip that stuff because this is very important if you don't score the baguettes you are like explode or something in the oven not really as pro but you are you are going to end up with that but because the steam you not allowing the steam to come out now I score the baguettes in two different ways the smaller ones I was straight down and the longer ones I slice them too now we're going to transfer this onto the sheet tray okay so moving the bread onto the trace is really hard next time I use a cardboard because I kind of messed up the shapes of the bread but that's fine because you'll still taste together mistakes happen and now what I'm doing is springing the bread with a lot of water once again this is to help with steam make sure you spread the bread on top and as you can see in the oven the pot of water is under and I was playing the entire other with more water don't skip this step because this is the help with the steam so after 40 minutes in the oven this is how your baguettes should look as you can see they opened up pretty good and the white parts on the baguette is actually fly without I dusted on top of them before going in the oven and I did forget to show you guys after 15 minutes in the oven I did open up the oven and spray more water to help with the steam and your baggage should be hard on the outside and the inside should be really soft and this is basically how you make a simple French baguette don't forget to Like subscribe and share with your friends until next time", "TtCu9hYGhOU": "from the book for how to shape a wet lean dough lean dough is kind of like French bread though only wetter and so the trick is forming it without squeezing out over the air what we're gonna do first is put a little olive oil down on the work surface just to keep it from sticking I'm just a rub it make a little oil slick right here and then a little oil on my scraper and get this dough onto the bench so it comes out pretty good because I've oiled the bowl as well and I only need half of this dough for what we're about to do so I'm gonna cut this in half and put that back in the bowl and use it for another level you can see as I work it it starts sort of de gases the gas falls out that it's been formed from the first rise and that's okay we're going to put this back in the refrigerator and use this later but this store I'm gonna make now into something that would be comparable to a large fat tart or not quite as long as a baguette but a wonderful French style bread typically the way this Brits formed is that it's sort of pressed out and formed and squeezed and a lot of air comes out but with this wet dough we want to preserve a lot of the gas that's in here so the trick is to just sort of lift it and I'm gonna flip it over because this is the smooth side and I'm going to kind of pull this dough around to the bottom and I'm gonna pull the dough that's underneath it to the top and squeeze it and you see it's kind of like pulling like if you were pulling your cheeks down to your chin we're doing that and in fact I'm gonna make this into a round loaf so I'm going to also pull it this way so I'm gonna just lift this and pull it we'll call it the cheeks to chin and squeeze it down to the bottom and the whole goal here is to make a nice tight surface surface tension we call it and that allows the dough to hold its shape when it rises you can see that it's a much wetter than regular French bread and it's going to want to spread out but by doing this surface tension we can trap the gas in there keep it from spreading and retain its shape and get a beautiful golden French boule or batard when it's finished all the techniques for this are in the book before for you to try it and happy baby [Music] you", "xYWyxkBWq7Q": "hello there's Jack here answering your bread-making questions at Baker with Jack today I'm going to show you how to shape a loaf of bread there are loads of different ways to do it but they always build tension across the top key point always build tension across the top of the dough if you build the tension that way it'll puff up nice and proud instead of going a little bit skew with all over the place always book tension across the top this is the way I'll do it at home and this is the way I teach in my course is have a look let me know how you get on okay so I made my dough oh yeah I popped into a bowl with a clock on the top and it's been sitting resting a room temperature somewhere between 60 and 90 minutes which is fine now when I take the top off I can see it's clearly risen a lot of recipes say leave it to it's doubled in size however I'm not too worried about that just so we can it's noticeably bigger than what it was it's absolutely fine we're ready to go for the next stage now I'm going to take it out of the bowl now I'll pick it out by the edge like this and let it dangle now with my plastic scraper I'm just gonna help it out easier now around the edges and let it come out naturally when it's coming out upside down onto the table a little touch of flour like this upside down onto the table now the next thing I like to do is a little pre shape I like to tie in the half a lot of people knock it down here with their fists and things like that boys just start to tighten up a little touch by giving it a nice little bump and this is what I do okay I want to keep it round it came out of the Bell round it comes out like a circle I'm just gonna give it a little press like this just to make it easy for myself and take the side farthest away from me here I'm gonna pick out with my thumb and fingers like this give it a little stretch nothing major and bring it over towards me like that now stick it down just shy of the edge give a 90-degree turn like this and do the same again 90 degree turn and the same again always taking that piece farthest away from you and bring it over every time you do it you notice there's another little bit sticking out that's the next piece to take turn it around take that piece bring it in turn it around say that piece bring it in now you can keep doing this you can literally do this all then on but I reckon 12 to 15 turns something like that tying out really nice into a ball like that okay now it's much firmer to what it was now it's much more springy I'm going to give it a little that's like this nothing major pop my cloth back onto the top and I'm going to give it about five minutes to rest up now five to ten minutes I reckon the rest are really nice they relax a little touch ready for the next shaping stage so 10 minutes has passed among those relaxed nicely ready for the final shape a little bit of duster flour on top like that pick it out upside down that's the table sticky side up a little press again I'm just going to press it out into a bit of a circle and I'm going to do one in 10 so not wider than the 10 you want to make it about as wide as what the tin is next thing to do two little flaps like this and fold them in I'm making the top narrower than the base give it a little press down take the top flap push it down like this next thing I'm going to roll it up building tension as I go so gonna put my thumb my thumb's like this in a horizontal line yeah push here where the see Miss roll push roll push each time build in tension here roll push when I get to the edge I'm going to squeeze it out squeeze out that seam into the table nice and tight roll over sort of seams back underneath and that's my loaf made now because I rolled up so nicely all the tensions going across the top this way so when it rises up it become nice and tall and proud give it a little dust like this all over that's does the only thing that's going to stop it sticking from the tin so make sure you get fast everywhere even on the ends all over the place pop into tin like this now give it a little shimmy you may notice that the corners aren't filled here in here there are gaps of the corners because I hope it's not a complete rectangle which is fine resist the urge to push it around everywhere and try and fill those gaps in because you're only going to disturb the structure that you've sort of already made just leave in there as it rises up it's going to fill those gaps on its own naturally as it pops up and let it rest ready for a final bake and that is how you shape a loaf of bread I hope you'd enjoyed watching this if you're making a loaf for home 70 photograph it's always really nice to have your pictures

new life is my live again okay that looks kind of good yeah take two I don't know what the hell happened there that was really bizarre [Music] sorry about that I not quite sure exactly what happened there let me copy the link and I'll put it in discord [Music] today okay yes okay good I honestly YouTube just needs to get rid of this whole individual URLs for streams and just give us a cocktails consoles /live it would be so much easier like why is YouTube had to be so far behind the curve now Cody what's up alright let make sure that chats updating over here - okay good that's updating here and we just have the bread to deal with okay thank you for coming back so I added the plow it's gonna be thick now I've added a pectin to our marmalade jam I really don't know what the difference is between all that I think this is ready now you go into our pretty little canister I don't have a funnel so we're gonna do this the hard way there we go that's clean okay this is gonna be pretty messy we're gonna do our best there we go well that's gonna look so pretty what'd I miss we put the pectin in to our Jam marmalade I don't know what the difference is and now this is ready to go in the fridge and we're ready to finish our bread oh this is gonna be so yummy now I just need some marscapone cheese remind me folks I need to get a funnel this will continue to thicken up as it cools down so it looks a little loose right now you'll thicken up there's some sugar in here that has not melted I think I can't tell if it's that or the pectin very hard to tell well Samina ton and Jam you know what else would taste really good with this some nice Greek yogurt mmm like I just want all the things now like I want to put this on top of cheesecake oh that would be really good there needs to be blood orange cheesecake we may have to make that for the microwave damn sure honestly I did not think it was gonna turn out this well I am pleasantly surprised really easy really quick and boom okay I think which is good cuz I want to make some Meyer lemon jam oh look at that just enough whoo booyah no damn it can you clean this up okay let's clean up around the edge make sure that's all nice and clean so we don't want this sticking there we go now I'm gonna throw this in the fridge no yeah the consistency is pretty I'm pretty amazed by it hola haste esta mmm oh god this is good I like this alright let me clean up a little bit and then we will get our bread going just because I'm running out of counter space yeah I'm not going to thoroughly clean these because I'm gonna let my dishwasher to do that later that's what make sure I get all the big parts of it off you can test it with a cold plate oh that's a cool tip I like that so you guys might have thought me crazy for heading in the crushed red pepper I'll tell you what it definitely adds something to it it doesn't taste spicy at the onset so on the onset I'm getting more of the sugar than I am getting the sour which is a little bit of a disappointment the sour does start to come through and I think the longer it sits in the fridge I think the balances will shift a little bit but you get the sugar first then you get a little bit of the sour and then the heat just kind of comes in at the end so it's not like heavy sugar all the way through yes everything is back on I don't know what the hell YouTube is doing but then again you're probably getting a lot of people watching stuff on there because what else are we gonna do throw stuff in my dishwasher so I can run this as soon as we're done definitely you you too and I should take care of that all right oh yeah sweet and spicy oh I love sweet and spicy peach and jalapeno jam that sounds delicious like I want that okay now for the last tricky part we got a shape the spread boom all right now told me I have to punch it down basically what I'm doing is I'm helping just to even out the bubbles that are in here and it feels a little bit like pizza dough all right now it's weirdest it's not having me put any kind of egg wash on here which I would assume would give us better browning but mm-hmm we're just going with what the recipe says all right so we're gonna cut this in half these are gonna be our baguettes no no no don't stick to the bottom you bastard that's okay we'll fix this we've got this I thought the parchment paper was gonna be enough to take care of it apparently I was wrong you sit there for a minute I need you get your sister there we go you don't normally need egg whites to make brown bread oh oh now I'm gonna use white I was going to use yolks yeah you're supposed to punch it down the bulb I want you guys to see kind of how it turned out all right now they did say to stretch it out a little bit this is gonna look porn errific so stretch pull stretch pull like you're making taffy not doing the other thing well it's covered in oil so maybe that'll help pull out that end piece there okay let's form this together and pull seem I need you to close there we go so I'm gonna do my best to try to form this and whatever it will be it will be because at the end of it all it's gonna be bread and that's honestly all I care about so there's any French petition here just stop watching you're not gonna be happy with what comes next it's very taffy ish yes okay it will be what it will be we're not going for prettiness we're going for its bread they have to fight someone again however I am there we go all right let me grab two ice cubes so what the recipe says we need to do is we need to put these in the oven and right before we close the door suppose to throw two ice cubes into the pan underneath and the steams supposed to help the crust come out really good oh you have bubble tea you lucky here we go whoo all right that's in the oven I can calm down now yeah sorry about that Melissa I don't know what the heck happened YouTube decided to have a theater and I couldn't get the stream on that URL to come back so I had to do a whole new one okay now we have 15 minutes until we can enjoy some bread you know I think this calls for I think this calls for a cocktail [Music] the taffy bread Thank You Cody have a good night dude we'll be back tomorrow with multiplayer Monday probably use up the last of this bottle thankfully I stocked up not even showing your subscription page what the hell is YouTube doing we'll make a big one it's hard times we need alcohol okay unfortunately I'm all out of Grand Marnier so we're gonna have to do without so instead we're gonna take our orange wheel for those you guys who saw the Catherine episode look at that color let's see cranberries do that and then sublime juice [Music] there we go Cheers Oh a little tart it needs two Grand Marnier but like I said I'm all out so those four times and all that ah that's good stuff woo alright what else can I clean in the meantime I really want to check well it's baking they're gonna look like some in bread bread but it's gonna be bread hmm Thank You AMA oh it's super tart right now hold on I hate using simple syrup because it doesn't bring any flavor but you got to do what you got to do and yes I know I can make this some scratch but it's pain in the ass and I don't wanna rap see bill read my mind he's a little more and come out dense that would make fantastic croutons oh they're puffing up at least a little bit in the oven but you'll see what I mean by in bread bread yeah they're gonna look like big hot dog rolls that got into a knife fight with Jason hmm see omelette now you're making me want to make a Caesar salad from scratch that sounds really good you guys want to do that next week oh I ain't missed it what what do you guys want to do for next week's cooking Stream now that a lot of us are having to cook from home where a lot of us haven't had to before are there any ingredients you guys would like to see featured any particular dishes let me know whilst I clean this yeah well they're phallic t-shaped they will make good hoagie rolls that's true I'd say we make some cheesesteak sandwiches problem is is that I have to have the meat special ordered and right now they're not focused on that yeah it looks better how are we doing on time six minutes what do I have in my pantry alcohol cereal a tiny little bit of pasta cuz that's cleaned out I trained you guys how to make pasta from scratch but unfortunately I don't have a pasta roller and flour is still unfortunately at this point still hard to get my hands on that's pretty much it I bought stuff for dinners this week I got swordfish with couscous and corn what also I'm making this week I got the swordfish I'm also doing chicken in a mustard sauce with some roasted Brussels sprouts so that's what I have in my fridge for dinner beyond that it's mostly like alcohol and lime juice sardines and ramen sardines actually tastes really good when you put them into a tomato sauce but chop them up nice and fine I think it's why is it Puttanesca that uses sardines even if you think you don't like sardines they do amazing things with the tomato sauce lobster rolls I get my hands on some Lobster yeah I don't really have a lot my pantry I've only ever been I've really been stocking like exactly what I need for the week yeah so if you guys have any ideas for recipes or ingredients to use ooh crab would be good I could think crab could work oh no I'm not normally a big lobster fan but in a lobster roll it's good because the toughness comparatively speaking to like crab works well for a lobster roll it's Fred it's morphed but it's Fred Oh Lord hats off to anyone who makes bread because your God I'm almost embarrassed to show you this it's it's not pretty why mama be happy I didn't use all of her flower so I'll at least be able to get that back to her that's still tart simple syrup where the hog could go man and I love things tart now why does the Grand Marnier fix this is because the Grand Marnier itself is a liqueur which means it already has a fair amount of sugar in it oh by the way this week the desert of Canada video unfortunately now gets moved a couple weeks out I have the I have the footage done it's just the editing took way too long so this Wednesday we are gonna have our Resident Evil 2 remake cocktail where I go back and remake the cocktail I made from the original Resident Evil 2 so that will be this Wednesday next Wednesday we'll have our resident evil 3 remake cocktail so you're gonna see me oh I almost said Claire Redfield out you're gonna see me all Jill Valentine out and I'm very excited to do that one so those are our next upcoming cocktail videos you forgot the heats oh thank you that that makes me feel better mmm pancakes sounds good too [Music] cheering what is this girls anymore let's see I'm here I'm the biggest one that I ever screwed up I was baking the lemon bars and I had to double the recipe and I doubled everything except the amount of sugar in the crust oh those were some bitter tasting lemon bars make sure this is current current there we go okay Oh what else is coming up 30 seconds so this Monday we're gonna hold up on death row to Canada we're actually gonna be playing jack box again cuz I think you guys kind of enjoy that especially right now probably the week after we're gonna do a round of desert in Canada just to mix it up a little bit because every week Jack Fox can get really boring for all parties involved but if there's some other multiplayer games do you guys come across that would be great for people to play especially if they're free to play let me know because I'd love to add them to the rotation what's freaking out what is wrong with this bread oh here we go [Music] Oh son of a here we go there ladies and gentlemen is our [Music] what to my left is on up and packet of yeast that'll do it oh lordy what sounds like it's pretty good even if it does look yeah oh you guys can't even see how horrible this is hold on check this out that one at least came out halfway decent then there's that one I don't know what happened but yes there is my in bread bread yeah that breads family tree did not Fork yeah it was too dry but thankfully at least its bread which means time to get the butter now normally you would use a bread knife for this I don't have one so we're gonna use the most serrated knife that I have it is a pre open hoagie roll exactly we're gonna cut this one because it looks more like what Fred should actually look like yeah I just didn't want to risk it let's see how this interior turns out you know the interior actually looks pretty good let's cut off a good swath there so better than my non-existent spread you burned your cast-iron pan out how'd you do that okay ooh little gummy on the inside I should have let this rest a bit longer but it's TV so we're gonna butter these suckers up with a little bit of butter and olive oil mix because I like that for the flavor and then we're gonna / preserves on now for this I think I'm just gonna use a spoon because it's not quite set yet yeah it's gonna need some time to sit but it looks beautiful yeah we could always toast it in the pan but it's starting to get a little bit on the late side don't you by the way you know what else tastes really good when you toss it in the pan cake c'mere you actually Oh God put my dumplings a little too long oh no you had to reseat it yeah sometimes that has to happen it's a little on the dense side I think if I'd let the yeast proof a little bit more like you guys said it would have fixed the texture and would've been is dense that way the steam had some place to go but the flavor is really good especially with that jam all mm-hmm exactly Alma hmm but it is quite yummy quite filling - and now chase it down with some vodka you so before you wrap up any suggestions for next week's episode you you sort of blood orange makes the best damn and so good oh well in the music ended just in time Oh suggestions okay well don't worry we have discord open for anyone to put suggestions in there now what we're gonna do for next Sunday tomorrow jack-bots 7:00 o'clock I should be able to hit 7 o'clock 7 o'clock p.m. PST is when we're starting you guys can come play if you haven't already yet you won't hit the subscribe button so it shows up in your feet that would be awesome thank you guys so much for all the likes and I will see you awesome people tomorrow at 7 bye guys", "q9XGJm6oJqk": "in this video I'll discuss shaping your dough if you've never shaped dough before you might think that you just take your dough and roll it into a ball or roll it out into a tube to get a baguette but champing is actually a series of folds and with each fold you remove gas from the dough and you also fold the dough tighter and tighter and build strength in it which will then help it stay upright when it goes in the oven we shaped dough for many different reasons an obvious one is to give us different styles of bread like a round loaf versus a long baguette shaping also removes the gas from the dough and you then let your dough rise one last time before it goes in the oven so this final rise is again you know more time for flavor to develop and you remove gas but you also leave behind tiny little gas bubbles so it's kind of like you take any big bubble that's in your dough and you know remove most of it and and disperse lots of little bubbles in its place and the result of this is that after you bake your bread you'll have a good internal structure with lots of different holes in it if you shaping also enables you to make a tight outer layer on your loaf and what this does is it slows down the rising and it helps your loaf rise in a controlled manner and rise evenly by having that nice even tightness all around it in addition you you have a smooth outer layer so if you if you shaped sloppily and you've got a seam showing or a weak spot what you'll often notice is when your bread comes out of the oven there's what I call a blowout where one side of it just exploded outward and that's because there was a weak spot there and as your dough expanded the gas was looking for the best place to go and it went toward that weak spot so by having a nice smooth evenly tight surface on your dough you helped create just a better looking bread and a bread that rises nicely on all sides so how do you know when your dough is ready to shape um you want to wait until it is fully risen and by that I mean your dough should be bring me anymore if you push on it with your fingers you should leave a dent rather than having it spring back you want it to be filled with gas all throughout it now one caveat of this is that different kinds of dough are more or less tough and so with a French dough made with yeast it's often very easy to tell it's fully risen you know you give it a little push with your fingers and it dents and it's pretty obvious but sometimes with a sour dough where the dough is tougher and it's more stretchy and you might push on it and the dent isn't that obvious and I also like to tell people you know if you push on anything hard enough you can leave a dent so you need to you know use a gentle yet forceful push you're not jabbing your finger into the dough and then saying oh love the debt must be ready when I'm shaping I almost always start with a pre shape an appreciate is like a halfway point in shaping your dough that just makes it a bit easier so for one thing if you're starting with just this blob of dough it's not symmetric but you're trying to get a final shape that is symmetric so by creating a symmetric pre shape you're kind of halfway there and it will make your final shaping easier in addition to the pre shape is just a chance to add more strength so you tighten your dough into this pre shape then you let it relax and then you go and shape it again and you know even if you're shaping around it might seem strange that you pre shape around then let it relax and then shape it again into another round but you're just stretching and stretching and that final shape will be able to rise more upright in the oven because of the added strength so I'm going to cut my dough into two pieces and I'm going to shape one into a round ball and the other into a baguette I'm gonna start by pre shaping them both so so first I just sprinkle a little bit of flour down you want enough that it doesn't stick but you don't want too much because if you have too much it just makes a mess and as you try to shape the flower of Earth the dough will just be sliding back and forth so you kind of need a balance and then here is my dough that's been rising in this tub so I'm just gonna loosen it from the sides use my bench scraper to cut it in half half over here out of the way all right so I'm pre shaping a ball so our hands a little bit first step is to smack the gas out of the dough and it's you know a few smacks but you're not killing it you're not stretching it just a few firms max to get the gas out now this piece is kind of long and rectangular and I want it to end up round so I'm gonna the basic idea is I want to fold up all the sides to make a nice smooth underside but I'm gonna have to fold a little bit more to make it round so I fold those two sides and then I'm gonna fold up this side and just kind of tuck and tuck under there's um two ways that you can sort of stretch the dough and tighten it and this is kind of the basic move of shaping is how I like to think of it one is to use two hands and sort of stretch and tighten but the other is just to use one hand and to push on your dough and it sticks right here and that stretches over the top of it so you use this pushing motion to stretch the dough the secret to doing that right is to keep your hand on the table I see a lot of people who just kind of mush the dough and roll it to use that stretching motion you keep your hands on the table and push again it catches right here and that stretches the top of it my fingers before I touch my phone here we go upside down it's around you usually want to cover it while it's now gonna relax for about 15 minutes 10 to 15 minutes so um you can do plastic wrap lightly over it but sometimes that has a tendency to stick what I often do is just put a little flour on the surface move it and then do something like this bowl up lay down over the dough to stop it from drying out so my second loaf I said I was gonna make a baguette and I'm not gonna give a really detailed explanation of shaping this because I only have one and usually takes a few but I just thought you if you've never shaped a baguette you might want to just see it to get some idea how it's done so the pre shape for a baguette sort of a football shape and a main thing to think about is we want it to be either even all the way across or a little fatter in the middle we do not want a barbell shape because it's very hard to get a nice baguette out of that so again you take your dough it looks a little sticky on top so I'm just gonna flour my hands and give it a few smacks to get the gas out but don't overdo it for this one instead of folding up all four sides to create a ball I'm gonna do a little bit of rolling but if I just roll it straight up it's gonna be kind of long and thin and that's not what we want we want it about that long and football-shaped so I'm going to take the sides and kind of push them to the center a little bit and then just gently roll and that's it and you could stop right there sometimes gas bubbles pop up and it's really hard not to pop them you could tighten a little bit using that tucking motion or the pushing motion and that I talked about before but this length is good and the more you push on it the longer and longer it's gonna get so I would just stop right here again I'll try to show you what it looks like so I'm gonna let them just soften a little and relax and then we'll shape them when they are again soft in strength so while I wait for this to relax I'll just mention a few things about shaping there's a lot to remember while you're shaping with each motion you make each fold or tuck you're you're building the strength of your shape so that when it eventually goes in the oven it will pull upward and not just flatten out after you shape the dough is gonna rise one more time and you want it to end up with all these little gas bubbles in it that then expand if you don't get the gas out at this stage you run the risk of having a big gas bubble in there that just gets bigger and bigger and bigger and then when you bake your bread you end up with one of those giant holes in it so part of shaping is getting the gas out and subdividing all those bubbles that are in there into little bubbles so that the dough can rise one final time and have an even internal structure and as with meeting balance is needed when you're shaping so I mentioned that you want to have enough flour down on this table that your dough just doesn't stick and get ruined but you can't have too much or you won't have the stickiness and the friction you need and your dough will just be sliding back and forth you need to be assertive and you know use deliberate motions but you don't want to be mutilating your dough and over handling it okay so I am going to take my pre shaped ball and shape it into the final round and this is gonna look pretty similar to pre shaping right now I have this nice smooth top surface so I'm going to pick this round and flip it on its head to preserve that top surface your bench scraper is pretty handy to pick it up and plop it on its head in some flour and then just like you did before again get the gas out now I have our pretty round symmetric shape so I'm just gonna tuck up the four sides of it and then flip it over and there's my round it's pretty floppy so now I'm gonna start tightening it by tucking or using that that stretching motion so the idea here and you can see I'm sliding a little bit so I have maybe a teeny bit too much flour on the surface the idea here is to get it's a tightest ball we can without the dough starting to rip and so you keep pushing on it and stretching it and tucking it until it starts to rip but stop right before it rips so how do you know what I would recommend is one time just keep pushing and keep tightening until it rips and that way you'll be able to see how far you can go and know when it when it is gonna start ripping I was gonna demonstrate that but I only have two loaves and I don't really want to because I want to be able to show you how to score them at the oven without having them be all ripped so I'm not gonna do that now but I encourage you to try that just shape it so tightly that it starts ripping and then you'll know how far you can stretch it so I'm gonna stop here so after you finished shaping your dough you need to cover it and have it rise you don't want to put plastic wrap right over it you know tightly because it will stick to the plastic wrap so you want you want it to be covered but it's a little trickier than it was before because now you have this shape that you need to preserve so you can't just stick the dough into a container so there's a few different things you can do what I like to do is to use a large container like this but I flip it over so you could put a sheet of parchment down or sprinkle some cornmeal put your dough on it and then use this as a cover so it's upside down but that works I also often use my cake Tupperware which is just perfect because you know it's got this nice cover on it if you don't have a container like that what you can do is take your cutting board and put your dough on it and then flip a bowl over it and as far as what goes underneath the dough so a lot of Baker's use a linen the professional ones are called cashews but you can just use any towel as long as it's not a super fuzzy towel but more of a woven linen towel and the idea here is you put the towel down sprinkle cornmeal on it and then your dough goes on it to rise um today I'm just gonna do the the simpler route which is to use parchment paper so you can buy it in a box like this so gently pick it up put it on the parchment paper when it comes time to bake it I'll be able to just pick up the parchment and put it into my pot in the oven so I'm just gonna let it rise just like this with this lovely bowl over the top of it to stop it from drying out and I'll probably plug that little hole with the towel so finally I'm going to shape a French baguette and again I'm sorry about my camera angles I hope you can see a little bit of what I'm doing I'll just I only have one so I'll just do it once to give you some idea so I have my pre shape and I'm gonna again flip it on its head smack the gas out just a little bit and then it's basically a series of three folds so this side is going to come about two-thirds of the way over then the far side is going to come up and then there's a third one that brings it together - and here's the third one it brings one side all the way over to the other side okay so this isn't the longest French baguette let me pick this up show it to you there you go but I am going to let it rise on my cake Tupperware so I can't have it too long or it won't fit but I can make it a little bit longer and I'm gonna do that by first rolling it right side up so that the seam is on the very bottom and then I'm gonna use that two-handed tucking motion we talked about before to kind of tighten it and as I do that sort of inevitably gets a little bit longer if you wanted it even longer you can just roll it out just like you're making a snake out of clay but I don't want mine any longer so I'm just gonna do that that two-handed tuck so there is my final baguette I'm gonna let it rise in my cake Tupperware had to scrunch that end a little bit to fit it on but well see you at the oven", "3UjUWfwWAC4": "some 1,300 years ago in the time of King Tut Egyptians were already baking 40 varieties of leavened bread the Greeks contribution to this history was the oven and 70 varieties of flavored breads breads so good that the Romans took the Greek Baker's to Rome and their ovens to Gaul this is how by the Middle Ages bread had become the primary food Western Europe multigrain bread is made from several ingredients such as flaxseed buckwheat soya and millet this protective grill prevents foreign matter from accidentally falling into the recipe mix a recipe calling for some 600 kilos of flour the ingredients ground in a mill are kept in these 36 enormous containers we begin by mixing the ingredients together these kneading troughs are used to ferment the yeast a step which takes three hours the fermenting yeast makes the dough rise considerably this huge mixer needs the dough for about eight minutes when thoroughly homogeneous the content is emptied into a large tub the dough weighs a thousand kilos that's almost a ton the dough is loaded onto a slide situated above the dough divider at the bottom of the machine a small hole allows the dough to escape to mechanically operated arms cut the dough pieces into equal lengths it forms a hundred and ninety two of these a minute the dough then falls on to a conveyor here dough pieces are rolled into balls which can be more easily worked the dough balls are flour to prevent them from sticking during their transport and when they're molded here the balls of dough leave the divider and go to the molder during transport the dough can rest allowing the yeast to act the dough is then folded and rolled the machine can handle three per second for a total of 11,500 an hour the dough is rolled out to the exact size and falls into baking molds here we see the making of hot dog rolls these little dough balls have to be shaped lengthwise and fermented before molding here the hot dog rolls are being machine molded doh pieces must not touch one another so they're spaced apart by a small mechanical arm now we go back to multigrain bread production squat it down at the bottom of the molds the dough pieces go into the prover where they rise for an hour at 42 degrees centigrade and it's 70% humidity then they bake for 20 minutes at 255 degrees when finally baked the loaves end up with a nice golden color a vacuum system draws the lobes from their molds they're then placed on a conveyor to cool a guidance system takes care of carrying the breads to various sections of the bakery when well cooled breads go to the slicer which cut 65 loaves a minute they are sliced by 2 meter wide and 40 centimeter long steel saw blades these blades are changed every two weeks slice loaves are automatically packed at 65 per minute they're now ready for shipping some five and a half hours have passed between preparation of the dry flour and packaging of the baked bread they say a picture's worth a thousand words I hope what we've shown you today speaks for itself our goal is to give you a view of the many manufacturing methods that produce the items we see in our everyday lives I'm mark Tewksbury see you next time on how it's made God", "kqCiwvfu-MI": "and we are ready to pre shape are you super excited I'm super excited this is where the fun starts so we have our final dough let me show you beautiful it is again doubled in volume it's lovely this is my digital probe thermometer I've been watching the temperature because we were up at a really scary 84 degrees for a little while but we've been in a consistent 78 for a little bit now so I'm completely happy with that 78 degrees could just be a variation on my scale accuracy but either way you know 78 degrees is great so we have this beautiful dough let's see what we're going to do with it shall we now make sure I have you set up right first I haven't changed my settings but you never know alrighty okay so get rid of my thermometer and I'm going to take my dough first let me lightly flour my bench I love tosin flower again guys I can't see any questions you make but you may have so forgive me I see how nicely that's pulling away from the sides this time i wailed it just right still needs a little coaxing but not by much oh look at that beautiful dough look isn't she pretty she's so super pretty pretty do okay so you got this gorgeous though we're gonna divide this i'm going to divide this into into six pieces because of the size of my baking stone so from my overall weight doh wait doh doh wait that's going to leave me at nine ounces each if you wanted to do this in two just four pieces if you're going to do a slightly larger a slightly larger what do you call it slightly larger bag at then you would use about 13 ounces each okay so I'm going to start a little bit off there but we'll make it work okay so about nine inches this is my bench scrape and it's ideally what I want 7.9 okay take a little bit more dough add it on top 8.7 you gotta really smack that thing alrighty we have 9.1 close enough so now what you're going to do with these is just set them aside and then you're going to cut your next one you want to avoid getting too many of those tiny little gotta make up for it cuts um because because then you just have a choppy piece of bread 8.8 close enough again 6.3 o how was bad I'm point ate too much Kate points X really kara we can't manage this beautiful ah right under that a so I got three sorry for that loud noise in your ear haha I used to be so much better at this but it's been a long time since I've done it I'd be a little short of my last one I know it that's okay we'll have a baby baguette alright this one ended up at 5.6 my mouth was a little off not a big deal okay let's see here so we're going to take our pieces and because we're only doing a few we're actually going to do a shape to pre shape them more similar to a baguette rather than doing a round pre shape so we're going to d gasps and flatten it out just a little I'm gonna bring it in bring it in bring it in bring it in bring it in keep pulling and working in there and now we are going to take this puppy I have a separate work surface so that I can keep rolling here and stage elsewhere I'm going to take this and we're going to place it seam-side up seam side up okay we're going to do that with each of these now no matter what whether or not it was going to be kind of more oblong shaped like this or round it's so going to turn into a long baguette in the end so this one this method just takes a little bit longer to do then doing around I'll take the small one and do around for you and pull it in and in and over in and in and over in an inn and over and you got around you can do round baguettes I don't like round baguettes I like long bigots more crust so even still you're going to take this and place it seam-side up on your staging board nicety I got some this is my beautiful cutting board oh well it is now being broken in I got some bench knife cuts on there now depending on how on how tight you roll these will depend on how long they're going to need to do some bench resting the tighter you make them the longer they're going to need to bench rest the loser you make them the best time I have these kind of moderate so you can really you can't i'm these to your baking needs so if you don't have if you don't have a lot of time you can do them loser like this so the bench rest quicker and rise or if you need to delay the baking of some like i think i need to for my for the size of my pizza stone you do it a little tighter no matter what you don't want damage on the outside these are just seems from the from the dough or from the folding process there's no damage on these two day damage any of them no none of them are damaged which is good that's good okay seem up i'm actually gonna move these over here now because my other work surface it's a little tiny and they need some room to to move around to grow and now while these are sitting here i am going to cover them covering them just with a little bit of a little bit of paper towels and then a little bit of plastic wrap why the paper towel so it doesn't stick to plastic wrap why the plastic wrap to prevent too much air flow in and around it why not flower we don't need to put excess flour on our I guess so literally just resting it down over them tada now i'm going to i'm gonna leave these go for about 20 minutes Oh upside down again sorry where y'all at these go for about 20 minutes ago set my timer and then we will do the final shaping the final shaping is where we're going to get that beautiful baguette shape and then after we shape it we have to let them kind of rest for a little while they take about an hour and a half from there to do their proofing oh thank you thank you very so we are going to let this proof after we do the final shaping for about an hour and a half in which case let me tell you now if you're baking at home you need steam I'm pretty certain none of you have steamers in your ovens because I don't think anybody does outside of the industry so make sure you have some ice cubes at the ready tricks tips and tricks so let these rest 20 minutes and we will come back and do our final shaping okay be right back", "MR2-x5XJMgE": "hello again my name's john i'm a retired cook from the north east of england in the uk and welcome to my latest bread video and in this one i'll be making these delicious but very easy to make vietnamese style baguettes and if you follow my recipe very carefully using only the four basic bread making ingredients flour water yeast and salt i guarantee you'll be making the very best sandwich bread you've ever tasted and i don't say that lightly because these little vietnamese style baguettes really are that good you can view the ingredients list and full written method for this recipe on the recipe page on the channel's website i'll leave a link in the description under the video or you can click on the i icon top right of the screen to take it directly to the recipe page and i'll be doing the patreon and paypal shout out a little later in the video and with that out of the way let's get on with today's recipe first i want to spend a couple of moments talking about cup and jug measurements and why i personally don't use them now this is one of two sets that i own and if you go online it says one lightly compacted cup of flour should weigh 150 grams so for this recipe i need three and a half cups which should weigh 525 grams so i go through it exactly and test the results on my digital scales okay that's three cups now for the half cup [Music] and the result is as you can see the amount of flour is too much for this recipe and i did this three times with a different reading each time [Music] and now i'll just purely weigh the flower and that's what it should be 525 grams [Music] right now for the water and as you can clearly see it says this cup holds 250 mils now 250 milliliters of water is exactly the same as 250 grams of water now let's test that can't get another drop in without it overflowing and it's still 15 mils or grams short so that's the flour and the water wrong so far and that's why i don't include cups in my ingredients lists now as far as using markings on the side of measuring jugs this concerned i've never owned an accurate one yet now this is probably the best known and used jug brand on the planet and it tells you right there on the jug itself that the markings is an approximate measurement so the best way to measure water is by weighing it so for this recipe i need 390 mls which is the same as saying 390 grams and try to use bottled or filtered water if you can [Music] and that just leaves the salt and yeast to measure now this set of spoons is the most accurate i have so i've tested these results on my jeweler scales the one teaspoon of salt is acceptable between seven and eight grams which it is [Music] and the half teaspoon of dried yeast should be around just over two grams [Music] and that also is close enough please don't think i have anything against cup and jug measurements i've only brought the subject up because so many people on youtube and facebook are wondering why their mix is completely different than mine when they've converted my measurements to cups and jugs if that's what you're used to then that's your choice but i want you to have the best possible chance of getting good results from your baking and there is no easier or better way than using digital scales i do give the measurements in imperial answers too and because it's a smaller unit grams is definitely the best and most accurate way to go and remember a gram is universal it's exactly the same wherever you live in the world right enough of that let's get on with this gorgeous no need recipe start by adding the flour and salt to a ball and mix those together [Music] next add the dry yeast and mix that in two i'm using instant dried yeast for this recipe but you can use active dried yeast in exactly the same way if you're using fresh yeast you'll need 10 grams dissolved in the water and now i'll add the water and bring it all together of course using my trusty wooden spoon handle check the website shop if you want one now the water's only about 17 degrees celsius which is about 62 fahrenheit another important point make sure your yeast is alive and well before you start the recipe now i've checked this batch and it's working fine if you watch my sandwich bread video i'll show you how to do a test on your yeast i'll leave a link in the description box or you can just click on the eye icon top right of your screen once it's all come together in a sticky mass as shown scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula [Music] now cover the ball i use a shower cup for this and these extra strong caps are back on sale in a website shop if you want one of those too now set your timer for 45 minutes how easy was that that's the first stage out of the way okay once your first of two rises in the ball is done scrape it out under the slightly wet bench as shown and as you can see there's not a great deal of change in the size for the first rise but that's okay now with wet hands give the dough a half a dozen turns as shown try to use the same technique as me it takes a little practice but it's easy once you get used to it and because you're using this slap and fall technique you should instantly see the dough become much smoother at this point right okay so far so good get it back into the bowl cover it and this time just for a change i'm going to give it its final rise in the bowl inside the oven with just the light bulb on but any warm dry spot will do and now i'll give it one hour for its final rise in the bowl and you want it to at least double in size this time may vary depending on the temperature of your kitchen and while that's proofing you'll need to get a couple of things ready starting with oil in a strip of crank film and i'll show you what i use that for a little later now i'll set that aside for now and now you'll need to prepare what's known in the baker's trade as a couch cloth basically it's just a piece of well floured material and it's there to support this relatively wet door as it rises and i just use a cotton pillowcase for mine it's a lot cheaper than the original koosh material and it does exactly the same job my regular viewers will have seen this many times i explain how it works a bit more in my french baguette or chapata videos and finally you'll need your digital skills to divide the door and your flower sprinkler at the ready [Music] [Music] okay the dough has doubled in size and it's time to pre-shape these buckets start by sprinkling some flour over the worktop [Music] turn the dough out and give the top a light dusting of flour too [Music] to evenly divide the dough we need to calculate the total weight and if you followed the measurements very carefully at the beginning that should be very easy just add them all together and divide the total weight by six and each piece should weigh 150 grams or five and a half ounces each right i'll let you watch while i divide it up [Music] once you have it divided you need to pre-shape the baguettes as shown a lot of people say they don't have time to make these in total and that's including the baking time it takes about three and a half hours to make these but ninety percent of that is proofing time so you're not spending that much time actually working on them it's like when you do your laundry you don't sit there and watch your machine for two and a half hours you utilize that time and doing something else [Music] it's very important to allow the dough to completely relax after dividing and pre-shaping this stage makes the final baguette shapes much easier to achieve [Music] now cover the pre-shapes with the oil cling film prepared earlier and let them rest for 15 to 20 minutes i like to allow 20. [Music] okay the final step coming up make sure there's no flour on the work surface and add a tiny little drop of oil and spread it out as thin as possible i'm using vegetable oil but any oil will do this just makes the worktop slightly sticky if you use flour the dough will just slide around [Music] right the best way to follow this part is to just watch shape the door like i'm doing and from the thin end start to roll the door back but just from the outer edge of the shape try not to touch the middle where it's starting to bulge up [Music] once you get to the end flip it over and pinch the seam together as shown once you're done it should resemble a cornish pasty which i will be making in a future video by the way it's actually much easier to do than it is to explain i'll do another one from a different angle so you can get a good idea of how it's done believe me this whole recipe is a lot easier to do when you're not trying to control three cameras at the same time [Music] do [Music] write the final step in the shaping once they're all done start with the first one you made and very gently without any downward pressure and with light hands roll the door until you have a reasonably pointy ends once again this is not as difficult as it looks the door at this point is soft but easy to handle i'll show you one more again now simply transfer them to the couch cloth and very importantly make sure the seam side is down on the bottom once you have two done adjust the cloth as shown so you support the baguettes and sprinkle a little more flour on the top a lot of people ask in the comments why is the koosh cloth necessary and can i not just let them rise on a tray or parchment paper so to explain the cloth gently supports these high hydration or relatively wet dose if they didn't have that support from both sides they would simply spread out instead of up once all six are done cover them with a lightweight dry cloth the dishcloths i use i have on the website and they're ideal for this purpose because they're nice and light if you used a heavy towel it would certainly restrict the dough from rising in an upward direction okay now set your timer for one hour and while those are proofing i hope you don't mind if i give my very first recipe book a bit of a mention the book has lots of our favorite recipes from our work kitchens in it and is available in the channel's website shop along with loads of other equipment i use in the videos it's just another way you can support the channel i'll leave a link in the description box below the video or just click on the i icon top right of your screen if you want to order a copy today when there's only 10 minutes left on the final rise preheat your oven to 220 celsius that's 430 fahrenheit or gas mark 7 and to make these buckets as crispy as possible very carefully place a pan of boiling water on the bottom of the oven and do this when you turn the oven on and to make them even crispier have a spray bottle of water at the ready you'll also need to lightly grease a couple of baking trays with oil butter or lard the dimensions of the trays that i'm using are on screen there's two or three tools for making the slashes in these baguettes the first example is the curved blade these are available in the website shop the second is the straight blade like this one but my personal favorite is this thin bladed knife which i keep razor sharp and its sole purpose is for slashing buckets but any of these blades will do the job [Music] okay the final hour is up so i'll carefully transfer three of them to the first tray they will have formed a thin skin so it's okay to gently pick them up by hand once they're on the tree and evenly spaced out give each one two slashes as shown slashing the dough does take a little confidence and practice especially with these high hydration recipes so be confident and quick but also please be very careful so you can clearly see through the glass i'm only doing three in this oven i'll do the other three off camera in the other oven obviously you can get both trays in your oven so get them straight into the preheated oven open the door slowly so you don't get a blast of steam once they're in give them a quick spray with water and get the door shut and set your timer for 16 minutes after a couple of minutes these baguettes start to rise a bit in the oven this is called oven spring and just out of interest notice how much the tray has deformed in the oven by the time they've done the tray will go back to its normal shape and this is what they look like after 10 minutes okay these beauties are done now i'll get them out and onto a wire rack [Music] and here's the other three also done and they look absolutely gorgeous not to mention the smell of freshly baked bread in my kitchen and just listen to how crispy they are as well as being crispy they're very light and airy and wonderful i'll allow them to cool for 15 minutes and when i come back i'll make one of my favorite sandwiches just listen to how crispy that is now the vietnamese people would fill these with spiced chicken or pork and lots of other delicious ingredients which unfortunately i'm not allowed and what a lovely chroma does on the inside not big bubbles like my other french baguette video because these are made using a slightly different process right i'm gonna make myself a cheese and ham salad sandwich but honestly you can fill these with anything you like one day i'll make a video on how i make my famous steak and blue cheese sandwiches right that's ready now i'll take a thumbnail shot and i'll be right back for a big bite of this beauty and honestly that has got to be the best sandwich baguette bread on the planet and i'm not kidding if you don't give this one a big thumbs up then you'll never give anything a thumbs up absolutely stunning and made only from four basic ingredients flour water yeast and salt amazing and as promised at the beginning here is the

hamburger oh no it is a chocolate and salty caramel cake let's see how he was made [Music] I baked my cake in a loaf tin to give me that lovely long shape and I baked two things so this is where I had a giant dough cuts moment we thought I was filming but it wasn't I carved these two cakes you want the top of the bun to be slightly higher the top of your baguette and curb so you want to carve a sort of sub sandwich type shape and also just put a little bit of curb on that bottom one and once you're happy with the shape you can ask those babies up I covered the cakes in fondant I mixed a little bit of yellow and a little bit of brown to give me a sort of creamy base bread color and then I rolled some strips of sugar paste and have ranged them over the top which had blended in with my fingers so check it out I love this type of sugar crafting I am stretching the sugar paste to make it look like expanded don't you see all those little creaks and creases where my sugar paste hasn't quite sealed with this type of cake for a textured bread it's no issue at all and then over my ridges I just went in with my fingers and just just kind of pinch together those edges where do you get dirt so I decided to dust this cake not to airbrush it because I wanted that slightly sort of powdery flowery look I suppose I thought it would be better so you can see I've got a lemon a summer yellow a chocolate and back and some cornflour or white that's what I'm using and I am building those colors up starting from the lightest and then adding more Brown into my mix as I work my way around the baguette using a soft brush you can see I'm going slowly with the color go slowly with the color at close Mac and I wanted to accentuate where we split that dough so I've kept those areas light and I've kept the slightly taller bits that would catch in the oven I've made them slightly Brown [Music] and then we go ahead and we do the same on the bottom I'm not going to see so much at the bottom of this forget because we're obviously going to load it up with sandwich goodies but you still need to cover it the petal toss goes everywhere unless you steam it that's what I'm doing here to set the color that's semolina colored with a bit of brown petal dress [Music] where do you find the time I brought that paste pretty thin I've cut organic random shapes and these are going to be my lettuce leaves this is a double-sided leaf Feiner and that's what I'm going to use just to give my leaf a little bit of texture before I then thin those edges to make them nice and crinkly so for the leaf I used sugar clay which is a sugar Street Studios product a little bit like a sculpting paste you can use flour paste or gum paste to make please leave regular fondant will tear on you and then you have to leave these guys to dry depending on what you've made it out of will depend on the time I left these for a couple of hours and they will firm enough to meet them to dust close my eyes this is modeling-chocolate this is what our three pieces are made out of man modeling-chocolate if you haven't tried it it is so cooked it's so easy to use and it tastes really really yummy so again I've dusted the stuff stuffs I've used my two types of yellow to graduate the color and then I'm coming in with a little bit of black and white so gray around the edges to create that kind of mould texture that you get on breathe a little bit of crinkle action again just to add a little bit of movement into that Bree where the mold looks like it's retracted and shrunk slightly and then I worked out lots of different ways the best way to trying to make the edges white and the obvious thing actually was just to paint them with a white edible paint or white dust mixed with alcohol which is what I did and here and then just painted the side and then I cut these so that I didn't have to have to have didn't have to make so many [Music] yeah I'm making my napkin that is pre-printed slightly paper I'm using this amazing product called flexi which essentially turns waster paper into fabric look how easy it is to use that's all happening in real time to speed it up there [Music] that's corn flour just to take the moisture out so that I can handle what is now from waste paper turned into flowering action tricky old color to get right I put some tabs hang up a little bit of blue put a little bit of brown in there just to give it a slightly finish prayer new to your pink sense at all but have a play have a play with it it's not quite as pink as you think that's just regular sugar [Music] thank you like Sunshine's [Music] so those lettuce leaves guys were steams like I did the bun just to set those dusts again and you can of course airbrush you don't have to use dust it's just the way that I did it for this cake but you can of course use an airbrush that's no issue and then I'm just piling up my brief before the tippity-top goes on that baguette so last-minute decision actually which is why I didn't film it I decided to make some cherry tomatoes on the board just for a pop of color just to offset the baguette I've got the composition too nice I hadn't planned to do it but it was totally the right thing to do and some extra pieces of three and that's that if a get shake and that you transpose to all sorts of other types of sandwich cakes peanut butter jelly sandwich or a hamburger cake or a different type of sub cake and you know hopefully you can use some of those techniques to apply to different fo food cakes [Music] really really hope you enjoyed watching the video and you know if you know anybody that you think would like it please share it please comment if you have any questions I'd love to hear from you sometime just comes [Music]", "Dtb25gHCJFI": "welcome

six-inch subway take a sharp knife so basically this recipe shows you how to make four subs so now I'm going to take one 6-inch sub bread I'm going to cut it make sure you use a very sharp knife that's very very important see I'm not completely divided them into two or cut them into two this is all that I want so we're going to do that with the remaining breads as well the art again as I said is to use a sharp knife so they have been cut now the main things some cheeks I'm going to take a cheese slice I'm just going to cut into triangle this way and place it on the upper half of the bread like this so in the same way we are going to do with all the breads make sure when you're cutting this cheese it's from the fridge because otherwise it's going to be really melting because of the temperatures that we live in okay so we were to bake this in a preheated oven at 200 degrees Celsius for 10 minutes or till the cheese slightly mix so till we put the breads in the oven I'm going to show you how to make a spread so the first spread I'm going to make is of the chili Mayo spread so this is the Moonies and I'm going to add some sweet chili sauce or a hot and sweet sauce or a chili sauce anything that you wish to just don't add regular ketchup just add little ketchup or a sauce with a little spice so after get a sweet chili sauce all you have to do is mix it well as you know the subway has a lot of different varieties of spreads whatever your family lies all you have to do is just mix them and keep them on the table and everybody can make their own sup you can also add some garlic paste finely chopped garlic some onions whatever different types of dips and spreads you want you can just place it on the table I'm sure your guests or your family members will enjoy making the own sub as their liking so the fall spread is ready now for the second son this is again my oh nice or you can add some mustard paste to this or you can add some mint dressing or you can ask something as simple as dream chutney that I'm going to do that but if you do not like that then as I said you can add any other dressing or chutney so I've added some mint chutney so that's my mint Mayo spread while making this mint chutney I've also added some garlic so if you wish you can also do that so the next time you want to eat a sub sandwich at home no need to get it from out you can quickly make it at home yes it's giving such a nice color as you can see so now that our spreads are ready and I think the ovens also done our breads are going to be ready and cheesy so let's quickly start making the sub sandwich so it has been 10 minutes and the bread has been lightly toasted and the cheese's also slightly melted now let's start making a subway I am going to be showing you one sub sandwich again as I said a Subway sandwich can be used any type of spreads in the same way you can use also any types of vegetables that you prefer but I'm going to be using the most basic ones that we all enjoy so I'm going to be starting off with our favorite the lettuce I have thinly shredded the lettuce again the quantity that you want will also differ from person to person so as I said just keep all the ingredients beautifully laid on your dining table and your guests or your family members can make their own subway as per their liking as I said I like lots of vegetables in my sub so I'm going to be loading some and as the name is vegetable sub sandwich I'm going to had lots of vegetables of course but if you're trying to make some tikki or some cutlet then you can go a little easy on the vegetables I'm going to put some tomato slices now we will add some cucumber slices now we'll add some onions I have to least like them similar Pinos if you like to give that spice some olives some salt and pepper someone add some salt pepper powder and our spreads the chili Mayo spread I'll a good amount of this because otherwise the sandwich will taste a little bland right then as a mint mayo spread you can also add some Tabasco sauce if you wish to on top and now my subway is dry to eat in the same way make three more sub sandwiches or many more if you have a big family or a lot of guests coming in so now a sub sandwich is ready all we have to do is quickly cover it you'd like to see some front view of it you can wrap it in some paper or some foil and serve it to your guests in the same way make some more sandwiches and I'm sure when you serve them with a hot bowl of soup your family friends everybody is just going to enjoy every bite of it so get into your

I'm today I'm going to make a baguette with sponge so which means I have to free preferment the sponge this is they call it Spanish or a starter something like that so I have to combine it with our with our was that mixture later so I made this what's going on yeah I made this bunch earlier because it needs to be like we need to be pretty permanent at least a night overnight or a couple of like four hours something like that so yeah and then I put the ingredients later don't worry about the measurement of this I'm going to show it to you later hello chef the major ingredients only of the packet is only for have this water the salt the flour a strong flour and yeast you see the yeast there I put it all together so yeah just combine all of them so I have with me the dough hook and dough put in the attachment and then combine all the ingredients flour the flour and the yeast is there already water Oh don't put the salt first okay so mix it for about three minutes allow to rest for 20 minutes and then that's the time we're gonna add our [Music] peppermint and then before putting the salt like after three minutes of mixing then this the time we put our soul okay we don't want like the yeast will be this distracted by the beta salt so so we're going to make it mix it now this slowly first because if you do it later it'll the flower going [Applause] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] at this point of time 20 minutes is all done so what are we going to do right now is remember the pre ferment that we did I made it la I guess last night so it's like overnight at least overnight of three permutation Oh when you smell this this is smells like really good so it also gives a nice aroma to the baguette to the French baguette so I had to mix it all together here so we need to mix them for about five minutes until they they combine because they have the different mixture right so it's not it's not right the way that they could mix together so we need like only a me a medium speed until the mix and then after five minutes then we have to go up the the speed for for like second speed something that or more than three it depends until they become unincorporated so right now we do it slowly so I I know that mostly some of you already know how how the how the dough looks like if they're ready right [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Applause] five minutes is bad turned it off and then continued on a high-speed five minutes until the dough will develop and then we need [Music] [Music] [Music] so I pulled out the door in the mix in the ball now so when you do like this sometimes there's another technique we do like this if you don't want like to speak in your hand if it's too sticky just dust of flour you need but you don't need like a lot you know the flour because we don't want our bread to be dry so keep on doing like that and then they're ready so we need to relax this for about 60 minutes okay so I have here at the other day [Music] just you're still sticking on the bottom just having put some flour anyway yeah there you go so you can do like that part or you can do keep on going like this and then we need to ferment that for 16 minutes or an hour so 60 minutes is done so right now [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so I need to roll it later okay okay you can do like these guys yeah did you see that okay focus yeah do like this hey don't touch it please hey I have a molder here with me so yeah or there's another way too you'd have to flatten it like that yeah plot them like that where's my love they're all of us my molder is too long you have to flatten like that make sure I'll do it beats please oh my baby okay you plot them it and roll like this or you can do it use this one and then roll like that so it's up to you guys and then roll like that okay make sure you lock this so that they will not separate when you're going to cook up a pop you don't have to say sorry to pop that oh you like it so hey say hello to them hello hello everyone hello everyone how are you hey Howie so I have heared some older so I have to put it in here so yeah that's it I want something like pointed on the edge the edge so I want some things point that under time so I do like that so and then okay [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] there's a lot of [Music] so that's the other design and other to use here [Music] [Music] [Music] baguette so I'm gonna put some flour tapenade [Music] then bake it this for like 20 to 25 minutes okay I have the blade here I need to square it like that you can score like in the middle and they need ah by that you can do like that and I will do like these [Music] [Music] Ilana Lehman mu para montar local a person is Corey clayey a nice squirt or daddy so we'll see what's gonna happen eight there there you go I already know so this is now what I made today I got it from from the oven and there's another batch of baguette will come in so this is now our finished product and it looks really good really you really kid fantastic just now our rustic they raised their decide rustic I get so you can see that there you go thank you guys for watching [Music]", "IiW-9mlWXI0": "hi welcome to you cooks okay Gary's John and today we're going to be making French baguettes yeah this is exciting I went to Paris and we were just like tasting Frenchburg gets all the time run home with my editor on like a true French person we've never we've never made this so we're gonna give it a whirl yes so the wreaths we need are 700 bit of bread flour it's important to use bread flour because it's a strong flour 1/2 a teaspoon of yeast one of the hep teaspoons of kosher salt if you're using tables table salt just use one teaspoon and then 520 grams of tepid water so I'm gonna start by measuring our [Music] we have our new fancy scale it changes grams 2 ounces 2 lakh pounds it's fantastic so the Englishman instead of a bow or 700 and it gets it right to the tea fantastic sometimes you have to kind of play it a little bit both that's there there we go alright then we're going to take our yeast and mix this in and give it a stir [Music] now in France their ovens have an option to steam so we have a little trick up our sleeves we're going to do to create the steam in our oven and that's put a little frying pan full of boiling water in it because they're they're bad guys come out so fantastic I don't know what we do Mary therefore yeah because our the scheme the steam makes the crust on the outside more crunchy and thanks alright then we're gonna mix in the salt so excited to be making this oh my gosh I can't wait to sit down alright and then we're going to add the 500 get some water so we're going to take a little well so we don't think a mess and then dairies are gonna mix up this is a very very sticky wet dough I don't know if you have to just be patient with it they're not the whisk and you have a trick that you stood next back and if that you spin that way it doesn't get all over the spoon part of the spoon is easier to clean off so we mix this up thoroughly and then we're going to cover it with cling film and put it in our oven on the bread proving setting so I love that we could say it awesome landlord I was this amazing new oven that makes such a difference when you have the ability to use precise cooking and stuff so this is actually going to rise four times for 45 minutes each before we actually form the baguettes and I think this makes two or three loaves we'll have to see what happens why four times that's what gives all this wonderful little air pockets and bubbles and oops it's a little tricky there after you do it this is a good workout though that's the great see oh my god it's like that the crazy can we do it with our hands or I still do it with this switch no I'm just going to get that I'll incorporate it and then because it's it's really sticky yeah that's perfect was supposed to be sticky so get that all in there it's okay we are rockin and rollin proof any 45 minutes so we'll catch you later here all right so our dough has been pest risen and it's been sitting for 45 minutes so I'm just going to take it out and just give it a few folds really sticky yeah so make sure you get all that out of there let's get the ball to scraper because we want all the dough all the bread Oh God it's so sticky that's alright we got most of it yeah alright so we don't want to put anything on this but no more flour yep but you can wet your hands a little bit that way it won't stick as much yep and daria's gonna show you how to fold it he's gonna smack it and fold it over smack it fold it over so smack that  in it yeah don't let any more flour you don't want to get the dough to get hard then we're having Lee dropped it and folded it over like yeah make some I couldn't hold it like that [Music] so sticky though and you can see how it's starting to get smooth then we're going to stick it back in the bowl and cover it and let it rise for 45 more minutes and we're going to do that like I said a total of four times so we're gonna drop it in the bowl and we're gonna get back to you use your scraper there you go yeah a little challenging but you'll get that yeah see in a few right here's the second rise I'm gonna pull it out and pull it a few times [Music] [Music] but again give it 45 more alright alright alright so it keeps getting bigger and bigger so we're going to switch it to a bigger bowl but this is the this is a third time right yeah so the next one will be the fourth rise notice just a third one right the third rise right that they're going to put it in for the last time wait I only folded it once alright you folded at once so Tesla - right we can get all this out of here okay [Music] [Music] put it back in for another 45 it's doing a bigger bowl because the duck is getting bigger and bigger love it all right so we will see you in another 45 Wow that is amazing look how oh my God look how some is tons of dough right now on to the next step which is flour your work surface [Music] I'm not going to use too much flour because I don't I want the dough to stay soft I wanted to get too hard so [Music] for sprinkle it was I want a ball [Music] for demo [Music] it really is sticky but it's so worth it when you taste this bread I know it's not gonna taste like the one there is Carrie back in Paris under his armpit but that's not a French to it so that's what we did well we haven't tasted it yet so we're doing all the right steps yeah so far so now he was gonna like punch all the air out of it so there's no gas pockets in it and then we're going to cut it into four and let it rest for 12 minutes it was 12 years didn't it say 12 News yes maybe Wow [Music] four equal pieces [Music] we're going to do is [Music] for me into little square drops by so they here [Music] and they don't have to be perfect because they're just gonna sit for a little bit yeah they're gonna rest for like 15 minutes [Music] so now we're going to lately spray little claim to Alma [Music] my spray but it doesn't stick to the dough I just stop talking so softly because I knew that doesn't come across on the video well we've seen 15 all right all right with the final step here yeah I think they're coming out pretty good they've written a little bit more so now we want to take them and roll them and add them to our hoof so we have a we don't have a couch I mean accuse so we're using a pillow case that we put little ribs on and we have generously floured it and this is what we're gonna let the baguettes rise in so that's start by taking one of our blobs it down and we're gonna roll it out [Music] [Music] here [Music] expand [Music] again squeeze all the air pockets out of it that way you can roll it out [Music] [Music] [Music] these [Music] and we have a fry pan with some water and you can see over there bring it to a boil we're going to stick that directly in the oven on the very very bottom part where the flame is and that's going to create steam it's going to give us our lovely crust so then little air plug it in there now we're going to cover this with [Music] one of our tea towels that we swiped in Paris now we're gonna let it rise for 20 minutes so we'll see in 20 all right all right so we just took our baguettes out they've been sitting proving for 15 minutes so we let them sit for another 12 minutes but while we're doing that we preheat our oven for 400 Fahrenheit 200 Celsius but while we're letting our oven preheat we want to boil the water because we're gonna put that at the bottom of this oven once we put our baguettes in there so you want to already have this pre done all right so we'll see you soon all right the last final step before we bake them I fashioned this little board it's a piece of cardboard cover with tinfoil and now I'm gonna try to get them from here to here on our parchment lined jelly roll pan I'm picking do this right [Music] without depleting them [Music] perfect for those [Music] all right now we have to spritz them down with some water and then put our slits in them so they can expand and rise perfectly so you do four angles slits [Music] you can use a razor blade or a sharp knife whatever you have on hand you onto them from side to side like Big Ben baby [Music] right so that's that [Music] yeah [Music] the other PA the freshman keeper [Music] oops [Music] long as you get him on there slits looks [Music] [Music] [Music] in the oven we put them and we have itself accidents have a bake evenly you can see we have our pan of water in there we're gonna put them in likely and then spray some water in the oven create some steam and then in 8 minutes and then we're gonna turn them around baking for eight more I love a big evenly so we'll see you back here in eight minutes here they are while love they are done and they are ready to be eaten but just we read so cross your fingers it sounds great look at all of that it's just this I think I think we did it first try don't be afraid to try this stuff at home oh I'm a G let's give it a fight I love damn them don't be

"hey there groovy guys and groovy girls chef Phil here and today I'm going to show you how to roll out a baguette at home in the privacy of your own kitchen true that so earlier today I did a classic French okay as you know or may remember classic French is 100% flour 60 percent water 2 percent salt and 1% instant yeast okay so for today I yeah I just reduce the yeast a little bit because I still have that wonderful sourdough starter so I'm making some French sourdough baguettes today so I'm using 800 grams of high gluten flour 400 grams of water 20 grams of salt 5 grams of instant yeast and 400 grams of sorry 400 grams of my starter so I made this so I don't know several hours ago and it's been in my homemade proof box in my oven with the pan of water so what I'm gonna do is flip the camera down so you can see how I scale and roll out the dough I've skipped the part of mixing and watching the mixer rotate and you all know how to do that by now so this is classic French baguettes here we go [Music] that looks good now let's get a little light on the subject but uh alright first let me show off my wonderful bread look at that bad boy okay that's three pounds well it's sixteen hundred and twenty-five grams okay so what is that 3.6 pounds why don't you do that in your head can't you I thought so all right so let's dust our bench and we're going to break out my hand and oh nice I keep it so handy wonderful kids just saying now classic French is a it's a sticky dough okay it's not a wet dough but it's also it's wonderful all right so here we have my with a little bit of flour yes they love the feel of this all right so I'm just giving it a rough shape because I'm not gonna break out the scale I want four pieces all right so handy dandy dough knife don't forget this is my in-1 from Wolfgang Puck C's logo they're probably not alright so we're just gonna cut this in half and we're gonna cut it in half again so there may not be exactly the same but they're close so next thing you do is make a rough shape all right so this time the shapes gonna just be a ball and what I'm doing is I'm just I'm gonna let this rest now for a little bit okay because it's gonna make it easier to work with look at that beauty you follow this follow the action of my hands all right we have one two three the same size they have two big ones and two little ones all right all good all right cover with a damp cloth if you've got one and I'll be back in ten minutes see you soon", "VrUdtzXquWk": "[Music] so guys let me show you a really simple bread recipe this is a really trusted way to do it it's super simple and you can do it easily at home yourself it's really good fun and I'm gonna be big enough my beautiful bakeware range this is gonna make two nice big tins first up we've got one kilo of strong bread flour use your hand to make a well and then what we're gonna do is add yeast to some tepid water all sachets are seven grand so we're gonna add one sachet to 620 milliliters of tepid water so if you leave that for about five minutes what you're gonna do is activate this dormant dried yeast and it will start to bubble absolutely start to bubble so mix it up what you can do is add just a little pinch of sugar to the tepid water now what this does is feed the yeast gets it going wakes it up it also gives you a beautiful kind of slightly darker crust let it just begin to fluff up and then we'll make the bread there's a nice generous couple of pinches of salt to the flour well we're going to wait for that yeast to activate and start kind of bubbling at that point we're gonna add the water to the well now you can see I'm using my fork here and I'm just bringing the fork in from the outside to the inside it makes like a kind of porridge first what we want to make is a beautiful smooth elastic dough this recipe is normally bang-on but sometimes depending on the weather you know the flour can react slightly differently so be prepared to add a little bit more water or flour depending on how it looks literally use the fork until the last moment when you can't use it anymore and then we're going to go through a process of kneading now I can kind of tell you there's a specific technique but really just move it stretch it rip it really rub it and rub it onto the marble it will become less sticky of course if you've got little stuck bits of dough you can use a palette knife just to scrape the dough off of it every time you need it you're kind of making the gluten stronger and stronger and therefore it's going to trap and stretch and hold in those gases that the yeast kind of create okay guys so look that's had about 10 minutes now this is going to have to proves the first proof will be to develop flavor okay so I'm just going to put it in a bowl rub with a little bit of oil and you can do this over about two hours until it's doubled in size or you can even do it in the fridge so it's colder and it will prove slower but what you'll get is even more flavor it'll develop more flavor so you choose which way you want to do it I'm gonna cover this with some cling film so it's kept nice and humid and if you look over here here's a dough that's had two hours proving so let's have a little look I'm gonna add a little bit of flour to a surface here and pull out this dough I'll split this dough in half here smash the air out of it and then what we're gonna do is just fill these two molds here knead it out into a ball just put it straight in the next thing I do is get myself a tea towel and I just put it under a warm tab and I want to wring it out so it's a nice humid environment and then I'll simply pop this over the top and let it prove for about an hour hour and a half until it's doubled in size and then we'll bake it so guys after an hour you can see it's doubled in size I'm gonna put it in the middle of the oven the oven is preheated to 200 degrees Celsius which is 400 Fahrenheit thirty minutes in there 35 minutes until it sort of sounds hollow when you tap it and we'll be good to go okay guys so after 35 minutes I took the bread out of the tin and I wanted to hear that hollow sound and then you know it's fluffy and cooked on the inside of course the top is really nice and crisp let's have a little look inside beautiful look at that a nice simple sandwich or toast made of homemade bread turns the everyday and the boring into something sublime and gorgeous if you want to see more of my gorgeous bakeware range hit the AI up there and check it out it's beautiful and if you want to see a lovely

many hosts to furnish their guests with ornate platters of their favorite savory snacks these spreads might seem a little intimidating but as you'll discover there are very few ways that you can mess up charcuterie except to call it Chuck Cooper II which throngs of angry internet commenters will be quick to remind you refers only to meat let's get down to basics [Music] basics with babish and the

Squarespace order with an offer code babish whether you need a domain website or online store make your next move with Squarespace alright folks so let's start with cheese and some of their different flavor profiles over here we have parmesan y'all know my man parmesan salty sweet waxy and just a little nutty then down below we have what I think is the French cousin de parmesan Mima let's it's cool-looking sweet nutty and expensive then over here we are headed to Spain with a little bit of manchego a firm sharp and some what's our cheese and perfect for pairing with cured meat then we have hunk of robiola or Brie's cousin that never takes a shower this stuff smells like slow death but has a surprisingly sweet and mild flavor then next up everybody's most or least favorite goat cheese this is a soft ripened goat cheese so it's a little creamier and more flavorful than your average chef then on the opposite end of the goat spectrum we have an aged to go Gouda this little guys 18 months old and has lost the distinct goat flavor in favor of sweeter and nuttier overtones then right behind that we have the more recognizable cow's milk Gouda which given its age would be normally sharp and salty but this is a double cream Gouda so you can actually see how much softer and creamier it is it's very sweet and nutty so it goes really well with sweet and nutty things then next door we've got my favorite formed the goat cheese can take midnight moon a six month old goat cheese that is sweet buttery and lightly crystalline so you're gonna get a little bit of crunch throughout its soft texture moving on over here we've got a classic aged Irish cheddar you guys have probably had this before but it's my cameraman's favorite so we had to get it it is sharp firm but slightly creamy and goes great with damn near anything now over here we have what's pretty much an American brie Mount Tam by cowgirl Creamery an incredibly soft buttery luxurious melt-in-your-mouth triple cream cheese that even Brie haters will love speaking of cheeses that people will love despite normally having an aversion to said Jesus the whatever over here we have something called gorgonzola Dolce a milder sweeter creamier version of its mouldy Italian French and British counterparts and lastly something a little less exotic to coat that hmm sorry ricotta sweet creamy mild and slightly granular it's got just as much a place on your cheese board as it does in your lasagna and we'll see why so this is obviously a very small smattering of the endless cheese options out there but hopefully it paints a picture of some of the basic genres and gives you a few ideas for your next classy night in next up someone better call Arby's cuz it appears as though we have the meats and way way better ones to up front we've got some hard cured stuff like this peppercorn sopressata which is gonna have a lot of funk from the aging process and a little bit of heat from the peppercorns of course you're gonna want to have your butcher slice this and virtually everything else paper-thin but some things you just got to slice yourself like this fennel salami which is likely gonna be a little bit more sour a little less funky but there mine cured meat flavors are going to vary wildly depending on their producer region and about a billion other factors over here though we've got a cured chorizo which based off its color alone is probably gonna be more spice forward with a bit of smoke and agent funk for either these joints you're gonna want to take off the casing yes it is perfectly edible delicious pig intestine but it has a texture that's practically reminiscent of dried out pig intestine it's really chewy and it's just gonna be easier on your guests to peel it off like so then once you've got the casing off go ahead and slice off a couple exemplary slices to show your guests yes it's okay cut a piece off eat it that's what this is here for don't ask me why but sometimes dinner guests need a little encouragement like that now we're gonna head back in time to before we sliced up that salami weird and talk about the pre sliced meats before me over here we've got a classic prosciutto sin Danielle sorry I don't know whether it keeps happening prosciutto sand annual who's salty oily tangy crudo flavors are contrasted here with prosciutto Cotto which is the same cut that has not been cured but simply cooked then over yonder we have my favorite thing in the world mortadella or Bologna for grown-ups it is fatty salty porky and thanks to the inclusion of some nuts nutty sorry anyway it's really really good and you should eat some then next to that we have my other favorite thing in the world spec this is prosciutto that has been smoked so in addition to all that oily tangy agent flavor it has smoked so beyond cured and Cook's meats like these there's a whole world of pates and terrains all them kinds of ways that you can bring tasty protein to the party but even all these studs need a wingman and here to fill that role are all these delicious accoutrements starting on the far we've got marcona almonds fried in olive oil these are way crunchy er and more flavorful than regular almonds and they are worth the extra cost then we've got these darling little pickles known as corny shell and they're delicious put one in your mouth see what happens and then we come to the matter of olives I like Nicoise olives which have a more savoury and less harsh flavor than Rickett Oh Oh be sure you check these little things for pits if like me you're not a frequent olive eater sometimes you forget let's try another one of these here and careful much better and then flanking the Nicoise we have our grocers choice mixed olives which you know are nice to have then over on the nutty side of things we have some smoked almonds these are gonna come in handy if you're serving strong imposing cheeses that need something a little kick to remind your guests that they are still alive then back here we've got some artichoke hearts packed with oil and herbs these are great on their own but go even better with a little bit of fresh mozzarella then adding background clockwise we've got some orange marmalade here it's very bitter and bright and it's one of the million ways that you can introduce fruit onto your board of meaty cheesy delights it's gonna go really nicely with free or goat cheese or telesia then we have a condiment that I think should be served at all tables alongside salt and pepper caramelized onion jam you can make this yourself but it's perfectly good out of the jar as is its neighbour over here a little sun-dried tomato puree not all this stuff is gonna be available anywhere you go so go to your grocer and mix and match like I hadn't seen this before some grilled Cipollini onions they had some so I bought some and now meeting them it is the meat and cheese boards circle of life and lastly I know this is pretty hipster but we have some spicy honey there's a reason that this stuff has caught on over the past few years it is delicious and it's gonna be especially good on our ricotta maybe with a few of those marcona almonds if we're feeling frisky and then I almost forgot about some fresh mission figs this will go really nicely with any of the sweet creamy cheese's there you have it we got our wingmen now who's driving the vehicles that will be driving our taste buds to flavortown are usually gonna be just bread or crackers we generally don't want anything too flavorful or Irby I'm going with a simply sliced baguette and some salted crackers we've got some high quality ingredients going onto our board and we don't want them overshadowed by roast garlic rosemary for cheese Asiago limited edition Triscuits anyway it's time for the big payoff laying out our cheese and charcuterie board you don't have to go into this with too much rhyme or reason I'm just gonna sort of localize different meats and cheeses by their varying levels of sweet and savory and putting the sweet stuff towards the center so we've got some ricotta and gorgonzola Dolce I've got parmesan pickles and speck on my left some artichoke hearts near the parmesan because I think that's what's gonna go best with smoked almonds by the midnight moon and grilled onions right near at the artichoke hearts the triple cream up front with a healthy scoop of caramelized onion jam and figs and then let's fill in the gaps with things that are probably gonna be eaten on their own nuts fruits and olives and there you have it one hell of a meat and cheese board you don't have to be culturally or regionally specific you don't have to be a city planner to lay one out you've just got to experiment try some new things and see what you like

breads but they're all make also makes bread rolls and one of the fantastic things that a lot of people are interested in are baguettes so you can make up to eight baguettes at a time if you want not only that it also makes cakes it can make lemon cakes it can make jams etc you can preset this so that it can turn on in the middle of the night and have beautiful warm hot bread for when you wake up and you've got that lovely smell right throughout the house and it comes with a fantastic easy-to-use cookbook as well as in this there is a guide that will help you to form the baguettes as well so we're going to make four baguettes today so we're just going to open that up in the middle is obviously the bread pan that is easy to come out so what we're going to do is which is going to it's very important in making a bread to ensure that you put it in the right way the right ingredients and the first thing to go in is the water so it's 170 mils of water and then a half a teaspoon sorry one teaspoon of salt the flour and that's 280 grams of flour and the last thing we're going to copy is a teaspoon of and even comes with a little measuring spoon so the precise measurements it's really important to have the precise measurements maybe a little bit more of that even comes with the water container so everything's there for you as well just pop the yeast on the top pop the bread pan back into the machine mate flexing lid down and then we're just going to turn it on to program one so you can also with this make three different loads you can make 750 1000 gram or 1.5 kilo gram loaf of bread and you can also program it to whether you like the crust light medium or dark so it's really easy to use just by following the little prompts that are on the front of the screen and we're just going to do that and what's going to happen is this is going to mix the dough it's going to need it it's going to rest it'll rise and then it will stop and that takes about an hour and 20 minutes and then we'll bring it out and we'll form the pickets okay so what we have to do really is to put it on program one that's the one that we're going to be using it has 19 programs yep press the start button and we're away so when you're wanting to make other bread rolls or baguettes we've got a handy to show you exactly what to do very simple so what we're going to do is to start off it we're going to take the dough out of the bread maker it's baked and it told us this medium weight a little bit of flour out a banjo now you can see that the star is already formed very easy I'm just going to roll that around a little bit awesome shape over shape I'm going to cut it into four we're going to make four records soin huh and then in half again you really don't have to be a professional at all to do this as you can see I'm just going to flatten out the dough for the first baguette fold it over in half and then just press it down and fold it over again press it down now I'm going to keep a little bit of a roll the contact and then just repeat that process until we've got it all and what we're going to do as well is you can do little shapes on top of that so this comes with a little knife so I'm just going to make some little incisions into the dough and such or an instruction book it even tells you that you can make some little cuts into the dough and you'll find that when it has completed cooking it just gives it a little different shape makes it look like you're a real professional we're then just going to put a little bit of water on top of them helps with the browning that's a first one done we're then going to pop this into the holder the dough and then just complete the next two and we're going to place it back into the bread maker down and then you just press the start button again and it will then complete the cooking time it will be a mess now you", "vp1Jmkw6EnI": "I'm Eric Kaiser I am owner of mezzo Kaiser in the worldwide and I wrote book plows book of

Today, I\u2019m showing you how to bake two delicious things. The Viennese bread. And the chocolate chips Viennese bread. The Viennese bread can be enjoyed plain, or used as a bread for your sandwich. I love it. And the chocolate chips Viennese bread, which can be drunk in a coffee or a tea. This is just extraordinary. * The plain or chocolate chips Viennese bread * Here are the utensils needed for the recipe. An electric stand mixer. A dough cutter. A dough scrapper. A brush. And for the baker\u2019s signature: a bread lame. And of course, the thermometer. It is very important to take the temperature of the doughs. Always have a dough at more or less 24\u00b0C. * The ingredients * Here are today recipe's ingredients. 500g of flour. 15g to 20g of fresh baker\u2019s yeast. 10g of salt. 70g of sourdough starter. 100g of butter. 20g of milk powder. 60g of sugar. 250g of water. And for the food lover, you can add chocolate chips at the end of the kneading. * The recipe * At first, we pour the liquids in the mixer\u2019s bowl. The water. The fresh baker\u2019s yeast. If we don\u2019t blend it with the salt, the sourdough starter. Like that. All the liquids are in the bowl. The milk powder. The flour. We lift the bowl up and start at first speed. I can add my sugar. The salt, as the mixing goes along. So now, we need more or less 10 minutes at a median speed. * Kneading 10 minutes  *\nIn order to knead the dough, properly. Once the dough is kneaded, more or less blended. We add the butter * Kneading 3 minutes *\nAnd now, we let the mixer properly blend the dough. We add a bit of oxygen in the dough. And then, the kneading is completed. with this Viennese dough, called plain Viennese. We can, if we like, add chocolate chips. To bake, what we call, nice chocolate chip Viennese. * The pre-shaping * Look, here, we have our both doughs. * After one hour rest *\nThe plain and chocolate chips Viennese breads. * After one hour rest *\nThey have raised for a little hour. And now, you see, when I touch the dough, it is full of gases. And with all these gases, we have to start the kneading. We\u2019re about to freshen the doughs. Cut your doughs in half. I\u2019m about to form a sausage. We cut them in 120g pieces. If you are not very used to it, weigh them. Same thing for the plain Viennese. Small pieces, see, I just shape my dough. Like a small sausage. And I cut them, in 120g pieces. Once it is done. We\u2019ll form ball. Bring all the edges back in the centre. So, if you are not used to it, you can, just, bring the edges to the centre. Just like that, it works the same. Voil\u00e0. And you form a ball. See, we slightly flatten and bring all the edges back in the centre. Meaning, that we will give it strength. For it to have a better resistance to gas pressure. If you are an expert, take your both hands. And you form two balls. One in each hand. It works very well. Here, the same. Same thing, so, either with two hands. Or, very gently, I flatten the dough and bring the edges toward the centre. You see, it is a very nice dough, it is so smooth, we want to, almost, take a bite in it. During the baker\u2019s apprenticeship, we say that this tiny piece is for the baker\u2019s boy. So, we\u2019ll keep it for the baker\u2019s boy, meaning me. Voil\u00e0. Once we have formed the balls. * Rest 30 minutes *\nWe leave them to rest for a half an hour. * Rest 30 minutes *\nAnd we will give them their definite shape. * The shaping * Look at my large baking tray. We call that a Viennese tray. We will let the doughs to proof on it. Because, we\u2019ll have something high, almost round. In order to have a nice sandwich bread or beautiful other things. Nowadays, you\u2019ll find that in every department store. I place a greaseproof paper to avoid greasing the tray. And if you don\u2019t want to use the paper, just grease your tray with a bit of butter. So, the chocolate Viennese. I start. We roll the dough, I\u2019m bringing all the pieces back toward me, and pinching the edges together. See, I pressed it with my fingers. And now, And now, I'm stretching it out, gently. The idea, here, is to avoid over shaping the dough. You should try stretching it just in one gesture. You should not over using it, because it would spoil the dough. The seam is uppermost. I\u2019m placing it underneath. And now, the plain Viennese. I love that bread. You know, some time ago, in Paris, at the beginning of the XXth century. We used the baguette dough and add milk powder and a bit of sugar. And we called it oatmeal bread. It is the same idea. I flatten the dough. Stretch it out a bit, preparing it to be stretched out. I place the top in the middle and pinch the edges together. I\u2019m stretching it. It is beautiful, just like silk. Stretch it. Middle. Edge to edge. And I\u2019m stretching it out. * Preparation of the baking * Once our Viennese breads are shaped. You can, eventually, if you want, glaze them with an egg. Or if you have steam in your oven. You can brush them with water. And now, we\u2019ll do the baker\u2019s signature. We score them from top to bottom. See, it is very simple. Quite deep into it, because while proofing, we\u2019ll see less and less scores. Chocolate, the same. * Rest 2 hours *\nAnd now, it will proof for 2 little hours. * The baking * You see, our breads have proofed. Plain or chocolate chips Viennese bread. * Baking at 200\u00b0C for 20 min *\nThey are ready to be put in the oven, at 200\u00b0C for 20 minutes. Or maybe, 21 minutes, if you like it well done. It will be, just, perfect to be savour. * The result * Here are the result of our baking. See all this Viennese breads, they look so appetising. They are well scored. You see, the glaze creates different colours. From light yellow to brown. It smells good. I hold myself back, because, I want to bite into it. It is gorgeous. And for the chocolate chips Viennese. Look, the same. Same thing, same scores, same colours. But, we have these extra chocolate chips. It remind me of my childhood. When my father baked them, and I always, secretly, stole one. I love it.", "Su_Qw12B2Jo": "Hello, Today I\u2019m showing you how to bake The Traditional French Bread La Baguette Let\u2019s go. *Traditional French Bread*\n[Music] You can knead with a small kneading machine. or just with your hands. Then, you need a digital probe thermometer. It\u2019s very important to take the dough\u2019s temperature. A dough scraper, A dough cutter A bread lame. Some water and a pastry brush. A baker cloth, to grow the dough. And an oven to bake the bread. That\u2019s it. Let\u2019s start kneading. *Ingredients*\n[Music] And for the ingredients: 500g of Classic French Flour 100g of our liquid sourdough starter 330g of water, If you are brave, you can add a bit more water, but know that it will be bit more difficult to manage the dough. but, the bread will be even more beautiful. 9g of salt And 4g of fresh baker\u2019s yeast. *The recipe*\n[Music] I\u2019m giving you a first tip to bake a beautiful bread. Stir together the 500g of flour and the 330g of water. You can pour the whole water in. But, if you knead with your hands, you\u2019ll have to pour the water slowly. The autolyse is completed after several minutes of kneading, Now, we leave the dough to rest. Put a baker\u2019s cloth on the kneading machine for an hour. *Rest: 1 hour* And then, we\u2019ll start kneading again with the yeast, the salt and the levain. And we add the liquid levain. Normally you would take a spatula. But I like to use my hands to feel the energy of the sourdough starter. You should learn to feel a lot with your hands in this job. And we start to knead for 6 - 7 minutes. *Kneading: 6 to 7 minutes\" And here is the dough of the traditional French bread. The kneading is done. I\u2019m putting it down a towel. I\u2019m taking its temperature. *Temperature: 23\u00b0C*\nIt is very important to have a dough around 23\u00b0C-24\u00b0C. It means that the dough is at the right temperature for the perfect fermentation. Then, we\u2019ll let it rest for at least 1 hour for it to build up its strength. *First Rising: 1 hour\"\nIts ferments carbon dioxide are released. You can see some thin bubbles at the surface of the dough. This first fermentation is very important. That\u2019s is what we call the first rise or first fermentation. The more your dough ferments the better it will taste. I cut the dough in three with my dough cutter. We\u2019re going to make some round balls, it is called pre-shaping the bread. The method is very simple: fold the edges in towards the centre. I\u2019m about to give it a round shape. *Second Resting: 30 min*\nSee, a nice round ball. *Second Resting: 30 min*\nLet it rest for at least 30 minutes. *The Shaping*\n[Music] Take some flour and lightly flour the work surface. I put my hand in the flour and slightly press the round loaf. Do not degas the loaf too much, we need the gas formed inside the loaf. It will turn into alveoli when the bread will be baked. I roll out the loaf a little bit. I\u2019m folding the loaf. I\u2019m rolling the baguette. It easily gets longer. I\u2019m putting it on the baker\u2019s cloth (or couche) Seams above *Proofing: 2 hours\"\nI cover the dough and leave to proof for 2 hours. *The baking*\n[Music] Just before putting the baguettes in the oven, pour a glass of water in it. It will create steam that will help the bread to rise longer in the over. The bread will bake for 22-23 minutes at 250\u00b0C. And you\u2019ll have something splendid to share at home.

Today I am going to show you how to make a real French baguette. So it has\nbeen ten minutes so I am going to turn my oven up to 450 degrees. That is really hot.\nNow let's take a lot of bread and work with it a little more and get it ready to go in\nalthough we are having pizza. Let's bring our bread out again for our final look. You\ncan see it has risen quite a bit. When I put this in it was half this size. So what I am\ngoing to do now is take the ring off again. I have already washed my hands so I am just\ngoing to punch this down. Take my hands like this and knock all the air out of it because\nwe don't want the big huge holes while it is baking. I am just going to take my fists,\nsmash this down, flip my bowl over and it should fall right out and it does. The thing\nis that this side with the oil on it is going to be kind of sticky so we are going to make\nsure that we have our flour here which we do and we are going to lay that side down\non the flour. Now what we need to do is we need to knead this just enough, see this side\nhas kind of a leathery dry skin about it so we want to roll the dough back over on top\nof it. We want to get that inside and get the nice soft part on the outside. Roll those\npieces over like this, roll this piece in like this, roll this piece in like this. Also\nwhat we are going to do is we are going to try to work all of that air out of our dough\nby kneading it. You can see that now it is really nice and really smooth and really great\nlooking bread dough. Now our next step is going to involve us shaping it and getting\nit ready to go.", "jpZ-pplzOu8": "okay so this right here I've already shaped to show you guys that is that is our final shape so we are going to take one of our pre-shaped lengths of dough here I gotta move you guys a little bit i can't work so far away from myself okay that's better sorry you guys are shaking so much there we go okay so this is seam up seam up again just I mean ever so light coating on here I can just barely get any of my hands you don't want excess dough in here our flour excuse me if you feel like you have excess flour on the outside of this dust it off seriously important okay so we're going to take this and we're going to d gas it just a little bit then since we have it already elongated we don't need to do a ton of folding we're just going to do a single fold before we start tapping it down with the palm of our hand so we're going to take the dough at the top edge fold it over like that you still want a little edge left open down here and press down okay now if you're right-handed you're going to tuck with your left thumb and press with your right palm the oil right heel excuse me if you're left-handed you're going to do it the opposite and you're always going to start on the side of your dominant hand so I'm going to take my left thumb on my right side near my right hand I'm going to tuck my thumb in and I'm going to press this down here i'm going to go much quicker but okay if you feel like you're getting tachy get a little bit of flour on your hands you don't want tackiness because if you have tackiness you're gonna tear your dough and that's just mean we don't want to do that we're gonna do that one more time okay so now we have a nice seam and make sure your hands again just have a little bit of flour on them and you're gonna roll ever so gently the way Jeffrey Hamilton describes it is keeping your hand cupped so that your fingertips are always touching the board your heel is always touching the board and your cupped and he says you know it's really hard to kind of describe how much pressure you put on it but he said it's the sweetest thing Baker's really are tender people it's very sweet he said think about having a loved one and how you would put your hand on your art hand on their arm you would put it there gently and you would cup it but you would still have a little bit of firm pressure to let them know you know that there's some affection there so he says do it that way so start by rolling that you'll have a little dip in the center then two hands same thing rolling out words tapered at your ends and try and keep them about the same length now we're going to rest these on the board seam up here's my scene so I'm going to put that there and again these are going to sit here for about an hour and a half normally we would use this cloth thing called a Koosh to rest these in and bunch up the Koosh in between them and have them on a board so we can move them around not many people actually have a Koosh than their home kitchen so we're not using a Koosh pressing down folding in my shape was a little bit off when I originally shaped it so I've got kind of this peanut shape you want to avoid peanut shapes because then you end up with peanut shaped baguettes and nobody wants a peanut-shaped baguette a little bit more bench flour I'm turning you do this little turn and tuck twice don't get in the habit of pinching seems like that just get a better get a better pat on it it's already a little thin in the center so I'm not going back in and pulling it anymore at the center again don't overwork there's my scene seemed up I'm actually going to rearrange my cutting board a little bit here I move this guy not really comfortable with moving it I'm going to anyways once you place it you should just let it go see these two are kind of awkward shaped let's get this next one let's make a perfect now if you're getting sticky stuff on your board that's when you want to get your bench knife get that off of there just like you don't want stickiness on your hands you don't want stickiness on your board either one more tucking dress I'm not she oh hi why having what am i doing I'm making a baguette can you say hi to everyone there in there but can you say hi to them to have everyone hi seem up second to last one seam up still on this hope you guys can still see what I'm doing here can you come live up a little bit yes this is a technique that says something that's not easy to do at first let's be honest I'm out of practice for about five years even though it is kind of like riding a bike I did so many of these in culinary school that I almost can't forget how to do this huh this one wasn't pinched as tight we'll pray for the best now we have this little mini one that I did here i'm gonna move this off to the side I can work a little better we have this tiny little mini one that I did in around you're going to shape this slightly differently than we did that those we were able to kind of just fold once and then start pressing and pushing out this hey hang on a sec okay again you're going to d gas but you're going to pull it a little bit now your that's a pastry brush honey you're going to pull it a little bit oblong as your degassing now our our gluten structure in here is kind of wanting to be in a circle whereas when we shaped these ones we already gave it the east-west orientation so we didn't have to do as much to convince our gluten structure to want to hang out and move that way we have to do a little more convincing with this one so we're going to pull in only about a third of the way with this one there are d gasps a little bit more flip it around and do it again okay and now this one we are only going to tuck and turn after we've done two of those one more and you don't want to go harder than your dough wants you to you'll start to feel resistance in your dough if you're asking too much of it if you're asking too much of it don't force it if you force it you're going to damage the gluten okay so we've got our seam down there this one's just going to be a slightly shorter but get yeah you don't want to eat that flower it's a flour baby all right and there's that one now again I am going to take these I'm going to very lightly cover them with some paper towels if we were doing this in a big bake shop we would be using we'd be using big fishes which are bakers linens um they're just gonna lay some plastic over purely to keep those kind of sitting down maybe if I can stretch out my plastic yeah maybe maybe right baby yeah yeah crazy guy okay yes all right so we're going to let that sit there we got we've got an hour and a half now we've got an hour and a half rest time so i am going to set my timer this is the hard part because you know that as soon as this is over you put it in the oven and none it's only 24 to 26 minutes away from bread gloriousness hey don't play with my bench flour you say hi to everyone say hi no you say hi before ya know how dare you mommy okay so an hour and a half our desired final dough temperatures about 76 degrees since it started out at 78 before we pre-shaped and then we made it into limon says hi to you can you say hi can you wave no Leland okay leyland says hi to you I thought we had another little another little joiner so since we portioned it and it's no longer the big mass that it is it's smaller it's going to be more apt to want to lose its temperature which is a good thing right now because we were a little higher than 76 so hopefully these will come down to about 76 degrees from 78 and it will be at its DDT desired doh temperature what are you doing are you rolling things make sure you stay off my cutting we're oh yeah look at that devilish little grin rarer okay so well now an hour in 29 minutes from now come on back and we'll put stuff in the oven in the meantime you are going to want to pre-heat your oven if you have a pizza stone I should show you my pizza stone can you hang on one second hang on one second i'll show you my pizza stone you say cute things to the camera no okay all right you guys are just got look at my ceiling for a minute I keep my pizza stone store it on top of my fridge but I keep it tightly wrapped in plastic all the time because it's not one of those often used you know things and I don't have one of those nice little sideways cabinet doors Oh to store like baking sheets and stuff outside it's a little too heavy for what I want to put in my baking rack so I just keep it covered in plastic and I put it on top of my French okay let's have a look sheets of stone yes it's taken some some wear and tear but this is what pizza stones do this is the sign of a good well used seasoned pizza stone this is what the inside of deck ovens look like to in hurts so this is perfectly fine it's completely clean these are just little burn marks why tightly wrapped so that the plastic doesn't stick to stuff who wants shaggy who wants shaggy plastic on it um and then you don't have it you don't have it catching on things and stuff like that I say tightly wrapped mostly because I was trying to tear the tightly wrap stuff off and it wasn't coming off easily so when you pre-heat your oven you need to preheat it starting with your stone in it a lot of people bust I see so many awful reviews for pizza stones like on amazon and so this thing broke the first time i used it well you know what is because you turned your oven up to 500 degrees waited till it preheated then you put a cold pizza stone in it that's not how we do things middle rack of your oven put your pizza stone in yeah I gotta sweep out that bottom put your pizza stone in and you preheat with it in there okay eat with that in there you also if you're baking at home and you don't have a steamer every one of us get yourself out a sheet tray cookie tray sheet tray of some sort not with the nonstick stuff on it I do I don't have one there it is and we will be putting that in the oven as well just before we put in our just before we put in our maggots so have this at the ready have ice cubes at the ready have your pizza stone at the ready if you don't have a pizza stone then yes use one of these with a with parchment parchment probably the best option so", "5oiKPMAEQ5E": "okay so what we've done is we've done a baguette and I'm going to walk you through all the steps where we're gonna make the dough and in theory we let it sit for three hours and outside at room temp and in that time we're actually going to be giving it folds right and the folder we're gonna give it some gluten development some body and then at the end of that we're actually going to pre shape it let it rest for 20 minutes now we're gonna shape it roll it out into a baguette and then we're going to proof it for whatever time it takes anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour and a half right and after that we're going to score it and we are gonna bake it so I'll walk you through all the steps I've I actually have the bread ready at every single step which will be interesting for us to see and after we do the bread will do a quick jam I'll show you that takes not even ten minutes and it doesn't need anything more than berries sugar and lemon juice and then some candied oranges for you to do you know something that you can make with oranges you know during this time right where you can eat the orange and then you can candy the peel and I'll walk you through how you blanch the peel multiple steps and then you can yet and within two hours you have your candied orange juice all right so let's go through the bread cuz I know that's why you're really here alright so for the bread you have the recipe there essentially I have flour yeast salt and water and I'm just gonna I'm gonna mix them all together right so I'm gonna get all together right here just all at once I'm gonna mix it now there's two ways you could do this I mean there's many ways you can do this using a mixer but we're not going to use a mixer we're actually gonna just mix it by hand it's gonna come together and then we're gonna we're gonna work a little more another way that you could do this besides mixing if by hands where you have all your dries and you add your water is you can actually have your water with your yeast let that foam ten minutes right after ten minutes it gets a little filling because of the action of the yeast and then you're going to add in the flour a little by little and you're gonna use a spatula and you're gonna just keep stirring it and it's gonna kind of that's gonna work the gluten until you have all of the flour in there and then you're gonna work if I hand for five to ten minutes but then if you do that you I need to do the folds and what I really want to show you is this very I guess old-school technique right where you're making a short mix dough which means that it's gonna get worked a little bit in the beginning and then we're gonna let it kind of ferment or proof bulk proof at room temperature and then it's gonna get the folds and the folds are really what's gonna give it the body so when we're grabbing our dough we have our dough on the table and we're going to fold it over and press down and that's just the kneading action as we do this we give it a quarter turn each way each time right so push down we fold over we push down fold over push down fold over push down and you just speed that up and you just have that going so what we're gonna do here just gonna mix it for about a minute or two again we're not gonna get a lot of gluten development for this so we're not looking to mix us for for ten minutes all right we just want to mix this as needed if you need to you can always put a little bit of flour on your table not a problem right just working it just like that there we go right see the dough's come together right it feels a little tight which is good see that tensile strength right there that's great however with this I won't be able to get a gluten window I mean I'd have to mix it for literally 10 or 15 minutes to get the gluten window which is what you're looking for so gluten window is how you usually know when you're using a mixer that your dough is ready because you can literally take a piece of the dough and you can kind of stretch it apart and it's so thin like you know like a thin sheet of plastic like plastic wrap like cling wrap now you can peer through it and that's called referred to as a bluing window and that's generally when you know that you've mixed your dough long enough on a standard KitchenAid mixer that is it's ready to go so now that we've got this going on we mixed it about a minute two minutes we're gonna roll it into a ball right now we're gonna put it back into our initial bowl there's some flour in there there's a little bit of flour in there I'm just gonna put it right there we're gonna cover it with plastic wrap all right just keep it covered with plastic wrap and just leave it on the side all right and I'm gonna do that right now so as I take this and I leave it on the side I'm gonna take the one that I did previously to remove the plastic wrap I'm gonna put it on the table and I'm gonna show you what we're gonna do so if you look at the dough right now it looks totally different right look at the difference in this dough right it looks a lot smoother it's a little gas here right you see that it's smells a little eesti and you see that it's kind of risen you see these pockets of air right here at these bubbles of air so we're gonna do here is we're going to do the fold and the fold is very simple right we're gonna fold it over from the front to the back right then we're going to fold it from the side to the side and that's it that's the fold that we're looking for this is what's gonna give body and build the gluten in our bread right then we're gonna roll it back into a bowl yes I'm gonna put it back into our bowl and we're gonna cover with plastic wrap and we're gonna do this every hour on the hour for three hours right so once every hour and we're gonna do that three times Merril so what almond flour work instead no for for the baguette the almond flour is not going to work because this it's not a real flower right I mean what it is is it doesn't there's no gluten in a nut flour right and what we really need is gluten gluten provides that skeletal structure for our bread that will trap all the gases you know from the the fermentation from from the East activity and that will give a nice you know that would cause it to give a nice rise to our bread and trap that you know and just give us that nice loaf with the beautiful crumb right so for an almond almond flour you get something more cakey for example if you use something like cup per cup right which is a great gluten-free alternative right you're you're gonna get more of a cakey bread that's not what we're looking for here so we do the fold we leave it on the side once we all the folds we have our flower flower we have our curve our dough that I am going to appreciate so if we appreciating the dough all I'm gonna do is I'm gonna press it down I can knock out the air you can usually hear it right you can hear it press down down again third time and a fourth time and I'm gonna quickly roll it right so I just roll it really quickly and there we go I appreciate my my dough my baguette right so at this point I would let it rest right but what I actually did is I had already pre shaped this right so what I'm doing right now is actually I'm shaping it so it initially I would appreciate it and then I would just cover with plastic wrap again or you know keep it in a in a cambro camera in a closed cabinet you know so it just doesn't dry out and I would leave it alone for 20 minutes after 20 minutes the dough's relaxed I'll lift off the plastic and again I'm going to press it down until I have a rectangle right one second yeah you should you should be able to see it pretty well so I have my rectangle right here what I'm gonna do with the rectangle end is I'm gonna bring in the edges bring in the edges and then I'm gonna start pressing it over right so maybe I'll go three times across I'll press down each time right so what I'm doing right here is I'm creating the roll I'm rolling the bread right if you look at it this way so I come over here press down I come over about imagine like the thickness of my finger and then I pressed down each time I'm pressing down I'm creating that crumb right I'm working on that crumb I do this three times and then on the fourth time for a small baguette like we're doing on the fourth time I'm gonna seal it and I'll use my palm to seal it so I'll just press it down and seal it so if we look at this right here this is our scene right do you see the seam of the dough right yes so Tina active dry yeast and in Sydney's are the same just their their granular right an instant yeast is finer so what I actually used is I use instant yeast but in the recipe that I that was given online I and active dry yeast which was I think four and a half grams for the recipe so to convert it I just I multiplied it by a 75% and it I used less so you can always convert the amount of yeast a you're going to use if you look there's converters online but from instant yeast which is a fine granular to active dry larger granules to the cake yeast which comes in blocks alright so back to our baguette this is our seem regret I'm gonna get a little bit of flour over here right and what I'm gonna do I'm actually going to kind of work on that tensile strength right so I'm actually going to push the dough against the table like this I'm going to push it against the table and it kind of rolls along the table it grips it a little bit and then I'm gonna do the same thing coming back right that's to help it get you know build up some body and it just works on this so that it's you can imagine that you have all these layers inside and they're really wound up really tightly against each other and then that they're not loose that they don't create any gaps in that layering once I've done that I'm gonna quickly roll it roll it out and I personally like the long ends on the baguette right so I'm gonna roll it out and as I roll it out using my pumps I'm going to thin out the ends okay say you see the ends have gotten thinned out I want to keep track of where my my my seam is I believe the seam is important yeah so Oh mark so for this baguette this is a baguette that is about two hundred and thirty five grams which is not the size of a standard baguette a standard baguette and I can't I'm sorry I can't do this in pounds right now but a standard baguette is 350 grams it really depends there's some very variety but when we do large baguettes at work we do 350 gram baguettes you can do small baguettes mini baguettes and those would be about 30 40 grams each okay and then you you would work it the same way all right so we have this we've rolled it out there we go and we know that the seam is where's the seen the steam is over here so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna show you the one that I had rolled out earlier I want you to compare them if we compare them you can see how this baguette has doubled in size and I and I started proofing it and we know it's ready when I press it down and it doesn't it doesn't hold its shape it barely holds the dimple right I think this may be a little bit over right I mean I my timing wasn't perfect with this but the room that I'm in is not perfect for it as well so what I did here is I actually put it seemed side up on some flour that I sit sit so if I walk you through that this is just one way you can do it you can also put it directly on to like so pen which is which is a perforated soap at like this which is great for break baking bread because it allows for the air circulation that's why there are all these holes in it right and in French bat or Pai N is bread and that's why it's called a silk pen right the more you know right so I'll show you this really quickly so this one that's ready I'm transferring it over here and as you can see I have the flower on the top of my bucket so the way I did that all I did was I did a thin layer of flour on here and then I put it seam side up right so obviously we don't want to bake it with the seam side up we want to bake it with the seam side down but this is gonna stay this way until I'm ready to transfer it that weight evenly coats the top of the baguette so I have this baguette right here I would have liked to have put a little bit of flour on this parchment I feel like it might be a little sticky now it's too late now yeah that's okay I'm sure it'll still peel off once it's baked off I'm gonna set my oven to 450 right um it's a house oven right I don't have a deck of and usually I would use the deck of it I don't have a deck oven I'm also using a razor blade I don't have my little handle you can buy a little handle online for your blade to the cost you maybe like $15 if you don't have a razor blade you could also use a serrated knife a serrated knife will cut right here as you can see it cuts through that's not an issue so when we're scoring our baguette on the small bucket like this we may give it four or five scores what we're doing is we're going from at an angle we're going to cut it at an angle and open it up right we're going to get open cuts on here pretty much we're going one two three four on this small baguette we're gonna go from the middle of one so ever jump essentially we're going straight down the line and we're just gonna cut it do you see that right so I started I started at the top I'm going straight down right I start cutting across the baguette not going to the sides but sticking to the top of the baguette right and then as I cut it then I'm gonna start my next incision essentially halfway of the first incision third one goes about halfway from the second down here fourth one same thing and then cuts and it opens up as a cut as we cut it and that's where the began he's gonna open up when we pull it out of the oven although this is not a great one it's the only one that didn't get eaten the better ones got eaten but you're gonna see the same thing here right the in French I believe they're called alveolus I don't know what they're called in English sorry should look that up so this is gonna go in the oven good way to do it when you're at home is you put a pan in the oven and the bottom of your oven you put a pan set your oven to 450 it all heats up it's ready to go in pour 1/3 of a cup of water into that hot pan that's at the bottom of your oven once you put your bread in close the door it's gonna steam right and that you need a little bit of steam injection at the beginning so you get a nice crumb towards the end so if we look at this it's got it's not super crunchy right I didn't want that out of this but I didn't want it super crunch up again and if I cut it if I look inside looks okay looks pretty good all right so that's that for our bread okay that was the bread part let me know if you have any questions on the bread I'm gonna turn on my oven because I have a couple of the guests to bake off and next we are going to do the berry jam in the canyon candied oranges and that's that's pretty quick too so I only took a few minutes to walk you through this and now I'm going to take just a few more minutes to walk you through the bergen let's cover my other Baudette want to lose this right this should be ready in the next I don't know in the next hour within all right so next project add two more projects coming up so as you see we have a berry gem you see how nice and thick this gem is okay and then the candied oranges you see how they're almost translucent right so we're gonna start with we'll start with the gem the gem needs to cook and I'm gonna change the way that the camera presents so you can see me where as I'm cooking it essentially when they do the gem I'm gonna start it first because it's good to take a little bit more time I'm gonna put our our mixed berries these are berries that were meant for smoothies right I can't go outside and get fresh berries I think you know what adding my sugar then I cut a quarter of a lemon I'm just gonna squeeze it in there so we have my lemon juice right and then I'm just gonna mix it all together and I'm gonna cook it and I'm gonna cook it for essentially eight to ten minutes right as I'm doing that as that's cooking and I'll show you the process as it's cooking I'm going to cut my orange to show you can get the rind off the orange so as you can see I also got the rind off of my lemon right this is just to show you that you're gonna use fruits but you don't the Ryans don't have to go to waste this is a great snack if you can yet not only that once you get your candied orange you can let leave it out on it on a rack to kind of dry out and then you can just once they're dry the next day you can just dip them in chocolate and it's so good it's delicious all right so I have my orange I'm going to cut my orange as you cut you want to follow that line right there you see the rinds yeah you're gonna you're gonna cut around the orange just like when you're segmenting and you're gonna get just that bit then right here you have a little bit of fruit not really a concern but you do want the rind because if you cut I'm sorry if you cut just the if you remove all the pit which is this part all right so when you're one second when you cook this this Jam want to make sure you get to meet me you want it too hot they also keep a spoon in the freezer so I can check the consistency this [Music] okay so that's working I set a timer because I know it's gonna take about six minutes yeah six more minutes and I remove so I'm removing the extra orange from my pit right so essentially you're going to lay it out flat you're just gonna cut and remove it there you go we have these once we have that we're just gonna throw it into a pot of water right cold water bring it up two boils and you're gonna do that three times so once you've done that what you wind up with I can find it you wind up with this this is the peel that has been boy boiled three times in boiling it three times you accomplished two things one you are removing all of the bitterness you're removing all the bitterness from the the pit right and you're all in and from you know the central oils that are in the skin you know which actually give it a lot of flavor but it's also pretty bitter the pith is and two you are going to be able to facilitate the exchange in the cell walls of water with sugar water or our syrup right so essentially what we're doing is we're gonna candy it right we're gonna remove the water and replace it with our serve so this is this is the Orangemen has been boiled three times once you have that you can just chop it up right you can just chop it or slice it into the segment size that you want just like these and then you can just drop them into the syrup so my syrup right here I'm gonna go in grams but essentially it's 65% sugar and 35% water it's a syrup that's 65 bricks which measures the density of sugar I'm gonna cook my syrup first so the sugar in the water bring it to a boil and then I'm gonna let this simmer in here for about an hour and a half until it's translucent it's gonna keep at a simmer you don't want to bring this to a boil if you boil it what you're gonna wind up with is you're gonna wind up with oranges that are really tough right you don't want something tough when we put this on right here and we leave it at a simmer right once this just sugar syrup has come to a boil and then it's just simmering then we just leave it alone we you know we just have to make sure that it's fully immersed right so if you need to put like a plate on top of all of your orange peels then do that but it just needs to be fully submerged when it comes out when the oranges come out they're going to be practically translucent just like this I just made this so what what I needed to do and you know I let them drain right away but what I needed to do was actually leave them just to cool down in the syrup that I had made right leave them to cool down into the syrup that I had made and and then the next day you know I just go ahead and eat them it's pretty good pretty good it's even better with chocolate so the jam is ready now I'm pretty sure I have about two more minutes I mean babies I'm gonna check on it so I know there's a question about bread I'm gonna answer them in a second but so I have my spoon which is frozen and this is a quick way to test if my jam is ready because what am i testing for I'm gonna test that when I drop it onto my spoon it's gonna cool down right away and I want to see if it holds does it hold looks like it does right do the same as with the oranges what we don't want to cook our jam for too long generally when you cook jams for too long you get darker notes more like more caramely notes right like you're you're cooking the sugar for a long time right and you don't get the nice bright fruity notes so I'm gonna stop my jam and I'm gonna pour it into a container you can pour it onto a plate or in a container and literally I'm not looking I'm not interested in canning this right this is I know I'm gonna eat this you know within the next week or two so I had my jam and I can cover it with plastic wrap and just throw it in the freezer for about 20-30 minutes and it should cool off it cools off even quicker if you just put it on a plate and you just cover it and leave it in your freezer it'll be ready within 30 minutes if that's what you want so yeah so and then this is the consistency of my gem right here as you can see like it's pretty thick right and I didn't use any pectin in here I mean with just the natural pectins in the fruit that I have right otherwise what I do like to use I use apple pectin or pectin NH which is a thermal reversible pectin which means that you could cook something with that pectin and then you could warm it up and it'll be nice and fluid again right all pectins do is they bind water they're hydrocolloids so they bind the water right there they're a gelling agent so there we go and then you can just spread that on there probably needs a little bit of butter and you can bite you know bite on it so the question you had was what is the difference between a baguette Omar the difference between a baguettes this baguette and a divan baguette so no that is just a starter so someone else had asked me about using a sourdough starter in their bread so essentially you can use you can use a couple of things in your bread right you can just use straight-up yeast as we did in our Easter bread you can use Levana which is a starter right so kind of like a sourdough starter not looking necessarily for a sourdough bread it can be the LaVette is in there along with the small amount of yeast to kind of you know kick it into action right the whole easting action or what you can do is you can also just use a bit of fermented dough that you made the day before that's not necessarily a sourdough but it's just an older dough that's been used and that older dough has somewhat broken down and fermented a little bit and what it's done is it's it gives a lot more flavor to your bread and it helps develop the crust a little better as well right so other than baguette is gonna be way tastier than this baguette however what you can also do with this baguette which is what I did with it yesterday is you can make it and just leave it in your fridge overnight so once you've gone through all the steps just leave it in your fridge the next day pull it out of your fridge and let it quickly proof it should be almost ready anyhow and then just throw it in your oven and that's gonna have a little more flavor than using it in the same day if you buy a baguette in a shop it's only gonna be good for the next you know six to 12 hours right and how long do we bake the baguette elomar well we're gonna put it at 450 gonna throw it in the oven it's gonna bake anywhere from 15 to 20 25 minutes I did a time lapse earlier than I posted and I believe that was a that was a 20-minute baguette again it depends on if you want it nice and crunchy right like old school like you break it and really you hear a crunch here you don't hear that crunch this is this is a lot softer right so if you want that crunch you just bake it for a little longer what you can do too is you can leave the door open even with the oven on just so it allows the steam to escape at the end and it helps it further dry out okay so thanks for joining in guys", "xugufifsB4s": "with a hint of Pesto Aioli Hey, what's up guys welcome back to Binging with Babish, where this week, you might be asking yourself Why does he need a bowl to make a sandwich? Well, we're going to need a lot of bowls because we're making ciabatta - the ideal vehicle for a prosciutto and mozzarella sandwich. We're starting with five ounces of all-purpose flour, quarter-teaspoon of instant yeast in a cup of water, that we're going to combine in a medium bowl Stir until it's a sort of pasty-looking paste. We're going to cover it in plastic wrap and let it sit - room temperature, for 24 hours. This is going to ferment into what's called a biga. which is a kind of Italian starter. The fermentation helps with flavor development and also made our biga all sticky, and icky. This is a sign that you did it right. In the bowl of a stand mixer combine the biga, ten ounces of all-purpose flour, a half-teaspoon of yeast and one and a half-teaspoons of Kosher salt. We're also going to add 6 ounces of lukewarm water and 2 ounces of lukewarm milk. This is a method developed by America's Test Kitchen and it helps control the size of the bubbles that form in the dough. Mix on low speed for a minute or two just combined, and at first you're going to be all like, \"this isn't bread dough this is cupcake batter,\" but just stick with me here. Switch to a dough hook and knead on medium speed for at least 10 minutes until the dough becomes silky, sticky, and smooth. This is helping me build gluten and therefore structure in our eventual loaves. Next up: rising, kneading, and repeating. Place the dough into a very well-oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap and let rest for one hour, or until it's doubled in volume. Three episodes of Frasier later and we're going to come back to see our little guy all grown up. Spray a rubber spatula down with the non-stick spray and gently fold the dough towards the center like this eight times. Recover with plastic and let rise for another episode and a half of Frasier. Fold eight times again, recover with plastic wrap, and let rise once more for another episode and a half. I know this seems like a lot of work, but I swear to God, sandwiches made on bread that you baked yourself taste ten times better. Scientifically proven. Turn this very sticky dough out onto an extremely well floured surface, flouring your tabletop more as the dough inevitably sticks to it. Divide the dough into three equal pieces and shape each of these pieces into roughly a six by ten inch rectangle. Try not to deflate too many bubbles. We're then going to fold the dough on itself kind of like a letter. Place seam-side down on a piece of parchment paper and dust with a bit more flour before covering with plastic wrap and letting rest for one final episode of Frasier. Remove the plastic wrap, make any final necessary adjustments to the shape. Dust with a bit more flour if it's leaning a little too doughy and placed on a pizza peel. Spritz down with a little bit of water before using the parchment paper to slide directly onto a pizza stone in a preheated 450F oven for one to one-and-a-half episodes of Frasier. I'm sorry, I'll stop doing that - for 22 to 30 minutes. While we let these guys cool completely, let's get some Pesto Aioli going. Start by toasting about a half-cup of pine nuts in a dry pan, allowing to cool completely, and placing in the jar of a food processor, along with maybe a cup of packed basil leaves, one to two glugs of high quality extra virgin olive oil, and a single clove of peeled garlic. Process for about a minute until you get a nice creamy pesto. We're going for a sandwich spread here so we don't want it too chunky. Season with salt and pepper if necessary and get ready to make some Aioli. We're employing Chef John's \"wrap a damp towel around the bowl\" so it won't move nothing. Because we're going to be whisking this guy pretty hard, we're going to need both of our hands. Combine one egg yolk and three cloves of grated garlic along with just a hint of grated fingertips because it gets kind of tricky towards the end there, see? Season with Kosher salt and whisk them to combine, while slowly drizzling in olive oil. Drizzle too fast and the Aioli will break, drizzle too slow, and you'll just kind of be here all day. Then we're going to present our pesto to the party, permanently pairing with our perfectly provencal Aioli. I gave up. Slice our beautiful bread, dressing a little bit of olive oil, and start shingling on layer after layer of prosciutto - about half a pound, I'd say. Next up -\n mozzarella. Make sure you use your buffalo mozzarella - way better. A few tomatoes, because it just makes sense in this sandwich, and then the only green that I think can stand up to all the richness and the sandwich - the peppery bite of Arugula. Make sure you put just the hint of our pesto aioli on the top half before putting the roof on our house and making it a home. If you think I'm not going to get a cross-section of this thing, you must be new around here. Take a look at, easily, what's got to be one of the top five sandwiches I've ever made. Top three. Now, I know the hydra are a bunch of really bad guys, but if they started serving these things in the cafeteria every Tuesday I'd join up. They have a cool logo anyway.", "vPpIgVyqNjk": "bozo Meza me to this video is on how to make French bread and baguettes and Petipa while we are at it and for that particular recipe you will need some bread flour 625 grams of it some water tap is good at 406 grams some salt at eleven point two five grams and finally some yeast at seven point five grams now you can mix the salt with the flour that's okay and you will need to mix also the yeast with your water now I need to warm up that water to about 100 degrees more or less 100 degrees Fahrenheit and that 100 degrees Fahrenheit through the entire recipe is where the yeast strive so if I want to mix my yeast to my water I want the water to be around 100 degree Fahrenheit so that's about 3540 seconds in the microwave for 406 ROM of water and by the way why 406 ROM of water because this is 65% hydration as my recipe calls it 65% hydration is perfect to begin a bread as you get more experience you will increase it to 66 67 68 69 and even 70% hydration which will make the bread last longer and be more soft on the inside and so on so you want more hydration but higher hydration is harder to knead the bread so we are going to start at 65 forces let's talk about the salt one point eight percent salt is standard for French bread then the yeast I use one point two percent of dry yeast by now my water is warm enough and I'm going to drop in my list in it with a little bit of sugar to feed least [Music] [Music] now that the yeast has been well mixed with the water sugar mix I'm going to let it rest for about 15 minutes during that time the yeast is going to hydrate and start hitting the sugar which should help it getting some kind of a boost now I'm going to oil one big large ball after the Knitting I will need a place to put the dough ball to rest for about an hour and this ball is going to be put aside for this time being I'm going back to my flour I probably need to mix the flour and salt together and then I pour in my my yeast water sugar mix picking up any last drop of it and then for the next about five minutes I'm going to mix everything together [Music] now it's time to transfer my dough into my workstation the table I built specifically to knead my dough and with the help of your dough scraper because you have one of course transfer the dough from the bowl to the table no flour knead it and for the next eight to ten minutes you are going to me that dough my method of meaning is not to push down on the dough but to fold it and slap it and fold it and slap it with a quarter turn every single time when you do that is with the slapping motion you stretch the dough at the same time it naturally stretch itself if you slap it too hard it will stretch it to break if you slap it gently it will stretch to this limit a little bit like an elastic you slowly stretch it and you stretch it more and more and more and more and it become stretched if you take that elastic and stretch it very far or at once it will break so that method helped create the gluten through stretching so again eight to ten minutes of that action making sure you rotate your dough every quarter turn every time on top of it every time you fold it back on itself you add oxygen to the dough the yeast and the bacteria need that oxygen [Music] the ball is perfectly formed let's place it inside an oil ball and cover it up I use a shower cap people make fun of me but I recycled it every single time I do not trash any plastic wrap and then is going inside the oven for an hour the oven will have its oven light on which will produce a hundred degree fahrenheit temperature for an hour and that this is going to love it no air circulation just warm heat for an hour maybe an hour and a half depending on the reaction and depending on my time after an hour you pull out your ball from the oven and before putting the dough on the wok station put a little bit of flour on it this time you want the dough to not stick at all using your dough scraper pull it out of your ball and place it on the flour you just put down what we're gonna do is measure the dough to make two patty pal one baguette and one batter the difference between the baguette in the batter of the batteries is more of a short and thick baguette and I'm going to make to put a pile of 75 grams each with sesame seed which will bring a lot of flavor into the bread one basic baguette and one basic butter the baguette will be 350 grams and the batter about 500 grams alright everybody has a scale okay good if not I will leave some link below about scales and and those scrapers and everything make sure you put flour everywhere and right now we are not fully shipping we are pre shipping we make small ball of the dough and those pre shaped balls will be led to rest for about 10 minutes 75 grams for 230 pound and you roll everything together you stretch a little bit you fold on to itself by also blowing up any little air bubble that you have in and try to make a tight ball and put your ball into a light flowerbed on your workstation and let's make another one it's 75 grams more or less and it is time now to let you know that I will have follow-up videos when explaining how to shape and pre shape another one explaining the vicar's math another one giving you a lot of little tricks I've learned over the years on how to make dough how to nee what kind of flour to use what water temperature what are the different type of the yeast there are so many details to know about it but I can tell you everything and I will on follow up videos right now you can see I'm looking for about 350 grams for my baguette and I should have about 500 gram left yeah for my better or large pan again we fold onto itself we stretch a little bit and we blow up any bubbles inside the dough you want the yeast to have full contact of the protein so we don't want to see any bubble at that point you stretch the ball and you put it into a light flower bed same thing for the 350 gram baguette before you let it rest for 10 minutes you will need to cover your balls you do not want any air drying the outer skin [Music] 10 minutes later you remove your covering which again we'll talk about it into another video but how to make those you take your first little both to make a booty pop you flatten it out stretch it and roll it and tied up and at the end you squeeze it roll it into a bit of moist paper since I'm a seed and place it into an oven pain and we're gonna repeat that for this second pupa so you need some flour on the workstation you bring your ball you flatten it out remove any air bubble and then you roll it tight a couple of times and squeeze the sim you put it into a moist paper towel and then into the sesame seed very moist water will make the seeds stick to your toe now it's time for the baguettes same again flatten stretch it remove the bubbles and then roll it tight and then create the same flatten the same you will need to roll out the baguette to extend it the same size as your baking sheet and add some flour to it it's a nice little rustic touch and it will stop your bucket from sticking to the baking sheet put it aside because now we need to work on the batter [Music] now you need to oversize your baking sheet a little bit of flour please thank you and flatten your 500 grams to roll it dyed it until you create the sim this one you are not going to elongate too much it's a batter butter are pretty big but not too long nice and I have to create toast into it put some flour onto it make sure you put the sim down and once again you need to cover all that then it's going to rest for about 45 minutes to an hour you need to start your oven now to 500 degree Fahrenheit it will take at least 45 minutes to reach temperature and a hole that temp it will reach it at 15 minutes but it needs to be fully heated at 500 degrees and that will take a good 45 minutes okay 45 minutes later let's do the poke test you poke the dough if it has no force to come out then that mean it's ready for the oven any longer we'll be overproofed this is my tool to help me score the bread I will talk about it on to another video and my scoring is not the best today but it will do and then another trick which I will talk again later for the vapor I use ice cubes that I drop in the oven the oven now has reached 500 grades for a while as you can see I have placed an iron skillet in the oven this is to hold the ice cube and the iron skillet is so thick that is going to maintain the high temperature to melt the ice cube slowly I counted about one ice cube for five minutes and I need at least 5 minutes for the bread on the outside to keep its moisture this wheat will expand before cooking and then on is going to create a crust and that is a French bread when you have a soft inside and a hard crust on the outside all right then so it's time now to put all the dough in the oven there we go and finally the ice cube into skeleton let's close the oven and put on the timer for about 15 to 20 minutes that is for the pretty part and then for the baguette is about 20 minutes and for the batter about the same okay the people are ready let's take a look yeah they look good let's add a few more minutes for the baguette and the batter that will do very nice very nice the sesame seeds are perfectly roasted and by now all my bread is out of the oven we have those two Petipa we have a baguette that is not long enough I get to work on that one but it did expand nicely and you cannot hear it but it's cracking from everywhere and here is our butter you can really slice some toast into it the uniform beautiful but anybody can make some bread without knitting and it will look good or somewhat good on the outside the real test is how is it inside and if you look at videos of people not showing you the inside of the bread do not trust them it can be as dense and as hard as it can be the softness of the dough is what counts and we have come to the end of how to make French bread Bon Appetit Meza me [Music] you [Music]", "6aw0PdsFA4M": "hello again my name's john i'm a retired cook from the northeast of England in the UK and welcome to my latest bread video and in this one I'll be making these delicious but very easy to make honey and oatmeal rolls you can view the ingredients list and full written method for this recipe on the recipe page on the channels website I'll leave a link in the description under the video or you can click on the I icon top right of the screen to take you directly to the recipe page and I'll be doing the patreon a paypal shout out a little later in the video and with that out of the way let's get on with today's recipe right I'll start the recipe by bringing the 240 mils of water to a boil [Music] and while that's heating up I'll add the butter honey rolled oats and salt to a mixer ball this is quite a sticky dough so you will need to use a stand mixer for this that is possible to make it by hand but pretty difficult and whatever you do don't are the other three ingredients yet as the boiling water will cook the flour scramble the eggs and kill the yeast stone-dead right soon as the water starts to boil get it straight into the machine don't hung about because while it's boiling the water is evaporating all the time and you're going to end up with the short measurement so soon as it starts to boil get it straight into the bowl now using the paddle attachment mix that for about a minute on speeds one or two and after a minute let it cool down as you can see it's at 55 degrees Celsius at the moment and we need to get it down to 40 or under remember these laser thermometers only take the surface temperature so make sure you give it a good mix before taking the temperature and if you haven't got a thermometer just get the temperature down so it's comfortably warm to the touch right mine's down to under 38 degrees so it's safe to add the other ingredients and I'll start by adding the beaten eggs and give those a quick mix and if you need an alternative to eggs as our norm any of you - you can use a hundred mils of milk instead but the eggs do give the bread a richer flavor next combine the flour and the yeast together and add that to the ball [Music] [Music] now using your dough hook this time mix the ingredients together for about a minute until everything is combined and once everything's together like this continue mixing for a further six minutes okay once the six minutes are up you can stop the machine and as you can see it's quite a sticky dough now remove and clean your dough hook and scrape down the sides of the bowl next job is to oil a large bowl and set it aside for the moment now flour your work chop right scrape out the door onto the floured bench make sure you get it all out [Music] sprinkle a little flour on the door and start to knead it for a few seconds incidentally these flour sprinkle is a bucking stock in the website shop if you want one along with the door scrapers and the ball proofing covers it's just another way you can support the channel it looked very sticky and unmanageable in the ball but once you get it on the bench or a little flour on it's quite easy to handle and then form it into a ball as shown [Music] right once it's formed into a ball get it into the oiled ball I'll give the door ball a good coat of the oil from the ball that prevents it from drying out and sticking to the cover and as my regular viewers will know I use the shower cap as a door proofing cover it works great right I'll get it into a warm draft-free spot for at least 45 minutes I like to use my new oven to do this with just a light bulb on it seems to be an ideal spot for proof window right now I'll set the timer for 45 minutes this time may vary depending on the temperature of where your proof in your door okay while that's proofing I'll get a couple of things ready starting with greasing a baking tin the dimensions of the tin that I'm using is on screen and grease it I'm using a little Lord but you can use oil butter or shortening to do yours [Music] next you'll need to oil a strip of cling film or plastic rub and this is just to cover the rules while they're proofing in the tin as you'll see a little later in the video right I'll just set that aside for now [Music] okay the 45 minutes are up and as you can see my door has risen beautifully [Music] right off turn it out onto a floured surface and knock it back that simply means force all the gas out of it as shown okay once that's done you need to divide the dough up into however many rolls you make in 50 measurements were correct at the beginning your dough should weigh the same as mine around 900 grams or 32 ounces now out of this recipe I like to make eight rolls but you can divide yours into ten or twelve if you prefer smaller ones no you can eyeball these if you want but I prefer to use my skills to equally divide mine so they're all exactly the same size so using the calculator eight rolls works out at a hundred and thirteen grams and that's four ounces each right I'll let you watch a bit while I divide the dough into 8 equal pieces [Music] right that's the dough divide it now I'll form each piece into a ball you can learn more about this rolling technique in my dinner roll video [Music] [Music] okay that's them all done now I'll place each doorbal neatly unevenly spaced into the greased baking tin and you can slightly flatten them a bit like I've shown in the video [Music] loosely cover the rolls with the prepared oiled cling film [Music] [Music] right now I'll get those into the bulb lit oven to prove with this pin in your oven I'm not sure how long they'll take so I'll start with 30 minutes there probably need a little more time but we'll see [Music] and as a thought after 30 minutes the need a bit more time so I'll give them an extra 15 minutes [Music] and after that extra time they look is all the ready for the next stage so I'll get them out and get them onto the bench while I preheat the oven and you'll need to pre-heat your oven to a hundred and eighty degrees Celsius that's 355 Fahrenheit or gas mark 4 and while the ovens heating up there's a couple of more things to deal with the rolls starting with very gently brushing on some egg wash this will give the finished rolls color and shine [Music] and the final thing to do before they go into the oven is to sprinkle a few of those rolled porridge oats of the top of each one [Music] now normally they each take between 18 and 20 minutes to bake but with this new oven I'm not exactly sure so I'll set the timer for 20 minutes but I'll keep a close eye on them through the glass door and while those there came the hope you don't mind if I give my very first recipe book a bit of a plug the book has lots of our favourite recipes from our kitchens in it and is available in the channels website shop along with loads of other equipment I use in the videos it's just another way you can support the channel I leave a link in the description box below the video or just click on the I icon top right of your screen if you want to order a copy today well looking through the grass it looks like these are done after 17 minutes so this oven looks like it's running a little hot so I make a mental note of that for future reference okay I'm gonna call these done at 17 minutes and get them out they're very soft at this point so I'll let them rest for 10 minutes on this wire rack before removing them from the tin all right they're still pretty hot so using two wire racks I'll carefully get them out of the tin now I let them cool completely on the wire rack I'll come back a little later and let you see what the like on the inside and of course up a little taste I would normally break these off but I'm trying to keep them tidy for the video the color and the texture of these are fantastic and the smell is amazing well here we go and I'm trying these with a little of my homemade butter and these are truly delicious a slightly sweet with the hint of honey and the kids also love these and I really hope

"[Music] hi guys I'm Susan from Sesostris cooking club and recently I've had quite a few people emailing me asking me for my sausage roll recipe so I thought today that's exactly what we're going to make sausage rolls so first thing we're going to do is quickly go through our ingredients and check that I've got everything so I've got sausage meat here I'm just using some sausages that I've taken the skin off but you could use minced chicken beef the vegetarian corn or poor so I'm using pork sausages today I've got some chopped up onions grated apple bread crumbs some herbs some salt pepper and of course and my puff pastry now I'm being really lazy today and I'm using pre rolled puff pastry but obviously you could use a slab of pastry and then roll it out to roughly about 4 cm to 4 millimeters I should say a little metres thick you could try and make your own but even in lockdown life's too short so I use water pastry and I've died the all battering ones because it makes them a lot more flaky ok so let's get started so sausage meat so all we're gonna do is throw our onions into there and bread crumbs goes in there grated apple and then I'm gonna put a few pairs in there you a little bit of salt and pepper sir twisted my pepper pinch of salt until their marvelous and that is it that's a mixture done okay as quick as that so now what we need to do is mix that up so you can either take it for if you don't wanna get your fingers in there but most of my students like to get their hands and then squish it up and actually you know I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do this thing so I get my hands in here and just squish that mixture through so I'm sort of oozes through your fingers like that okay just get your hands right down to the bottom of the bowl and squish it through make sure it's really really well mixed right so just about there um I should say one of while I'm doing this I've got the oven preheating to 200 degrees Celsius okay so make sure your oven is preheating and I've lined my oven tray with some baking paper so these sausage rolls don't stick to the trade because that would be a disaster right so all done just look at my hands a clip wash right now it's time to put the sausage meat into the pastry or on the pastry so I'm just gonna swap that over there wait now roll the pastry nice and carefully okay now what we're going to do is we're going to line the sausage meat down the middle there okay so I'm just going to do it like this I've seen people do this for the piping bag but to be honest that's just one step too far for me just make it into a nice fat sausage down in the middle I'm just going to make sure you mix goes right to the end there because otherwise your bytom's wouldn't it'll be only pastry you don't want that you want the delicious pudding all right so can you see what I've done there sausage meat down the middle all right now time to put this baby to bed so what I'm going to do is I'm going to dish and Wow I'm good paint a little bit down this side just so that it seals the pastry when I and close it up okay so just a little bit of air down the side there now if you wanted to do these as a vegan sausage roll you could use a milk instead of this okay doesn't have to be egg all right so now time to put the sausage roll bit so I'm going to roll this piece over like so okay so I've just rolled the top but over like that I'm here the piece of paper now this one is going to count can you see I'm going to roll this one over like this just Pat it down nice and gently to seal that wrap the page back or roll the paper back now what we want to do guys is we want to have this seam here the seam of a sausage roll underneath okay so this way no I'm just going to look at oh just like that okay roll the peel the paper back piece of paper come out now make sure it's a nicely sealed otherwise right okay one big chunky sausage a roll ready almost ready to cook now we need to glaze the top which makes it lovely and golden okay so I'm just going to take my egg wash again this is what we call an egg wash and paint it now don't slop too much on guys because otherwise it could be soggy and we don't want soggy sausage rolls just enough to cover it make sure you go down the edges as well okay right down into the paper that's it now we're going to slice this into slices of about two centimetres thick you could do them thicker or wider but obviously good they're going to take longer to cook but actually I think that's probably about the right size for a nice little snack and sausage roll I'm just going to slice this into my slices so actually I'm going to use a sharper knife for this I'm gonna get this baby out okay so just be careful what are you doing this just down in through down and try and keep your knife clean [Music] yeah you know this but on the end here we'll just cook a little baby one okay she really because it's been put people in the other bits okay so this is just about really should go into the oven you can see this this but here I'm probably slices up in a minute I just wanted you to see that a beanie weenie bit on there right so that will go into the oven for approximately 20 to 25 minutes until the pastry is nice and golden and more importantly than the mixture in the middle the stuffing is probably properly cooked right so that's going to cook now for as I say 20 to 25 minutes see you soon you", "7LQW3ITUZsw": "hi and welcome to episode number 589 with watts for child , but Leo's are Mexico's version of French baguettes with the trademark thin and crispy crust these little rolls are every bit as good despite the long rising times the recipe is really easy and certainly worth the effort the recipe does require a starter sometimes called the pre ferment or poolish to make the starter place a cup of all-purpose flour in your mixer bowl add 1/2 teaspoon of active dry yeast followed by a hundred and 80 milliliters of water place the bowl on your mixer with the beater pedal fitted mix this on medium low speed and salt slightly combined this will take 30 to 60 seconds remove the bowl from the machine cover with cling wrap and allow this to stand overnight the following day the slurry will be bubbly and active at a further three cups of all-purpose flour two teaspoons of salt one and a half teaspoons active dry yeast 60 milliliters of melted butter and 240 milliliters of warm water place the bowl on your mixer with the dough hook attached start the mixer on slow for the first minutes then increased the kneading speed to medium slow and allow this to knead for seven minutes once the kneading is complete cover the bowl with cling wrap and allow the dough to rise in a warm place for two to three hours until doubled in size after the first dries you will have a lovely soft dough that is only slightly sticky turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface weigh the dough and divide this into 10 equal portions roll each

is the half batch and because in school we make a lot ok it's very easy one cup enough the water is from temperature okay the yeast in this case i usually of course in italy we use a fresh here uh usain we have at the moment we don't yeah we're using dry yeast exactly and we have dry yeast this is one uh okay okay great is that flour so you have the flour and then you add the water so easy isn't it yeast salt really easy and now you need the smallest one yes a strong spoon yes we start mix together okay okay okay you see after two just two minutes look at that you mix together you see simple so it's just stir you don't have to need this one do you no is mary yeah everything okay hook a few holes okay so it's a tea towel that we've got wet and we wrung it out yes just damp um okay hey you put here room temperature okay no problem no no so 20 hours uh is it 20 22 sometimes you need maybe 24 hours because depends of course for the uh okay after 22 hours remember the next day exactly now next step okay okay what's next look at that you see the bubbles yeah oh that's nice i smell it now too yes yes it smells great okay now very important ah let's flour because this is stick yeah you don't want it to stick yes that's a lot of flour yeah cover it up and this is all-purpose flour again there we go okay now important we know we need to push too much just um [Music] put a yeah okay so you just make it a little bit bigger yeah yeah a rectangle shape sorry my english is not perfect to make it bigger make bigger okay okay next step off okay so fold it a third in and then another fold in yeah off okay okay next step all right okay i'm not important lots of float is mini stick put it here okay more flour okay we recover okay okay and now one more hours one more hour rest yes okay see you later all right that's fine okay okay next step we need the the oven for eight degrees 480 for 85 500 500 really hot yes and 20 50 minutes before we make 15 to 20 minutes in this case knees 12 knots so it just goes in the oven yes empty empty and there's nothing okay so we get it really hot yes okay okay now next step be careful because it's baby yeah i can imagine oh yeah baby yeah you can see it's hot yeah it's already it's darker red there's no nothing there's no oil nothing no spray no no okay okay now it's beautiful this is the tricky part huh [Laughter] getting it in there very careful because it's very hot yeah okay so just gently roll it in very smartly there's a lot of flour but that's good yes because then it won't stick yeah and it's just gonna bake in there and we cook for 30 minutes cover okay after this we take out and we cook 15 10 15 more okay so okay 30 minutes bake covered and then you remove the cover 10 minutes yes no 30 minutes yes okay okay okay now after 10 minutes okay okay great okay we'll be back okay now after 10 minutes in this case a bit 10 15 my oh sorry oh that looks so good and it smells wonderful yeah okay now we go because it's very hot put that on a wire rack let it cool okay now we need 10 minutes 15 minutes before we cut okay sounds good okay no i cut this is my favorite part you see sorry really crispy crusty crusty outside that's beautiful it looks like tuscan bread okay", "_U_qCdcnPzY": "hello this is chef john from food wishes\ncomma with meatball stuffed garlic bread sliders that's right i'm going to show\nyou a very simple technique for turning a plain old package of dinner rolls into\na stellar slab of what are basically mini meatball subs and while I'm not\nsure exactly what occasion you'll be serving these apps I do know that long\nafter whatever that is is forgotten people will still be talking about that\ntime that person brought those meatball sliders and you know what that person\nwas you so with that let's go hang get started by quickly mixing up some\nmeatballs which we will start with one pound of ground beef grass-fed of course\nand to that we will add some onions and garlic we've sauteed in olive oil along\nwith some freshly chopped to tell him parsley and one large egg extra credit\nif you beat it first we'll also toss in some plain dry breadcrumbs and then if I\nwas making regular meatballs I would add some Parmesan cheese here but for these\nsliders I'm actually gonna add a handful of grated fontina and by the way\nprovolone would also be a beautiful choice and I'm gonna finish these up by\nseasoning with some kosher salt some freshly ground black pepper and of\ncourse a little touch of cayenne and then we'll get in there with a couple of\nclean hands and mix this until just combined and by the way of time is short\nand or you're making this for a large group it's okay if you want to buy some\npre-made meatballs for as long as they're good quality I think we're all\nfine with that but anyway we'll go ahead and give that a mix which would usually\nbring us to the most time-consuming difficult part of the operation the\ntraditional rolling and frying of the meatballs but we're not gonna do that\nwe're gonna take a shortcut by using the old mini meat muffin method which is\nsimply done by filling these mini muffin cups up to the top with our mixture and\nthen if we want with some dappin fingers we can kind of smooth out the tops and\nas you'll see once these are break we're gonna end up with a very meatball like\nshape which by the way for this use is really not that big of a deal since\nthese are gonna be stuffed in our rolls and covered with cheese and sauce a\nperfectly round meatball is not going to be noticed but anyway we'll go ahead and\nfill those up at which point they're ready to transfer into the center of a\n400 degree oven for about 12 minutes or until they're just about cooked through\nand look a little something like this and once those are said I will do is set\nthose aside and let them cool down a little bit while we move on to prep our\nrolls and we will start that by making a little bit of garlic butter and for that\nwe will melt a couple tablespoons of unsalted butter over medium heat and\nonce we see those milk solids in the pan start to bubble we'll go ahead and add a\ncouple cloves of finely minced garlic and we will stir that in and immediately\nturn off the heat all right because there's gonna be enough residual heat in\nthat butter as this cools down that fat is going to be perfectly infused with\nthat garlic flavor and by the way I'm using butter here but you could also do\nthis with olive oil or a combination and then once that's been accomplished we\ncan simply set that aside and move on to whole our rolls which I'm going to take\nout of the package in place on a well oiled piece of foil on this sheet pan\nokay just rub that with some olive oil and we'll go ahead and transfer our\nrolls on still attached I mean what we're gonna want to do here is take a\nsmall knife preferably serrated and cut a round a meatball sized hole on top of\neach one and we'll go ahead and pull that piece out and save it for bread\ncrumbs oh and one tip we don't want to be cutting all the way through okay I'm\ntrying to only go about two-thirds of the way down okay because we are gonna\nfill these with sauce and meatballs we do want to retain a little bit of bread\nat the bottom so we will go ahead and make a hole in each one at which point\nwe can take our garlic butter and very generously apply it to the inside and\noutside of these rolls when in case you're wondering I'm using some rolls\nthat were imported from Hawaii because I thought the sweetness would pair\nperfectly with the extra spicy tomato sauce I'm using but of course any\nsimilarly sized roll will work here and then what we'll do once these have been\nthoroughly garlic buttered is pop these into the center of a 400 degree oven for\nabout eight to ten minutes or until they just start to turn golden brown and\nhopefully look a little something like this and then before we start stuffing\nthese with our meatballs what we'll do is add about a tablespoon of tomato\nsauce to each one and as I mentioned I'm using a spicy tomato sauce for this\nwhich was basically a marinara I put too many red pepper flakes in but it really\ndid work beautifully for this so like I said we'll go ahead and add about a\ntablespoon or so to each one and once that's been accomplished we can now\nstart placing it in our meatballs which if everything's gotten according to plan\nshould just barely fit into the hole we made\nand as usual the first one is always the worst one okay that ball was a little\nbigger than the hole so as you're doing these try to match the meatball to the\nappropriate role ok the roles are gonna vary a little bit in size as are the\nballs so don't be afraid to do a little bit of matchmaking and please note this\nis a techniques video and not necessarily a specific recipe since we\ncould use this exact same procedure to stuff these with anything we want I mean\nyou guys are after all the Billy Joel's of what to stuff in these holes and if\nyou happen to be in more of a New York state of mind you could stuff these\nwould press trom EA and cheese and sauerkraut and do like a Reuben version\nor maybe Italian sausage and peppers or sloppy joe mix or hay even something\nlike garlic shrimp could work so what I'm trying to say is even if you're not\ninto meatballs you should make these anyway and then what we'll do after\nwe're done ballin and shot Colin is go ahead and top these with sauce and\ncheese and just like when we're making pizza we don't wanna wreck these by\nputting on too much topping all right we definitely want enough sauce and cheese\nto make these moist and delicious but we don't want them so sloppy we can't eat\nthem so I don't think you want to use much more sauce than you see me applying\nhere and then one sauce I'm gonna go ahead and apply some more grated fontina\nto the top and if you never had fontina cheese before it's kind of like\nmozzarella only with flavor so I really do like it here but of course use\nwhatever you want and then we'll go ahead and finish this off with a very\nvery generous grading of Parmesan cheese all right the real stuff\nparmigiano-reggiano from Italy and that's it once that's been top with\ncheese we will finish this off by placing it back in the center of our 400\ndegree oven for about 12 to 15 minutes or until it's beautifully browned and\nour cheese is melted and everything's heated through oh yes that does look\namazing and you're gonna want to enjoy these immediately but don't okay let's\nlet these wait about 5 or 10 minutes to firm up a little bit before we try to\ntransfer them onto our serving platter and while we're waiting if we want we\ncan go ahead and garnish the top with some freshly chopped to tell you parsley\nwhich not only looks nice but it will also prevent you from getting garlic\nbreath true story something to do with the chlorophyll I'm not sure it's all\nvery scientific but go ahead and scatter over some parsley\nand like I said we'll let that sit about five or ten minutes before transferring\nthat onto our serving platter and that's it what we're calling meatball stuffed\ngarlic bread sliders is done or is it are done I'm not sure but either way I'm\nready to try one so let me go ahead and grab this freakishly small cleaver so I\ncan hack one off and go in for a taste and that my friends really was amazing\nright not only do these look amazing and taste delicious but most importantly\nespecially when it comes to party food they are extremely fun to eat I mean\nsure we could have just split the rolls open and shoved in some meatball sauce\nand cheese but there's just something about having it place down in the center\nthere really makes it special and is hopefully you can see here we achieve\nthe perfect ratio of meat to roll to sauce to cheese so I really was\nextremely happy with how these came out although if I was gonna nitpick next\ntime I'll probably just use a regular dinner roll since as I said I chose the\nsweet ones because I thought that would match my spicy tomato sauce but I\nthought the sweetness of the roll kind of took away from the garlic bread\naspect so that's something I might adjust later but either way if you're\nlooking to impress some friends and family at a party or you're just looking\nto make a tasty snack for yourself or maybe your new year's resolution was\ndeep more stuffed breads no matter your motivation I really do hope you give\nthese a try soon so head over to food wishes comm for all the ingredient\namounts of more info as usual and as always enjoy you you", "rrVbZ6bE6dQ": "hello everyone welcome to no fear cooking a new episode for today and we are going to do two loaves of pepperoni bread bread i forgot now and we are doing the same dough we did for the french baguettes a couple weeks ago they should watch there yes you can find it right up here or here nathaniel is home so i'm going to ask him to help today and we did a dough last night yes 10 minutes work put it in the refrigerator get it out for two hours today room temperature and now it's ready to do the bread with pepperoni cheese so we are going right into doing the bread nathaniel we just start please to dump it right dry flour a little bit of flour yes please do a little bit of flour it's a little bit easier then it is yeah yeah for sure not going to stick and yes you're ready look at this [Music] all that martinga soldiers they did a good work look at them look at the bubbles yes it's really good work to do a night before unless you want to do this morning i did one this morning too because i want to have extra so two loaves yes what do we have to do for that cut it in half yes good job you know it want to flour in between a little bit to stay apart yeah oh you're getting very good it's exactly half and half is it yep looks like do we want to weigh in you want to yes why not quick right here let's see that ariel how good [Music] one pound perfect about one pound each bread right that we do and it's okay if it's not even i mean might be a little bit let's see perfect yes you know why nathaniel your your best teacher was what practice ah yes that's right alex practice nathan is practicing today on the bread just keep it here on the side let me flour it a little bit okay yeah that's good should i put more flour on here just a tiny bit if you feel like it and then we'll roll it as you make it a bread and this is the tray we use it so it's about this big it's big that's okay it's good the tray is the perfect size for this thing yes for rolling for us yesterday and roll it by hand or with a rolling pin that's right yeah whatever it's easy do it by hand like you just push it yeah you just yeah push it you pull it and push it push it pull it good job nothing yeah almost like pizza yes correct yeah because when you roll it it's going to but not too thin in the middle yeah so you can use a little bit of pin a little bit the rolling pin yeah especially the outsides now because the middle is enough thin and you just flour the rolling pin so it doesn't stick as much correct very good yeah yeah again i always yeah very good [Music] and even if we are can i pop the bubbles no no no no no no no leave it there yeah yeah because then you'll have a little open area so it's okay it's not even perfect it's still good it's still going to be delicious because it's homemade uh to make a flower dough from like the baguettes like we did last two weeks ago it's so inexpensive that even if you practice on it yeah it's like 10 cents to make like a loaf of bread yeah it's very cheap to do very good so please try it yeah let the young west perfect yeah you can just kind of you can always reshape that's the the beauty of the flower see you can always reshape it a little bit if you don't like it you can just pull a little bit here put a little bit there perfect i think it's very good yep now we're going to grate a little bit of the cheese on top of the dough and then we'll make it like a rolling bread so we'll start with a little bit as much as you want but not too much just roll a little bit i'm just going to cover the surface area perfect yeah and this way it's going to when you tight we have to be very tight when you roll the bread okay what happens if you're not it's going to have a lot of air in between and it's still going to make some air but it's not too bad good yep perfect very good and now we're going to put a pepperoni usually i put about a quarter a little bit less than a quarter of pepperoni and when you order it at a deli see how nice they cut it yes and thin very thin and you just put it on yeah just put it just like that yeah you don't even have to do too much look how thin it is you can almost see through nothing i see very thin yes very good and one more that's good enough yes you can put less if you want to or and now we put just a little bit more cheese on top and it's good [Music] and when you do the second one you'll be perfect you know why because i've had practice yes it's [Music] let the young ones his age help in the kitchen it's a free present i always say that because if they learn as young ones they love to cook and it's a little bit messy but we clean up in the kitchen it's okay good job this is good for men to learn how to cook too this is an important skill for men to have in life yes yeah very good i think you get to put your things out there that's my thing you're a guy learn to cook good job roll it now and very tight just kind of do a little portion like that and then it's easier to start to roll like a little pre-roll pre-roll yes okay thank you that's good and then let's go and if you like to do this pre-roll it a little bit push the like yep and now you go so the pepperoni won't come out the juices from the cheese and will stay in very nice and you just roll as tight as you can and again practice makes perfect and it's if it's not really good at the beginning you'll get a better by trying it again to do it very nice thank you and it's important when you're rolling in as she said make it tight but also keep on tucking the ends in yes otherwise when you cook it the what what happens the pepperoni yeah a little bit of the the juices from the pepperoni might come out so it might stick to the pan that's all and if it is it's okay it's still very tasty oh you'll you'll love it look how nice the bubble comes out very good dough you see when i'm rolling it i'm sort of like squeezing it and rolling it yes good tuck tuck tuck yes and then the seam yeah pinch it very good thank you you remember that from the french bread we do the baguettes oh my god this is the italian bread baguettes but this is the italian baguettes of italy with pepperoni and trees and you can serve it with a little bit on the side of um a little bit sauce now should i pinch these ends a little bit tiny bit but you did a good job tucking it in and i i want you to see the dough here nathaniel will oh let me finish this seam down yeah seems down just tuck it a little tuck it yeah give it a hug yes squeeze yeah all that soldiers there are saying thank you yep with love and love and you can go a little bit like this and now this rises for 40 minutes let's keep it for 40 minutes and i have one here that it's almost 40 minutes and i'll show you how it looks look almost 40 minutes you see oh yeah look at the difference but look how much it rises yeah you have to let it rise because the pepperoni is heavy the cheese and if you don't it's going to be like a heavy bread this way it's going to get light and perfect we are coming back in 40 minutes we'll wait for this one 40 minutes we'll start this one and we'll show you when we put it in the oven oh also the dough here look at these bubbles here look at these bubbles look how nice they come they come yeah they form so even just sitting here look even just for it's an amazing dough from last night so easy at least yeah there's a dough that you make yeah look at this just just holding it all and look at this it's exact how what do you say nathaniel uh play-doh yes play-doh yes yeah and it's fun look at the other one it's amazing so thank you there's a good work so we are coming back it's fun to play with though you can keep it thank you and do the second right we'll come back in 40 minutes [Music] 45 minutes in the oven at 3.75 two beautiful loaves what do you think nathaniel it's delicious i'm going to take this one this is up that's why i put a little bit of the paper inside it's a little bit easier to wash also and yes you can see a little bit of the pepperoni we love it it's yummy nothing would you like to cut a slice and again it's so economically i'll cut a few slices two slices okay um a quarter pound of pepperoni 349. still by more than a quarter so you can use less more look at that that looks beautiful the first one the the ends yeah the ends like the first slice isn't gonna have much pepperoni but after you get past that first one it's gonna be loaded with that pepperoni and cheese so nathaniel i'm so glad you could help tell your friends that they can learn from you now to make pepperoni bread yes and with alba cheese you can serve it with a little bit sauce on the side if you like to and more than that there's nothing we can say we appreciate it that you take time to watch our videos we are sharing recipes that we think they are very interesting and fun what do you think that danielle i love them you love them stuff so what do we do next we eat it okay good till next time uh manja manja thank you again for watching give us a like write a note and if you have an idea send it to us and i'll have some nathaniel yeah the end i love to have it is a little bit sauce it's perfect so again thank you for helping thank you goodbye till next [Music] time [Music] this", "4m09A0zTmFs": "Bolillos are probably the number two carb\neaten all over Mexico just after corn tortillas they are the best and most\ndelicious fluffy and airy rolls that you will ever have tasted and today I'm\ngoing to show you how to make them before we get into the whole process I\nneed to explain that successful bread baking is all about exact measurements\nof ingredients and following the recipe to a tee I highly encourage you to get a\ndigital scale for any kind of bread baking I will link my favorite in the\ndescription but really any digital scale works if for whatever reason you\ncannot get one because the zombies or some weird virus are going around outside, then this is how you correctly measure flour make sure you use imperial cups\nsome cups are metric which are 250 milliliters in volume some are\nimperial 236 milliliters in volume and some won't even state what they are so\ndon't use them lightly spoon your all-purpose flour into your Imperial cup\nand don't tap the cup on the surface keep it in the air so the flour doesn't\ncondense in the cup once you filled it all use a flat spatula or the back of a\nlarge knife and move the flour into the sides and scrape off any excess until the\nflour is completely level with the edge this is the correct way to weigh flour\nand despite following the exact instructions I get anywhere from 100 to\n125 grams in one cup always different that's why a scale is so important when\nbread baking you need 500 grams of flour so that's about 4 cups but maybe a\nlittle more by using a digital scale you also save on dishes because you can\nsimply put your stand mixer bowl right on the scale adjust it to zero and\nthen add the flour right from the bag or container you store it in and until you\nreach exactly 500 grams now it's time to add active dry yeast you want to add 8\ngrams which is what most packets contain some brands put seven grams\nyeast into a packet that works too no need to open another seven to eight\ngrams is what you need if you have a large container with active dry yeast\nthen use your scale or add two teaspoons now make a little well into your flour\nin the bowl and add the yeast eight grams of salt and eight grams of sugar\nmost digital scales have a little bit of a delay when measuring so wait a couple\nof seconds before adding more for those of you unable to get a scale add one and\na half teaspoons of salt and one 3/4 teaspoons of sugar if you're not sure if\nyour yeast is expired or your faucet's water too chlorine rich which makes the\nactivation of the yeast impossible proof your yeast I will show you at the end of\nthe video how you can proof yeast my yeast is super fresh and has been stored in a refrigerator so I know it's fine and I don't need to proof it\nnow get some hot water you want it to be a hundred and ten Fahrenheit hot exactly\nuse a meat thermometer to ensure the right temperature and this is very\nimportant because if the water is too hot you kill your yeast and if it's too\ncold the first rise can take many many many hours now add 350 milliliters\nthat's one and a half cups of that 110 Fahrenheit hot water to your flower and\nattach the dough hook to your stand mixer knead the dough for at least 15\nminutes 20 minutes is even better you can knead it by hand but it's a really\nhard job because it's a high water sticky dough\nI recommend kneading it for at least 25 minutes if you're using your hands to\nachieve the same texture as the mixer you want the dough to be very very\nelastic but just a tiny little bit sticky you should be able to mold it in\nyour dry hands without too much sticking to your fingers pull the dough away from\nthe sides and the bottom of the bowl and try to form a ball as good as possible\nonce you've formed a ball put it back in the bowl and cover it with a kitchen\ntowel now let it rise until doubled in size this can take anywhere\nfrom 25 to 50 minutes depending on the humidity and temperature in your kitchen\nonce the dough doubled in size flour you clean work surface and pour the dough\nonto the surface now flour the top of the dough as well and start folding the\ndough turning it then folding it again about three to four times form a ball\nagain and then let it rest for 10 minutes then repeat the folding process\none more time and let it rest again for 10 minutes after the second 10 minute\nrest time use a knife or a dough scraper to cut the ball in half and then in half\nagain and in half again to make 8 equal big pieces take one piece and roll it\nwhile applying more pressure on the sides use your fingertips to form the\nlittle pointy ends of the bully you roll and form using one or both hands until\nyou achieve the perfect bully uniform then continue with the other seven\npieces place the eighth bully us onto a parchment people and baking sheet make\nan incision on the top of each bully with a sharp knife or a serrated knife\nwhere a cutter and then spray the bullies with a spray bottle or use a\nbrush to lightly wet them put a clean kitchen towel on top and let the dough\nrise a second time now for approximately 30 to 40 minutes immediately preheat the\noven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit because you want it preheating for a long time\nto ensure it's really really hot and add a baking sheet in there so you can pour\nsome water in later after the second rise they should look like this missed\nyour resemble use one last time with water and then add a cup of water to\nyour hot baking sheet already in the oven be really careful\nthen place the bully use in the phone and fifty degrees preheated oven for 15\nminutes or until slightly golden you want the water in there to create steam\nthat's why we add it remove the values from the oven and let them rest for at\nleast 10 minutes I know you're dying to eat one hot right out of the\nbut if you break one right away this team doesn't redistribute and it becomes\nall doughy in the center let it cool down at least a tiny little bit so it\nbecomes an Aryan light bully oh if you have a wire rack let them cool on the\nwire rack instead of the baking sheet now break one and eat it just like that\nwarm and delicious or add some butter to it that's what I like to do or make some\nmojitos for that all you have to do is cut a balloon in half mash up some black\nbeans in a small bowl with a fork add the mashed black beans to the bhalil\nsprinkle with grated cheese and then place under the broiler for a couple of\nminutes so the cheese can melt while the murrieta is under the broiler\nyou can quickly prep a delicious pico de gallo all you need is about two\ntablespoons of chopped onion half to one chopped jalapeno pepper 1 chopped tomato\na handful of chopped cilantro the juice of half a lime and a bit of sea salt\nthat's it mix it all together and serve on top of\nthem we hit this and here as promised the quick tutorial on how to prove dry\nactive yeast it's really easy at the amount of yeast your recipe calls for\ninto the amount of water your recipe calls for make sure the water is a\nhundred and ten degrees Fahrenheit this is important then add the salt and sugar\nyour recipe calls for and that's it now all you have to do is wait 10 minutes to\nsee if the yeast revised within 10 minutes it should start bubbling up and\nbecome foamy like this if it does use it for your recipe and if it does not then\ntry again your dough will not rise if it doesn't\nlook like this and the blog post I go into the details of all the reasons the\nyeast is either dead or not reviving I hope you enjoyed this video if your\ngonna give these bullies or maybe even more yet this a try please\ndon't forget to snap

feeling too good so we took some time and we were doctoring a lot and now we are back and today um tomorrow we're going to some friends for grilling so i'm gonna for the first time ever make um hamburger ones i've made sourdough bread french bread regular french bread um white bread rye bread i've made lots of bread but i've never made buns before so we're going to try that but i had started a pre-ferment i had started to pre-firm it pre-ferment mixture yesterday i'm going to show you also artisan style french bread and uh homemade garlic butter and artisan style french bread recipe i have it's a pre-ferment mixture for eight to 24 hours so you start the pre-ferment the day before anyway so we'll be doing some other videos right now we're going to do the artists that reset the tripod up and show you everything over here really quick so this is a preferred mixture i you know started yesterday yesterday so to make this you have one cup bread flour one tablespoon rye flour in a separate bowl mixed up and one cup of warm water 105 to 115 you will add a quarter teaspoon of yeast stir it up set the timer for five minutes and then after five minutes um take one tablespoon of that from that one cup of pre-ferment mixture take one tablespoon put it in your bread flour rye flour mix it up and then add three quarter cup plain water warmed to 105 to 115 stir it up cover it let it sit now the next process is to add one cup warm water from 105 115 and stir it in here until it's mixed up really good and then you will be adding this to your bread flour salt and more yeast i have two bowls here because i'm going to be doing homemade buns too still i have two bowls but this is just an old crock pot liner okay and here i'm going to add three cups bread flour the s oh gosh uh half a teaspoon of yeast and i believe it's one teaspoon of salt check i'm doing so many recipes two teas so two teaspoons of salt in here a teaspoon this is the okay show them the yeast that we use yeah we get the stuff in bulk from here we get this stuff in in bulk from sam's club which i think we're gonna switch to costco so we have the yeast you can use a plastic or a wood spatula a spoon half a teaspoon of yeast two teaspoons of salt and three cups red flour okay i know well then maybe we should just complete the start over here i can't remix it yeah add in a pre-ferment mixture into my dry mixture that's the oven preheated so i'm gonna put the bread board over on the warm stove because it's cold here in north dakota so it helps to bread to rise when it's on the stove okay and have this mixed together throw it out on a floured surface just knead it a few times and then but don't overwork it because you're going to have it you're going to cover it and let it rest for 20 minutes i'm going to put it on the stove and it's going to be really sticky [Music] okay wash my hands because it was so it's so sick it's sticky to start on cover i cover it with saran wrap and then i put it over on the burnt or on the warm oven and let it rest for 20 minutes okay we're back after this was over on the stove for 20 minutes um have an extra quarter cup bread flour on hand because you can knead up it's going to be sticky so um you can use a mixer if you want to be lazy or and do it in like a minute and a half on with the mixer or you can knead it for another three to five minutes which is i do what i do do it for three to five minutes put it in this bowl here and let it rise for two to two and a half hours okay and then we'll set this in a warm dry place i put it on the oven for two to two and a half hours so now we're back to the artisan style french bread and we have to heavily flour with bread flour and here is the okay very carefully it doesn't stick very carefully roll this out onto the heavy floured surface picking on the side try to not disturb the air bubbles as much as possible just roll it out very carefully just try not trying not to disturb too much of it get it all flop covered in flour without and then what you need to do next is to very carefully without causing too much damage to it very carefully cut it in half try not to disturb it too much and then what you're going to do is turn around and shape this into a rectangle shape and without see that nice bubble right there we don't want to mess that up too much cover it and let it rest for half an hour it's time then without disturbing as easy as possible as careful as possible without disturbing red holes you're going to pick this up very carefully and kind of pull it out slowly without into about 12 inches here pull pull pull so i usually like to use parchment paper but i am out to parchment paper so i just greased the pan then i will cover this and set it off to the side and let it rise for 30 minutes and we'll come back to you after it's done rising yep okay these are all ready to go in the oven at for at 4 50 for um 15 minutes check it at around 13. um i can't find my razor to do the slits so i'm going to attempt to of a slit here with a knife it's going to take some of the bubbles out nice have a bottle oops have a bottle of water we use filtered water from the berkey we are going to spray inside the oven and on the bread very liberally get it misty in there okay 15 minutes timer just beeped so i i forgot to grab the phone and record it so here is the final product they're hollow they're not too they're just perfectly golden brown perfectly golden brown and it is the best french bread you will ever have and i'm gonna be making some i've been got some softened butter here and i'm making homemade garlic butter as well to go with it have a good one you", "XQbZe5Nq5z8": "[Music] hi I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm today we're going to make a multigrain bread and this is what it looks like this is a very flavorful bread we're using three types of flour and three types of seeds in it so there's two steps that we need to do about twelve to fourteen hours before we make our bread dough so what I do is usually the night before the first thing is we're going to make what is called a pre ferment you may know it as a starter essentially all we're doing is making just a little bit of bread dough so in a small bowl I have two thirds of a cup which is 80 grams of bread flour now if you can if you have a scale you know weigh your ingredients much more accurate than doing the cup measurements so like I said two-thirds of a cup 80 grams of bread flour to that I'm going to add a half a teaspoon 1 gram I'm using saf red instant yeast this is yeast that is used by professionals it gives a really nice bread good rice and what I really like about it is that we don't have to proof it you can just add it right into your dry ingredients so I'm just going to stir that in and add also a half a teaspoon 2 grams I'm using kosher salt here stir it and then just make a little well in the center and add 4 tablespoons 52 grams of cold filtered water I like to use filtered water rather than Rado the tap filtered water has a better flavor which therefore will make a better tasting bread so now what we're gonna do is just kind of mix it all together I'm using use a spoon wooden spoon your fingers because all we're doing here is just moistening all the flour that's all i am going to use my fingers here okay and that looks good I'm gonna make sure all the flowers moistened and then stick it over the ball looks feels good and then I'm just gonna add a little bit of oil yeah I'm just using a vegetable oil any flavorless oil canola learn corn okay and then just take your pre ferment put it in and then flip it over so there's a little oil on top that'll prevent the preformed ant from drying out so then just take a little piece of plastic wrap put that over and then let this sit at room temperature about an hour hour and a half by room temperature I mean around 75 degrees Fahrenheit 24 C so you know depending it could be a little longer a little shorter but and then after that time after the hour hour and a half just put it into the refrigerator overnight that's all you got to do so the second thing we need to do is to soak our seats so in just in a bowl I have three tablespoons 30 grams of flax seeds all of my seeds are raw now you could toast your seeds in it but I don't bother I just use raw and then I'm using three tablespoons 30 grams of sunflower seeds and four tablespoons 30 grams of sesame seeds and stir that and then I'm going to add a quarter of a cup which is 60 grams 60 mils of just again cold filtered water and just stir that now the reason we're doing this is we want the seeds to absorb the water overnight and because if you don't soak your seats what's going to happen is once you make your bread the seeds are going to absorb the moisture in your bread and your bread will stale a lot faster so that's why we do this and then just cover it up again just leave this at room temperature you don't have to do anything else and let that sit overnight and then when we come back we will make our bread dough for our bread dough if you have a stand mixer use your dough hook for this and the first thing you will need is one cup plus four tablespoons 285 grams you want ice cold filtered water so from the fridge that's what I find and buy ice cold I'm talking about 45 around 45 degrees Fahrenheit which is about 7 degrees Celsius and the reason we're using such cold water is we're going to knead this dough for quite a while and kneading really warms up the dough so that's why you want to start with you know cold water and then we have our pre ferment the reason we make a starter preform it is it adds flavor because you're developing this dough overnight so it's really gonna help with the flavor of our bread so just take your pre ferment and then we want to cut it into small pieces I'm just using one of these bench scrapers you can just use a knife and then just put that in there and for the rest of our dry ingredients in a bowl I have two hundred quarter cups which is 300 grams of bread flour and to that I'm adding 1/2 a cup 65 grams of I'm using a whole wheat flour now if you wanted to use like have more whole wheat you could just substitute some of the bread flour for whole wheat to your taste and then I'm also adding 1/2 a cup 50 grams of rye flour that adds a really nice flavor to our bread you can use either the Lite rye or the dark whatever you like or whatever you can find and then for a little sweetness plus to help the the yeast can feed on this during our proofing our fermentation 2 tablespoons 30 grams of light brown sugar it's got to work that in and then along with we're adding 1 teaspoon 2 grams again of the saf red instant yeast always like that don't have to prove it and then 2 teaspoons 10 grams of kosher salt so just mix all that together now we're not adding the seeds yet we'll do that later we're going to first mix our dough and build some structure before we add the seeds so that's good put this in here so now what I'm going to do is turn my mixer on first speed like low speed for 5 minutes I do use my timer for this because we just want to mix get everything moistened and all mixed together so 5 minutes on first speed [Music] okay so that's five minutes everything's all mixed together so now what I'm gonna do is just increase my mixer speed to second and beat it for about five to seven minutes so what I'm looking for the the dough is gonna clean the ball is going to be smooth elastic and a little sticky I'll show you what it looks like so five to seven minutes [Music] ok so it's been about five minutes it looks good it's kind of clean it's cleaning the bowl it's a little sticky nice and smooth but what we're gonna do is do a little test it's called the window test and cuz time or even you look at it kind of looks done but we're gonna do a window test so get your hands nice and wet take a small piece of dough and then it's gently we're gonna stretch it and we'll see say just move it around you want to actually kind of be able to see a window and you don't want your dough breaking apart at this like ripping if it's ripping too easily then it's not needed enough because it's really hard to kind of especially if you're new to just tell by looking at see so it's it's looking pretty good it's breaking a little as you can see so I'm gonna beat this maybe about thirty seconds more on second speed and then we can add our seeds [Music] okay so now it's really cleaning the bowl there was a little stuck to the bottom when we tested it last time I think it's ready but we will just when you're doing this just take a bit and then like that try not to really stretch your dough too much so again just work it around this is a great test too because if some people are doing this by hand you know time is kind of a hard thing to go by it feels you can also it feels really nice and smooth and elastic say that's what we're looking for okay so now we got to add our seeds and this you can see all the water has been absorbed so we're just gonna dump those all in and we're going to beat our need I should say our dough you know somewhere between five and seven minutes on on first speed because you know it's going to take a while that's a lot of seeds for that to be absorbed into our dough because essentially we have built the strength of our dough and now we're just trying to mix those seeds in so you know check it after about five minutes on first speed [Music] okay so actually mine took about seven minutes you could if you want to double-check you can do the window test same thing so we are our dough is now ready so you want to have a large bowl and put a little bit again of flavorless oil in there and I just take a paper towel you don't want you just want a light coating it's too carried away and then so put it in and then see it's a little sticky you don't want it ridiculously sticky but a little and then just take and flip it over so that the top of the dough has a nice light coating of oil I'm gonna take the temperature if you I have like an infrared thermometer you just use a digital or whatever you have to check now I'm about 77 78 degrees Fahrenheit which surround say 25 C which is maybe a little warmer than room temperature but not much that is why we start with cold really cold water so you can see how much our dough from the amount of kneading warmed up so now just cover it with some plastic wrap and we're gonna let this sit about an hour and a half at broome temperature till it's almost doubled in size again if your room temperature is a little colder might take a little longer if you have a really warm kitchen might take a little shorter but around an hour and a half and then when we come back we will pre shape so our dough has been proofing for 45 minutes and I forgot to say that at this point we need to stretch our dough we do that for two reasons one is to equalize the temperature and two is to strengthen the dose so what you do is just kind of take your hands underneath and just kind of gently pull it out stretch it and then just flip it on top of itself turn your bowl turn your bowl 90 and then strain it so you want to go all the way around and oh and then just take the bottom flip it over like so like that cover it and then we're going to let it proof for another 45 minutes and then we will pre shape our dough so our dough has been proofing fermenting for an hour and a half total so we are ready to divide it and shape pre shape so that and then you want to flour your surface of your counter very well and then flip your dough so now the top is on the bottom and then flour top really well and Pat it down it's sticking a little more flour you want to get rid of some of those large air bubbles and then we want to divide our dough in half scale is really handy for this you want about 500 grams per loaf and cut don't don't pull your bread dough try not to so either use a knife or if you have one of these bench scrapers like I said about 500 grams light take a little off of that okay so now what we want to do is shape each one into a rectangle I'm just gonna eyeball this about six inches by four inches so that's 15 by 10 their votes I'm actually not gonna use my ruler so there we go so what we're gonna do is take these like the shortest and away from us fold it a third and kind of like you're folding a letter and just press down to seal and then take this and take it and seal it at the end like so that's going to create some tension surface tension on our bread and then where the seal is put that on the bottom and then just Rock take the palms of your hands and just Rock the dhol back and forth and form it into kind of like a little log get a little tension there okay so that's what you do and then just honor you can have a baking sheet or I've just got a wooden board here flour it nicely and then just put your log like so and then cover it and I'm gonna do the same thing for the second one and what we're going to do is let that sit for about a half-hour at room temperature we want the gluten in the flour to kind of relax and then when we come back we are going to shape our bread so we are now ready to form our loaves so again flour your surface take your Browns turn them upside down so the top is on the bottom and then what I like to do is I have a clean linen cloth here I've floured it and that's what I'm going once i form my loaves I'm going to put it on there so flour it nice leaks you don't want the bread to stick and we are going to make what is called batons and what that is is it's kind of a loaf that's thickened the center and then it kind of tapers out kind of cool-looking so again I'm gonna get a little bit of the air bubbles out form it again into a rectangle with the short end closest out of the way so to make a batard so you have that what you do is take fold again but a third seal it and then take these two ends and we're making like a triangle so take the two ends and let them meet in the center of the dome like so and seal it and then take this over to the end like so and again we're going to seal that kind of cool everyone will be impressed when you give them one of these they'll think you bought it okay so sure that's nice and sealed and then you've got the seal down again put that like that and then we're gonna rock this back and forth if you've made big s same sort of thing but what we want to do is kind of make it thick in the center and tapered at the ends and we wanted about twelve inches just about 35 centimeters this is gonna create some tension here I'm almost there yeah that's about right so that's what you want and then take your seen and put it seem side up and then just make a little wrinkle in the cloth like so and then we're gonna do the same thing for our second okay so again seam side up like that and then just cover it with plastic wrap now what we're gonna do is let this proof for about an hour at room temperature they will rise a bit and then when you take your finger it'll leave a slight indentation that's when you know it's fully proofed so what I like to do is to preheat my oven about an hour before I want to get it nice and hot if you've ever bought an artesian bread at a bakery you know they have a wonderful crust and that is because they bake their bread in a deck oven kind of hard to do at home but we can kind of simulate a deck oven and so what you want to do for your oven have your racks in the top and bottom third of your oven if you have them I have a pizza stone on both because that way it's gonna get really nice and hot and that will give you that nice crust if you only have one just put it on the bottom I get to that's good if you don't even have a pizza stone then put a baking sheet on the bottom there well your preheating your oven to get nice and hot I also have a cast iron frying pan on the bottom I want that in there to get nice and hot and we are going to put some ice cubes in there when we put our bread in and that will create a little steam so that's what you do about an hour and we want to preheat our oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit which is 230 degrees Celsius so we're ready to bake our bread so you will need I'm using a pizza paddle and I what I've done is sprinkled it with fine cornmeal you could sprinkle it with flour if you don't have one of these you could just turn over a baking sheet and then just sprinkle the flour or cornmeal on that so we need to transfer the our bread over so what I like to do is what that peel back and then you can use a spatula if you don't have a wooden board like this and then just line them up if you want you know if you noticed artesian bread they kind of have a little flour on top you just sprinkle a bit and then we need to score the top of our bread and we want to do that so that we control the expansion how it looks because you will get a bit of rise or oven spring when we put our bread in the oven so you can use a sharp knife or you could use this little tools cut a lamb really what it is is it's got a razor blade and like on a stick so either one sharp knife or one of these and then what you want to do is on an angle just one long cut like that and that will control how the bread splits in the oven now you need a spatula I do have some ice cubes I just put about a cup of ice cubes in there and we are ready so I'm going to use this to help me Hey and then put your ice cubes in it's gonna create some steam give us a nice crust so we're gonna bake these for 25 to 30 minutes so you'll turn a beautiful golden brown and if you turn your loaf over and tap it on the bottom it will sound hollow that point turn off your oven open your door and let them just let the bread sit in there turned off on for about five minutes so Oh 25 to 30 minutes of baking time [Music] so our multigrain bread is done don't they look gorgeous beautiful golden brown I like the where we put a little bit of flour on there it kind of gives it that artesian look and then we have a really nice you can see how we controlled the cut nice ear there that's what they call this kind of Ridge it's nice ears so we're gonna just put them on a wire rack we're gonna let them cool down and then try some so our bread has cooled down so let's cut a slice so on a cutting board the using a serrated knife they really haven't seen ice air bubbles in there the crust is cut it's not a real like crisp it softens as it's cool as it cools inside it's really nice and soft I love that the outside crust is really chewy little crisp nice and sure it has really good flavor and then inside it's soft it's tender the seeds I like those three flowers it really adds a depth of flavor to your multigrain bread you know it's good on soul I love it with say some butter and a slice of cheese you could dip it in oil makes really good sandwiches and you can toast it so a really good all-purpose type of bread try it and until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of Joey baking calm [Music]", "TWiNsFuYhs8": "hello guys welcome once again to my kitchen thank you all for your likes for your comments for sharing and for subscribing to my channel if you are new here welcome home please feel free to interact this morning guys we will be making french bread now back at home we we eat a lot of french bread okay i come from cameroon where we speak english and french okay french bread is very common in all the shops you see french bread so i'm i'm kind of craving for it and so today i want to show you guys how i make it okay so to start with our french bread we need six to seven cups of all-purpose flour but you can go ahead and use bread flour if you prefer i've got two and a half cup of warm water guys this water is warm not hot the reason why i use warm water is because i'm going to be using this water to proof my yeast and if the water is too hot it's going to kill the yeast and if it's too cold the yeast will not become active okay guys i'm also using four teaspoon of sugar okay i'm using three teaspoon of active dry yeast okay and i'm using one teaspoon of sugar and this egg here is optional i'll be using it to do my egg wash at the end of my mixing okay guys so to begin you put your water inside your mixing bowl then you put your sugar and then just give that a stir to dissolve the sugar and in goes your your yeast we're going to proof the yeast [Music] just let it sit for about five minutes until it forms up to show us that our yeast is active okay let me just keep that [Music] now you just want to cover this okay guys cover it for 5 minutes we are approving the yeast to make sure it's still active and we want to be sure our dough will rise when we eventually use this yeast so five minutes it's all we need okay so guys our yeast has been proven for five minutes and you can see the bubbles and you can see the foaming part of it okay which shows that our yeast is active at this point you go in and add half of your flour the reason why i'm adding half of the flour is because i want to add this gradually and see if my dough is still sticky then i go ahead and add some and also i'll be i'll be needing some of my flour to use on my work surface okay so at this point you add in your your salt okay guys you adding your salt now now the reason why i'm adding the salt now is because yeast and salt usually do not marry each other so you put the salt after you put your flour give that a mix okay stir it well to incorporate [Music] this is a very easy and quick recipe guys but it's so yummy okay french bread wow you can toast it you can make it you can use it for this for sandwich okay guys you can see our dough is sticky so we go ahead and add in more flour to eat okay [Music] at this point guys you want to use your hands okay [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you start adding in your flat okay guys and see your door is firm and nice when you push it in it it if it bounces right back then you know your dude is ready okay [Music] i'm just going to be using maybe about just 10 minutes to do this [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so i've been kneading my dough and you can see when you push it in and it comes back that shows that you do it's alive okay and it's you see you see that yeah at this point guys you just go ahead and put it back inside your mixing bowl and cover it and leave it to rise for about 30 minutes okay guys just leave your dough in it for about 30 minutes so guys our dough has been resting for 30 minutes [Music] see it has doubled in size now we're just going to roll this up okay so let's put some flour on our working surface okay like so guys then we're going to roll this up okay that's quite it okay just put some flour so that it will not be sticky i'm going to roll this up [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Applause] i'm just going to be making two french loaves okay two guys [Music] [Applause] [Music] guys we just i'm going to use my cookie cutter and just cut it in the middle okay remember i told us i'm making two french [Music] [Applause] leaves now you just go ahead and roll this up okay roll it up like [Music] just want to tuck in this this part okay just tuck it in now i've got my baking pan that i've lined with baking sheets okay i'm just going to put this [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i'm just going to put this inside okay [Music] i'm going to roll the other one also and then i'll put it inside so guys we're just going to cover this up and let it sit for another 20 minutes before we put it into the oven okay cover it up and let it sit for another 20 minutes then you put it in the oven okay guys so our brain has been sitting for another 20 minutes now we want to go ahead and brush it up with the egg wash okay this is just one egg beating up together to incorporate okay guys just go and give that a brush on your braid this is just so that's when it's cooked it is going to give you that golden brown nice looking color okay guys but it's optional you can omit this yet but i love my bread looking good remember you eat with your eyes before you eat with your mouth okay guys so that's what we're doing we can feel some french bread i can feel it it's here guys i can feel it french [Music] okay after you do the by by the way i'm already pre preheating my oven to 350 degrees okay [Music] already preheating okay that's a good wash now i go again with my cookie cutter and i i give it some i think it's not working let me go in with the knife i think this cutter is not working because i am not applying pressure let me just put a knife okay just give it a nice [Music] just nice [Music] two points [Music] okay guys i'm going to put this in my preheated oven and let it cook onto golden brown into golden brown okay [Music] so guys our bread has been cooking in there for about 25 minutes i just want to go ahead and test to see if it's done inside otherwise maybe i will leave it again for some time then i take it out let me test it [Music] i'm just going to poke this in there and see if it comes out clean then it's done okay our dough looks done to me okay it's done okay guys so guys our french bread is ready i'm just going to let that cool off then i will go ahead with my fillings okay i'm going to fill it up with some onions mayonnaise that i made myself some avocado some lettuce and some sandwich ham okay guys the kids are gonna love love love love love their breakfast guys isn't this beautiful look at that our french love is ready okay guys i'm going to show you the final product okay thank you [Music] so guys our bread is cool i just went ahead and cut it into two parts okay you can see you can see it's nice and fluffy inside crunchy at the outside okay that's what you want to do for my feeling guys i've got marioness which i made which i need you can watch the video down okay guys just go ahead and put some mayonnaise on the bread like so you can put butter if you want to then i've got some sandwich ham there okay [Applause] just got some glitches [Applause] [Music] as well avocado and voila our french bread is ready okay just go ahead and enjoy this with a cup of tea okay thank you guys for watching until next time i will see you in my next video and if you love what we're doing here please go ahead like share comment and subscribe to my channel bye", "mrVeJMigoHI": "okay another 45 minutes maybe a little more has passed after we did the one stretch and fold and now we have this gorgeous pizza dough here so a couple of tips on getting it out of your container you're going to sprinkle a little bit of flour just right on the top not a lot and then what you want to do is actually invert it onto the table and your workstation and you want to let it fall on its own now this one is going to be touching so i'm going to just lift it and hold it and let it come loose on it's by itself you can use your bench scraper and help encourage it to come out a little easier from the side but especially if you have a clear container like this it's pretty satisfying to watch it just fall away from the sides at this point you want to really although you gave it a lot of strength before you want to really allow it to just be untouched unbothered too much so again this is the recipe that's just going to make two smaller doughs maybe a 12 to 14 inch pizza depending on the size the thickness of your crust you should see a lot of gorgeous action with the yeast here this is the one we made with the pulish and i'm going to just eyeball it in half and make my circles as we talked about as we watched it's always a good idea when you're portioning and scaling to get used to using something to cut through the dough and not to pull and tear it because that actually changes the structure of the yeast formation the gluten formation so you really want to make sure that you are cutting through and be clean with that when you're scaling especially at the beginning you're not always going to get it right so don't feel badly about the times when you know you have like five different small pieces to get the portion that you're going for as long as you're cutting and a good way for that by the way let's say i had this small piece here and this small piece here that came off the best way to handle that is you'll take these pieces and you put it on the ends the top and then when you pick this up and you put it over to start to do that shaping that we watched the video from you just tuck it underneath not too much flour and put it aside that's the flour that we just had right on top when we sprinkled to invert it and the same here you just want to pick it up you can see it's sticking a little bit to the table and that's not a bad thing at all all this excess hopefully it comes through and you can see it all this excess flour we don't really need because there's enough on our hands and on the dough that we can start to do that shaping and pulling that we watched yesterday again remember i said that hula hoop motion and the way you see it and he was talking about the membranes this is a great looking dough so i think you guys are going to be happy okay that's my pre-shape i'm starting to get that any belly button that i was talking about but i don't need to go much further because it's just a pre-shape for now let's go for the second one all this activity i didn't de-gas because it wasn't that big of a piece but definitely you could degas which all it takes is a little bit of pressure you don't want to be you know playing the conga here so again you sort of pull hula hoop motion clockwise counterclockwise doesn't matter too much all right so we've got a pre-shape we set those aside and go from there if you're going to uh do your slow  fermentation you're going to go directly into a like an airtight container those cork containers work well for a dough size like this four to six hours before you're going to pull it out that's so much fun a little bit of flour and you're going to roll it and make it a pizza but you do need to give it a little bit of time because now we've tightened all of that gluten up and it's going to resist us to try to get us that that gorgeous shape okay", "LFWW4NpDZFo": "hello my lovelies and welcome to jake's unique things i hope you're doing well if this is your first time of coming across my video welcome on board and please subscribe to this video share it like and comment this today's video so my channel is basically a platform where i take you on a futor around the world and i you know i cook various dishes from various continents and countries so today we're making um so today our destination is in france we're making a um [Music] french baguette yeah it's an easy recipe so prior to this video let me introduce you to what we need so um with the dough for our baguette i'm going to uh refer you to our turkey bread recipe and i'll put the link in the description below so basically you need just soft raisin flour and a bit of salt and yeast and yeah like i said i'll put the link in the description so this flower was made prior to this video as you can see and i put it um the dough away for an hour and then i kneaded it and then i put it away again for 45 minutes and then i kneaded it again and put it away for 40 45 minutes and this is this process is very crucial in order to you know it enhances the taste of your baguette so it is very crucial that you do these steps that i've just mentioned if not then you you end up you know your your baguette will not really turn well out well so yeah i'll put the link of my turkey bread in the descriptions for you to have a look yeah so i'm just going to now knead this meat and just really really roll it just kneading it with my hands and then give it a good roll a rub on the head and then knead knee knee knee keep kneading so i'm just making one big fat baguette i'm not just i'm not going to like split them [Music] so i'll split maybe do two baguette cut it into two off and then roll this give it a rub on the head and then it's important that the dough spread it out i need a bit of flour a bit more flour here on another surface area and then you know you really keep rolling with your hand so baguette you know takes process it takes time and it's very important that you follow the steps carefully [Music] and then just like rolling it gently [Music] so i've rolled it and i'm just going to place it here like that and then repeat that with the same repeats the process with this the other one and then i'm going to allow this to rise again for 20 minutes and then we'll bake our baguette it's a long process [Music] done you know this one so i'm just rolling it with my hands and by and extending it a bit yeah and then i'll just put this here yeah and i'm just going to cover it um for another 20 minutes and then it's ready to i'll scotch it and put some water on the surface and then you know bake it yeah so a simple i'm going to scorch the surface and then you know grease it with water yeah it's important that you when you're scourging you do it you know the same size yeah same length yeah this will help heat to penetrate through the baguette doing the same with this one yes so i have my cup of water and i'm just going to you know the surface of the dough it will keep it nice and moist and then you have to place you have to place um a bowl of water in your in your oven and pre heat it to 220 you know oven yeah not grill oven so now i'm just going to place the

uses", "uU4DRA00hig": "okay today I am going to show you my all-time favorite bread this bread is this just came out of the oven it's a French baguette and this has changed my family forever we've loved this bread and then this recipe about a year and a half ago and since then we make it like every week and it's easy enough that my kids can make it there's only five ingredients in this bread the thing that I love about this bread is that it's so versatile you can have it just as a loaf that you serve your family at dinner or you can do french toast overnight french toast you could do sandwiches with it we like to cut it in half and make a big Subway sandwich Nega turkey avocados Swiss cheese sandwich we do french dip sandwiches the bread it has endless amounts of potential I will throw the ingredients in that bowl and get it mixing and then I'll start my dinner and you have fresh bread of you my family I don't know about you something that is so simple and so easy I want to share this with you another thing I love about this bread usually when I make this recipe I'll double it so I'll get four loaves instead of two and then I just wrap them up in the Mike strand wrap or whatever and stick them in the freezer and you can pull them out and just warm them up in the microwave for like 30 seconds maybe a minute and then you have more fresh bread and your family will love it so I'm going to show you this so there's like five ingredients to this bread flour sugar divided water yeast and salt and that is it the first part is a divided part we've got 1/2 cup water a tablespoon and a half of yeast and I'm just gonna end it's hot water it's hot water out of the tap I'm just going to add the yeast to it and then one teaspoon of sugar this is divided I have another teaspoon that I'll add this is just one teaspoon of sugar and I'm just going to mix this up separately just so that I know that my East is good and then it's gonna start to follow and I'm gonna set this aside while we mix the bread up in my KitchenAid you can use a Bosch you can even do this by hand I like to use the kitchen Eve because I feel like the dough just gets really heated really well when I measure I try and make it fluffy so that it's not really heavy and condensed you'll end up with more flour than the recipe calls for so I've fluff up the flour and then when I measure it I try to not disrupt the flour that's in the cup so anyway three and a half cups of flour and then I'm going to add the other remaining teaspoon of sugar and two teaspoons of salt and this is a this is a kosher salt you could use people solve this is whatever but that's just a kosher salt I'm just going to use my dough hook attachment and stick on there and you can see that my yeast is starting to visit bubble all out of my water oh and this is one cup of water popped from the town and I'm going to let this mix just for just for a couple seconds right now I'm going to add my yeast mixture that's starting to froth you can see that we're just gonna go ahead and pour that in there and that is the hardest part of this basic all right so I think this toast ready the way I know it is ready is I can kind of touch it with my finger and it's still sticky but my fingers clean this is my baguette cam cooker things I just bought this up in Amazon it's like $13 or something but the thing that I love about this is that it has this kind of mesh looking metal that cooks the the bread all the way around so it can see with this loaf that it has it cooks all the way around which I love so we're gonna fit terms most right here and I'm just gonna spray it just typical you could use butter if you wanted to I thought a silicon map and I'm just gonna go ahead and pour out doh and again this makes two lows so this is a pretty it's it's not super sticky which is great I'm just gonna divide it in half and I'm just gonna start rolling you don't even have to wait for it to rise we're just gonna roll right now and I didn't need to put any flour down on my mouth because it's good enough so I just kind of hold my hand right here and see how long it's supposed to be - the second one and I try didn't start in the middle and kind of roll out and I kind of just tuck the ends under if they don't a little bit pointy and then I like to run a knife just down the middle of it just to get that little extra crease and then the last thing I do you don't have to do this every time but this is just if you have an inch a minute and you want to I'll just face the top of the loaves with egg white this is just an egg right and with this brand you couldn't I've done this before but you could do cheese's inside of your dome you could add like a aged cheddar or a parmesan or I don't know any sort of like a hard cheese and you could even top the top of it with Parmesan cheese or an Asiago which would be really good I've done that before you can dress this bread up as much or as little as you want to and it's it just works every time so I'm just gonna base this around with this egg white we're gonna let this rise for about 30 minutes and setting a timer right now and I'll tell you how long we end up letting it rise in the meantime pre-heat your oven to 450 degrees we're gonna bake this in the oven with a shallow dish of water so the water is going to create some steam give the heart kind of crispy or outside like a back end and the this softer bread on the inside if you don't want to do the water you don't have to but that's what we're going to do it today okay so it has only been 15 minutes and 37 seconds that we let this dog rice and I think it's ready I'm just going to go ahead and gently and I found that 11 minutes and 30 seconds is my perfect temperature or time to cook and ground the buckets off see the Lemnos so here is the finished packet I hope you guys like these as much as my family does and I hope you enjoy the ease and how quick they are to make", "1MwL9w7i2ho": "we're going to make a baguette today that tastes like fish you can see if we'd stop you know what went hey guys I'm the beat love princess and welcome to my kitchen or make code weird

posted videos of it anyway just put that subscribe button ha", "Zrth151jBR0": "been craving this all day long and i hope this tastes like the real thing here we go [Music] hi everybody so okay here's the story i woke up this morning and i had a really big craving for one of the pre sandwiches which has got avocado and sundried tomatoes and olive tapenade and all sorts of stuff and i was gonna get on a train go to the next town to go to pratt and get a sandwich and my dad was like can't you make one yourself and at first i was like okay what i've done i'm gonna go buy a sandwich and then i thought i have a food channel how shameful i can't make a freaking sandwich so that's what i'm going to do i'm going to go into town walking into town now and get the ingredients that i need and we're going to make a sandwich so the sandwich is not really that straightforward because there's a tricky ingredient that i'm not sure i'll find which is the black olive tapenade and i'm going to try two different shops i've already got sundried tomatoes i've already got avocado so what i'm looking for is pine nuts black olives happen yard the half baked rolls and rocket and butternut squash from my mom so don't let me forget that but that's what we're looking for wish me luck so i've finished in morrison's and good news and bad news got most of what i wanted didn't get the whole the whole whole wheat half baked loaves got white ones instead which is fine but the tapenade i knew it would be a problem the only black olive tapenade they had had feta in it which of course can't have because it's not vegan i thought make my own looked up some tapenade recipes and they've all got anchovies in them so even if i'd found black olive tapenade probably wouldn't have been vegan anyway so my simple let's just show you guys how to make a sandwich video is turning into i'm going to show you how to make black hole of tapenade the recipe that i found is quite simple it's got kalamata olives i've got some nice kalamata olives from the deli and it's got almonds in it sister's allergic to nuts and um but i'm gonna substitute that with sunflower seeds so i'm gonna tweak the recipe that i've got and see how it goes we're going to do a bit of experimenting today i hope you can hear me because it's really windy we're going to do a bit of experimenting today it's probably a better idea that i'm showing you how to make all of taco because i found such a i found it so hard to get hold of it you probably will too so there you go gonna learn a new skill today all right back home and ready to make my sandwich like i said i've never made this black hole of tapenade before so you're gonna come on an adventure with me fingers crossed it's going to turn out well i'm also tweaking the recipe that i found as if it wasn't difficult enough already so let's just see how that's going to turn out i'm hopeful so for your avo sun dried tomato black olive tapenade pretomonge sandwich you're going to need some part baked baguettes rocket if you're in the states you'll know this as arugula sun-dried tomatoes pine nuts dairy-free spread and avocado for the black olive tapenade you're going to need kalamata olives fresh thyme garlic capers olive oil and sunflower seeds the original recipe calls for almonds but of course i'm not using almonds because my sister has a nut allergy but go ahead and use almonds if you've got no problem with nuts so really the only thing to do before we construct the sandwich is to make the tapenade so let's measure everything out so the first thing we need to do is measure out our kalamata olives and our capers they're like exactly 200 grams okay happy dose and then capers just one and a half tablespoons of clovers how am i going to get these into here i just want to make sure it's all accurate i don't want lots of brine in there oh no i poured brine in oh my gosh going everywhere mine overboard one and a half tablespoon so that's one and well let's say that's a half so the next step says that because the olives and capers are preserved in salt and will be quite salty to take the edge off i've got to put them between some paper towel and pat them dry it also prevents the tapenade from being too liquidy quite therapeutic think of all the people you saw in town today not wearing their masks okay i think that's as good as we're gonna get i'm gonna throw this into the food processor now all right the recipe says one garlic clove but i always double it so i'm gonna do two i'm actually gonna put one garlic clove in and see how it go i don't want to spoil all of this some flaxseeds doesn't say how much parsley or thyme so i'm going to put a teaspoon in one two some pepper all right i'm gonna blend this now here's my taping yard doesn't look very pretty but it tastes exactly as i wanted it it tastes really good and now i know that if i'm ever stuck on a desert island with no supermarkets and all there is is kalamata olives and sunflower seeds and garlic and capers and olive oil and thyme i can make my own taping yard how's that for self-sufficient so i'm just going to bake this for 10 minutes and then we're going to construct a sandwich quite hot oh look at all the steam coming off that so i'm just going to add on my sorry this is quite a lot my vegan spread dairy-free spread fresh bread and butter on its own is one of the nicest things but we're going to elevate it so we're going to put on the tapping yard next this is really salty so i'm going to be careful with how much i put on it's also like the best part of the sandwich so don't want to skimp on it it's a difficult balance and put on my pine nuts i'm gonna put in that tomato spread that out and the evo leave a gap in the middle so i can cut it in half and the rocket aka arugula papa i've been craving this all day long and i hope this tastes like the real thing here we go [Applause] i'm so happy this tastes exactly like the sandwiches that i love from pratt i'm really happy i was able to recreate it so if you're like me and you miss them too try this recipe out because you won't be disappointed and you can make them any time you want so we've got there in the end there was a little bit of a bump in the road with the tapping yard but as you can see from what i did quick google search and you can normally find a simple veganized recipe so don't give up just because you're not eating animal products doesn't mean you have to miss out on your favorite things it's way way past my lunch time and i'm super hungry so i'm gonna go off and

guys my name is Rob Barrett you're watching cooking for dads today I'm going to show you how to make a great all-purpose yeasty bread dough that you can use for so many things you can do a roll you can do it like a French loaf you can even make pizza with it super easy it's good for almost anything breadsticks for instance here's how you do it start with 1 cup of hot water about 105 degrees to be exact or about just as hot as you can take it ok to that hot water add two spoonfuls of active dry yeast now if you're short on time you only have like about an hour you can do three spoonfuls it'll go faster we're gonna let this rise for two hours or so so make sure you have that kind of time also add a little bit of sugar stir that together you want this to turn all nice and foamy if it doesn't we did something wrong and then in a large mixing bowl put all your dry ingredients when you stir them together three and a quarter cups of flour three spoonfuls of sugar three spoonfuls of olive oil and the secret ingredient 1/4 cup of cold milk now we're gonna take a fork and serve that stuff all together I think it's evenly combined okay our yeast is activated nice and foamy I'm gonna pour all that in here okay pout it and the extra that we need let's stir that together with a fork until it's just basically comes together now either put it on your KitchenAid with your dough hook or pour it out on the countertop and knead it by hand I'm kind of hooked I'm just doing this so I'm gonna put that on low block it down and let it needed for seven minutes that's one minute we're gonna come back and check it and see how sticky or not sticky it is okay one minutes gone by we're gonna check it it should be sticky wet but not too sticky that's just a little bit to see that sticking to my finger too much so we're gonna add a little flour keep the flour by about another scoop of flour in there that should do it that's pretty common for this recipe to add just a little bit more flour did you go in all right that's seven minutes let's check on it oh yeah this dough still will be impossibly a little sticky but don't worry about it too much it doesn't glom on to your hands take a look at that see how when you stretch it just tsuki smooth awesome here we're gonna take some olive oil sprinkle it over the top make it into a ball spread it around and drop it into the bowl cover that with plastic wrap poke seven holes in it set that aside for two hours now if you've used three spoonfuls of a yeast probably be done in an hour but let's just double in size now I have one that I did earlier I'm gonna get that one we'll finish it up with that okay this one's double in size it's pressing up against the plastic wrap okay this is what I call my say yeasty all-purpose dough it's good for almost everything we're gonna make a loaf we're gonna make a roll and we're gonna make a pizza so to make a roll just grab a little bit of it roll it into a ball you can't smoothly but then on a cookie sheet then we let that rise a second time for a loaf we have a bigger piece make this into like a French loaf place that on the cookie sheet then we're gonna cover it whatever we do with plastic wrap again and let it rise for at least 30 minutes before we put that into the oven kind of a second proofing if you will what my favorite thing to do with this dough is make pizza of course I'm gonna do a pan-fried Pizza version here the first thing we're gonna do is get our pizza pan hot I'll put a little olive oil down there that we've spread around later we're also gonna turn our broiler on full this is a version I learned from the Food Lab at Kent Kenji I can't remember the rest of his name but it's a really great way of cooking pizza all right so we're gonna grab a handful of dough I'm just gonna stretch it out okay let gravity do the hard work for us going around and around it gets kind of thin if you can see that or not we're making about the size of our pan there we go okay lay that out for now let's come over here lightly spread the oil around on the pan once that starts to smoke then we're gonna throw in our pizza our pan is hot I'm gonna take our pizza I'm gonna lay it right down in there spread it out immediately we're gonna put on our pizza stuff we're gonna add a little sauce spread that around and you can use chopped tomatoes or if you want now put it on any toppings that you want I'm just gonna use some sausages I cooked up earlier in the day the onions or whatever and finally some cheese mozzarella or whatever you want okay as soon as you have that put together bring that under the broiler the pan is hot is gonna continue to cook even once it's in here have our broiler on it's gonna cook underneath in the pan and on top from the broiler all right so that browned up a little too fast almost okay line three was grab it pull it out under there I really like this way of cooking pizza from the Food Lab because it gets hot on both the bottom in the top really fast you had a nice crunch on the bottom and this doesn't take very long to cook it's almost all at 500 plus degrees the key to a good crust on a bread or roll is to get a lot of steam in there have it cooked by steam so we're gonna get a shallow pan like this put it in the oven before we preheat it then we're gonna add hot water to it while we're cooking it so it goes in like this preheat our oven to 425 all right we've let this rise for about 20 minutes it could be a little bit more so it kind of forms its own shape we're gonna take a little knife here and gently cut across some slits on our loaf and then also on a roll that we spray them with a little water to get them pre dampened then we're gonna put them in our oven then when it gets really hot water and add that to our pan that's gonna add our steam there we go close that up let that cook for about 11 minutes we should be good all right they're nice and golden-brown I'm gonna pull them out turn off the oven we're gonna remove them from this right away so they don't continue to cook here's our little French loaf oh here's that nice crust see those nice air holes that came just really quick like that so that's how you make an all-purpose yeasty dough that's good for almost everything my name is Rob Barrett you're actually cooking for dads cook well it's worth it [Music]", "5lqTY7I7SJY": "hi this is Karla with Karla gluten-free recipe box calm I'm experimenting today on a new roll recipe I want to make rolls similar to subway so I'm looking for a soft dough and I'm not gonna make them 12 inches long because they're gonna expand well I'm have is a glass to hold this down I use a glass to hold down the paper I have the parchment paper lined on a perforated baguette pan I'm getting fit three on there and I just tucked the paper underneath on both sides and then I lay a glass in each area to keep it from lifting up this should make three baguettes are three buns nice size last one right here and you have to realize these are gonna rise they're gonna get longer so to get a twelve inch roll you want to make it a little shorter then twelve inches then when you get to the end just push that dough out of the bag oops like you hear my dog barking in the background Abey Abey [Music] this makes perfect what three it's okay sweetie and then if you want to moisten your fingers have some water nearby just moisten your fingers and smooth out those ends look where I stopped had a little mark on it you just dip your fingers in the water [Music] anywhere you want to smooth you're gonna let those rice", "CSK1rIrEtd0": "Hello friends! Today I am going to teach you how to prepare\n\"Sfilatino\", delicious Italian baguette bread. The recipe is Franco Galli. Chef of the chain\nAmerican restaurant called \"Il fornaio\". Franco Galli was born in Lombardy, specifically\nin a small town called Carpenedolo. And he dedicated his entire life to making bread.\nAnd the truth is that this is noticeable because their recipes They are magnificent. It is a very aromatic and tasty bread, it goes\nlove. Its crust is thin and crunchy. And the best\nis that it's done pretty fast thanks to that part of the flour is introduced with\nbiga of Franco Galli. The one that I teach you to do in his time. Those who do not yet know that\nIt is biga not worry. Above the screen, On the right, there is the link. I will also leave\nthe link below the video, in the description. To prepare the phylatins you will need\nthe next ingredients: 375 g of strength flour (11.5 - 13% protein)\n255 g of water 5 g of fresh yeast or 1.7 g of dry\n9 g of salt 135 g of Franco Galli biga Force flour is flour suitable for making\nbread. Maybe in your country you call another shape. Buy a wheat flour that contains\n11.5 - 13% of proteins. This information you'll find in the flour package. In a container put the yeast. Add 125 g of warm water. On this occasion I used the yeast\ndry because it's the one I had at home but you can use the fresh one The quantities are indicated\nin the ingredients. Let the yeast soak for about\n15 minutes. Take the biga from the fridge. Look what body you have! As much as I remove it, it resists to go down The aroma that it gives off is wonderful. This will leave the yeast soaked. In a container made yeast. Add the remaining cold water. Sift the flour. Add the salt. Add the biga. Remove until you see the particles of\nflour. Close the container and leave the dough at rest\nabout 20 minutes, so they get properly moistened the flour particles. Pour the dough on the table clean and dry. Knead dough until smooth, shiny\nand covered with small blisters. I have been slow to knead the dough 15 minutes. your\nyou can take more time or less, according to the skill you have and according to the quality\nof your flour. You can knead the dough in the mixer. 5 min\nin first speed, then rest of 20 min and 10 - 12 min at second speed. Spread the container with oil, preferably\nwith the olive Put the dough inside. Close the container and leave the dough at rest\nabout 30 minutes or until it has swollen slightly. Fold the dough into an envelope. Close the container and let the dough rise\nin 1.5 times. That swells but not much. At 22\u00baC my mass took 40 minutes to rise. TO\nHigher temperature will rise before and vice versa. Sprinkle the table with flour. Roll the dough over the sprinkled table. Divide the dough into 4 pieces of the same weight.\nOf about 190 - 200 g. Fold each piece in the form of an envelope. Cover them with a cloth and leave them at rest\n15 minutes. Grab a piece of linen or cotton cloth\nchubby, and sprinkle with flour. At the bottom of the oven put a tray for\nthrowing the water. Put the stone to bake breads and pizzas. Turn on the oven at 250\u00baC with heat only\ndown. Take a piece of dough. Form the sfilatino as I show it. The length of the bar must be the size\nof your stone or tray on which you are going to to bake. Place it on the fabric with the stitching\nup, supporting it on the sides with folds. It is so that it does not grow in width but at\nhigh. Let them rise. You will know that the bars are ready to bake\nWhen you see that your skin has stretched, you It has become smooth and smooth. At 22 - 23\u00baC my pieces have been slow to rise\n40 minutes. At higher temperature they will rise before and vice versa. Place the bars with the stitching below\non a small board or a piece of covered cardboard with baking paper. Make some cuts. Put them in the oven. In the bottom tray, pour almost a glass of water\nboiling. If you do not have the stone like mine you can bake them\nin a tray. After 5 minutes the temperature drops to 225\u00baC\nand put the heat up and down. Bake the bars for 20 more minutes. Yes\nyou want more bark, bake more time and vice versa. If your oven heats more on one side than\nOn the other hand, when they have taken color turn them or change them from site. Take philately from the oven. Place them on a rack and let them\ncool at least 10 minutes. They serve for accompany all kinds of meals. And also\nto make sandwiches. To keep them free.

garlic butter first spoon the butter into a small bowl place some of the garlic cloves into the crusher squeeze the handle tightly down and scrape off the crushed garlic with a knife into the bowl continue this process until all the garlic has been crushed next pour in the parsley season with salt and pepper and stir well step 4 slice and film place the baguette onto the chopping board and with the bread knife cut across diagonally into two to three centimeter slices without cutting completely through the bread now create a gap between the slices add a good dollop of the garlic butter and smooth it down with a knife finally spread any remaining butter over the top of the baguette Step five wrap in foil unroll the aluminium foil and tear off a large enough piece to wrap the baguette place the bread into the center of the foil and wrap it up making sure that you seal the ends while step 6 bake place the baguette into the center of the oven and cook for 10 minutes then turn it over cook for further ten minutes and remove it from the oven step 7 serve unwrap the baguette and cut all the way through into slices this is best served as an accompaniment to soups and pastas that's how to make garlic bread the videojug way enjoy", "z2BvjOkEEIU": "welcome to everyday cooking with ann i'm so excited to be here in st george utah with my grandson xander who you're meeting today i am so impressed he sent me a picture last week of my french bread recipe his first ever loaf of french bread that he made all by himself without any help so i said hey we've got to put you on camera and show everybody that anybody can do this recipe and not that he's not anybody but if anybody has a desire to make bread at all this is a great recipe to start with because it's got just a few ingredients and i'm going to let xander explain how he made the bread so take it away xander okay so first you're going to want um you're going to want two tablespoons of sugar about two tablespoons of yeast now two tablespoons of yeast might sound like a lot but we're gonna make two very large loafs and you're gonna add two and a half cups of warm water but um you're gonna want it to be around 110 to 115 degrees and for those hardcore bakers out there you can use a meat thermometer to measure it out we already have it measured so i'm just gonna pour it in okay we're gonna stir that and we're gonna wait about five minutes for it to puff up proof so now the yeast is nice and soft and puffy like a living thing because it is um now we are going to add the salt and the olive oil you're going to have one tablespoon of salt that might seem like a lot but it's bread and bread needs a lot of salt so we're going to put that in and are also going to have two tablespoons of olive oil one [Music] two so now that we have our two tablespoons of olive oil we're going to stir we're going now we're going to add the bread flour so we're going to add a cup and a half now we're going to be using six cups in total but right now we're just adding a cup and a half you're going to want to take the wire whisk and just whisk it around so it's easier and to measure now we're going to take one cup what you're going to do now is you're going to wait for 10 minutes and then you're gonna come back and you're gonna punch it down well we're actually just gonna add uh more flour until we're ready to punch it down we're gonna add more flour until we're ready to punch it down so we're gonna set a timer for 10 minutes because my grandma wants me to show off that i'm in the digital age so we'll be back in 10. now it should look all bubbly now this is this is different from other french breads uh the bubbles are what give it its flavor and it's like it's look so now we're going to add the remaining four and a half cups of flour one cup one cup at a time stirring in between so my grandma's going to measure out the next cup she's going to put it in i'm just going to keep stirring and then i'm going to vigorously stir this actually making dough is very therapeutic you get to use your in your own energy in the dough and that makes it it's called love energy actually okay he's we're gonna add a little bit more at a time this is cup number three right correct okay but keep going mix this in before we add the rest and grandma might help him a little bit because hold on just a minute i'm going to take this right now and get all of the dough we're going to turn it around a little bit like this just like that so that the dough gets incorporated quickly because once you start stirring you can no longer stir you now have to be a little bit tricky on getting the dough that's right and we're gonna put the rest of the is this our third cup this is the rest of the third cup yes yeah so this is why we only add one cup at a time because guess what it's already looking like it doesn't need much more flour and we have another whole cup to go right yeah and a half and a half so this is when like when you read a recipe and it has talked about that bread it may say five to six cups three to four cups because it really just depends and you can see we don't need much more flour here now that we've incorporated all of it okay okay i'm just mentally preparing myself for the fourth cup except that we're really not going to add any more that's that's what's weird about this maybe a little bit more let's add just a little bit more okay it always surprises us when we're making bread that it might not be what the recipe says so you have to be flexible like the bread this spread is too flexible too heavy yes it takes strength to do this doesn't it zen are you going to get a good arm workout okay so now what are we going to do now that you kind of mixed in that you're going to leave the spoon in here and what are you doing next we're going to let it rest for another 10 minutes okay okay now that you stared intently at your flower for 10 minutes without blinking um we're going to but it should be kind of sticky but we're going to put a little flour on the countertop like that spread it around and um now we're going to take the dough out of the bowl so you can see you let it raise to 10 minutes so now you see that it's raised for 10 minutes it's kind of stretchy and sticky right now yeah stretchy so we're going to add in a little bit more flour let's get some flour on the countertop over here scrape this off so that we have the maximum amount of dough we're just gonna kind of punch it down or shape it we're just adding the rest of the flour so that it's not too sticky yeah and for this it's about a half a cup so kind of knead that down a little bit how long are we gonna wait now now we're going to wait you guessed it 10 minutes okay so after 10 minutes you can see how it's already really puffy and like risen up um so really we're going to be doing this three more times because usually like you can you can uh you can wait 10 minutes and punch it down you can do that as many times as you want but for the sake of time we're just gonna do it uh for 50 minutes so we're gonna do it three more times uh so i'm just gonna kind of want to get the air out of it yeah like this a little bit there we go put it in another little ball like so this has been resting for 15 minutes uh with 10 minute rest we've been punching it down so next you're going to want to take your knife it's got to be long and serrated now if you're under the age of 4 and your parents aren't home you might want to wait so we're going to saw it be careful not to crush it this might take a moment okay okay so we've got now two now we have the dough now we have two big pieces of dough that are going to become two big loaves and grandma's gonna roll out the first one show you how it's done so we're gonna basically be punching it down again with our rolling pin and we're gonna roll it kind of flat again and at this point it's really nice and spongy which is what creates the really great french bread taste so you know what and you don't need to do too much of that so now we're going to take this and go across like this and we're going to pitch the edges like this and then we're going to place it seam side down on parchment paper where we're going to actually let it raise so we're going to be making two whole lows so we're going to raise two french breads i think what would work best xander we're going to let you do this one okay roll this out but i think we'll roll it out this way so that we turn it over it'll be a lot smoother than what it is right here okay so might need a little bit of yeah that's okay just actually put a little bit of flour on the roll on the rolling pin and it should work fine make sure yeah okay we're good you want to go down to all the way to the top all the way to the top up here so that you're rolling it evenly uh-huh that's not good there it is no it's totally perfect roll it in the middle so we've got an even amount of dough okay so it's about the same size as the other one now roll it this way let's see we've got some bubbles in it we're still trying to get a few bubbles out it is a little bit sticky hold on we need a little bit more flour yeah all right it's a work in progress figuring this out very gently because we don't want to we want to keep it still puffy looking okay and then you're going to take this and you want to pinch these edges together so that the seam will go into the dough okay pinch it nice and tight just on the very edge on the very edge yes okay okay now it doesn't have to look perfect and it doesn't but you know what when it's starting to sew you can see how nice take this dough and put it over put this dough next to the other one right next to it okay and what i'm going to do now how long are we going to let this raise we're gonna let this raise for about 30 minutes and now after you let it rise for 30 minutes voila what a beautiful magic trick called science so first we're going to we're going to take an egg and we're going to bully it harder than that all right we're going to bully this egg okay now we're going to go ahead and we're going to bully it even more all right so now before we put on the egg wash we're going to go ahead and we're going to make three diagonal slashes but you want to make sure that you don't crush the bread so we're gonna go one oh that was really deep just a very little one two three i was not expecting that anyways one this is the fun part yes i was not expecting that anyways now you're going to egg wash you're going to wash the bread with egg so now what you can do is you can put sesame or poppy seed on you can't you can put it on it's up to you so we're going to talk about the paint so we have a pizza stone so we're going to be able to use this but if you don't have one of these then you're going to take like a jelly roll pan about like this the pan from the beginning so it won't stick now we have this so we can just right to the wow yes okay now we've been preheating our oven to 400 degrees that's pretty hot we're gonna bake it for 22 to 28 minutes so as soon as you get 22 minutes you might want to check on it to make sure it's good if it looks good you can take it out then just keep checking on it until you reach like 20. let's take a look at our pizza stone okay this is our pizza stone it's a stone that pizza goes on but today we're putting french bread on it what red looks like perfectly baked french bread isn't this french bread look good and in a few minutes we're going to cut a slice to show you what the inside looks like when it's cooled just a bit so because we use the pizza stone it's evenly browned on the bottom as it is up here so that's just a fun little thing if you have a pizza stone so we're gonna cut it real nice like this there we go there we go so it's still hot and steamy um it's texture inside it's nice and soft so it's like soft on the outside and like it's kind the egg wash gave the outside kind of nice glaze so now we're gonna put some butter and apricot preserves on it this is how you butter something actually that's not how you do it you're doing it wrong yeah i failed so um pick it up and do it again um that's not how you butter something we're gonna have a lot of butter on this it'll it'll melt or let's this is this seems like a little much okay um all right now we have some nice apricot preserves it's up to you if you want some or not i'll put some on half of it so this is the finished product and now uh don't take my word for it but yeah take my word for it it's pretty good but if if you've been following along this video you can you can spread some apricot preserves and butter on this if you want to and try it yourself", "9lzAH4CBLJo":

videojug way enjoy", "jJpIzr2sCDE": "let me show you something kind of see where I'm going with this oh one more thing it's fermentation [Music] this is easily one of my most requested videos of all time period ever since I did the ultimate sourdough guide people have been requesting the advanced version this isn't necessarily about the ingredients or the recipe well I mean it has something to do with the ingredients but don't expect like some sort of like special flour because that's not the secret to really good bread its technique but with all that said let's make this shall we but soir\u00e9e brothers i gotta interrupt you really quick i got teamed up with somebody new merchants do hate britain so that's that's good very excited about that but i need to know what you guys want comment below let me know what you want to see on that hatred alright so we've arrived i'm gonna assume you already have prior knowledge about sourdough so we're just gonna jump right in now first we're gonna start our levin before anybody asks the scheduling for everything will be in the description so timing is gonna be up to you but i usually start around 8:00 in the morning so in a clean jar you're gonna add 35 grams of mature sourdough starter 35 grams of all-purpose flour 35 grams of whole wheat flour and 70 grams of room-temperature filtered water mix all that together place a cap on it use at least a pint sized jar place a loose-fitting lid on it then ferment at 78 degrees fahrenheit or 25 degrees celsius for five to six hours guys if you want to play the advanced game you really need to get that temperature control well under control make sure that you're using some sort of bread proofer or something i'm using the broaden taylor bread proofer this is not a pate promo by the way i'm just genuinely using this now three and a half hours into your levan you're gonna want to mix your flour and water for your auto lease so in a large bowl mix together eight hundred four grams of nice bread flour and 75 grams of whole wheat flour mix that together by hand you don't get your hands in there don't be afraid to get dirty okay so now you're gonna measure out 740 grams of filtered water of that water just separate out 80 grams of that and place it in a small bowl and place that aside you'll need that later for the mix with the remaining water just heat that to 90 degrees fahrenheit or 32 degrees Celsius pour that into your flour mix and mix that just until everything's hydrated do not over mix cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap and let that rest in the same area as your levan for the remaining time that levan has which should be around one and a half hours you can tell when the levan is done because the top is flat and it's just beginning to fall now we're gonna mix so literally pour your levin directly onto your dough which is out at least for an hour and a half and then using some of that reserved 80 grams of water on the side you're just gonna use your hands to spread that out dimple it into the dough but I like to pour little tiny splash of it not all of it but a little tiny splash that remaining water in there and then mix the dough together by hand good for the biceps you know once that's searched to integrate a little bit I like to use the robot method to help incorporate it better which is basically just scooping and then slapping the dough back down once it's pretty decently incorporated which should only take about 30 seconds to a minute dump that dough out onto a work surface no flour and we're gonna slap and fold now this is gonna take some practices if you've never done it before especially with the dough this hydrated facing and oh you're gonna pick the dough up using your fingers it's gonna stick pretty bad you're gonna pick it up and then you're gonna slap it back down and then fold it over itself pick it up and then slap it back down and then fold it over itself it's gonna be really difficult to handle at first but as you do this more it'll start to come together it won't stick as bad and then you'll start to kind of get a flow going that'll take about 3 to 5 minutes now once the dough becomes smooth and it's not sticking so bad anymore you can then transfer it back to your bowl cover it again place it back at the 78 degrees Fahrenheit and let it sit for 25 minutes after the 25 minutes you can pull the dough back out sprinkle 18 grams of fine sea salt over the top add the rest of your water that was kept to the side mix it the same way as before and then perform another set of slap and fold for about 2 to 3 minutes or until smooth and it begins to catch some air place it back in your bowl cover it and then place it back in your warm environment now its rise a key bulk ferment is gonna be four and a half hours during that you're gonna perform six total folds after letting your dough rest for 15 minutes grab the dough and stretch it up as far as it'll extend without tearing folded over itself and repeat that all around the premiere of the dough that is one set of folds place it back in the warm environment and rest for 15 minutes repeat that two more times so grand total of 3 15 minute interval folds then let it rest for 30 minutes after that 30 minutes is up perform another set of folds and repeat that two more time so you're gonna have a grand total of 3 15 minute interval folds and 3 30 minute interval folds then just let it rest in that warm environment for the remainder of the bull' from it which by the way you should be placing it back in that environment every time you do a fold which should be about two to two and a half hours just as a note every time this dough is resting it should be sitting up at 78 degree Fahrenheit temperature once you've finished the remainder of your bulk ferment your dough should have risen about 85% grand total gently dump it out onto an unflavored work surface just sprinkle a little line to show how to split it in half I usually eyeball it to be honest with you music and dampen bench scraper and dampen hands carefully split the dough in half and then pre shape each dough into a light boule again this is a pre don't make it too tight all right you don't need them type bools now let those loose bulls rest for 20 minutes uncovered we're gonna discuss the coveted Tartine shoelace shaping method so first flour the top of your bowl okay very gently make sure that it's totally coated in flour though then loosen the bottom with a bench scraper and gently flip it over being really careful 1/2 D Gasset all right I'm gonna slow this clip down so first fold the bottom up to the center and then stretch and fold the left side 3/4 over to the right and then fold the right side over the left side and then stretch and fold the top part up and over down to the center now we're gonna carefully grab each side sort of a segment of dough and stretch and fold it over itself sort of like a shoelace pattern and repeat that on the top the middle and then the bottom then carefully fold and roll itself from the bottom to the top and gently lightly seal it on the bottom you know I like to create a little bit of tension with my bench scraper there you don't have to do that then that's that's it that's the shaping method lightly flour 9 and 1/2 inch oval Benetton with rice flour and then gently and carefully place your dough into the floured Banat in with the seam side facing up and the smooth side facing down in the Banton repeat that with the other dough place it in its Banat and all that jazz you know you get the whole gist and then individually placed each prepared dough into a plastic bag close up with the rubber band so no air can really get into it and then place it in the refrigerator to proof for 12 to 14 hours so we're gonna do the easier oven sieving method since we already spent someone to come on everything else you can mean to your Lodge combo cooker if you don't really have one there'll be a link in the description place that bevel in your oven and then preheat that to 500 degrees Fahrenheit or 260 degrees Celsius for one hour I want this thing screaming hot once you get to hear your pot screamin that's a joke dust the bottom of one of your proof dough's with rice flour then dust the pan gently dump your dough into the pan please be careful not to burn yourself and using a lame which by the way the lame that I got is custom made by the super nice guy whose name I can't pronounce so I actually DM him to tell us how to pronounce it [Music] at home play that is my mom's last name this should really just have people send me pronunciation videos like this May it's so much easier anyway thank you Ola anyways you're gonna squirt your dough down the center from the top to the bottom a little over a quarter of an inch deep at about a 45 degree angle put the top on and place it back in the oven oh yeah great job autofocus thank you for doing your job today then just bake that for 20 minutes at 500 degrees Fahrenheit once that 20 minutes is up bust that up and open and then take the top off your combo cooker and then reduce the oven temperature to 450 degrees Fahrenheit or 232 degrees Celsius and Bank for another 20 to 30 minutes or until it reaches a nice deep Brown it's okay if there's a tiny tiny bit of char we want to cook this well done a KB on Qui which is like basically a French term for a darker colored bread there's way more flavor this way get that bad boy to cool onto a wire rack and then bake the other loaf the exact same way as before just make sure to reset your oven back up to 500 and give your pot a 15 minute reheat before placing your next loaf in there and that's the whole flippin shebang you got bread just make sure to let it cool down on a wire rack until it's room temperature please easily my favorite bread to make it don't need anything extra it's fine on its own but a little bit of butter and flaky salt it's pretty nice too do you wanna know what else is nice a little bit of butter and flaky salt [Music] alright guys and that is it so homemade sourdough bread the advanced method again you could see that it's more about technique one more big thing I got a safe yes sir yes sir sir yes sir we one suffers best food video reader's choice that is because of you the only reason that we won that is because you guys voted for me and well I don't even know where to begin and the sheer amount of votes that we got was extremely flattering I'm very very grateful you guys know this I've said it a million times funny thing is actually didn't go to the award ceremony because I'm an [ __ ] and also because I didn't know if I was gonna win there warts coming in the mail it'll come soon when it gets here I will show you you will see it we will experience it together so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learn something too leave a like subscribe and I will see you next time [Music]", "SyxTM9HNjLU": "let me show you something can you see where i'm going with this oh yeah i'm\u00a0\u00a0 trying out joshua weisman's recipe for\u00a0\nthe ultimate homemade sourdough bread hi i'm sune and i'm a food geek today i'm going\u00a0\nto be making joshua weissman's ultimate homemade\u00a0\u00a0 sourdough bread and see how it stacks up in\u00a0\nevery way. his method seems pretty standard\u00a0\u00a0 with the lavain and autolyse. then he's mixing in\u00a0\nthe starter and then the salt. during bulk he's\u00a0\u00a0 doing six stretch and folds the first three at\u00a0\n15 minute intervals then the remaining three at\u00a0\u00a0 30 minute intervals. he uses a proofer set to 25\u00a0\ndegrees celsius 78 degrees fahrenheit all the\u00a0\u00a0 way during bulk and even the autolyse is done\u00a0\nwith warm water and in the proofer. this makes it\u00a0\u00a0 easy for him to use a specific time for the bulk\u00a0\nwhich is four and a half hours. note that if you\u00a0\u00a0 want to use his recipe the proofer is essential\u00a0\nto the results you will either under ferment if\u00a0\u00a0 you proof at 4.5 hours at a lower temperature or\u00a0\nover ferment if you proof at a higher temperature\u00a0\u00a0 these are the choices we have to make when\u00a0\nwe publish a recipe and there's no wrong way\u00a0\u00a0 if you know what you're doing. if you're new

words.\nthis is me baking joshua weissman's recipe\u00a0\u00a0 in the morning i mix the levain by combining:\n70 grams of water, 35 grams of sourdough starter\u00a0\u00a0 35 grams of whole grain wheat flour and 35\u00a0\ngrams of all-purpose flour. i mix it together and put it in my proofer. about one and a half\u00a0\nhours before i expect the levain to be ready\u00a0\u00a0 i mix the autolyse: 804 grams of strong bread\u00a0\nflour, 75 grams of whole grain wheat flour\u00a0\u00a0 660 grams of warm water. i reserve 80 grams of\u00a0\nwater for mixing in the starter and the salt later\u00a0\u00a0 i leave it in the proofer set to 25\u00a0\ndegrees celsius 78 degrees fahrenheit\u00a0\u00a0 until the levain is ready. here you see\u00a0\nthe leman after about one and a half hours, about six hours after i mixed it.\nthen i grab my dough from the proofer\u00a0\u00a0 and add the entire levain on top. i sprinkle some of\u00a0\nthe reserved water on top. i dimple in the starter then i mix using the rubaud method after it's reasonably mixed i dump\u00a0\nthe dough out onto my kitchen counter\u00a0\u00a0 and i slap and fold it to work the gluten can you tell how the dough is getting stronger\u00a0\u00a0 then i let the dough rest\u00a0\n25 minutes in the proofer\u00a0\u00a0 when the time is up i add all the salt to the top\u00a0\u00a0 and the remaining water. then i\u00a0\nmix it until it's incorporated and i top it off with another slap\u00a0\nand fold to further develop the gluten the dough is looking nice and strong then the bulk fermentation is starting. well\u00a0\nit started when we mixed in the levain but\u00a0\u00a0 this is where we start counting four and a half\u00a0\nhours. after the dough has rested for 15 minutes\u00a0\u00a0 we'll do the first set of stretch and folds then after another 15 minutes we'll do another set and after another 15 minutes we'll\u00a0\ndo one more set of stretch and folds\u00a0\u00a0 then the dough rests for 30 minutes and\u00a0\nthen another set of stretch and folds another 30 minutes rest and\u00a0\nanother set of stretch and folds after 30 minutes i do the\u00a0\nlast set of stretch and folds then the dough rests for the rest of the\u00a0\nfour and a half hours which at this point\u00a0\u00a0 is a little bit over two hours. then i\u00a0\ndump out the dough and split it in half well half-ish. then i pre-shape\u00a0\neach piece of dough into a boule i let the boules rest for 20 minutes on the\u00a0\ncounter. then it's time to final shape\u00a0\u00a0 and we're using the tartine stitch method i\u00a0\ndust the top of each boule with some ap flour\u00a0\u00a0 i gently flip the dough over then i\u00a0\nfold the bottom about three quarters\u00a0\u00a0 up from the right about three quarters\u00a0\nover and then all the way from the left then from the top down to\u00a0\nthe middle and into the sides then i stitch the top the middle and\u00a0\nthe bottom and then i gently roll it up and i tighten up a little bit. then i\u00a0\nsprinkle the banneton with rice flour\u00a0\u00a0 and move the shaped dough into the banneton.\ni shape the other boule the exact same way\u00a0\u00a0 then i let the dough's rest in the fridge\u00a0\nuntil the next morning. in the morning i heat\u00a0\u00a0 my oven to 260 degrees celsius 500 degrees\u00a0\nfahrenheit with my challenger pan inside\u00a0\u00a0 when the challenger is screaming it's\u00a0\nready to bake. no joke. i grab the dough\u00a0\u00a0 from the fridge flip it onto my peel.\u00a0\ni score it and then i put it in the oven\u00a0\u00a0 i bake for 20 minutes and then i\u00a0\ntake the lid off to reveal the bread nice oven spring. i bake 25 minutes more to get\u00a0\nthe bread super crispy then i take out the bread\u00a0\u00a0 and let it cool on a wire rack. the\u00a0\nsecond bread is baked the exact same way\u00a0\u00a0 let's have a look at the crumb.\u00a0\nwow, this is a great looking bread\u00a0\u00a0 let's have a sniff and taste. nice\u00a0\nbready smell and some good sourness\u00a0\u00a0 great crunch from the crust and a wonderful taste\u00a0\u00a0 yum, let me just eat this with\u00a0\nsome butter and some flaky salt do you know what else is nice with\u00a0\nsome butter and flaky salt? b-roll\u00a0\u00a0 all right guys and that is it. it's a great recipe\u00a0\nand method albeit not for beginners but there are\u00a0\u00a0 so many things to learn from this recipe and\u00a0\nif you use a proofer the fermentation is spot\u00a0\u00a0 on every time which means that leaves room to\u00a0\nlearn all the other techniques. let me know in the\u00a0\u00a0 comments what recipes i should be trying next. i\u00a0\nhope you learned something today. see you next time", "KyJH_wKnqho": "here's a welcome to the McQueen family kitchen coaching welcome to the McQueen family kitchen today we are gonna be trying to make some French baguettes you know the long French bread that you see in the grocery store mm-hmm I saw a video on YouTube by John Kirkwood I'm gonna link it below and so we're gonna try to make our own French bread what do you think about that Camden yeah this video you want candy in the bread this video has 11 million views so it's legit it looks pretty simple no let's try to make some French baguettes shall we do you think okay so mr. Kirkwood alleges that we need to start with 25 ounces of strong white bread flour now I don't have strong white bread flour I just have all-purpose flour so that's what we're gonna use next he said we need a half of a teaspoon of instant dried yeast once again I'm messing up already and I just have the active yeast in the red packet that I make a teaspoon of put it right in the bowl and then do exactly like what he says and just give it a little wisp so the next ingredient that we're going to use that mr. Kirkwood says we need is one and a half teaspoons of kosher salt now mind you I don't have any kosher salt I have some good sea salt from Costco so that's what we're gonna mix in there and just call it good so finally we need 19 ounces of cool tap water which I am very bougie over here so I used the finest filtered refrigerator water and we put 19 houses in there and we're just gonna give it a little mix now mind you mine at this point is not looking like mr. Kirkwood's I don't have one of those official like scales that you weigh food on I only have one of those glass measuring cups so that's how I got to the 25 ounces of flour 19 ounces of cool tap water so nevertheless I persisted even though I can see it's wrong it it's very liquidy so I went ahead and mixed it up put the top on and let it rest for 45 minutes for the first proofing now I came back in 45 minutes and this actually looks like pancake batter it looks like nothing of the sort of what mr. Kirkwood made so I decided to go off-script to make mine look like his and I put a little bit of extra flour in it so I'm messing up already but here we go I put about half a cup of flour 3/4 a cup of flour in there just to make it look his looks like dough and mine look like pancake batter and so here was my first folding is me folding some extra flour into it because mine was just very very liquidy so obviously the measurements didn't go right so this is me mixing in some additional flour to get it to where it's more like a soft dough and even then I feel like it's still not right but you know what we're just going to press on because I didn't use these materials so now we don't keep going so I'm not gonna make you watch me stir all of this so let's just skip forward so I put the top on and I come back for my second 45 minute break I open it up for the second folding and it's actually something that I can spill out on the counter to fold for a couple of seconds like mr. Kirkwood does so I take it out of my bowl and wet my hands and then just give it a little fold is still pretty sticky but he said it would be so I just fold it a couple of times and throw it right back in the ball okay so it's time for my third folding and mr. Kirkwood has you know techniques of how the different folds go I am not that professional nor nearly as capable as him so I just go ahead and fold it as best I can to make it look as legit as I can like he did for a couple of seconds and then throw it back in the bowl so I come back after another 45 minute break scrape all my bread out onto the counter that's still dirty from the last 45 minutes before scrape it out give it a little fold and just let it make its magic [Music] so then finally because I can't count and because I'm not paying attention I actually come back for a fifth fold because I'm just trying to do too much at home with these kids and I wet my hands I lose count of how many folds I had done but I pull it out and just fold it one more time just for good measure as you can see I've got some little extra grubby hands in there we folds it and then put it back and let it rest so now that I've used up about four or five hours trying to make this dough right you know giving it for 45 minutes times actually go to bed and wake up the next morning so I wake up and my dough looks like this it has bubbled and I know this is definitely not right you know mr. Kirkwood said nothing about letting it rest overnight but here we are so why does some flour on my countertop that's my dough I know it ain't right but we're gonna just try to make it work so I put some flour in my dough is still very sticky so I just try to fold it over and mr. Kirkwood says that we should divide the dough into four even parts he said they should be about 11 ounces each once again I don't have a scale so I just kind of eyeball it and just divide it with this big huge machete knife that I have okay so the first thing that we're gonna do is pre shape the dough pieces which means just like kinda roll them up and get them kind of looking like little baby baguettes so I'm going to show you guys the first one I'm not gonna make you sit through me doing all of them but I just put put it in some flour patted it down and then rolled it up so it can be like a cute little fresh baguette so I have all of my little baguettes rolled up and as you can see they are not of similar sizes but that's okay because you know this is home cooking we're going to cover it in some cling film or some saran wrap whatever you'd like to call it that has been lightly oiled and we're just gonna let that sit for about 20 minutes so after that 15 or 20 minutes has passed you're going to take your little roll dough which look like perfect Scrolls of perfection and just a little flour on your counter top and roll it out you're gonna press it down into a rectangle and pop all the air bubbles out and roll it up into the baguette form and let it rest again now I'm gonna digress for a minute and just politely draw your attention to this chocolate farm that comes into my frame see I get no respect around here this is my husband in the middle of my youtube video interrupting to make himself a cup of coffee in our raggedy old Keurig so there's that please don't mind his arm I could have taken it out bow off or what so you keep going even though your family hates you and you just roll up your little baguette in this little form so where you're gonna put your baguette is on what he calls a baking cloche which you can just use a cotton pillowcase and put some flour on it and we're just gonna let it rest for 20 minutes and then a few minutes while the oven is heating up so this is me peeling my bread off of the Keurig machine and trying to fold it into another rectangle so I can roll it up and add it to the bunch so after we've gotten all our bread on the baking cloche it's time to get ready to put it in the oven so we're gonna preheat our oven to 400 degrees and start to boil some water when the water is boiling in the oven is preheated I put it in a pot and the lowest rung in my oven and closed it and that creates a little bit of crispy steamy atmosphere so the outside of your bread is crispy so I take two of my baguettes and put them on a lightly oiled baking pan and throw them right in the oven because I'm so excited now I had forgot two of the steps I was supposed to score my baguettes which means cut them on the top and then spray them with water so I can have a crispy outside so this is me a couple of minutes later going back to my baguettes letting all the steam out of the oven spraying some water in the oven to help them be crispy so after about eight minutes you're supposed to turn them around so they bake evenly and then after about 15 minutes they should be done and minor crispy so I pull them on out so this is me trying to do it right the second time with my other two baguettes this is me trying to take a knife and keep my phone in one hand and score it and then spray them with water so the outside can be crispy and delicious while the inside is soft and chewy me closing my oven or before I close the oven spray a little water in there so it'll be steamy and this is how they turned out they're not perfect but I'm really pleased thank you so much mr. Kirkwood this was a really fun video an easy recipe it took a long time but I'm really glad about how they came out my family ate them and didn't complain so what else do you want thank you so much for watching take care bye [Music]", "xxr4oedBRIE": "you [Music] so with a ciabatta because of entire water content we do a double time what we call a double play duration so 80% of the water it meets the first and then once we have mixed at 75% bloom development we then have the other 25% water so 2010 water and oil we mix for about 5 minutes on Thursday about three minutes on second speed with our first 80% of our water all right so once the ciabatta dough's had around about 2 minutes on second speed we just give it a test make sure that we have enough gluten structure when we've got a ground about 75% gluten structure we can then add our second a lot of water and oil a little bit at a time it just slows the dough you can take it up stopping every now and then so the dough catches up all of this water addition is done on second sea there's been a distinctive sound change in the dough it's now flapping instead of squashing so it's actually taken up all the water and it's probably the stage now where I need to check it if it's ready to come out [Music] you so less than a fold the lift in the folded under three three purposes it redistributes the heat in within the dough it puts this yeast back in contact with its food source and it layers the gluten so we build it with instructor with inside [Music] you you with your ciabatta dough it doesn't have an intermediate prove it goes straight into its final shape and to do that what we do is we just place pick up a piece of dough fold into the middle fold over seal and then lightly shape the dough it then gets placed upside down with the seam facing up on a floured board or Koosh [Music] at first for about another 45 minutes now Jafar has had its final proof now we just need to check to make sure that it's approved properly let's do the press test you can see that it's bounced back half way so that's ready to go on the other a little bit of semolina on the board just a much stopped it from sticking what we want to do is we actually turn out Shabbat or over while we're turning it we stretch it slightly and place it on our boards so to do that what we do to roll the ciabatta forward pick it up from underneath stretch it and place it on our ball is [Music] [Applause] so I have to buy this bike around about 230 to 240 degrees we I give it a little bit of steam around about 2 seconds it allows the bread to expand a little bit better it also gives you a shiny finish to the to the bread if you want to see at home just a tray or a pan with some untreated chain-link get that hot with your oven and then as you load the bread into your oven drop a couple of ice blocks onto the metal chain it will evaporate we need steam in the chamber for the first 5 minutes of baking so once our bread is faith we then just need to do internal temperature it's really important that our dough or our bread is at not over 93 degrees at 93 degrees all of our starch is gelatinized all our enzyme activity is ceased and all our yeast activity is ceased as well and at that point it's a fully baked slave for bread we still look for the color and we still look to the sound but ultimately if the internal temperature that tells us if our brain is fine same shape as a but he's working with a bigger dough piece you just with the moiled hand what you want to do is stretch it out and push it into a shape or even hands again stretch it out once you've sprayer to for character you can top it with anything you like roast potatoes is a really nice one we placed on top barbecued onions you can do cherry tomatoes you can do whatever you like we're simply going to put some seeds both black and white sesame seeds and then when it comes out of the oven I'm going to brush it with a garlic oil all right so this is around about the halfway mark in the proving cycle we've been pretty brutal with it and would squash it out so we need to allow this dough to recover so it's probably got about another 20 minutes worth of proved to go disappearing temperature alright once after captures have been faked what we do is we pull Matt I like to brush them with a little bit of garlic oil this is just garlic olive oil and a little bit of sun-dried tomatoes [Music]", "yGb-hwg2OaU": "after about an hour you're going to come back and notice that there's something different about your dough that it's really expanded and grown there are ways to tell whether or not the dough is ready to shape and some of the things that you want to look for are kind of that marshmallowy quality that I can see here it's really puffy and full obviously doubled and another thing you'll notice is it actually can you can get little air bubbles that form on the surface when you poke the dough and that just tells you that you've got a lot of carbon dioxide in the deck yeah it definitely looks happy and bubbly so this is ready to shape we're going to get a little flour down on our counter and we're going to gently turn this dough out onto that floured surface we really didn't need to wash the bowl you see how it kind of cleaned everything up for us which is really nice and this is enough to make two breads or one pizza and one bread or cinnamon rolls and bread you get the idea I'm going to divide this into two pieces using a bench knife or something sharp this piece we're going to shape into a traditional loaf to make our sandwich bread I'm going to flour my hands just a little bit we're going to get just enough flour underneath to keep it from sticking and we're going to Pat the dough out into a rough oval shape here and now I'm going to take the top third and fold it down fold it like a letter like a business letter and I'm going to use this part of my hand and just kind of seam that down turn the dough around and I'm going to do the same thing with the other side fold it down about a third and then seam it down notice I'm not using my fingers at this point what I'll do is just fold the dough right in half okay and then just sort of tuck and press down on the bench so we're ready now to go into the loaf pan I'm going to prepare it with a little spray you can use butter you can use shortening you can use olive oil whatever you have you just don't want this to stick to the pan so now I'm going to pick up this little bundle here and drop it into my pan and it doesn't need to look perfect you're just trying to make sure that it's kind of tucked together right exactly seems a little counterintuitive but I'm going to take my flattened hand and press down on top of the dough and what's going to happen is it's going to evenly distribute this dough in my bread pan so that when it rises it has a nice smooth shape this will again be covered with plastic and then we'll put it in a nice warm place to rise this bread has been rising for about thirty minutes so let's see if it looks like it's ready for the oven I already can tell that it's mounding over the top of the pan and it's important that you never let it go over an inch above the pan because that's usually a sign that it's over risen and then you get the Incredible Shrinking bread as soon as it hits the oven it just sort of flattens out and deflate and you so if it's gone over then you should take it out and read it and let it rise again if that happens it's a good idea to just reshape it put it back in the pan and start over again so let's take a peek here looks good it's definitely got the dome going on here this definitely is ready to go in the oven you want to make sure that you've got your oven preheated to about 375 degrees Fahrenheit if you don't have the oven preheated that means you have to wait and then at that point your bread can over rise and can collapse in the oven so have it ready you can bake it at 350 or 375 depending on how crusty you want your sandwich bread to be lower temperature it's going to be a little bit of a softer crust higher temperature you'll get a little bit more crustiness so that's up to you it goes right in the center rack of the oven and it's going to take about 30 to 40 minutes for the bread to bake can't wait our bread is out of the oven and it looks great has a nice golden color but you can be fooled sometimes by the color of your bread you really want to make sure it's baked before you pull it out of the oven for good so good way to check it is to turn it out of the pan and tap it or thump it on the bottom you should hear sort of a hollow sound and another thing you can do is insert an instant-read thermometer into the center of the loaf another important thing is to let bread cool before you cut into it thirty minutes is a good time to wait there's a lot of steam trapped in the bread and if you cut into it it's going to compress it and it's going to seem gummy so you want to wait and put it on a rack to cool so this is fully cooled and ready for us to try yay tastes the best part tasting is the best part we waited a little while for this this smells really good you smell that mmm honey nothing like fresh baked bread it's really good I like to use a serrated knife by the way when I cut into bread because it just works better if you use a knife that's not it compresses it down too it can squish it let's take a slice here oh it's pretty inside it's got nice even structure on the inside nice crumb no big holes for you thank you and for me right this is where it butters good cheese Janne just plain bread a purist yet hmm that's delicious mm-hmm", "Cq-PmjFdFf4": "okay morning this is another installment of the wagga preparation from webrick am calm no no common in the peanut gallery this is the dough that we made in no no the in part one we made it balls down that hasn't been filled yet then we let the dough rest now we're going to form the baguette Frankie shush so after the dough is rested we're going to form the baguette and then let it proof here's the technique you won't like focusing on that go take the round ball swish it flat cut up cut it in half then roll the two ends to the middle so it's pretty much the same technique julia child uses in the way to cook we're going to repeat that cut a groove in the middle that's how it's making forming a baguette so now it's almost out to shape I'm going to make this into a 15 inch long wolf the dough is about 500 grams by the time it finishes cooking it will be a pound we take one end to the middle Frankie I just need to tell you something now this is about 15 inches all we're going to do now is cut it with flower on the top of kinder you don't have to pinch the seams like Julia Child says you need to because its moist enough it will just close up on its own and that's it we're going to let it rest for 10 minutes pop it in a baguette pan and cook it oh dear Lord set the timer for about 12 minutes and then we'll cook perfect that's it thanks for watching it's been a weber camp production and thanks for filming", "vSnAjDJy_4s": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music]", "av2xoc4B8ok": "thank you so much for all your requests for different bread recipes this time the dinner it's a French baguette I am obsessed [Music] there's nothing quite like I spent 8 years trying to perfect the perfect back yet you don't have to do that though the thing that's really interesting about bread is that each person makes it slightly different you get a chance to experiment and find the bread you like and baguettes is a great way to do it so with this process what you're trying to achieve is a sour ish toast balanced with that wonderful French bread flavor and to do that this is what you'll need 600 grams of strong bread flour I can't stress enough how important it is to get the best flour before for this better the flour the better your baguette will be 10 grams of salt 200 ml water an extra 100 mil of warm water and you'll also need 2 different types of yeast 111 which is a starter mixed with water and flour cup of each left to bubble against provi and to a foolish which is easy bake east add it to a cup of flour and water now I've had to do the leaven earlier because as it's wild ease didn't take a while to get bubbling what you do is you mix 1 cup of flour 1 cup of water and one cup of your starter do that the night before possibly early in the morning and you want to make your pooch just before you're ready to make your baguette 1 cup of flour 1 cup of water into a bowl with a whisk take your 10 grams of easy-bake east and add it to the flour and the water and let it start doing its thing that happened very quickly so in the meantime stop combining some of your other ingredients take your flour market and you're 11 you want to test to see if it's ready take a teaspoon of it and drop it in some water if it floats it's ready to go in pop that into the flour that's all good very very dry then agile 200ml water here we go they start to get a little sticky now you'll notice I'm not needing this it's actually there's very little meeting to be done I'll show you as the flour absorbs all the water is actually quite dry it's almost like a crumbly pastry at moment that's a good thing because we're going to be adding more liquid and we have a lovely a couple of French baguettes just sit in the Sun and join some wetland with right as we be bringing that together you'll notice the Polish has really started going public take it all up just bash it onto the dough you've been working so now work that into the dough while DS is more delicate than the easy-bake yeast and if you're whacking them together easy make yourself takes over it doesn't let the wild beast do its thing maybe you're wondering why is he banging on about the water so much he's because you're aiming for about a 60% hydration rate what's that you say roughly speaking you're saying if you've got a kilogram of flour you want six hundred mil of water I wouldn't get too hung up about it anywhere between 50 and 60% what we're gonna do is where I'll leave that for his first proof now you probably notice that I haven't added the salt yet now this is a slow process you'll need to prove this several times and this is just the first proof if we add the salt to the start the gluten to the bread start disintegrating and by the time you get to bake it grab yourself a t-tail I'm gonna leave it in temperature only two minutes I'll show you what this is for later that has doubled in size what I've got here is a hundred ml of water teaspoon and my 10 grams of salt add the salt for the water even a good stir Biglia salty solution already simply add this salt solution to our don't get your fingers stuck in there it's gonna feel really weird for a while while that doughnut orbs the water salt hello way of kenny yeast especially wild yeast so what we wanted to do is give it a chance to really develop in the bread before we put the salt in what's rich rich rich rich rich rich rich that's normal that way it's like weird strangelet now mix it for about ten minutes I actually worked in a French bakery when I was a teenager who is this Englishman I love the smell of this stuff way the texture was a bit weird gooey about 10 minutes don't start to look like that thing now the next process is pretty simple I'm gonna leave mine at room temperature every 20 minutes I'm going to come back and I'm not going to need it I'm gonna grab hold of the bottom today I'm gonna and then I'm gonna leave it again about four or five times then ready to make into baguettes well but then all right [Music] that's been proving now for the last four hours and beside that it's really fantastic it's got an elastic it's gone bubbly it smells or really sort of complex the next thing to do is to start shaping baguettes and just tease your dough out onto the table there we go use your scraper put this into four so next take some flour whack it on the table when you put a piece of dough onto the flour where the flour is touching the dough that's gonna be the outside of the baguette if you don't have tension in the outside of your baguette it won't have that wonderful crust when you slice it it rises in the oven take your outside and you fold it into the middle like so and then stretch it out of it it hold it from the top to the bottom okay now take your hands and push in and hole it's your first level for tensioning okay boom into the middle boom into the middle fold over the top fold in again there we go okay so I've you've done the first bit of tensioning roll it and tuck your fingers underneath to add that extra bit of tension on the dough I love the way this stuff filled with this stage it's much soft is silky and full of bubbles we're just gonna roll now take your hands and put them at this angle now a little bit of a tapered end okay that's looking like a pretty good guy now the shaping process is actually quite complicated I found the cheaper and it's this this is a piece of corrugated steel for shaping my baguettes with the added bonus that once they're shaped and they've had their final proof you just stick the whole thing in the oven it bakes in that perfect I love shortcut now you don't have to use the corrugated steel train you can just use a flat paper your baguette will have a flat bottom you can tank that's something to work on take your baguette you pop it on your baking tray allow a little bit of room on either side because it's gonna prove again there's our baguette sat on their tray we need to score them every good Baggett has scoring down it did you know that actually the scoring can be used to identify the maker of the thread that's right look factoid for you be confident [Music] a little bit of semolina flour the extra rustic look moving ourselves nice big plastic baggie and fine yet I never find the end of these things no make sure it doesn't touch their bread bread now we will leave that for about 20 minutes to their final proof in the meantime with us or the other it needs to be on hot as you can get it usually around 220 degrees many to bake for about 25 minutes I've also put a tray full of water in the oven at the bottom with a cloth and it's create lots of steam now baguettes really need steam when they're baking they should have proved up nicely looking something like this ready to go in the oven they're baked they and here we have it Oh smells so French haha crusty on the outside soft and fluffy inside you can have it with a meal you can have it on its own with some butter they make some sandwiches out of it whatever you do enjoy it yeah you", "uTj0yXVDNns": "Yo, Nflated, spice that

Kobe Bryant, R.I.P. 24", "n-dBM7d2uLM": "hi I'm Krista with the big family homestead and today I'm going to show you how to make no yeast bread now this is not to be confused with Irish soda bread this is not that because with Irish soda bread you use baking soda with a with this no yeast bread we're using baking powder and a milk product to make that activation of the the bubbliness to make this rise now four ingredients we have four cups of plain flour can be all-purpose it can be bread flour then we have 1 teaspoon of salt 2 teaspoons of baking powder and a cup and 1/3 of buttermilk now if you don't have buttermilk don't worry I'm going to show you how to make a quick way to have a buttermilk alternative so we have a cup and a third of just whole milk regular milk and we're gonna take just a splash of white vinegar into that milk and give it a good stir now this is going to curdle the milk just a little bit and give it a sour flavor that is what the buttermilk is now all we need to do is mix our dry ingredients together our four cups of flour our 2 teaspoons of baking powder not baking soda baking powder and 1 teaspoon of salt just mix that up really well now we're gonna go ahead and add our milk in here and give it a good stir and get it all well combined alright so this is the consistency you're looking for if it does start to be a little bit dry you can add a little bit a splash of milk but this is what we're looking for we're gonna turn this out and give it a little knead on a floured set or surface [Music] not too much of a need because not too much of a need don't need it too much because you don't want a tough dough the more you need it the tougher and harder the bread will be so we're just gonna need it just a little bit just like that and then we're gonna Pat it down just a little bit so that has about an inch inch and a half in height like a really big biscuit now before we put this in the oven we're gonna go ahead and score the top just make a nice big cross on the top that way it will bake evenly now into a 375-degree oven we're gonna kick it cook it on a pizza stone but you don't need to do that you can cook it on a regular baking sheet and we'll bake that for 35 minutes until it's lightly golden brown all right so we're waited our time let's check this out oh boy and look at that very carefully not touching that stone that looks so good YUM all right let's get a slice of this look at that that looks really good now no warm bread is complete without a slab of butter or some jam or some honey but oh man I cannot wait that looks so good mmm really good hmm now this is a fantastic bread it is a bit dry so adding it to us you know having it with a stew or with butter or jam is a great thing this is super fast super easy last-second bread you know if you needed something for a quick dinner that's it super easy I'm Kristen with the big family homestead and don't forget we have tons of other bread videos that you can check out to learn how to make bread and you have an amazing and blessed day [Music]", "fjX4sllMers": "hey y'all welcome back to christian live acres in today's video i'm going to show you how to make homemade french bread the easy way i will leave the full recipe in the description box below so let's just go ahead and get started you're going to add warm water hot to the touch but not hot enough to kill your yeast so it's about two and three quarters that i have here i'm just going to put that in my mixing bowl and then you want to add your sugar so i've got about four teaspoons of sugar and let me grab something to stir that with because you want your sugar to evaporate a little bit into your water all right and then you're going to add your yeast you want to add between two and a half teaspoons to three if your packet only has two and a half they all come in different sizes depending on the brand so you just kind of i'll show you how you know if it's good to go but it's active dry yeast all right so i'm going to go ahead and mix that up you can smell it it's definitely active i'm going to let that sit for i don't know 20 30 seconds and it should start to foam if it starts to foam then you'll know it's good and active if it doesn't foam then it's expired and it's no longer good so it's starting to bubble and foam a little bit let me just give it a few more minutes uh and then after that we're going to add about three quarters of the total amount of flour so if you're starting with six cups then i would probably add maybe like four and a half ish um but let's go ahead and check this and make sure that our yeast is good and yet active and ready to go all right so it's bubbling a little bit but it's not foaming quite as much as i think it needs to so i'm going to grab another packet and just add a tiny bit more because this is really important if you don't get this step right you might as well just stop there and not waste any more ingredients because the sugar and the warm water help activate the yeast if your yeast is no good and it's not foaming and bubbling like it should then the rest of the recipe is not going to work so you really want to make sure you start appropriately all right so i don't know if y'all can see this but now we're getting some bubbling and some foaming which is exactly what we're looking for and this point we're going to add the flour when i say adding three quarters of the total flour add it slowly and stir so i've got some flour here that is pre-packaged for my long-term food storage and um [Music] it was actually packaged about nine months ago and i always try to go from my oldest food which it's not old but oldest to newest so that i'm constantly rotating my food storage so out of this two cups i'm gonna do about half of this and stir it in all right i'm gonna add about well i guess the other cup and this recipe will make two pretty decent sized loafs i believe it's gonna be about one and a half to one three quarter pounds total so these are good size something similar to what you'd find in your local grocery store all right so we're getting this all stirred up and then we're going to continue to add our flour so this that was a two cup long-term food storage this is four so we're gonna open this one up and add maybe about half that makes it about four just you know i'm eyeballing it so it doesn't need to be exact you just want to make sure that it doesn't get too dry because it's much easier to add more you can't take it away let's not want to come out [Applause] you always want to make sure that you add um your salt last which is what i have right here four teaspoons of the kosher sea salt because yeast and salt aren't they're not best friends but they're not uh they don't like each other so you want to get this good mix before you add the salt so you don't deactivate your yeast so this is getting to a pretty good consistency but it's definitely still doughy so i need to add more flour like i said this is about six cups you always want to have a little more on hand just in case it's too doughy otherwise you're going to get kind of soppy bread and nobody wants that i may do a little um cut in the video so i don't bore y'all with my stirring and mixing [Music] it's very important though to get all these ingredients incorporated together because after we add the salt the next step will be to let it rise and rest and it won't do it properly if you don't have everything mixed together properly all right so i'm going to get a little more flour in there and then i'm going to knead it with my hands [Applause] that's probably good and then you also want a little extra flour to be able to put down in your counter or parchment paper and for your rolling pin in a later step so and you know flour is not expensive even these days with the way the world's going it's pretty reasonable so it's always better to have a little extra than not enough all right so now i'm going to add the salt i have pulled the dough out of the bowl and i'm going to flour my hands pretty heavily which is why i wore a white shirt i need to get myself an apron but um you want to just knead this together to make sure all the ingredients are well distributed you just kind of want to do this until it's sponge like like your kitchen sponge you can kind of push on it and it re-expands like it's doing here so that's about a good spot so we're going to go ahead and take it maybe and get this off of here and put it back in the bowl with a little bit of flour on the bottom so it doesn't completely stick and then cover it and give it about 20 30 minutes or so to finish rising and we'll go from there so my dough has risen and have covered my hands in flour so i'm gonna go ahead and put this on a floured surface you can put it directly in your counter with flour but my counter it's another whole story it's a whole nother video it's a hot mess right now so we're not gonna do that but we're just gonna roll this continually adding some flour either right to the dough or to your rolling pin doesn't matter either way okay so the goal is just to get this song rolled out in a asymmetrical or even way it's uh not the easiest thing in the world and it doesn't have to be perfect because it's homemade and that's what makes it awesome all right just about there you want it to be somewhat even so that some are burnt right out and others are still deli it's very important okay and it looks like my dog wants to come inside so i'll be right back the dough is pretty well rolled out so you can take whatever you want to do split it in somewhat half and then you're going to take one side and just start rolling and if there's any pieces at the end that are smaller you want to kind of put those into the end otherwise they're going to burn okay so you can take either parchment paper or if you have a um i don't know what do they call it we have a silicone baking sheet that's what i use that way it doesn't stick and you don't need any extra additional oil just tuck these ends in put them over here on my baking sheet you can make this into one large one if you'd like i like to do it in two sometimes i'll freeze one but we like bread so much that we usually go through them pretty quickly all right so i've got the oven preheated 375 if this is optional but if you want to do an egg wash it's one egg with about a tablespoon of water i've already mixed it up i've got i lost the handle to my my little thingy i can't remember what's called like a pastry thing i don't know bakery something pastry brush maybe then i like to do this again about 10 minutes before it's done you don't have to this whole step is optional i happen to have chickens and ducks so i have a large amount of eggs at my disposal if you do not just skip it and you know if you don't and you do want a little bit of that crispiness at the end you can always not at this point but towards the end maybe five minutes before it's done use a pastry brush like this and take a little bit of butter and just kind of soak down the top and the ends it'll give you a similar result this is just my favorite way of doing it i like to make sure it's all in the creases and then i've got the other part that i will use when it's almost done so let's go ahead and put it in the oven and i'll see you in 20 minutes all right so it's been 20 minutes let's pull out the bread it looks delicious let me grab a knife and we'll go ahead and slice it it's going to be hot but i'm going to go ahead and lift it off of here my bread knife is in the dishwasher so i'm just using a regular knife oh it's like perfectly done okay i'm just gonna put a little sliver of butter because i love butter on my hot bread butter and bacon makes everything better all right here we go hopefully i don't burn myself um [Music] i hope you all enjoyed the video [Music] i'm gonna eat some bread now please hit that like button and subscribe if you have not yet until next time i'll see y'all later", "vRVKA371bAs": "[Music] the kitchen island it's that magical place where everybody seems to congregate which is why I was really excited to spend an afternoon at my friend Alex's House whipping up some delicious dishes but I also invited more of my friends to join in today we are learning how to make an authentic French baguette from Ashley's friend seemed Rina and let me guess you wanted to speak in French the entire time I did but I also translated it for you come on just watch Bonjour c'est Mon Ami sampling ever multi coma effective BAM or should we maxi simply thank you for having me for those of you who don't speak French this is my friend Sandrine and she's gonna show us how to make bread today and not just any bread this is an authentic French baguette thank you so much for joining me thank you for having me why did you first start really making French baguettes I started out maybe eight years ago when we moved from France and I wasn't able to find any good baguette that wasn't too expensive or with a long list of ingredients that I couldn't even read so yeah so do you like that you started and this is the best baguette recipe that you've ever kind of come across you've sort of perfected it a little bit over the years to make it really from yes the best but must have old the easiest one all right well let's get started what's the first step so the first step is just you're gonna pour some you just need like four ingredients so water flour yeast and salt okay that's it and we'll have the ingredients posted online too so you can make this bread later yes sure so you just pour some one cup in a sort of water lukewarm water let you take from tap water just make sure it's lukewarm yes mm-hmm why does it have to be warm it's going to be necessary to activate the yeast so then you're gonna take one teaspoon two teaspoons of dry active yeast this is dry active yeah how many two teaspoons I mean if it's not exact proportions that's sorry like it's a very forgiving recipe this is the forgiveness already so there's the and then you don't use any other bowl you just pour the flour so to cup and a half flour shook up in this regular flour regular all-purpose flour try to find like them the best parts you can but all-purpose does do the job now you just add one teaspoon of salt on top of it how did you make bread when you were in France to know you know in France like the our bakery's at every corner so you don't really make your bread it's like it's a skill that is very important and when you know how to do it you're like finally I have French baguette yes now I have all the ingredients yeah all the ingredients so you take a spatula and you just mix to have a nice and a nice dough that's perfect it's for the dough and then now what then you're just gonna put a table on top and let it sit for about one hour an hour and a half oh my gosh that looks amazing okay so I've got my dough and it's already risen now what now you can shape them thank you and baguette yep using this tray so you can find this tray online pretty easily it's like it's called like baguette tray I guess I get tray all that I don't know exactly and is this what they use in France - are they like professional bakeries yes they're really like the and the results that you get it's very similar to what you find in a in a regular baker in France so and you mentioned if you don't want to have a pan so yeah if you still want to make this recipe but I don't want to invest in this you can totally use a regular like bread loaf pan that works well take a little bit of flour - so your hands won't get too sticky with them though like this yes and with just you just take the whole dough and just shape it so it won't it doesn't get too sticky okay this is like so I want to take all of it out yeah okay and you will divide it into pieces okay and maybe use a little bit a little bit more flour and put some one for me sure okay I can't do it yeah you do good with you and I'm just gonna kind of roll it out mm-hmm Dre just use my hands I put it on there we can use your hands or I have a friend actually that do it without even touching the dough like she keep the spatula divide it and put it like just like that and the results are amazing so it's really and it's really it's whatever art you want to make this right okay exactly do I have it it's perfect it's perfect because we started in French okay so I put it on the pan now yeah you can put it in the middle and I'm gonna do the same here okay there you go and then just sprinkle a little flour on top and it's nice when you pre deal then to put a tray will fill with water to give some steam in them in the oven and it will give a nice crust to your emo hope to sort of that correct order perfect and how long does it need to bake it depends on your oven but I would say at least 30 minutes and voila voila voila that was so it was so easy really I thought really is it release any smells like wonderful in the kitchen yes we are in a French bakery now okay sure hey is there a way is there a French way to break it or just pull it off your hands do you want some - sure we have to eat together and that's the French Way magnifique so it's clay magnifique oh thank you so much Sandrine I know I don't be my pleasure French bread now my life is actually complete this is so good Oh merci beaucoup that's only one corner of alex's beautiful kitchen you'll be seen a lot more of it in the weeks ahead and is kitchen and via Singh I think so I don't know but if food Envy is definitely a thing care to sneak us a peek at what else we're gonna be expecting well we did I did do a little project with Alex himself we made a dessert that we started on fire to reveal the insights that one was a little dicey but by a really cool and then our friend Clark casserole agend us to show us how to make bacon in a pot I'm getting hungry my idea", "fqkOSoGZrKo": "you know welcome to Todd's kitchen earlier on I made bread in an air fryer now that's incredibly simple but I'm going to do a little bit of a spin on us today I don't know that you'll love it so join me today as I make my version of dinner rolls in an air fryer okay so we're going to start this off with a normal way of making bread and that's our milk in yeast so obviously into a bowl the first ingredient is going to be some milk and this is at room temperature so just make sure it's not cold and then to that I'm going to add one standard packet which also equals two and a quarter teaspoons of instant yeast and we're just going to let that sit like that for about five to ten minutes just for the yeast to soak up the milk which will also activate the yeast and that's what helps gives that bread that nice fluffy texture okay so our yeast is completely activated so now we add the rest of the ingredients so I'm going to add in half a cup of melted butter followed by a quarter cup of sugar one and a half teaspoons of salt 2 eggs and three cups of regular plain flour okay so at this point you'd mix it through they can use a normal bowl and then just knead it which is basically just folding it in on itself for about six seven minutes and that way you work all the ingredients in so you can do it by hand or you can do it the lazy way which I prefer personally because it just makes life so much easier I'm going to use it don't walk on my stand mixer so it does the same thing and it takes about the same time so I'm going to knead this for about seven minutes and in seven minutes we're gonna have a lovely dough ball now if you find that the dough ball hasn't come together properly if it's too dry just add a little bit of milk you'd be surprised what just a little bit of milk will do it'll bring that dough ball together but if it's too wet then just have a little bit of flour but only do a small amount at a time okay so as you can see it's not exactly a dough ball just gel it seems a little bit wet so I'm just going to add just a small amount of flour a little bit at a time just so everything comes off the bowl and it just forms one big dough ball okay as you can see now it has now come off the sides and it's just starting to form into a ball now so it's not too wet not too dry but remember I just added too much at once just a little bit at a time and once you've reached the desired consistency just knead it away for seven minutes okay so it's been meeting away for seven minutes so we're just going to turn off our machine or stop meeting if you do it by hand just going to take it off the hook and at this point we're just going to place a tea towel on top so keeps all the fresh air from getting in plus it also keeps a nice and dark and we're gonna leave it to proof for about half an hour and that time it should almost double in size and the reason we didn't do this on the slow cooker is because we are cooking this in an air fryer and it will be a lot faster so I've had a chance to proof itself in the slow cooker but with the airfryer which is much faster you really need that extra time for it to proof before you start cooking okay so it's been about a half an hour and as you can see it as risen nicely sir all right now it's full of air so basically we just want to get in there sort of punch it down you're gonna get all that excess air out okay so put a chopping board here and I'm just lightly spreading some flour to prevent sticking so we just come to place our dough onto our chopping board and try and make it as uniform as possible and with a knife we're going to cut it into sixteen individual sections so do it this way this way did you get the exact size for everyone so I just can't cut it exactly as so [Music] so we have our eight sections there and now we just go Hobbs again which will give us 16 okay so next I've got a airfryer a basket now what I've done is I've just lined the base in it with some nonstick parchment paper that'll just prevent it from sticking and as an extra precaution I'm going to use some cooking spray oil so just give it a good grease on the paper itself and just inside and we're just simply going to grab one at a time roll them into a ball and just place it into our air fryer baskets now you should have enough room to do two batches so hopefully we should be able to fit in eight some people have a larger air fries some people have small so honestly it just comes down to the size of the air fryer won't affect anything else just depends whether you do two runs or three runs or for those people with the larger ones will one run but for mine I'm gonna have to do two runs this is the large one but there's actually an extra-large version for an extra extra-large what I've seen ok so we are going to have to proof these rolls a second time which is normal for bread and because we are cooking it pretty fast now normally you just honestly just cover them with some paper towel the tea towel or even some glad wrap or cling wrap but honestly easiest ways the way to do it is just stick it in your air fryer obviously don't turn the head fryer on but they'll prove perfectly fine inside the air fryer turned off and we'll leave it in there for about half an hour and in that time they'll increase the size okay so it's been about half an hour and as you can see that proofed up nicely they've all doubled in size and we're going to touch them but they're nice and fluffy okay so we're going to set it to 160 degrees Celsius which is 320 degrees Fahrenheit and we're going to cook them away for 15 minutes until they're just nice and brown okay so it's been 15 minutes time has just gone off I look at those perfectly cooked dinner rolls and just quickly while they're still warm we're just going to give them a quick glaze and I'm just got some melted butter here so just give them a quick about a light brushing with some butter just makes them look that little bit much better and there we have our delicious dinner rolls and look at how they just pull apart so simply so easily look at that so these are perfect to have with dinner or as a treat after the lunch for example and of course if you tie them just right where they're just done and ready for after dinner you can get that melted butter consistency on your rolls and just look how that butter has already start to melt in that's the absolute deliciousness of freshly baked dinner rolls you just can't get that from the shops so the best thing is you know exactly what's in it they're 100% fresh and they're guaranteed warm they're not gonna have that reheated microwave feel so they can get that melted butter taste and making them in an airfryer makes it super simple and easy and I can guarantee when you use an airfryer and you make them at home they're going to taste simply delicious [Music]", "PTjfvqn9rwQ": "hi friends welcome to tarla dalal's kitchen i chef arsenal today is going to show you a dinner roll recipe which can be served with any of your favorite soups and curries the first step to make these roles is to make a east mixture for that I am going to take some yeast is instant dries which I have taken here to this I am going to add little sugar and approximately 2 tbsp of warm water just give it a mix and we'll cover this with a lid and keep this aside for 10 minutes it's been 10 minutes let's check see how beautiful it is risen now we proceed to the next step I'm going to take maida 1 teaspoon of salt 1 tablespoon of soft butter I have taken soft butter so that is easy for me to knead and the easte mixture which we had prepared and knead it into a soft dough using some warm water I have taken approximately 1/2 cup of warm water here I have not used entire house copper water because it depends upon the quality of meta you are using so while you are needing gradually add the water so now my dough is nice and soft all I am going to do is just make a nice round and cover this with a damp muslin cloth and keep this aside for one hour here I would like to tell you one thing while I was kneading the dough you must have seen initially my dough was sticky and as in when I was needing it it automatically smoothen out it's been one up let's check our dough yes it's so beautiful it is if it is going to take out this excess dough now to this dough I am going to add 1/2 tablespoon of butter and knead it again till it is nice and smooth yes my dough is nice and smooth and all the butter has been absorbed now and this is going to divide this dough into 6 equal portions now my dough has been divided now I'll take a chopping board and I'm going to take one portion of the dough and roll it into a 10-inch rope a thin rope now we are going to shape the dough basically and now I'm just going to overlap this on top and again give a twist and stick to both the ends and turn it around I am going to place this on a greased baking tray I'll show you one more how to roll just roll it into a thin rope and then the same method twist again give a twist both the edges press together and just tuck it in the bottom and place it on a greased baking tray and make sure keeping enough space between the bread rolls in the same way I am going to roll the others now this is a last one now I'm going to cover this with a damp muslin cloth and we'll keep this in a warm place for thirty minutes to prove now it's been half enough you can see it's doubled in size now the final step I'm just going to apply some milk over it I am applying this milk so that when it's baked it will give a nice brown color applying milk over this is very important as you can keep the rolls moist finally sprinkle some mixed herbs over it if you wish you can add only organo or only time as per your taste that's it and now I am going to bake this in a preheated oven at 200 degree Celsius for 20 minutes our dinner rolls are baked and ready let's apply some butter soft butter on it and make sure you applied when it's hot apply butter generously serve it one with the favorite soup or gravies and also you can store this for approximately

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] can you see the barbecue on the chicken wings oh my gosh this looks too delicious it does oh my gosh we can't wait to eat it isn't it [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] make sure you place your wings apart before putting it in the oven if it's overlapping each other the bottom one won't get dried so make sure you place them apart before putting it in the oven keep watching to see the final results [Music] we're going to be eating our barbecue wings with garlic bread you can get garlic bread from your local supermarket this particular garlic bread we are using today got some garlic and also and it has basily filling i normally call it garlic bread baguette i know [Music] [Applause] [Music] preheat your oven before putting in your barbecue wings and garlic breads put your bbq chicken wings above your garlic breads in the oven for 30 minutes depending on how you like it you might like it crispy so you leave it in longer but if you don't like it too crispy like me and my family do then just put it in for 30 minutes [Music] our barbecuings are ready oh it looks so delicious thanks for watching in case you haven't subscribed what are you waiting for please don't forget to like subscribe and share this video thank you all for all the support my mom am i going to start eating anyways see you in our next video bye [Music] you", "X03la5ho0UI": "yo guys yellow from gym or fitness and today I'm going to show you how to bake your own damn bread okay that was a long intro anyway I want to show you guys how to make your own bread it's  easy it's cheap and you know what you're good what you're taking right like you don't want to eat too much processed food so make your own bread it's like because almost nothing because like on a budget it's very easy it just cost another time but you can do it while you work or while they study or whatever so I'll show you real quick how it's done after the intro so let's go all right guys so let's start with showing what you need 565 grams of flour 8 grams of salt 5 grams of yeast this is fresh yeast you can get it in most supermarkets and if you want this is optional right like this is the basic of course you need water with this but that's everybody else water this is dark floor and this is more like this has a higher content of fibre so in case you say like hey I want some more fiber in there because this has like 15 grams of fiber per 100 grams so if you just jam in 100 gram extra then you have a lot of fiber on this one it's preference here but yeah you choose hi guys I quickly got my machine here I'm lucky enough to have one of those mixer machines if you don't have one of those just use a hand mixer electrical hand mixer either you can use you just your hands is fine you know you can just whisk it until it get sticky and then you like like a real old-fashioned Baker you can just like knit it together until night it's a nice dough but I'll show you how it's done so quickly put the floor in there 565 grams I also put this on the screen and the description alright guys this is it for now only a floor list of water I didn't mention the water before but that's 370 milliliters you want to jam that in as well and then I measure the water alright so you put the water together with the floor that's it for now and you let it mix for five minutes in case you have a hand mixer same if you don't have a hand mixer also same but then just with your hands it's just a little harder but the process is in fact the same if you do time guys I also want to show you quickly the macros of the of the floor I'm using because you know you still want to know what you take in a lot of floors are different so choose a floor that fits you and your macros because there's a lot of healthy floors out there but there's also a lot of like less healthy floor so you choose what you want to choose I like to take ecologic floor this one it's like 11 grams of protein per 100 grams a lot of carbs low sugar decent amount of fiber and almost no fat so this is nice my recipe is for three big baguettes or six little breaths estimation of one baguette which is like one third of this is about 650 calories I will show it as well at the end when it's finished but it's pretty good macros and you don't get all the  that other companies put in there because you make it yourself this is plain clean food alright guys so the dough now is for 25 minutes from now on it's a lot of time boring and just waiting working or whatever you're doing and wait so just make sure that there's a bit of everything everywhere and you let it mix for ten minutes all right so when it's mixed you take out and it will look like this a bit more sticky and creamy so it's harder to work with but we got a solution for that and that is that you take a smaller bowl and you take a little you cannot really see it here but you take a little drop of olive oil on a piece of paper or something and you go around in the ball so it gets like a tiny bit of oil the dough will be less sticky on the outside and it will be easier to work with it's not mandatory but it's just a trick to make it easier for yourself so right now I just put the dough in there and let it rise for a half an hour with the towel on top again all right so this is how it looks after half an hour and what the only thing you do like take it out stretch it out and fold it back in again and let it be for another half an hour all right guys now it is half an hour later and this is how it looks it's pretty sweet very nice dough right there so we're gonna work with it right now I'll show you what you have to do with it you take a little bit of flour you spread it out over some workspace and you take all the dough and you put it on the workspace try to keep it at everyone in one big chunk of course put a little bit of flour on it not too much yet so it doesn't stick anymore you try to stretch it out equally for the next step I'm using this bakery thing it's like a plastic thing where you can cut the bread easy way if you don't have that please use a knife your hands are too inconsistent so don't use that because you want equal pieces because we're gonna split them up in three parts so please use one of those or knife what you do is you take a piece you kind of stretch it out make a little ball fold it and then try with your thumbs you can see that here with my Witcher thumbs you can try to like fold it over so it starts to really become a bowl you know and then you have a nice bowl like this take a little bit of flour put it under and let the ball be there do that also with the other two [Music] and then if you have three of them just put them under it's all for another 15 minutes like this alright guys so it's a little moment later 15 minutes later you can take them under the towel you can you can see the balls have risen and calm down a little bit what you do is you stretch them out once more you fold them and then do the same thing over again so you make a little ball now and put them back now you have this you put it onto the towel again for another 15 minutes alright guys we're back again one of the last steps right now before the big waiting time putting it in the oven so basically what you do you take them off make sure that they're on the side here I'll take the big like that so what you just want to do right now is stretch it out fold it again but then instead of making a ball we're gonna make a real bug out of it so you try to like push it outwards while you roll the bread or the dough I mean until it has the nice length to put it on the plate this is a nice length right there so you put it on you can see I put them like this this one can be a bit more in the middle you see damn those look good so what we do now is you leave them under the towel for another 45 minutes but after 40 minutes you pre-heat your oven in my case nothing my case in every case it's gonna be on 200 degrees on a normal oven it's like this one with the double with a ventilator and a double line alright guys so now it's some time later and it's time to eat the oven before I in the oven there is a very important step you have to do if you don't do this your baguettes will not be crunchy so keep an eye out on this take a bowl and put some water in it then what you do so you open the oven if you preheated it and you put it in on the bottom of the oven just like that and while you're preheating the oven you let the water preheat as well this way you get a steamy effect which creates the crisps and the crispness on the outside of the baguettes so your breaths will be even more delicious you just take a random knife one quick it should be a sharp knife though so so you take a sharp knife like this one here and you carve like five carbs so one two three four five and you do that with all the bread this makes it like that it breaks open when it's baking so you have this like Chris penis you know alright guys the time is there we're gonna put them in the oven oh my god I'm so bad that's that focus please you see boom 12 minutes then we remove the bottom water bowl and then another 8 minutes and then this should be done alright guys welcome back I have my oven glove on it's time to remove them turn off the oven and see those beauties see Dad guys I just took the breath out guys this is the result pure beauty completely whole on the inside it's like fluffy as hell [Music] I will quickly calculate the macros for you guys put them on the screen this is pretty solid for a breakfast or something like that I use only the white white floor you can also use with the more whole-grain flour actually that's pretty good to mix it up so you feel longer fulfilled situated so that's pretty nice so thank you guys for watching I hope you liked the tutorial especially when you're a student this is insanely cheap I think here in Denmark I can make like well that's it again 15 breads for about 2 euros please leave a comment if you liked it subscribe and give it a thumbs up enjoy the breath happy baking & see you next one guys", "tm8krQn4TPU": "time to eat again no why no hungry that's why see I didn't forget about my favor airfryer the go why's the turbo air fryer with rotisserie function but I'm not using the rotisserie today today I'm

good for this recipe okay we had this Pillsbury pop and fresh French bread dough so you can make a long French baguette out of it but I'm going to spread it out and make a pizza crust okay let's open this is always fun to remember you feed them on the counter I don't happen no more now you gotta peel it here let's take exciting press see you killers I rather have it's just truffle Opress spoon net

kind of whiskey but I'm going to make it into a pizza crust open this office I'm going to use my rack here see so it's gonna be about that big use that for guide and to make two of them huh - one stop eating this - laughs bring that a little bit come on come on do it right it makes you fight right pizza's here whatever you want with it forward stretch it fold up near these little flour all the less the refrigerated kind of dough you don't want to eat flour for don't worry it's going to be good and don't matter shape cause like right word you know right don't write breads to come on a track expect the best wrinkle back this is wreck okay won't Frank over like that don't worry gonna be good Oh care of all that here we go II love it me I'm going to love it now remember we could have made one big round pizza but I wanted to keep with the French bread theme because it's going to puff up like some bread you know got a little pizza sauce happen to have here that's good just pulling it out

don't ya I like the type are only like that maybe you don't maybe do or you don't have to have that pony at all and you can have to burn it that much cool mmm mmm nice like white bread good and crunchy so you can make something similar to this and your airfryer or whatever brains you have I got this one from Amazon I'll put a link down there check it out I like it because it has the window it has a rotisserie function so that was my air fried french bread pizza pepperoni crunchy I like it a lot step back so please subscribe check that out make yourself one of these or two of these alright have a nice day [Music]", "N90fLxaBCGE": "today is March 61st we've been here a long time boy am I tired no no I'm kidding it's the 19th is March 19th ah let's see what I can do is this 19 that is a tricky birthday David Berg welcome to lunch doodles on March 19 I hope everybody is doing well I have some exciting stuff to share with you today something a little bit different not exactly illustration it's actually toilet paper roll I bet you're gonna be seeing a lot of these in the future and maybe even some of these which are bigger and then maybe you'll even get one of these which is for an enormous toilet it's probably the largest toilet you can ever imagine and these look like there's there's pieces of cardboard but they are actually art tools they are actually things I can make art and put them back when you like take them in a little while and play with them again but I'll give you an example I made this book that just happens to be right here call the next baguette and in the nuts baguettes and that livers in a city and there is a fountain and goes to a bakery and that fountain right there that little picture of the fountain that's a toilet paper roll so I actually made this entire city well you really see the city there we go there it is in the rain I built this city and I did this book many many years ago so it's been a while but I went into my storage and I've found some of the buildings they were not meant to last and they haven't but this is the pharmacy and see there's a little pharmacy sign and that's sort of a joke because his story takes place in France and France there are a lot of pharmacies every little town has a pharmacy and this farm [Music] it's a little French version of a deli right and there it is from the sonic where people walk by but it was next to another domain so it's just a box I built this whole city and took over my whole studio and don't don't have to do any not to build in for weeks and weeks and you can't have a building without trees so that is a big one and then here's another littler tree I thought this might be a fun little activity to sort of do because you could draw a tree and tape it on there and cut it maybe with one of the grown-ups - or maybe you can use scissors on your own and you could make a village and I know what you're asking now you're saying oh how did the net and all of those characters get to walk in that town to be part of that town well I drew those characters flags right and then I put them together with a computer so I want to come see let's go take a look original drawings alright remember these were the elephant employees here are some of the pigeon ones there's the kitchen needs a behalf right and there's some early drawings of another different story we're gonna keep going down busy creatures day evening time desert and no net Spygate so remember a couple days ago I think I was talking about how I always started with the blue drawings first and these drives I drew pretty big and that was because I knew that I was gonna photograph them and they would leave some of their quality when I photographed so I labeled everyone and I drew them where I thought they would need to be there's an X petting something it's another layer there's the back of the net there's the net in the rain the net gets a coin see something special about that coin yeah that's one of the places that I hit the pigeon and then afterwards I had all these different things you know where the characters were and draw them and color them there's no net having the baguette this is 2015 in December there are some of the Nets friends look at that that was the day after Christmas and this one I did the day before New Year's Eve I love working during the holidays because the phone doesn't ring and then I can make my part there's no net dreaming of get and here isn't a net really really scared cuz then it ate the whole baguette and now Nanette is worried and that's gonna have to talk to our mom and then Nanette is gonna have to be brave which we all have to be sometimes even when we don't feel like this I bet you're wondering if you look at this big drawer look at all these drawings and you dip the floor place and figuring out the doorknobs and making the rough sketches how did you do all that well you talked about this on another day but I have a chart with every single piece of art on every page I'm up this is the chart for Nanette spaghett did I build the location did I make the building did I put it together have i drawn the sky have i photographed it and I lit it right did I do the rough drawing did I put it in together did I get it approved did I change it and check it and do the typography and did I get it approved by my editor again all these different things every time I do one of these little things I get to check off one of these boxes because it is impossible to make a book so much work but it is possible to do one of these little things and when you do it you can check it off just like sometimes it feels like it's impossible to get through some of the stuff that's going on now but we just need to check off box by dogs and then eventually hopefully we've got this beautiful big thing that becomes a story let's go back as I forget to show you some of the things I'm very forgetful later we're gonna head back these big buildings that was really fun but I also got to build these little things this isn't a tiny scene in the back of a corner there's a Bareilles stand it's a French love umbrella and it's been raining we see that it's raining earlier so whatever umbrella stand and you see that nice not going to know about pitching and the beginning women yeah it's very excited about going Nanette is in the kitchen and this is the stove top and the oven in the kitchen this is the first prop that I built the very first one to see if all this other stuff was going to work and it did and after today's little broadcasts are gonna put on a short film that's a stop-motion film of me very quickly building some of these buildings and building the whole town so you can get a sense of how big that really was so maybe you can use this to build a building or maybe if you have one let's take a Twitter pivot roll let me pause fun this physical go rock so you get a type at the roll or paper roll or maybe if you're like me you have a giant toilet go I'm the dark chocolate okay and I'll get the roll all right it's a weakened you got okay I'm so funny oh okay play because we can use this also just to make carrot right we can do plays sometimes it helps me when I'm writing to think of characters talking and to create dialogues and so if I have a little puppet well the yellow doesn't look very yellow in this toilet paper roll looks more brown and grayish so I guess I learned something about toilet paper rolls the yellow doesn't work as well doesn't matter see this is my little bird now right Roley I can put on a little play with rolling I like doing that I like putting on the little plays matter of fact I like writing plays and I wrote a play called don't let the pigeon drive the bus the musical that until very recently was touring all over the country and I think will be again and I mention that because in the program that we gave all of the theatre goers there was this special thing it was these puppets these finger puppets if you can make it come right out and take a piece of tape and you've got the ductless let's see what else oh we also have the Buffs so you can play the play that was close boss oh yes and remember from the pigeon he wants a puppy was also this I know what you're saying right now what mom why do you get to play with these and I don't well if you go to the Kennedy Center website there are these as downloads now they're not in color because you get to color them and they're not pre-cut like these are but you can cut them or have someone cut them and then you have your own little finger puppets that you've created just like this oh I'm so in love oh yeah there we go so alright there's a little beeping you don't worry about it I think there's a truck outside because I'm in a studio it's all fine alright well now you know how to make a props and sets puppets you can download them and make your own place I really hope that you could do that maybe with a grown-up in your life that'll be fun I like to see grown-ups get silly again I want the grown-ups out there to get a shame after me silly yeah alright that was really fun so now we've been getting a lot of questions I've been seeing a lot of drawings online and sent to me and there are some fantastic drawings I really appreciate it I think you guys are doing really creative stuff up there and so today I got these questions sent to me put together for me obviously I can't answer all your questions a lot of questions are coming through but we have someone initial be age six who says which book makes him laugh the most by him not I'm guessing he means me which book makes me laugh the most who I'll be honest any time I read a Calvin and Hobbs book I just start laughing so probably Calvin House makes me laugh the most when you get an idea for new character or a series what do you do first I celebrate and how do you get books published I call my editor so as free of eight and Gabi age six well for me I've been publishing books since oh well before creed and Gabi were born and I have an editor and when I have an idea for a book when the beginning of an idea for a book I call it my editor and I start talking to my header do you think this is a good idea or how can I make this happen and I make little sketches and if my editor thinks it's an okay idea then I continue to work on growing that idea which of your characters is the most like you who this is from Delaney who is age six in Michigan Delaney you I guess are gonna grow up to be a psychiatrist or a therapist and when you do I will pretend an hour is really 45 to 50 minutes and I will pay you and tell me the answer to that question all right Fiero h9 asked how do you not need to erase every five seconds oh yeah that is a great question well I've been drawing a lot I've been drawing for many many years I made many many many many drawings but even so when I'm sitting at my drawing table and really working I think I need to erase not every five seconds probably more like every four and a half seconds remember an eraser is part of a pencil for a reason and adding and taking away are both types of drawing all right are you going outside this is Cassidy in Pennsylvania 7 years old are you going to make a pigeon book and he gets what he wants that would be pretty cool I think that would be pretty cool don't you and I'm gonna make a picture book where he gets what he wants no in the same way that Charlie Brown is never gonna be able to kick that football the pigeon is never gonna get what he wants because I'm kind of a stinker that way with the pigeon it's a good question and the reason not is books need drama if I made a book called happy pigeon gets everything he wants in happy land and boy it's really great it'd be pretty boring right and by the end you would stop reading that book elion Spence I have a question Eli would like to know if you have a favorite fish okay Eli I do have a favorite fish his name is Roberto how did Gerald and Piggy become best friends asks olive was a six year old in California how did Gerald Antony become best friends Gerald and piggy met on a farm and Gerald was working on the farm and came from the city as a tourist and they met each other and they decided they had a lot of similar interests and then it turned out that because of rent that they needed to sort of like get a larger apartment with a bunch of different animals and then they became very very good friends or maybe there's a better story I really don't know and I like that maybe you could write a story of how elephant and piggy first met because to be honest when I first met them they were already best friends all right Charlie is a 7 year old in Montreal motor running how many pigeons are there in the world not enough not my name is Zach this is from Zach and I'm in the fifth grade in New Hampshire I wanted to ask if you if anyone ever think that you weren't a good artist some of my friends don't like my drawings but I still try my best Wow that that's pretty deep question yes that a lot of people who didn't think I was a good artist for many years certainly when I was growing up people didn't like my cartoons sometimes even teachers thought that cartoons weren't real art and I knew that if I drew everyday my drawings would get better I knew my drawings weren't perfect my feelings weren't perfect now but every day after the end of a day of drawing I feel like I'm that little bit better and I think when I was your age it was good to have heroes who drew so I would look at comic strips in the paper and I would imitate them and I would draw in their style just to see how they did what they did and over time all of those things developed into what is called a style so that I could draw in the way that I draw is that you are 10 I look forward to a day when I can see one of your drawings in a book in a bookstore all right and now dear mr. beau this is from Luke Eliza and Anna New York does pigeon have any friends or family yes the pigeon has lots of friends I hope you're one of the pigeons friends and the pigeon has family it's the duckling but definitely his family all right those were wonderful questions thank you for them these things down alright we're talking about building today we're talking about not just illustrating but finding boxes and I suspect there to be a lot more boxes in your life over time and taking paper and taping on them and making buildings and making sets and characters for paper so I thought for today's doodle I want to make impossible buildings buildings that look like buildings is a drawing but could never really exist so let's see what we do all right let's do it all together so this is house with big hairy legs there's a hairy leg house and a bird in the living room and bear claws that effect in a possible house what your possible house looks like well let me just write my name so if I come across this drawing again I can remember we made it I forgot my last couple days but I'm gonna stamp this it's mine impossible house you hold up your impossible house oh yeah that house is barely possible matter of fact I would say that some of these houses are looking at now are completely impossible houses well thank you guys for visiting today I hope that you enjoyed the little clip that's going to come out afterwards and I hope that you'll start building and making and creating little maybe not so little houses and stores and you can turn that into a set for a play and then you can take some of your puppets and make a little story alright this is Mo Willems saying songs did they go business at one I knew when I was totally cabbage we need okay put the two don't touch no much use of the who [Music]", "-Durg7YO-Pk": "hi I'm Clint oh and this is how to make a baguette day one is a prep day it's all about meson possums you first you're going to skill your pre ferment which is a polish for maggots it's a very wet pray for men and it's one hundred percent hydrated which means the water and the flower are the same person it's a very lactic preferment which means it doesn't have an acidic sour flavor it's kind of a nutty flavor and you're going to mix the pool eesh by hand which is the flour yeast in water and that gets mixed on day one and then set overnight to ferment and double in size about 6 to 16 hours your final dough you're just going to me some class you're going to put the flour mult and salt in a paper bag and leave the water to be measured the next day as well as the east the water we have to figure out the temperature for so we'll do that tomorrow once the proofer pray for men is done and all the variables are taking care of the flour in the dough acts as a binding ingredient it provides structure for the bread and food for the yeast the salt adds shelf-life flavor as well as regulates the yeast production and the malt is a sprouted barley milled into a fine powder the water as well regulates the fermentation and the dough temperature so in day two once you have your proof event ready and amazon clause what we're going to do is calculate the water type and you do this by taking into consideration all the variables like the room temperature the flower temperature your friction factor so this depends on which mixing method you're going to use and we're going to use the improved but I'll go over what those are in a minute and you also have to include the variable of the pre ferment temperature so the first thing you do is take the pre ferment temperature take all of these temperatures and you're going to multiply your desired doe temperature which is always between 75 and 78 by four since there are four variables and then you can going to subtract each of the numbers that you get to find your water temperature and then you're going to measure your water and then you can start your mixing for the day so when you're mixing the dough first you're going to add all the ingredients into the mixer and go on first speed you can add the poolish the water yeast and dry ingredients that you all measured the day before on first feed for just as long as it takes for it all to be incorporated and combined occasionally scraping down the bowl and then you're going to go two seconds for you'd once everything is incorporated and combined then you're going to mix until medium gluten development is achieved and you can test that by pulling gluten windows and making sure it doesn't rip too easily so we're using the improved method but there are a few other methods that you can use for mixing there's short and there's intense and the difference between these mixing methods or the outcomes and the way that they're done so short is the most desirable it creates the most open creamy crumb and it has excellent flavor it's done by hand which means it takes a lot of manpower a lot of work so it's the least used but the most desirable improved is the next best you have a medium-sized crumb with an almost creamy color like you see in the short and it has good flavor not as excellent as short but still a good flavor this is done by a mixer but is not using as much it doesn't incorporate as much friction as the intense method so it's a better product in the end and then intense is also done by a mixer it incorporates a lot of friction which decreases the color so it looks more white than creamy as you see on the other other two and it lacks flavor and creates a really tight closed crumb so you see that in like decorative doze where there's not an open structure of the bread it needs to be more firm and I guess durable more than open and airy now once you finish mixing you're going to take your dough temperature right out of the mixer and it should be between your desired temperature of 75 to 78 you're then going to spray your proofing bin and you're going to take the dough from the mixer and you're going to organize it into a nice smooth top and place it in the bin and then you're just going to cover it with the lid and allow that to rest so your dough is going to rest and ferment for a total of ninety minutes with one fold after the first 45 minutes and the benefits of fermentation they give your bread a better quality a better flavor longer shelf life fermentation is really the way that flavor develops in bread it allows the yeast to mature more and act more flavor and your fold after the 45 minutes is just going to be 5 down on top of each other on top of itself you're going to fold it down in the bin and then once you get to the end you're going to turn it and you're going to set it nicely on it seemed back the other way in the bin and then cover it back up and allow it to rest for another 45 minutes to complete its fermentation so after the 90 minutes total is up we want to take your dough and flour your table because it's a wetter dough we're going to flip your dough out of the bin onto the table the flowered table and you kind of want to spread it organize it so that it's kind of a rectangle shape so easier to divide more evenly and then you're gonna do gasps that dough with the palm of your hand just do gasps it so there's no not a lot of air bubbles you know and then you're going to divide those pieces measure them out on a scale into about 400 grams each they should be about just the shape of a square but anything closes pretty much good it works so once you have your 400 grams square pieces of dough measured out you're going to take them on your on your table it's all has a lot of bit of flour not too much and you're going to appreciate and praise shaping is the first shaping of the dough into the bigot kind of general shape before you're going to do you have to do one more rest and then a final shaping and for the pre shaping all you're going to do is roll it down using your side of your hand so you're not pushing down on top of the dough you're going to tuck it under and just keep doing that should be about five times until you have your last seam and roll it over on your seam and you're going to have it sit on your seam in a moist body bag so that the gluten can relax and you can do your final shaping and it'll get long enough otherwise if you don't let it have another rest and the gluten can't relax you won't be able to get the maximum length for your baguette the proper link which won't look good when you bake it so after the 20 minister minutes of rest in the body bags you're going to take her down take it out of the body bag place it down you're going to do gasps that so you have the proper shape you want kind of a rectangular shape and then for the final shaping what you're going to do is you're going to fold the top down so there's about engine and a half have an inch between that left at the bottom just using the base of your hand right here to close that and then you're going to flip it over so you have the lip at the top and you're going to fold it down to me in the middle don't go all the way over and you're going to use the base of your poem again to do that so you have a little seam in the middle right there and then you're going to do ask that a little bit more because now you have more don't piled on top of each other there's a little bit of air incorporation and you're going to take your thumb to push in and fold over closing it at this at the ends so making a seam right there with the palm of your hand again you're just going to close that up so you have the seam there a nice scene and what you're going to do from there is you're going to roll it out with the seam facing up you're going to roll it out with a rocking motion I'm going to do it with one hand just because our papers are moving but typically you would do it with two starting here and you would roll it out and you want to kind of rock back and forth and use the table more than your strength so that you can get the most out of what you're doing quicker you don't want to go over it too many times otherwise you're going to tighten the crumb structure and you're going to lose that open chrome that you were looking for and at the ends you're going to roll down a little bit harder so that you get the pointed end of a baguette that you typically see typically you only want to go over it once or twice but since I'm only doing one hand that's why I'm going over it a few more times and then once you have your baguette shape with your pointed ends you're going to lay it in a Koosh which is just a resting thing it's got a piece of cloth down you want to make sure that you have some flour on it so you have a little bit of flour there and you're going to lay your I get on and you have to make sure you have privacy in between each bed so you're going to pull it up and then your next bagnet would go right there and so on until I say we do about six buckets / couche and then after they're all on we cover them up with the rest of the fabric and you're going to set them back in the body bag the moist fateh guys for their final rest of 45 minutes before baking okay so our next step is loading I made a teacher I see the 45 minutes ago to secure Vegas out of the body bag off the couch and I think i forgot to mention before but when you're placing them on the couch you want to make sure their seem up not seem down so when you're transporting them onto the loader which is what you use to put them into the oven you have it seemed up and you're going to take a wooden board which I'm just going to use my hand for now but typically we have long thin wooden boards that will use and we'll flip it over and then using the Koosh you'll flip it back over onto the wooden loader so that seemed up so that when you place it onto the loader it seemed down kind of rolls off seem down and then that's all gnaw on the loader and you line them up so that you have space in between and then we gotta score yeah so for scoring we pretend that there are two parallel lines running down the top of the baguette and you want to score like this not like these so staying in between the parallel lines you're going to start from point A and make lines overlapping they're about three inches long and an 8th in a pinch of an inch deep using just the forward front edge of the knife the little boy and you're going in at a 45-degree angle not 90 degrees otherwise all the gas will be lit out 45 degrees so after the guy gets have been scored you want to load them into the oven and bake them with the oven set up for 70 degrees on top and the 445 on bot on the bottom and you're going to set the steam at point 20 for 20 minutes and then bake it and the steam serves to add volume to the bread it improves the crest color and it prevents a tough like unedible crust room for it and then after the 20 minutes is up you're going to check your buckets and see their color and typically you're going to bake it for an additional three to five minutes just until they're the golden brown that you want them to be and in the oven the meijer reaction occurs which is just the heat in the oven causing the simple sugars to react in the presence of proteins and it breaks down those simple sugars resulting in that golden brown color after the 20 minutes and then the three to five minutes without the steam occur of the baking you're going to take them out of the oven and you're going to cool them we don't cut by gets right out of the oven because the cooling allows the flavor to be enhanced and all as the crumb to finish setting if you cut them too soon they won't be ready they won't be fully set and you won't get as a desirable result finally we have storage after cooling we want to store the by gets in paper bags this prevents the bread from getting really soft the paper bags do more to like not hold in moisture as plastic bags would and the moisture that you would find in a plastic bag builds up on the bread and it makes it's often not as tasty and after that that's it you can just enjoy the bread thanks for watching happy baking", "D9ZvlKQmm6M": "hello again and welcome to another break video this time I'm going to show you how I make my ciabatta bread it's a pretty simple bread to make but it can be a little awkward to handle but with a little practice you soon get used to it it'll also be an advantage if you will have a stand mixer but not essential I'll address that problem a little later ok the first job in making a good tasty ciabatta bread is to prepare the police or sponge the night before out of the main ingredients list start by adding 200 grams that's 7 ounces of the water followed by the CM in strong white bread flour then add the quarter teaspoon of instant or active dried yeast if you using fresh yeast that's 7 grams or quarter of an ounce and give that a good mix a quick word on measuring the ingredients I always wear my ingredients especially the water as it's much more accurate than cups or measuring jokes so we'll try to use scales instead of converting my measurements and you can't go wrong right once that's all mixed to cover the ball I use a shower cup for this and put it on the top shelf of your fridge for at least 12 hours this stage parts a lot of flavor unhhhh structure to the finished bread right it's the next morning and the police has been in the fridge for the last 14 hours okay now it's time to use the mixer but like I said in the intro to the video if you don't have a mixer then you have to do it this way right for those without a mixer do everything I've done so far know instead of it all going into a mixer to start the police and the remainder of the ingredients to a separate ball which should be if you've got your police measurements correct 240 grams or eaten or half ounces of water 350 grams or 12 and a half ounces of flour and of course the salt now give this a good mix then cover the ball and let it rest at room temperature for three hours unfortunately that's how long after it if you don't have a mixer with the mixer this will take about six minutes right as you can see after spending the night in the fridge this is what the police should look like all risen and probably now one easy way of transferring the Peniche from this ball to the mixer ball is by adding all the water to it first then added to the mixer ball followed by the flour and the salt a quick word on the flour I've been asked many times what is strong white bread flour strong white bread flour has at least 12% protein in it unlike all-purpose or plain flour which only has around 10% protein these flowers are ideal for cakes and pastries so if we check the ingredients list on the side of the flour bug and it has 12 percent or more protein than its strong enough to make bread with using the door hook on this kind of door is no good so use the puddle attachment right mix on slow speed for one minute then move up to the next speed for a further minute and then to the next beat for approximately four minutes or until the door starts to release from the sides of the ball we'll give after three minutes on the faster speed you can see the door is starting to release from the ball this one should take about another minute basically what's happening here is the gluten strands are joining and bonding together accelerated by the motion of the mixer it's kneading the door in other words for those without the mixer the three other weird in time does just about the same thing all care to sweat your hands and scrape off the excess door from the puddle most of it should just fall off anyway whether you've spent the last three hours waiting or the last six minutes mixing were all at the same point now the next stage in making ciabatta bread is to let the door rest and rise for two and a quarter hours but the door needs a quick turn three times that's every 45 minutes start by oil in a large bowl with half a teaspoon of vegetable or olive oil this will help prevent the door from sticking too much I find a wide stainless steel ball the most comfortable to get my hands into turn the door then wet your hands and scrape the bowl from the mixer ball to this one I said at the start of the video this door is a bit awkward to handle that's because ciabatta bread is a high hydration bread in other words it's a pretty wet door in this case 80% hydration that's 80% water to 100% flour on the best way to prevent it sticking is to have wet hands so have a bowl of warm water already all the time and when I say a warm water that's for your comfort it's got nothing to do with the bread okay that's the first 45 minutes up now we'll give the door a quick turn and here's my tip of the deer coming up it's a simple solution to a problem who could drive you nuts when working with this kind of door oh okay let's try that again earn that much better I hope you can see as sticky as the story is it won't stick your hands if your hands are wet okay I'll cover that up and let that develop for another 45 minutes as I said in my budget video these rest and rise periods are very important to bring out the best possible flavor and structure in the bread writer cover that and let that develop for the last 45 minutes and now I'll prepare the next stage of the process okay this batch of dual will produce two decent-sized loaves of ciabatta incidentally ciabatta in Italian simply means slipper and when you see the finished off you can see why they were named utter right back to the bread give a clean dry surface the good dusting of flour ready to pour up the door you'll also need what's known in the trade as a baker's couche which simply is a well floured cloth to rest the dawn for the last 20 minutes before it goes into the oven I use a tight woven cotton pillowcase for mine it's a lot cheaper than the real cushy cloth and it does the same job another bit of equipment you'll need is a couple of these Scribus for shaping and transferring the doll from the bench to the cloth but unfortunately you can't lift the door off with these creepers as the snag on the cloth that bit will have to be done by hand as you'll see a little later right the last 45 minutes is up and it's time for your first bravery test don't turn the door anymore by hand just suspend the ball over the floured bench and slowly turn the ball over until the door gently slips out under the flour it may take a few seconds don't have the ball too high from the bench once it comes out I don't have to touch it anymore with my hands at this stage now I can start to gently shape it into a square with the scraper but before shipping it give it a good dusting of flour to prevent the scrapers from sticking from now on any flour that's added is only external flour so don't be afraid to put plenty on as it all can be brushed off again and the loaves are cooked just keep manipulating the door from the sides but don't put any pressure on the top of the door at all cause you don't want to force any of the gas out of it it's like working with the giant marshmallow but it's surprisingly easy to shape once it's approximately a square I split it down the middle and gently shape it into two lofts right pre every test number two first make sure you have plenty of flour on the couch now using board scrapers slide them in from both ends of the door and quickly but confidently transfer it to the couch tidied up a bit then fold the cloth up a little to separate it and support it and then do the same with the other one once you've done this a few times it becomes a lot less intimidating and easier to do it's all about confidence now cover the door with a light tea towel and set the timer for 20 minutes okay one is about 10 minutes left set your oven to 230 degrees Celsius that's 450 degrees Fahrenheit or gas mark 8 I'm set in mine to 210 Celsius because mine is fun assisted and it runs approximately 20 degrees Celsius hotter than indicated on the dial now I normally bake my chapattis on a granite slab but I realized not everyone has one applause so I'll do these on a couple of baking trays turned upside down in the oven you'll also need a tray of hot water in the bottom of the oven and a spray bottle with a little water in okay to transfer the door to the oven you would normally use at Baker's pale it looks like a wooden shovel but once again I'm going to show you an alternative and it's this heat-resistant lightweight cutting board with a sheet of parchment or grease proof paper on it so that it'll slide straight off in the oven it works great you could also use a piece of plywood or heavy cardboard right bravery test number three once the 20 minutes are up uncover the door and using the cloth flip the first door over this is to make sure it's not stuck then gently get your fingers underneath it and move it to the nearby pail then straighten it out a bit and very carefully would quickly let the door on the paper slide off onto the hot baking tray as shown then do the same with the other one give the inside of the oven a couple of Spears as quickly as possible and get the oven door claws to retain the heat now the sprayer underwater tree and the bottom of the oven will make the bread nice and crispy these laws take between 18 to 25 minutes to cook depending on how well done you like them so about two-thirds of the way through I'm going to turn the loaves buck the front and swap the shelves top to bottom so I'll set the timer for 12 minutes as you can see the loaves have risen quite a bit this is called oven spring so I'll swap them around as quickly and as safely as possible and I'm going to set the timer for a further 6 minutes because that's the way my wife and I like them but you can experiment how well-done you want yours but I would see a minimum of 18 minutes and a maximum of 25 minutes at this temperature at bay they are made from only four ingredients flour water yeast and salt what an amazing transformation from a sticky mass to this in about three hours and now you can understand why the Italian word for slipper is ciabatta right I'll just cut one open so you can see what it looks like on the inside with high hydration bread you always get a large crumb of bubbles in the bread which is what a good ciabatta should look like these are still a bit warm to cut but I'll have a look anyway my wife calls his Sookie up bread andd she loves this with homemade pasta and bolognese sauce I only wish you could smell this - it's deceiving but these two lofts are not as small as they appear in the video this one is approximately 12 inches by 6 inches wide and 3 inches deep so they are pretty large lofts they also freeze very well - I've only made 2 but you could double or trouble the recipe in about the same time for him if you are the oven space to take them well there you go that's how I make this ciabatta bread I hope you try it - so thanks again for watching I'll be back with another recipe very soon please like share comment and maybe subscribe by hitting the circle above in the meantime here's some

prepare a hot dog there is a quotation by lawrence j peter that the noblest of all dogs is the hot dog it feeds the hand that bites it a hot dog is where a cooked sausage is served in the slit of a sliced roll and topped with caramelized onions mustard sauce and tomato ketchup so let's get straight to the ingredients [Music] method add milk water sugar and the yeast to a mixing jug stir gently and set aside for 5-10 minutes after 5-10 minutes the yeast should begin to form a creamy foam on the surface of the water which means the yeast is active [Music] sift in the flour [Music] and the salt into the bowl of a stand mixer add in the whisked egg oil and the activated yeast mixture mixture knead with the dough hook for about four to five minutes using the stand mixer alternatively you can knead by hand for about 8-10 minutes [Music] then grease the dough with oil [Music] then cover and set aside in the warm place until it almost triples in size this will take approximately one hour when the dough has tripled in size remove it from the bowl of the stand mixer and drop it onto a floured surface weigh the dough then divide the dough into 10 equal portions by weight approximately 105 grams each gently roll the individual portions to shape into round dough balls then cover and let it rest for about five to ten minutes after five to ten minutes roll to flatten and shape into a sausage approximately five and a half to six inches long [Music] pinch the seams to seal the dough repeat the process and shape the rest of the dough balls into sausages remember pinch the seams to seal the [Music] dough place the sausage shaped dough approximately one centimeter or half inch apart from each other into a baking tray that has been lined with parchment paper or grease proof paper note make sure you place the dough into the baking tray with the seam at the bottom now grease cling film and cover the baking trays then set aside in the warm place for about one hour to allow it to rise and double in size [Music] in the meanwhile while the dough is rising preheat the oven to the temperature shown when the dough has doubled in size the rolls will just be touching each other then brush the tops with egg wash egg wash is got by whisking one egg and one one tablespoon of water together bake in the preheated oven for about 15 to 18 minutes halfway through the baking process open the oven dough rotate the tray by 180 degrees for even baking [Music] when done remove the trays from the oven and set aside on the wire rack to cool completely finally slit open the hot dog rolls across the top and place a cooked sausage into each top up with caramelized onions mustard sauce and tomato ketchup and there you have it soft and delicious hot dog rolls which are used to prepare a hot dog so thank you for stopping by hope you will give this recipe a try have lots of fun in the process as you toy and most of all don't forget to enjoy tricky's kitchen has lots of other baking

love and drain cleaner that's like a what only being partly true by the way [Music] okay so the drink cleaner comment real funny ahahaha but like I said it's only partly true but I'm really talking about is dipping your pretzels in a weak food grade lye solution prior to baking now we'll discuss all this stuff later and there are alternatives which I'll mention because I know can be scary for some people but at the end of the day lye aka sodium hydroxide is king for pretzel making it's just the traditional way now with Oktoberfest coming around the corner I couldn't help but follow up my beer video with a pretzel video it just felt right now I'm not sure how the Germans are gonna feel about this but my last name is Weissman so hopefully that counts for something which by the way I found out that my last name directly translates to white man yep great anyway with that said let's make this shall we so before we mix our dough we're gonna have to prime our yeast do that by mixing one and a half tablespoons or 13 grams of instant yeast with one and a half cups or 365 grams of lukewarm water at 95 degrees Fahrenheit or 35 degrees Celsius then just cover that and let that sit for ten minutes before using then mix together four cups our 632 grams of bread flour with two teaspoons or 12 grams of fine sea salt and one gram or 1/2 teaspoon of diastatic malt powder now that stuff is optional but diastatic malt powder is gonna help a lot with not only to flavor but also just the general browning of the actual pretzel so not necessary but very helpful then just give it a good whisk you maneuver until everything is completely incorporated make sure to spill a little bit on otherside because it's tradition now with that flour mixture in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment begin mixing on low speed and pouring your yeast and water mix which has sat for about 10 minutes the yeast mixture should be a little bit bubbly after sitting for that time now mix the flour and water on medium-low speed scraping the sides with a spatula as needed once the dough forms continue to mix for five minutes then add one and a half tablespoons or 21 grams of softened unsalted butter the dough will probably break up a little bit when you add that if it struggles to get the dough back together then you can just stop the mixer and reset it and then continue mixing then just mix for two to three more minutes or until fully mixed and the dough is smooth and elastic then remove the dough and shape it into a light ball and place it back in the bowl cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel for 15 minutes once it's rusted to be a tiny bit poofier and now we're ready to divide the dough so go ahead and divide that into 8 even pieces weighing about 127 grams each if you want to be exact like myself extra now lots of recipes don't do this but I actually have preferred to preciate my pretzels just to get that shape going and makes it a whole lot easier later so go ahead and take a segment of dough and lightly shape it in sort of like a fat little torpedo about four inches or 10 centimeters long then just do that with all of your pieces of dough and place that it on a rimmed baking sheet that's been greased with oil cover it with a damp towel or plastic wrap and let it rest for five minutes okay so now we're ready to shape the pretzels you're basically gonna take one of those fat torpedoes and starting from the center you're gonna roll and increase pressure as you reach the ends that way you sort of get a tapered effect and you're gonna kind of keep doing that until you get a long tapered torpedo it's around 20 inches or 50 centimeters long okay now this part's easy take the two ends and bring them together then just take these two ends and then gently cross them over each other so now that you've got a funny-looking pair of pants with crossed legs you're then just going to twist those pieces once then grab both pieces and gently bring it down to the front and attach those legs to the base gently and boom you got yourself a little pretzel boy then just repeat that with all of your pretzels until they're well all shaped then place your shaped pretzels on round baking sheets that have been greased lightly with oil to prevent sticking I usually do four per baking sheet but for some reason I did six and two here I don't know why just make sure that they have an inch of space between them 10 with plastic wrap or a damp towel and proof at room temperature for 30 minutes after that place them in the fridge for one hour or overnight then when it's time to bake them you'll bake them straight from the fridge while they're still cold so before taking them out prepare your lye solution now listen carefully this stuff is very dangerous if I'm properly handled so please wear gloves and follow safety precaution now this is where a lot of people get turned off because it's a little bit scary we're using chemicals why are we eating lye and hey you should be using the food grade stuff link in the description for this one and B you can always just google and research why it's safe now if you want an alternative because you don't feel comfortable with that you can totally use baking soda but the results will be definitely lesser the ingredients for both the lye bath and the baking soda bath will be in the description so first get a bowl of a thousand grams of cold water then slowly pour and whisk together 30 grams of food grade lye beads never ever ever add water to lie otherwise you're gonna risk the lye popping and spitting back at you and that's that's no good then just keep whisking until all the beads are dissolved now take your pretzels and drop them into the solution for 10 seconds per side then place them on a wire rack set over try to drip off excess then repeat with all pretzels I did these in a foreword pretzels buy four pretzels batch then placed the lye dipped pretzels on baking sheets that have been lined with parchment paper that have been greased sufficiently optionally you can slash the base of these with a razor so that they pop open a little bit then sprinkle them generously with flaky salt flaky soap because you know that's my style but traditionally you would use well pretzel salt then bake these at 425 degrees Fahrenheit or 218 degrees Celsius ideally on a convection setting for 15 to 20 minutes or until nicely deep Brown then just pull them out and enjoy your labor these are best the day of baking and even better when eating warm out of the oven in terms of disposing of the live just make sure that you research what you should do in your state first and that's it you can enjoy proper pretzels at home and have your very own home Oktoberfest you know what else is gonna have its own Oktoberfest beer old [Music] alright guys and that is it's so homemade pretzels is close to the German variety as we can get without you know actually being in Germany which would help they're way better than than a brand that I'm not gonna name but brand that I'm not naming yeah I'm not probably shouldn't say that that was a joke that was a joke now like I said in my last few videos I'm going to San Francisco in a couple of days in this video we'll probably be going up around the time that I'm flying out so any recommendations on places to eat please let me know I

method oh my you gotta try that a slightly different method than in my last easy homemade French baguette video this one offers sensational results as well good bread takes time so let's get started combine water flour salt yeast and molasses together and knead for about 4 minutes that's all then form a ball and transfer the dough into a non greased plastic container to rise the dough should be around 83 degrees Fahrenheit 28 degrees Celsius now led to rise at room temperature for 4 hours during the resting time gently deflate to do every arm so 3 times using water instead of flour to prevent sticking indeed good bread takes time but it does not take time from you and a while you wait for your bread to rise you can do the 101 other things you want to do deflating it to do after it rises releases the carbon dioxide buildup in the dough and relaxes the gluten the dough is also developing flavor during this long fermentation process that's what we are looking for it smells just fabulous my dear friends the rising time is over to shape your round love begin by gently pressing down the dough without deflating it except large bubbles draw up the edges to the center turn dough over draw the dough down with cupped hands to slightly tight in the skin rotating the dough back and forth using a circular motion gorgeous let it proof for about an hour and a half and by the way this recipe makes excellent baguette as well so what is the secret to French baguette well watch the easy homemade French baguette video and you see what I am talking about once risen unmold and transfer all off to an upside-down baking tray or bread peel dusted with fine semolina / and carefully slide onto the hot baking tray or pizza stone and beg for 55 minutes for centuries French villages had communal ovens where the town's fork would bring them to be baked today you can make it at home the real deal is now your favorite cooking channel I am Bruno al booze thank you for watching and don't forget to subscribe you", "Yq_6VGSLG30": "today I'm very quickly gonna show you how to make bread like you would get at Jimmy John's why Jimmy John's because I really like their songs this bread is pretty similar to what you'd get at other sub shops - like subway and other places like that but I specifically formulated this particular recipe to be as close to Jimmy John's as possible and to be doable in a home kitchen before I start I should say that I don't have any secret knowledge of Jimmy John's nobody gave me a recipe or ingredients or formula or anything the only thing I did was go there and eat their subs a few times and keep my eyes open to what they were doing and the only real useful information I got out of that is what kind of bread it is and the cooking temperature for the bread and the proofing temperature Jimmy John's says that their bread is actually French bread and I kind of disagree with that just a little bit on a couple points what you're going for in your bread is a texture with a nice soft crust not a real thick hearty crust like you would get on actual French bread and then the crumb is not like actual French bread either it's more of a it's more like Wonder Bread on the Jimmy John's bread it's got that nice open pore structure to it and it's it's a lot different from most of the authentic French bread recipes that I've made another way that it's different is that there's oil in the Jimmy John's bread and I can tell that just by the the texture and a bunch of other things about the bread so a couple of the differences between this bread that I'm making and real French bread is the addition of oil and the addition of baking soda to get those real small fine little air bubbles like you would get in something like Wonder bread so I'll just start with the dough preparation real quick you add one package of yeast to your mixer then you add a cup of water a tablespoon of sugar one tablespoon of powdered milk 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda one teaspoon of salt four tablespoons of soybean oil or vegetable oil and then finally about three cups of flour and you're gonna adjust that later using the dough hook you'll beat the dough together until it is combined well and then you'll let it rest five minutes the next step is the actual kneading of the dough for this you'll do two minutes on the setting for on a KitchenAid mixer followed by a seven minute rest followed by an additional three minutes on for the dough consistency you're going for is a nice soft elastic dough that is a little bit sticky and still fixed to the sides just a little bit if it's too wet and in other words it's a big goopy mess then add a little bit more flour if it's too dry and it doesn't stick to the bowl at all then go ahead and add a little bit of water now one of the things I learned from going to Jimmy John's is their proofing rack temperature and Jimmy John's that I went to it was 113 degrees so to kind of duplicate that what I did was just heated my oven up just a little bit and then you take your dough and cover it in a bowl and put it in there to double in size takes about an hour once your dough is doubled in size take it out of your little proofing oven there divide your dough ball into three different balls and the next thing to do is roll out and you want to roll them so that they're about as big as your thumb and indexfinger about like that transfer them to a cookie sheet that's been lined with parchment paper and cover them with some saran wrap that has been sprayed real quickly with some spray oil they'll go back into your little proofing oven for about a half an hour that's about how long it takes for them to double in size then you take them out and you set them on the counter and you want to pre-heat your oven to 338 it had their temperature between 388 and 394 degrees on all of their ovens once your oven is well preheated put the pan with the dough into the oven on the middle rack buying baked in this instance about 16 minutes you're just going for a nice brown color of the crust you don't want it to get too dark and too hard my oven is a convection oven so your baking time and may vary a little bit once they're done take them out of the oven and set them on a cooling rack to cool", "XSpz27UMV8c": "hi today we're making a family favorite appetizer my three cheese i can't say the word i'm sorry cheese rolls so much easier [Music] hi today we're making a family favorite appetizer my three cheese charcuterie roll it's a great addition to any appetizer spread all year round i even plate my finger food platters with this as the centerpiece it's a basic dish that even an amateur cook can make costs about eight dollars and each roll will be enough for 10 guests to grab a few bites total prep time is only about 15 minutes let's get to it for this recipe you'll need eight ounces of cream cheese softened four ounces of mascarpone softened one and a half cups shredded mozzarella three fourths of a cup of gorgonzola cheese half cup dried tomatoes chopped half cup of kalamata olives sliced half cup of parsley chopped and a half cup of chopped hazelnuts or pistachios of your choice [Music] what i've done so far is taken a french baguette and i've cut them into one inch diagonal slices i'm gonna lay these out on a cookie sheet brush them with olive oil and put a little fresh rosemary on each slice we're gonna cook them at 325 for about 15 minutes and pull them out of the oven and tap them when they have a hollow sound that means they're dry and crisp and that's what we want to hold the weight of the cheese [Music] one whole loaf will fit on this just got to move them around you might have to get them cozy and tight in there but it all work also before you use the olive oil don't pour it directly from the bottle put it in a little cup use a pastry brush and then brush the olive oil on each slice that'll help it for not getting too soggy and control the portions evenly [Music] also put the thicker slices in the middle of the baguette up top and the smaller place pieces in the center that'll control cooking i'm gonna grab some olive oil i'm gonna get my pastry brush out also and my fresh rosemary so just across each slice you want to give it a sheen but you don't want it to be soggy okay i've brushed one side of the baguette slices i turn them over and then brush and olive oil on the opposite side now i'm going to take some fresh rosemary and i'm going to just slice it really thin so again just some real small slices in here i think it would be equivalent to a chop oh i wish you could be here to smell this it smells so aerobic and earthy right now one of my favorite herbs to cook with okay and just a little tiny sprinkle on each slice you don't want to saturate it just a little color [Music] we're not going to turn these over and we'll take them out to cool and my bees are cooling we'll start the cheese roll i love the smell of the olive oil and the yeast and the bread and the rosemary all together they marry really well for for flavor and smell so now i'm going to put the sliced baguette in the oven on the bottom rack we're going to put the timer on for 10 minutes check them might add 10 minutes at a pop until we start getting that hollow sound and if i feel like the bottoms are over browning i'll move them up a rack on the oven [Music] so now we're gonna get a bowl out and start mixing the ingredients for the cheese roll [Music] now we're gonna start mixing the cream cheese up just make sure it's really soft and creamy and then we're gonna add the blue cheese [Music] this is also the mascarpone blended in with the cream cheese they're pretty similar they're both cream cheeses but the american cream cheese is a little denser and that's why i like to blend them and if you can see it's nice and creamy and soft there's no lumps in it it should look like really thick cake batter once you have that then you're going to add the gorgonzola [Music] this doesn't need to be beaded as much as blended and just stir it around you can smash it down a little bit but not like the cream cheese now you can see it's really blended but you definitely see the chunks of gorgonzola in there the cream cheese is nice incorporated now we're going to add the shredded mozzarella again that's one and a half cups finely shredded mozzarella seems to work a little better in this recipe but if not if you can't find it it's okay don't need to smash and beat it just blend it around until it's incorporated nice and creamy it's all incorporated now i'm going to add some of the other ingredients first i'm going to add the heavier ingredients which are the kalamata olives and the sun-dried tomatoes these sun-dried tomatoes are in olive oil so i want to make sure i get that excess olive oil out so i'm going to put them in some paper towels squish out that extra moisture first before i chop them up and put them in the cheese mixture [Music] again this was a half a cup roll the sun-dried tomatoes up [Music] twist the opposite ends and you can see all the olive oil coming up that's exactly what you want a little olive oil is okay it's going to add moisture to the cheese which will be fine but we just don't want an excessive amount of it [Music] i'm going to chop these up it can be a coarse chop it doesn't have to be really fine [Music] turn over what you're chopping check it out make sure it looks more uniform than not you don't want a really long strip of sun-dried tomato and then something really small i'm going to take this and add it to the cheese mixture now i'm going to take the olives and do the same thing with the paper towel to get any of the extra brine out just like we did the sun-dried tomatoes twist the opposite ends to get out extra moisture a little bit's okay [Music] now i'm going to slice the olives to add to the other ingredients in the bowl with the cheese [Music] maybe like three slices per olive just like if you were to open up a can of pre-cut olives that kind of thickness [Music] now i'm just checking to make sure they're all sliced up one stray here i'm gonna work on that one [Music] now they're all sliced okay i'm gonna take this and add it also to the cheese mixture [Music] ten minutes just went off on the baguette slices so i'm going to check them out right now i can tell by looking at them they're not done yet but i'm also going to do the tap test they're starting to get a little dry and hollow when i tap them they're not quite done yet i'm going to move them up a shelf put them in for another 10 minutes and then they'll definitely be done now the recipe calls for half cup total parsley but i'm only going to take gosh a cup which will equal a couple of tablespoons once it's chopped the rest is going to get chopped but this and um the nuts will be on the outside like a crust that we're going to roll the log in back and forth before we put it in the refrigerator [Music] just going to go through and rough cut it [Music] i'm going to add this to the bowl as well and now i'm going to mix that together it's not going to take a lot of work because we've already creamed the cheeses together and that's really the most dense part of the recipe and so these were just blending in and mixing together i'm going to stop get those runaways try to escape the bowl now this time i'm going to take a rubber scraper i'm going to clean off my spoon [Music] and down around the bowl and you can see on the top before i did this it looked incorporated but when i got the bottom up and the sides down you can see it still needs some blending over here so that's what i'm going to do now so now i'm going to cut the pistachio nut and this will be part of the crust that goes on the outside so just take your time you can also put this in a small food processor but sometimes it comes out powdery and then chunky i just like to be able to control this since the cheese roll itself is not really large i like to make sure that the nuts and the parsley going on the outside creating the crust are more uniform and also just look if you see some really large pieces go ahead and just randomly chop those up like i noticed right now they're more on the outskirts of the cutting board so i'm looking for those specifically all right those look great on my green cutting board i'm going to take the parsley the remaining parsley from the half cup and now i'm going to chop this up it can be coarse it doesn't have to be super [Music] fun [Music] i'm going to move this to its own bowl because i'm going to cut a little bit more rosemary also to put on the outside for the crust maybe just two tablespoons of this doesn't take a lot it's so fragrant oh my goodness make sure you get off the ends those are really um bitter and they're coarse and they don't have a good texture when you try to go bite into them i'm gonna discard that the other ones look good i'm actually gonna use my smaller paring knife for this okay same thing take this chopped up rosemary go ahead and put it in its separate bowl okay now i'm going to take some wax paper i'm actually going to take two different sheets same size and layer one on top of the other the reason being is the first layer that the cheese touches is i'm going to be manipulating the cheese to create that roll then i'm going to roll that onto the next layer and we're going to put these dry crust ingredients down on the wax paper and work it together so it completely covers the cheese and then we're going to put it in the fridge and it makes almost like a soft crust gives it amazing flavor and texture combination as well give yourself some extra wax paper because you're going to end up twisting the ends and turning it under [Music] it doesn't have to be exactly the same size but try to get as close as possible [Music] okay take the cheese mixture i'm going to put it out on the wax paper what i'm going to do is i'm going to put this somewhat in the shape i want it and then just start manipulating the log rolling it sometimes you might need an extra piece of wax paper too depends on how creamy the cheese is when you started with it wash my hands a quick second my husband teases me because i'm always washing my hands cleaning the counter like separate cutting boards and he teases me and he says barb are we performing surgery in the kitchen are you cooking in the kitchen just how i was raised if you've noticed i'm pressing the cheese out trying to give it somewhat of a uniform shape [Music] as you pull your hands across the cheese roll and as you're manipulating the wax paper you can feel the density of it you want to try to get it as even as possible across the top and then on the ends pat it in [Music] i'm going to open it and check it out [Music] you can see it's starting to take shape i'm going to actually turn the wax paper on this side and do the same thing [Music] so i'm going to move this to the side first thing i'm going to put are the pistachios they're the most dense of the three ingredients and you just want to roll it out like this there's a big one what i'm going to do is take this slog open it up try to get it even over the pistachios where they're at on the clean wax paper and what i'm going to do is very gently fold it over you can see how it already made a crust going to roll it back the other way and all these loose pistachios i'm going to put on top gently take your finger around pick up any that have dropped gently press them in roll it back again and i'll show you on this side you can see all those pistachios just use your finger go all the way down the side now you'll be able to touch it because it's not so tacky and the nuts make a nice barrier between your hands and the cheese roll it up take all these strays and with the extras we're going to do the same thing my mom used to love pistachios [Music] roll it again and again your hands look at there's virtually no cheese on my hands because the pistachios make a barrier we want to show love to the ends too so if you need to take some of these spare pistachios put them in gonna roll it again now on this area i'm going to put the chopped parsley this particular combination with the red sun-dried tomatoes and the vibrant calamales and the green herbs with the green pistachios is really pretty at christmas time the extra parsley on the side rolling it and you can see as we add the different layers the cheese roll keeps its shape okay what i'm going to do now so i'm going to move this to the center of the wax paper and you can see that was really easy to do all these loose herbs any pistachios that's okay because this is what we're going to do okay make sure it's center widthwise and [Music] lengthwise you're going to roll this down [Music] then you're going to take the ends and twist it [Music] you're going to take those underneath and you're going to refrigerate this for two to four hours for all the flavors to marry and for the cheese to get firm again [Music] well there you go it's fun to experiment with seasonal ingredients and different flavors for example we've made them one way for christmas dinner and another way for super bowl sunday with buffalo kick instead let me know in the comments what fun variations you come up with until next time remember the simplest dishes can mean the most [Music] you", "u9IF2UubLZk": "welcome back everyone are you ready are you ready I hope you're ready so for a moment just before we start we are going to talk about auto lease because we talked about this the other night and that's what we're going to do with this bread we're going to auto lease it auto lease means before we add all the rest of our dough ingredients to our pool eesh which I just showed you our pre ferment we are going to do kind of a premix almost with just the remaining water the remaining flour and since we're using a pool eesh that required so much of the water from the overall dough recipe we are going to put the pollution normally you don't put a pre ferment in why don't you normally put a pre ferment in your auto lease because it creates acidity from all the yeasts that's in there and normally that would toughen the dough and the gluten bonds that you're trying to create and that is not what we want however our polish has so little yeast in it that it's not going to make a difference but if we were to omit that from our auto lease there would be so little remaining water for the amount of flour that we're putting in there for the final dough that it would leave little chunks of raw flour in there and we don't want that in our final dough right right right right right okay so let's look at our final ingredients and I'll show you what we're putting in and what we're not putting in just yet hi guys so there's our polish our entire police is going to go in and if you see we have about quadrupled in size and like I told you last night your polish is going to be more like a batter than it is a dough because it has what one hundred percent hydration this is important one hundred percent hydration means that when we made this we put equal parts by weight of flour and water in here also with just a little bit of East so this is going to be very loose this isn't a stiff this is Anna stiff biga and it's not an old dough a pat ferment from a previous batch so we're going to do that and we have one pound five point four ounces of bread flour or four and seven eighths cups and then we have ten point oh thank you um my hair won't take a curl to save my life and it never has I've gotten perms and used every roller and every bit of chemical in the salon and it's never worked my hair is resistant so we're going to use 10.6 ounces of water at around 105 degrees or one and three-quarters cups so I'm going to prop you guys over top of my mixer and then we will keep going just have to give me a second to find the absolute right angle that I had you guys set up on I think that's it actually I think I had you guys the other way duh yes I think this was better yeah and I can see what I'm doing this way too alright so first we add z h 2 o that's my scientist accent because we're kind of being mad scientists and having fun then we add the flour bread flour I don't know why I have to do the accent but I just feel like I have to do the accent and lastly our beautiful polish it helps at this point yeah Oh pack tonight away poop me see if I can grab one real quick it helps at this point if you have a um a bowl scrape for dough oh can I reach it can I read you can arrange it it I have all sorts of tools hanging out back in my one cabinet is that it's that's not all right oh well can use my spatula I prefer my dolls my bowls great but we are going to add our pool eesh I have my mixer away from me right now so it's a little awkward trying to get you guys real good light in a real good angle to see this without me creating shadow and obstructing it so I'm not usually this awkward using a spatula or with the general scraping process now that just provided us a whole bunch of moisture but do you guys remember why we're auto leasing just so you know I can't actually I can't see what your comments are at the moment do you know why we are auto leasing well what it'll do for us is it Alex it'll increase the extensibility which is the stretch ability of the dough it's going to create some initial tender gluten bonds even though we're only going to mix it for a very short period of time it's still going to help develop those we are going to reduce the overall mixing time which is going to prevent some oxidation in the loss of carotenoids but why does this stuff matter because in the final dough it's going to give us during it while it's in the oven give us a lot more volume it's going to spring more we're going to have a really really beautiful flavor and because it's springing more we're going to have that more open crumb that we really want out of a baguette and those cuts on the top are going to be more pronounced and beautiful and exactly as they should be so so let's put I've got a dough hook by the way make sure you use a dough hook no paddles definitely no whisks we're going to lock it and in your stand mixer we are simply going to turn it on to the very first click to the stir and let it go only until this has incorporated don't double your batch in a standard mixer you're going to flower absolutely everywhere but we are looking to bring all of these together so that you don't have any more dough on the side of the bowl or flour excuse me and so that it's all mixed together now you're going to watch this for about 20 to 60 minutes see how it's starting to pick stuff up from the side of the mixer from around the side of the bowl and mix are starting to struggle all right we have a pretty good homogenous mix let's just have us another look at it I got some I've got some really wet stuff up here so I'm going to scrape that down real quick and gently mix again maybe flop it over a little but we want all of that stuff to be pretty much incorporated nicely we're not going crazy mixing we're not looking to develop gluten during this mix we're just looking to hydrate our flour and get a boof pins come now get a nice consistent mix okay that's looking pretty let's have a look ah that makes me much happier okay so what we are going to do is we are going to put a piece of plastic just around the bowl in here let me grab my plastic I got one of those big old rules those industrial sized rules and I love this thing we are just going to carefully wrap this around in here we want to prevent air from getting in here in forming any kind of crustiness you're just putting it on gently you are not even pressing it directly to the surface you're just trying to keep air flow out of there there's best you can so now now no no no no now we're gonna have that rest for about 20 to 60 minutes we have to watch it to see when it you know starts to kind of come together and becomes a little bit softer on the surface where you don't see as much of that almost rough-looking patches so we're going to watch that for 20 or 60 minutes I can't tell you what I'm going to be back because I actually got my kitchen to about 76 degrees right now so I'm hoping that that will optimize exactly what we have going on in the bowl here what type of bread am I making I am making baguette starting with a Polish preferment now why don't we add the yeast in this in the auto lease because as we talked about before with adding the pool eesh the yeast will create acidity the polish itself doesn't have enough yeast in there to create acidity in the final dough what does acidity do to your dough during the auto lease it strengthens it we're not looking to strengthen it right now we don't want to do that also we don't add salt during the auto lease because salt does the same thing it toughens and strengthens your dough and that's not what we want to do right now why don't we want to do it because we haven't done the final mix for yet and once we do the final mix if it's too tough and too strong part of me it's too tough and too strong we're actually going to damage all that beautiful gluten structure that we've created we're going to tear it apart and once you do that you kind of hurt the dough kind of permanently is it going to make awful baguette yes okay no but it's not going to be the beautiful baguette that you wanted from this so just listen to me just add your poo leash that little bit of beasts not going to hurt it don't add your final used not add your salt so we're going to let this sit for about 20 to 60 minutes I can't really tell you how long that's going to be for me but check back again if you're following this you know and not and not doing it until you see the full process that's probably perfect just because your temperature and your humidity your climate in your kitchen is going to differ than mine and actually it's starting to feel a little warmer over by this window than it did before from the Sun coming in I have a south-facing window right here so I may have to turn my air on to try and bring the the temperature my kitchen down a little optimally the temperature in your kitchen will be about 72 76 degrees because we want our final dough temperature to be 76 degrees so if we have it in an overly warm kitchen it's going to write then too quickly and we have to take into account that when we do our final mix this mixer is going to have some friction and it's going to add to the temperature of the dough in the bowl so we do our best to control as much as we can just being mindful don't go crazy if this is your first time making bread you know thinking about those things they're just interesting things to keep in your head so that if something doesn't seem right your process is about an hour behind mine that's probably perfect Jen so if if something doesn't seem quite right as you go along in the process it's not going to be fatal don't give up don't take your dough and chuck it across the kitchen those are the things i do and regret them learn from it learn from it and you know we can troubleshoot we can talk about it so it's always a good learning experience when we are all done with our dough at the end of the day I I'm going to ask everybody after you've baked off even if it's not till tomorrow on the thread that we have in the facebook group the foodie bedtime stories periscope group which everyone is welcome to find the group on facebook I will approve you in that thread where our recipe is I mean I ask everyone to post pictures of their bread we're all going to show off what we did um it's a good learning experience it's absolutely great so let's wait let's see when I can come back to this dough and watch for my periscope okay see you very very shortly", "xDZokQG0VZ4": "and at this point you know you can stop kind of move it around feel for it and you're then going to cut it into shapes they could bake it like that do you want it to ever be fine but I can cut this cut this into three language just never very easy flat part the scraper bit more flour where and a neighbor cart and push down so you can push it from side to side you never push them or you lose it you lose their father's right having done that now with your ones you probably cut it into two I'm going to make two pieces of that now you want to stretch it so we've got nice bubbles we want to stretch them out even further you do that by getting underneath it I'm sure you know stick to a given just kidding okay having stretched it out you can then cut it into whatever size piece you want like that's quite a long DS or a kind of sandwich size okay to do that at the end of a kneading so it's already in the bowl and already in the mix you must spread them out so that cooks pretty quick do that 20 minutes oh let's see", "IxVSlizlt-s": "today I'm going to show you how to shape a high hydration dope I'll show you both how to shape a pool and how to shape a batard hi i'm soon and I'm a food geek today I'm going to show you how to shape a high hydration dough into a round loaf also known as a bull and a cigar shaped loaf also known as a petard I assume since you here that you're working on learning the craft of making artisan sourdough bread so I have a couple of videos that may interest you after you've finished watching this one the first one is my beginner sourdough bread recipe this bread has a hydration of 70% not so high that it's too difficult to work with but still a departure of the low hydration yeast of loaves that you've probably baked before the second video is all about the things that you need to be aware of so that you can put out amazing sourdough bread every single time if you sometimes get awesome bread but the next time you get a frisbee this is the video for you it's probably more than one aha moment for you in there the third video is about bakers percentages which are widely used in salad or baking if you want to know how it works how to make your own recipes and how to calculate hydration this is the video for you if you're new to this channel I baked a lot of sourdough bread and I make delicious food from all over the world I'm at a quest to get the most from every ingredient and my goal is to teach you how to do that in simple and understandable steps so join me by subscribing and ringing the bell so you won't miss any future videos the dough that I'm using in this video is a 75% hydration dough with 20% freshly milled whole-wheat flour with the right handling the stowe can give you an amazing open crumb for effective shaping you can get by with your hands but as hydration goes up having a bench scraper will be your best friend put a link in the description for a good inexpensive bench scraper that'll get you far so enough talking let's get on with the shaping the first part of the shaping process is the pre shaping we'll do it like this flip the dough over and I pull out a side and pull it in over the dough then grab the other side and pull that in over and then go from the top and then the bottom then I flip the dough back over and now we have a little bit of surface tension on the top and we'll pull the dough over the table using the bench scraper in the back using your hand as a guide build a little bit more of that surface tension not too much in this first shaping we'll put the dough away and then we'll work on the other three pieces of dough that I have for this video the exact same process [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] after 20 to 30 minute rest it's time to actually finally shape the dough for this first piece of dough we're gonna do a bull and the process is exactly the same as the pre-shape so both aside in over the dough that wasn't perfect was it I'll try again just want to work that surface tension then the last side flip it over and now this time we go a little bit further we want to build to that surface tension so it's really nice and taut as you can see it's getting tighter and tighter for each revolution [Music] [Music] then we'll work the next dough ball will do another fool pull out the side and pull it in over the dough go from each corner built the surface tension on the top flip the dough ball back over and then pull it across the table and get that surface tension built now it's time to shape the bat art start by flowering your kitchen counter flip the dough ball onto the flour and pull it out into a rectangle as you can see I'm flowering my hands a little bit so that the dough won't stick to my fingers [Music] once you have a rectangle pull the side out and fold it in over the middle do the same thing from the other side and then I start rolling the dough up into this little roll you can see I pull and I roll a bit and then I grab the sides and I pulled them down to make a nice rounded edge then I grab my bench scraper and I flip over the dough Oh a little bit flour on my hands a bit and I lift it up and put it into the bandits on the bandits on is already floured with rice flour then I like to stitch the dough to make sure that the surface tension is just super toned also the edges a little bit then we need a little more flour for the last one it's the same principle flip the dough onto on the flour and pull it out into a rectangle [Music] [Music] and pull out the side and fold it in over the dough or Pat it down and then we pull the other side and fold it over the the other flap and then we roll it up full roll pull roll make sure it's tight and and then we just fix the edges so you can see I pull down the dough and tuck it underneath and then the same thing on the other side [Music] just making sure that it's all of the way taught and then pick it up and into the flower band time again a little bit of stitching [Music] and then fix the edges there we go that's two pools and two batard shaped now all that's left is bake them and you'll have some officing bread don't they look pretty so that's my way of shaping high hydration dough I use both of them all the time and if you keep using them you'll learn how the dough reacts to you and you scraper I hope you learned something today see you next time [Music]", "yTOqD5EBVz8": "hi I'm Steve and welcome to my kitchen today I want to show you how to make one of my most popular breads Italian sesame seed bread I'm going to show you how to make one dough and how to use that bill to make a bolo sandwich bread and

get started 14 ounces cool tap water there's no reason to use warm water you have a long proofing time and cool water is better for that 1 and 1/2 teaspoon salt I use a teaspoon then I make the teaspoon heat beat that gives me a teaspoon and a half 1/4 teaspoon instant yeast shake the level and it goes we're going to put in some sesame seeds 1 tbsp and one tablespoon olive oil when you have an Italian threat you'll have olive oil in it if it's a French mint they don't use olive oil a fresh baguette as an example does not have olive oil in it I'll stir to combine 3 and 1/2 cups bread flour let's start out with a half cup note I'm going to drop it on the side if you drop it on the side it doesn't splash 1 cup I drop it on the other 1/2 and three shape the level does not have to be precise think about it when you see a baker when they get through the door what do they do they roll it in flour because you can add flour to it just isn't a problem it doesn't have to be precise it's a very forgiving recipe stir to combine okay going to go around the outsides and draw it in go around the outside and draw it in going around the outside that brings a lot of it into the main in the center ball and now look I have 90% of it in the book go in the center I scraped the outside that brings the last go into the dough ball then I'm going to tumble it that just takes the bottom brings it up the bottom might have some dry flour on it and it just introduces it to the wet and that's how simple lays all we need to do now is cover the dough with plastic wrap and it's ready to proof no need those should be proof for 8 to 24 hours I generally proof overnight on the kitchen counter that there was proved overnight and it's time to make the bread the dough s proofed overnight and more than doubled in size the first steps didi gasps pull it stretch the dough to make it into a smaller go ball okay I want to scrape my sides I want to get all the dough in so a little bit there but we want to get it in next thing we're going to do is we're going to cut the outside of the dole with sesame seeds you seem that this is a sticky dough and let's take advantage of it if we add the sesame seeds now they will stick I'm putting two tablespoons in then I'm going to take the dough ball roll it in the sesame seeds okay that we're going to do for all of them this is a starting point now we can fix it several different ways the first one is I'm going to do it in the Dutch oven now the Dutch oven is put in the oven and this preheat it because it shouldn't be preheated in the oven we have to put it into something else to proof I put it in what I call a proofing skillet I'm going to spray the proofing skill above no-stick spray I'm going to roll the dough out put it in the proofing skillet put the hook to the side now why this is advantageous is it will shape the dough to a round shape then when this is hot I'll be able to open it up and just plop it in so we're ready to proof all we need to do now is cover the poofy skillet with a lint-free towel and it's ready to proof proof though for 30 to 60 minutes before bill was fully proved move oven rack to load through to the oven place Dutch oven in oven and preheat to 450 degrees and here's how easy it is to pass the dough on this is a hot Dutch oven so I'm using hot pads I'll shake the center cover back on and take it up to the other bake for 30 minutes with the lid on and 5 to 15 minutes with the lid off depending upon how rustic you like your crust once again we're starting at the same point that was proved overnight I'm going to be gas pull stretch it going around the outside bring them to go into the middle what are the reasons I use plastic is because still sticks us to it great the excess dough from the sides add two tablespoons sesame seeds and putting some on the side of the glass so that when we roll it it'll pick up on that now I'm going to roll the dough the end of sesame seeds and look how well they stick you got wet dough sticks real easy so we're going to bake it in a grand pan I use bread crams with rounded corners that are better this is an eight and a half by a four and a half nice pan what I love about it is this flat edge here this is really nice it's easy to clean it'll show you why I like that flat edge in a minute I'm gonna spray it with no sticks break through the bottom side side side and side here's how easy it is just take your dough and roll it into the bread bread pan I'm not even going to shape it it will shape itself as it rises that's how easy it is all we need to do now is cover the pan with a lint-free towel and it's ready - proof proof dough for 30 minutes before dough was fully proved move oven rack to lower through the oven and preheat to 400 degrees bake for 40 minutes at 400 degrees now I'd like to show you the newest technique you take that same bread pan that you would have used instead of baking it open you cover it I'm going to spray the edge of their prey the edge there because it's a dough Rises it might touch those two spots like this by the way is why you like this to be nice and flat because that will rest perfectly on there I'll take a binder clip the same type you get a stationary store I put it on the end there put it on the other end and now I have a closed environment now why you would like to do this is this protects the crust and give you a soft crust if you have children and your children don't like the hard crust of a rustic loaf of bread this will give you a softer crust proofed over 30 minutes before bill was fully proved move oven rack to lower third of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees bake for 40 minutes at 400 degrees with the top on and 3 to 10 minutes with the top off because a poor man and protects the crust from the heating element it can be used to bake bread in a toaster oven I like to bake bread in a toaster oven because it's energy-efficient and it doesn't overheat the kitchen in the summer set toaster oven to 400 degrees and bake for 45 minutes five extra minutes because the toaster of it is not preheated and it is not necessary to bake it with the top off because it is closer to the heating element so let's make some dinner rolls and to start with a single ball you gasp pull and stretch bring the ball down scrape the sides garnish with sesame seeds 2 tablespoons notice and putting it on the glass I want some excess on the glass so that when I lit this you'll be able to run underneath nope and there we go okay when you make rolls this time you're going to have to handle it this dough ball is a bit sticky the way to solve that is I add some flour roll to coat it in the flour put a little flour on the work surface roll the dough out on the flour form it into a circle this is called a bowl scraper when you wash these bowls you can use that edge of this bowl scraper I'll clean it okay I'm going to cut it in half whoops I didn't spray the that's what I need to do see I use bacon vessels to form a shape my rolls you don't have to shape them by hand you always can if you would like to if you don't have to I'm going to cut this in half then I just take it pop it in pop it in pop it in cut it in half cut it in quarters pop it in pop it in there we go now they look really irregular right now but don't worry about that as they rise they will fill oak upset well we need to do now is cover the pan with a lint-free towel and it's ready to proof proof go for 30 minutes before dough was fully proved we'll welcome back to the middle of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees bake for 15 minutes at 450 degrees the bread is ready let's take a look and here's Fred here's a bolo outside of the Dutch oven sandwich bread out of a poor man's Dutch oven and

I'm Esbieta. Bread\nFrench that I bring you today for me has been a great revelation. Its very small size and its beautiful shape,\nits crust so crunchy and its crumb so fluffy make it a real treat. This bread, friends, eat like pipes\ndelicious that is. And I've known him thank you to you. Thanks to you have spoken to me\nof him, asking him to do it. And for them I am very grateful. The recipe is from Panera magazine, where they say\nwhich is a Peruvian bread although it is recognized the French influence. It is considered the\nbread of greater consumption at breakfast. And it does not surprise me because it's ideal for\nbreakfasts and even for snacks. East bread, friends, is a clear example that the\nshape and size influence taste. Everyone who makes bread at home in should\nTry this marvel, as an experiment. To prepare the French bread you will need\nthe next ingredients: 350 g of all-purpose wheat flour or flour\nof wheat with 10.5 - 11.5% proteins 8 g of salt\n8 g of butter 4 g fresh yeast or 1.4 g dry\n210 g of water 105 g of fermented dough Old mass 65 g of all-purpose wheat flour or flour\nof wheat with 10.5 - 11.5% proteins 40 g of water\n1 g of salt 1.5 g of fresh yeast or 0.5 g of dry If you do not know what old mass is, do not worry\nbecause it becomes very easy and in less than 1 minute.\nPut the yeast in a container. Add the water and stir. The water is about\n25-30\u00baC. You can use the yeast, both fresh and\nthe dry, the amounts are in the ingredients. Add the flour. Add the salt. Remove very well. Close the container and let it stand until\nthat goes up a little, about 30 min. Deflate the dough and store it in the fridge\nfrom 8 to 24 hours. I do it at night to use it the next day. Remove the old dough from the refrigerator. In a container put the yeast. Add the water of about 25 - 30\u00baC. Stir until the yeast is diluted. Sift the flour. Add the salt. Remove a little. Add the old mass. Finish making the ball with your hand. Add the butter and integrate it into the dough. Close the container and leave the dough at rest\nabout 20 minutes, so they get properly moistened the flour particles. Pour the dough on the table clean and dry\nand massage it until it becomes smooth, elastic and stop sticking to your hands. You can knead the dough in the mixer, they would be\n10 minutes in 2 speed. I've been slow to knead the dough for about 10 minutes. It is a very pleasant mass to the touch, very manageable\nand it's not sticky at all. A joy of mass. Put the dough in the container and let it rise\ndoubling its size. At 27\u00baC my mass took 45 minutes to rise.\nAt a lower temperature it will take longer to rise and vice versa. Roll the dough on the table and knead it\nminute. We are sorry Divide the dough into portions. Usually the\nportions are 40 g but I made them 55 g each. Make balls. Grab a cloth or a piece of cloth and sprinkle it\nwith flour. Form the loaves starting with the first ball\nwhat did you do. Put them on the cloth mouth low. Let them rise almost doubling their size. When 20 minutes are left to finish the levado\nturn on the oven at 250\u00baC with heat from above and below. At the bottom of the oven put a tray for\npour the water and create the steam. At 28\u00baC my rolls have been slow to rise\n35 minutes. At a lower temperature it will take more in uploading and vice versa. On a tray lined with baking paper\nplace the muffins face up. Put them in the oven. In the bottom tray, pour half a glass of\nboiling water. Bake rolls 18 - 20 minutes or until\nthat remain as you like. Remove the rolls from the oven. Place them on a rack to cool them down. I do not know what they usually eat in Peru,\nI would love that our Peruvian friends they will tell us, but I have eaten them so much\nwith salty things as with sweets and superbly.

together in a ball and we are going to grease our bowl and let it sit for about an hour but first we need to get it into a nice cohesive ball of dough this is kind of a mess here whoo lots and lots of kneading here so it's really coming together as you can see it is coming together but we have a lot more kneading that we need to do and kudos to all your bakers who do this by hand i'm lazy and i have my kitchenaid at home with my dough hook but good practice and good muscle exercise are muscle exercise for me can you hold the bowl sure dad okay all right just a little bit more of this and we'll be back so our dough has come together really nicely in a nice round dough mound and dad could you please spray the bowl around the sides and on the bottom with the pam so we're gonna spray our bowl because as this rises okay okay that's good okay i need a paper towel i did it well it's [Laughter] okay that's good so we are going to uh put our dough into our bowl and into the bowl and we're going to cover it with saran wrap and let it rise for about an hour maybe a little bit more so it's about doubled in size and um then we'll be back all right it's been about an hour and let's see what we have here what do you think dad beautiful it looks like a lump a lump okay a lump of dough for our bread but you'll see that it's doubled in size and what i'm going to do i'm just going to press it down like this i'm deflating it again and we're going to just form it into another round dough ball and put it back in and cover it back up it's a process definitely a process and we're going to let this sit here for about another 30 minutes to 45 minutes and then we're going to roll it out sounds good sounds good yup are you into rolling the dough no the bread has risen for another 30 minutes and i have floured the counter and we are going to roll this dough roll it out into a rectangle so i'm gonna take the dough and roll it as square as i can like into a rectangle then we're going to roll it up like a jelly like a jelly roll i'm a very good helper here with the dishes so i've rolled out the dough into a somewhat of a rectangle and we're just going to start at the bottom here and we're going to just going to roll it into a little tube like a jelly roll and once we get to the end we're going to tuck the sides in so i'm just going to kind of grab the sides and kind of tuck them tuck them in grab the sides or the end i should say not the sides okay so that almost like a baguette but this is gonna more than double in size so there we go so we have it in a nice roll i have a baking sheet lined with parchment i'm just going to take that put this on there and we're going to let this rise another hour and um we'll bake welcome back everyone we're on to the last phase last phase dad okay okay and look at our bread look how it's rising what do you think do you think we did okay it's big it is big we've done all right so we are going to take um an egg wash and we are going to spread it over the loaf would you like to do something this will give the bread some nice browning and a nice crust when it's when it's all baked so we're just going to spread that over it's just one beaten egg not using the whole thing just to get get it spread onto the to the dough and we are going to take a serrated knife and we are going to make some slashes in the dough so it has room to grow as it as it's baking so that's what we're doing now we're going to put it in the oven and let's see what we get when it comes out here's our finished loaf we're out of the oven look at that look at that what do you think dad beautiful can we do okay yes like what a piece well we have to wait a little bit it's still very very warm but you can have a piece you're a great help thank you thank you how did you like helping me make bread today i didn't do much well i enjoyed your company thank you i enjoyed yours too i'm working with limited this is okay that's fine okay and one

oh carbs delicious my name is cj and today we're gonna make packets now i know that making vegas and it sounds very intimidating for some of you but i promise you it's actually not that difficult the recipe that i'm gonna show you today requires little to no kneading at all um it literally only takes about 10 minutes of active time and the rest is down time so the secret ingredient to making baguettes is time you gotta have time and patience because it does require double proofing now i know that there's a lot of different recipes lots of different variants of the baguettes out there but the baguette that we're gonna make today is the traditional way of making baguettes that means that we're only gonna need four ingredients that is flour water yeast and salt that's it no honey no sugar just these four ingredients i hope you'll give it a try and if you do let me know in the comments down below how it turned out you can also tag me on instagram or facebook at all carbs delicious i'd love to see your creations now let's bake some baguettes shall we so we're gonna start by adding the yeast into the water make sure it's lukewarm because if it's too warm then you'll kill the yeast and if it's too cold then the yeast won't get activated whisk the mixture till the yeast is entirely dissolved into the water then put it aside for a few minutes until it becomes bubbly and foamy meanwhile mix flour and salt in a large mixing bowl till it's evenly distributed then make a well in the middle of your mixing bowl and pour in the activated yeast mixture take a spatula and mix everything [Music] if the dough is too dry or doesn't come together add a little bit of extra water one tablespoon at a time the dough will be quite sticky but try to shape it into a ball with your hands it doesn't have to be a perfect ball cover the dough i always use a shower cap for this but you can use a kitchen towel or cling wrap as well then let it proof for 45 to 60 minutes in a warm place until it has doubled in size meanwhile place a container filled with hot water at the bottom of your oven the hot water will create a steamy environment in the oven thus creating crunchier crust on your baguettes if you have a baking stone place it on a middle rack in your oven then start preheating your oven at 230 degrees celsius or 450 degrees fahrenheit next line a baking tray that is big enough for your buckets with parchment paper [Music] this is my favorite part it's been about an hour now and the dough has doubled in size wet your hand and punch the air out of the dough [Music] then transfer the dough onto a floured working surface to prevent sticking a bench scraper will come in handy for this [Music] sprinkle on some extra flour on the dough then divide your dough in the number of portions of your choice [Music] i like to cut mine in 4 to make four smaller baggets so i can easily freeze them in if they can't be finished at once [Music] shape your dough into a rectangle then roll it up tightly starting from the longest end [Music] seal the seam by pinching the dough together then roll it out into your desired length [Music] transfer it onto your baking tray and repeat these steps for the remaining portions cover them with a kitchen towel and let them proof in a warm place for another 30 to 60 minutes until doubled in size when your oven is ready and the dough has doubled in size score the baguettes with a lame or sharp knife you want to cut the baguette at a 45 degree angle applying swift and confident slashes these cuts create weak spots in the dough while baking allowing controlled expansion instead of rendering random cracks on the baguettes transfer the baguettes into the oven and bake for minimum 20 minutes for a lighter crust or a few minutes longer until the baguettes feature a golden brown crunchy crust [Music] let the buckets cool off on a cooling rack and proudly enjoy your fresh baguettes made from scratch bon appetit throw a

bread you can find the original recipe in my cookbook from France to the farm which is available on Amazon I think you should give this video a thumbs up and be sure to subscribe if you haven't and follow me over on Instagram because that's where you and I can hang out every day [Music] this is it this is my crusty country loaf the one you've been asking for this loaf you've seen in so many videos here on the preach and farmgirl channel and I'd love to share with you how to bake it it's so easy I think if you are a bread baking beginner this is the perfect first step into the world of baking bread we're not going to use a sourdough starter today we're not going to use a food scale here's what you're going to need flour salt water and yeast and as for equipment I love to have a dough scraper of course you will need some measuring tools you'll want to have parchment paper I think this makes it really easy to handle your dough and a Dutch oven now this is the key to the recipe I'll share why in a little while I have my Dutch oven here and you can see it's used and abused I expose it to some very high temperatures if you don't have a Dutch oven don't panic you can still bake bread today just use a roasting pan anything you have that can handle a high temps and has a lid you want to start this recipe the night before that's what I suggest we're looking at at 12 to 18 hour ferment and then a two hour rise the following day so you'll start with six cups of flour you can divide this recipe in half but I see if you're gonna bake a loaf of bread bake a loaf of bread something that you can make a big beautiful sandwich out of so 6 cups of flour I use King Arthur organic for this recipe [Music] we have six cups of flour and we are going to use a tablespoon of yeast I keep my east in a ball jar and I store it in the refrigerator so you of course can use a measuring spoon and a teaspoon and a half of salt don't forget the salt after you have that all mixed together just take a fork and stir it up and what you want to do is make sure that you get everything on the bottom of the bowl mixed in it's gonna look very shaggy it's going to look like nothing's going to become of it that's okay just make sure you get all the flour at the bottom mixed in otherwise tomorrow morning you'll wake up to this beautiful slightly fermented dough and on the bottom won't be all these flour crumbles so we don't want that if it happens your first few times you will get the hang of it and you'll have flour crumbles no more so we have this saran wrap leftover from when we butchered our cakes but it's really not the most earth-friendly choice so if you can find those reusable covers that's fantastic but this is going to sitt cover it in saran wrap overnight in a nice warm spot my kitchen is pretty cold so since the oven has been running during the day I typically put this at the back of the oven where it's a little bit warmer it needs 12 to 18 hours to ferment so it's really nice to start this little right before you make dinner it can sit all night and then you can get started on it first thing the next morning what we have here is a beautiful dough that has been fermenting all night long [Music] just give it a little work around and let it sit under plastic for 15 minutes our bread has been under saran wrap for about 15 minutes so just take a little flour and your dough scraper flour your work surface and one easy step it's going to press it into a slight rectangle fold it over fold it over turn it over on its back or on it bum turn it a few times and we're going to set it on some parchment paper to do its final rise this just makes it really really easy to put it in the oven grab my loan and if it's out a little wonky just give it a turn no no fuss now this beautiful beautiful loaf is going to sit here for two hours 45 minutes into that 2 hours turn your oven off as high as it will go and put your Dutch oven inside and that's how we're gonna get the gorgeous crust on this loaf of bread because we're mimicking a commercial oven we're mimicking a bread oven by creating an oven within an oven so we're providing maximum heat and humidity for the loaf our beautiful dough has been proofing that's its final rice for the last two hours the oven has been on for 45 minutes now it's time to bake some bread I leave this loaf in for about 30 minutes and then I check on it it's starting to turn golden brown I'll take the lid off and leave it in for a few more minutes when you knock on your loaf you want it to sound hollow that's a sign that it's done if you can resist be sure to let it rest for a while before cutting into it this looks so delicious it's still a little bit warm it's got a beautiful crumb I think you're going to love this recipe now if you'd like me to do a little bit more cooking for you be sure to mention that in the comments and if you'd like some more kitchen inspiration check out this video

making\" At first, the main element is either the hands or the kneading machine. Secondly, of course, the oven. The weighing scale is also important. A baking stone for the bread. A thermometer, essential to check the temperature of the dough. Bread baskets for the flour or the bread. Greaseproof paper for the baking stone. A dough scraper. A dough cutter. A bread lame to sign the bread, it is important. A baker\u2019s brush and a glass of water to moisten the bread before putting it into the oven. And of course, a bowl with some flour in. *The temperature of the water* One of the most important rules of our profession is to calculate the temperature of the water. The temperature of the water that will be poured on the flour, in order to have a dough at 23\u00b0C-24\u00b0C when the kneading is done. At first, take the room\u2019s temperature. Today it is at 22\u00b0C. The flour has been stored in the room for a day and is at the same temperature. So, the room at 22\u00b0C plus the flour at 22\u00b0C equal to 44\u00b0C. And we know that for a kneading in the machine, the ingredients have to reach 70\u00b0C. *Room's T\u00b0 + Flour's T\u00b0 + Water's T\u00b0 = 70\u00b0C*\nSo, 70\u00b0C - 44\u00b0C equal to 26\u00b0C for the water If you knead with your hands, the water should be a bit warmer, because with your hands, you cannot heat the dough up enough. So, I will use a water at 30\u00b0C. Let\u2019s go. *The kneading with the hands* The simple technique is to put the baker\u2019s yeast far from the salt. The salt on the other side, otherwise it will soak the yeast up. The sourdough starter. I always mix with my hands, because I have kept this habit and I can feel the consistency of the starter. It is important. And, then, I\u2019m pouring the water. I\u2019m doing it quickly, I absorb the whole flour. By the way, it is a fascinating thing to do this with children, because they learn how to use their hands. We say that working with your hands freed the mind. And you can think while doing it. I\u2019m mixing and pulling the dough. This is the gesture, it seems easy. But the dough is getting harder. So, the dough is more or less mixed. I will start to incorporate the air inside. I put the dough down, and throw it in front of me. And I\u2019m doing it until the dough no longer sticks to the work surface. You see, there, it\u2019s getting stronger and stronger. I\u2019m throwing and pulling it as much as possible I\u2019m taking it, pulling it and throwing it And I\u2019m turning it through 90 degrees. Once the dough, almost, no longer sticks to the work surface Dust the work table with flour. And shape the dough into a smooth ball. The baker\u2019s bowl is floured. And we put the dough inside and let it rest. *The frequently asked questions* Once the dough is kneaded, can we put it in the fridge? Yes, once the kneading is done, let it rest for 1 hour outside and then you can put it in the fridge. Otherwise, you can let it rest for 2 hours outside. It is called the first rising. Then divide it into equal pieces like these. And you can put them in the fridge and shape them the day after. It works both ways.The fridge will slow down the fermentation. And this is perfect, because the fermentation operates at a slower pace. The second question is knowing when the dough is ready to be used. Look.\nI\u2019m pressing it with my finger. If I\u2019m firmly pressing on it and it goes up to quickly it is not ready, yet. If it goes up slowly, like this. Normally, it is ready to be shaped. If it doesn\u2019t goes up. It\u2019s too late. You\u2019ll have to start over because the dough will never rise in the oven. *The dividing* Once the dough has risen for 2 hours with a flap. It is ready to be shaped. You cut it into 300g pieces. It is easier to shape. Once cut, you can shape it. At first you should prepare the shaping. You bring back every sides in the middle and you form a bowl. Do this very lightly, you don\u2019t want to degas the dough. Once the doughs are ready to be shaped. *Rest 30 min*\nYou have a 30 min rest. Before shaping them on in their final form. *The shaping* I\u2019m about to teach you how to shape a boule, a batard, a baguette and a rectangle called a pav\u00e9. First, the pav\u00e9, the more simple shape. I take the dough and turn it over. I\u2019m slightly degassing it with the palm of the hand. And I\u2019m putting the top on the middle and the bottom on the middle. I\u2019m pushing on the dough, it has to stick. If it doesn\u2019t stick, it won\u2019t work. I\u2019m evenly degassing and putting it on my shelf. The second shape will see is the boule. My thumb in the middle and all the sides of the bowl in the middle. Never forget that the bread rises, it will triple its size. So, you have to give him some space. Third bread, the batard. Always the same thing. I turn the dough over. I degas and I\u2019m rolling the dough out. With your fingers, you take the dough *Roll out 3 times*\nand roll it out 3 times. Or if you don\u2019t do it with your fingers, you can do it with the palm of the hand. My thumb inside and I\u2019m sticking the dough. Same thing, same result. Here, I\u2019m slightly lengthening it. The batard is plump oval, slightly tapered at each end. Here is what I do. Seams underneath. I\u2019m putting it next to my ball. And at last, the famous French baguette. I\u2019m rolling it out like I did for the batard. One, two, three times. The edges are sealed together. If it is not sealed enough, I\u2019m finishing by pinching them together. And now, one hand on the other, and I\u2019m starting to roll it out to create a nice baguette. The seams underneath. Look how nice it is. A pav\u00e9, a boule, a batard and a baguette. To end this shaping stage, once everything is set down the shelf. You take a damp cloth. *Proofing 1h30*\nYou always have to cover the dough or it will crust. *Baking preparation* You have to moisten each bread with a brush and water, in order to avoid the crust to form too quickly. This way, the bread rises at 75\u00b0C and the crust forms. Then take your dough cutter to score the dough. The boule can be scored in a cross shape. The pav\u00e9 in crosshatch. The batard can have just a single slash. And the baguette, as it is shorter, can have 4 slashes. The second slash will always be at the third of the first slash. See, a third, a third, and a third. You just have to put it in the oven. 2O min for the baguettes and 22 min for the smaller breads. *Baking 230\u00b0C* *How do we know that the bread is baked?* When the bread is baked we say that it sings. It should crunch. We can hear it. It is like a little bird singing. And to check if it is baked enough, you knock on it a bit. It should resonate dry. Now it\u2019s your turn to play.", "2FVfJTGpXnU": "{\\an8} So what we're going to do now is, is we're going to show you how to\nmake some sourdough bread. Sourdough has got quite\nfashionable and trendy. It's on a lot of restaurant menus. Sourdough is trending since about\n5000 B.C. It's the oldest form of\nleavened bread. So while we think we've a big\ntradition with soda bread, your granny might have made it - this is what her\ngranny's granny used to make. This is what we're all\ntrying to get back to. So the big revolution,\nthe big future in food, the future in bread, is about going\nback. Back to the past. And this is what we're trying\nto get back to. Beautiful,\nbeautiful sourdoughs, naturally fermented,\nwith our seeded sourdough a bit of malthouse. As I say, you could have a\nhundred different types. In order\nto make sourdough bread, is to make your sourdough starter,\nor your sourdough culture. The process is very, very simple. It's simply just a mix of\nflour and water. So we've got 50 grams of flour and to that we're adding\n50 mls of water. Stir it together. And that is simply it. Now what we're going to do\nis to leave that to sit out in your kitchen,\njust gently covered, ambient temperature, overnight,\nfor about 12 hours. So at the moment, we're\nsurrounded by wild yeast. It's a good strain of bacteria,\nit exists everywhere. You breathe it in everyday. And then basically\nover a process of using simply just flour\nand just water, it eventually picks up that\nbacteria in the air. And that bacteria starts to ferment.\nIt starts to live off the protein within the flour,\nso it starts to rise and collapse. Realistically it takes about\n7 or 10 days to make it. But for a lot of people,\nI know, I'm not making a loaf of bread if\nit takes 7 or 10 days to make it, but the idea is, once you\nget up and going once, that's virtually about it. As long as you don't use it all,\nyou'll never run out. So you only have to do it\none time in your life. So we'll mix it together,\nflour and water. About 12 hours later,\nit looks a little bit like this. So at this stage,\nwe would be due to mix this with another 50 grams of flour\nand another 50 mls of water. Stir it together and that's it. Again, we let it sit overnight. Day 3 we repeat the process. Then on Day 4,\nwe can already see it's starting to become\nlovely and bubbly. You can see all these little bubbles\ncoming lovely and active. And this is the sign of life\nstarting to form. This is exactly what\nwe're looking for. It's starting to ferment. It's all the good things in life -\nwine, beer, cheese, bread. All based on the same principle. So you will find it starts to take\non a sweet, vinegary kind of smell. But don't worry, that's exactly\nwhat we're looking for. But if you find a little liquid\nstarting to come away from it, don't worry about that either,\njust put it straight back in. So we're going to give this\nanother day. And we're going to feed it again -\none more time. And by the time it's ready, most likely on about Day 7. Don't worry\nif you find that maybe, on Day 6 or Day 7,\nit's not exactly there yet. Don't be afraid to give it\nan extra day. Because it will differ, depending on\nthe environment it was kept in. So if it needs an extra day, just\ngive it an extra day. But now we've got our lovely\nactive sourdough. It's got that lovely vinegary smell. You can see it's been kind of rising\nup the glass. This started about here earlier on\nand now it's climbed up to here. So it'll continue to rise and then it will drop back down. So at this stage,\nit's basically ready to go. Well, if I'm completely honest,\nthis is Day 2. This is Day 4. And this is Year 9. I've had this for 9 years. So as long as I don't use it all,\nI'll never run out. So all I'll simply do, for example\nafter we make our bread today, I will have 200 grams left over. I will simply stir in 200 flour,\n200 water, and tomorrow,\nit's ready to go again. Because I keep mine\nat room temperature, I've to feed mine everyday. But for the home-baker, who might\nonly bake once a week, or at weekends\nwhen you've a bit more time, it can become quite an expensive pet\nto keep if you feed it every day. So what you can simply do\nis keep yours in the fridge. Because it's based on bacteria,\ncold won't kill it. It'll just slow it down. So for example, you're going to be\nbaking on a Saturday morning. Take it out of your fridge on a\nFriday, just leave it sit in your kitchen\nto take the chill off it. That evening, say whatever weight\nyou have. For example, 200 grams. Stir in 200 flour, 200 water\nleave it sit in your kitchen. Next morning it's going to be\nlovely and bubbly. lovely and active,\nready to make your bread. Take what you need to\nmake your bread, whatever is left over,\nback in your fridge, that's it. So you've a little\nonce a week cycle. You find it gets better with age -\nthe flavour starts to develop. So even if you're not baking, you still have to feed it, because\ntechnically it is alive. So if you're building up too much, just bin some away, just keep back\nenough to keep it going. And the easiest ratio to work off, is whatever weight you have here, same weight of flour,\nsame weight of water. Could not be simpler. Now, in order to make our\nsourdough bread, we've got our sourdough starter.\nAs I say, it takes about a week. Get it going today, you'll be ready\nby next weekend. Ready to go,\nperfect to make your bread. If not,\nyou could always get down to your local baker. Most real bread bakeries will\nhappily give you some starter. If you check out\nrealbreadireland.org it's got all the real bread bakers\nacross Ireland. And most of them like myself, are\nhappy to give you a little starter, if you can't get your own going. So with this one, we're going to\nmake enough for two loaves. The great thing about this is\nwe can bake two loves. We can pop one in the freezer and\nhave one to try fresh in the day. And sourdough comes\nback great from the freezer. So we've get 800 grams\nof strong flour. To this... we're going to add 460 mls, or 460 grams of water. We're taking about\n10 grams of salt. Salt is an essential ingredient. Salt acts as a natural flavour\nenhancer. We've got our flour,\nwe've got our water, we've got our salt\nand then finally, we just need a little bit of our\nsourdough starter. So we're using 320 grams. Just make sure we don't use it all. Like you would any other recipe,\njust add your yeast straight in. And in this case,\nour sourdough starter. Once your ingredients are all in, just start bringing everything\ntogether. So once the dough roughly comes\ntogether, just dump it, straight out on the table. The gluten forms\nonce we add a liquid. At the moment,\nthe gluten is quite weak. So we want to build up the\nstrength of our dough, by what we call kneading. The idea of kneading\nis you simply stretch and work the dough. So you will find the dough goes\na little bit wet and a little bit sticky. Generally everyone's reaction at\nhome is to immediately reach for some flour\nand keep adding in there. But if you keep adding flour, the\ndough will quite happily soak it up. And then the more it soaks it up,\nthe heavier the dough becomes and the tighter\nyour bread will be. So when it comes to kneading,\nyou will get a lot of recipes suggesting the best technique,\nhow best to knead. To be honest, the one piece of\nadvice I give most people is think about somebody\nyou don't like, and just go for it! So I tend to use the heel of my\nhand, a little short stretch, and then use my fingers. Just pin the dough between\nhere and here and hook it back. And if you can pick yourself up\na little dough scraper, absolutely great. It's almost like a little extension\nof your hand. Bring it all back together again\nand keep working away. So most recipes will suggest how\nlong to need for. Most of them will say\n8 to 10 minutes. Most of them are lying,\nbut the thing is, it's very difficult for a recipe to\nbe exact. Because everybody is\na little bit different. Some people are just stronger than\nothers, some days you're tired. The dough will always tell you\nwhen it's ready. There's a thing called the\nwindow-pane effect. You can see it's getting elastic,\nit's getting there. But as I stretch and work it out,\nit's just ripping, it's tearing. And that's just the dough telling me\nit's not ready. It just needs a little more work.\nSo just keep on going. And if you do have a mixer at home,\nfeel free to use it. The dough hook will do exactly the\nsame thing as your hands are doing. You're going to feel the dough\nstarting to change. You can even see already,\nhow beautiful and silky how lovely and smooth\nthe dough has become. Like you saw earlier,\nwhen we tested it initially, it just kept ripping, it kept\ntearing. So we'll take a little oil in your hands. It'll stop the dough\nfrom sticking to you. And nice and gently stretch the\ndough, working it out. You can see the shadows,\nthe membrane behind it. It's exactly what we're looking for. So earlier,\nthat just ripped and tore. But now, that's holding.\nIt's elastic. It's got the strength we need,\nthat's exactly what we're looking\nfor. So bring your dough back together. Back into one piece.\nInto your bowl. And now I'm going to let it prove. With sourdough however, because\nit's a more natural process, everything tends to happen much,\nmuch slower. So where most yeast recipes need\nto prove for about an hour, this one, we're going to be looking\nat about three hours. So you need to leave it\nplenty of time. So we're going to let this prove\nfor three hours. So when you come back to it, you'll be looking at\nsomething like this. What we'll be doing now, is we're\nsimply knocking our dough back. Because as much as we say the\nlonger you prove it the better, you don't want to over-prove\nyour bread. Simply take it out of your bowl and try and make it into\na round ball. And again, don't over-think it. By making it into a ball,\nyou'll have simply knocked it back\nknocked all the air from it. So you're kind of back to where you\nwould have been three hours ago. So now, what we need to do\nat this stage, is we need to shape our dough. So with the quantity we made,\nit gives us the perfect portion to make two lovely sized loaves. So when we're shaping our breads,\nwe use proving baskets. Because it's going to be proving\nfor another three hours, it would just slowly start\nto prove out, and go very, very flat. So by using the basket, it gives the\ndough support. It encourages it to take on that\nshape,  so instead of proving out, it proves up. But if you don't have\na basket, you could use absolutely anything. A tin, a tray,\na box, a bowl. It's simply something that's going\nto support and help your dough out. And probably,\nI'm sure all of us have... a Pyrex dish at home. If you don't have it, your mum has,\nyour gran has. They're always kicking\naround everywhere. We take a little flour\nand dust it all over. Coating it\nwith a little coating of flour, will stop the dough from sticking. So the best thing to do is simply\ntake a clean tea-towel. You could use your mixing bowl,\nor whatever you like. Pop your tea-towel in. And again just a good generous\ncoating of flour. Just to make sure that the dough\nwon't stick. So all that's left to do now\nis to shape our dough. So no matter what we're shaping, we always kind of start\nfrom a round base. Again, try not to use too much\nflour. Just a very gentle coating if you\nfind your dough is a little soft or a little bit sticky.\nSimply flip your dough over. Take all your little edges and push\nthem down to the centre. Go to the next one. And then overlap the last. Round and round you\ngo and you can see it naturally starting\nto curve around. So I flip the dough over. Put your hands out and\nsimply drag them forward. You'll find the dough lifts up. Turn it 45 degrees and go again. Keep repeating,\neach time the surface of the dough\nis getting that little bit tighter. A little roll around. And now we have a perfect little\nloaf ready to go. And pop it into our basket\nupside down. And it's into our little Pyrex dish\nwith our tea-towel. And just so it doesn't stick, a little dusting of flour. And now with the tea-towel,\nyou simply tuck it straight in. So we just tucked our dough in and\nwe're going to let it prove again. It needs to prove for about another\nthree to three and a half hours. The great thing about this though\nis, at this stage, you could go and put this straight\nin the fridge. And it can sit there all night long,\nno problem whatsoever. Because, with our sourdough,\nit's moving lovely and slowly. And some yeasted breads would\ntend to overprove in the fridge. Sourdough really lends itself\nto be proven overnight. So we'll leave it there all night.\nFirst thing tomorrow morning, we'll come back,\ntake our dough out turn it straight out\nand into our oven and we'll bake it away. Our sourdough has been proving,\nthey've had a second prove now. We had them shaping. We had one\nin our lovely proving basket. And our second one\nin our lovely Pyrex dish. So at this stage\nthey are ready to bake. Your dough should have a\nnice little bounce to it. You should be able to touch it and\nthere's no fear of it collapsing. So if you kind of touch it and felt\nthe whole thing was going to drop, you've overproved it, so the idea is\nat least you know for next time, catch it a little sooner.\nThe idea is we catch it on the rise. Have your baking tray ready. If you're using a proving basket or\nlucky to have one at home, so simply like a sandcastle, just\nturn your dough straight out. So you can see\nall that beautiful pattern which the dough picks up\nfrom the basket. That's what gives this dough a lot\nof its traditional markings. So then we've also got our lovely\nPyrex dish. It's a great way\nto improvise at home. It's been tucked in for the last\ncouple of hours. We're going to gently waken it up. And all you do, very simply, just in case it's going to stick, we'll put a little bit of flour\non our dough. So we take our lid,\nyou pop your lid on. And you literally just flip it\nupside down. So take it off. Nice and gently, just remove your\nflour and tea-towel. Most professional ovens\nare fitted with steam. The idea being for the first 8 to 10\nminutes of your bake, the dough is still rising. So by having steam in the oven,\nit allows the dough to open up. And it stops a crust from forming. Because often what can happen\nif you don't use steam, curst forms, the dough hasn't\nfinished rising, and sometimes it can't break\nthrough the surface. It gets a bulge out the side because it'll look for any weakness\nin the dough. Or sometimes it won't rise at all.\nSo by having steam in the oven it protects the dough and allows it\nto continue to open up. That's also what helps to create\nyour lovely little crust. This is why the Pyrex dish is\nso great, it's so brilliant. Because no matter\nhow crappy your oven is, you don't even have to steam it,\nbecause basically once we pop the lid on, it's going\nto basically self steam. It creates its own little chamber. And it'll steam the bread and does\na perfect job for us. Before we do that though, we're\ngoing to score our bread. It dates back to central ovens. Each village would have one,\neveryone would help maintain it. So the only way to tell your bread\napart is how you mark it. It's called a baker's signature. We use a razor blade. The thing to remember when you're\nusing it, it's not a bread knife, so don't start doing this.\nBe nice and confident. So a really sharp knife at home\nif you can. When you're in full control... And don't be afraid\nto cut into your dough. Just make sure you\ncut all the way through. So by scoring it,\nas well as aesthetics it also helps you to control\nhow the dough rises and gives the dough\nsomewhere to go. So when it comes to baking your\ndough, don't be afraid to turn the temperature\nof your oven up. We all have a tendency to cook\nabsolutely everything at 180. It's like the universal setting\non an oven. But with bread, we need those good\nhigh temperatures. So really crank it up.\nSo you're looking at a minimum of 230 degrees.\nWe need that high temperature to create that lovely, lovely crust. So a great way we can create steam\nat home, is by as we pop our bread in, and pop in our little Pyrex dish. Once you pre-heat the oven, just turn it right up,\nput in a roasting tray and pre-heat it and all I'm doing is\ntaking some hot water... Which is going to release that\nlovely blast of steam into our oven which is going to help\nyour bread rise.\n360\n00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:50,640\n{\\an8}", "EgtxNZFglwE": "Hi!\nand welcome back to Erika's best.  My name is\nErika for those of you who don't know me and\njust real quick,  please subscribe, please hit the notification bell\nand if you like this video, give me a thumbs up!\nThis week is bread week! Yay!! I love making homemade bread. It is\nabsolutely my favorite thing.  I love, love, love, love\nbread. All types of bread products. So this,  today I am making french bread\nand in this bowl I already have all of my ingredients and I have my dough that has, uh, risen\nfor the first time and so now I am going to punch it down\nthis first, uh, this rising is called proofing and so how you know\nthat your dough is properly proofed is if you stick your finger in\nsee what happens nothing. It will slowly start coming up,\nthen you know it has been properly properly proofed.\nThis bread has been proofing for about an hour\nand, uh, and so now I'm going to take it out\nand shape it into my loafs and very soon we will have some\nhomemade french bread So as you see I am rolling my dough and, um, I want to make it\na little rectangle shape and then you're going to roll it hold on a second, okay?\nSo you're just going to roll it rolling it tight and then kind of squish the ends together and then you're going\nto put that on your baking sheet, with the seam side\ndown as shown. So the same you're seeing these\ndown Okay, let's do that one more time with\nthe second piece of dough This recipe yields\ntwo loaves of the best french bread you ever want to see\ni will have the recipe in the link below I mean in the description below, so you don't have to worry about writing\nthe directions down now they will be in the description.\nSo I'm just gonna roll it out as square as you possibly can.  It's not\nso much a square, but it'll be fun. So you're gonna roll it up,\nroll it up, squish the ends and then put it on your baking tray\nand then you are going to leave it on your baking tray\nI'm gonna put a piece of parchment paper over the top\nyou're going to leave this on your baking tray again\nfor about an hour while it proofs the second rise and while you're doing\nthis while this part is happening you want to\npreheat your oven at 375 degrees and by the time this is ready your\noven should be completely preheated So here you can see the bread has risen\nfor the for the this second proofing\nand I'm just gonna brush it with a little beaten\negg with a little bit of water, about a tablespoon of water.\nSo I have one egg with about a tablespoon of water and I'm just going\nto brush that on top and that's just going to give a golden\ncolor to the top of the bread. You want to be\ncareful to not allow it to leak down the sides. You just\nwant to brush it on pretty good and into these little cracks\nbut, not let it drip down too much I mean if it does it's not going to kill\nyour bread, but, it will um it will make it stick a little bit\nto the paper. So you just want to brush it on\nvery good making sure it's all covered both loaves and I will turn it around to\nthe other side to make sure I have it coated very well\non both sides so I picked up this little handy brush, so handy, to brush on things, at the 99\ncents store So you can find some pretty good little\nthings to help you\nto be a little bit better in the kitchen. A little bit more efficient\nand so now I'm going to turn the tray around just so I can get\nboth sides with eggs. This is called putting on an egg wash.  So make sure\nboth sides are equally egg washed.\nMy oven has been preheating now during this\nprocess of the second rise and so now I'm going to put my bread in\nthis hot 375 degree preheated oven\nand it should take between 20 and 25 minutes to bake.\nAnd welcome back to Erika's best and here is my french bread just out of\nthe oven I've let it sit out here for a few\nminutes. Just to cool down, a little bit So I can take a taste. So I'm gonna\ncut into it and it's nice, \nall the way cooked through and I'm just going to take a little butter\nto try it out it just never fails! This is the absolute best french bread\nrecipe that I've ever made It is light, it\nhas a nice crust That again, is the most delicious bread\nNow you want to keep this on your countertop.\nYou don't want to put this in the refrigerator because\nputting bread in the refrigerator does speed up the effects of going stale. So\nyou want to keep this on the counter and it will stay fresh in a ziploc bag\nfor three to five days. This bread never\nusually stays in my house more than two or three days and it's\ngone So thanks for watching! Please\nsubscribe and hit the notification bell, So you will be notified\nevery time I upload a new video and if you like this video\ngive me a thumbs up! Thanks again for watching!\nI'm Erika from Erika's BEST. Bye now!", "3jDCV_WMSQw": "baking bread can use all of your talents from physical dexterity to fine mental precision though challenging and time-consuming creating the ideal product is very rewarding the popularity of freshly baked crusty bread has grown enormously in the last few years and so is the demand for qualified Baker's the phenomenon of people buying and consuming these crusty breads has increased by a double-digit rate of growth within like the last five years because people are looking at crusty breads as a an old-world style bread but it's very fresh and it's very simple in this program chef Richard Coppedge will demonstrate the basic steps of making leand Oh bread lean dough contains neither added fats nor other enriching agents it is created from only a few ingredients but it is an important building block for many bread products including pan bread dinner rolls even pizza dough and proving that simplicity is elegance lean dough is also the heart of the traditional French loaf the baguette it has a simple make up of ingredients it has its own unique taste and texture and I think once a person learns to appreciate that simple taste and texture they just buy the crusty products the method the chef will demonstrate is a technique used widely for mixing and using dough in one day it's called the straight dough method and like lean dough it is an elemental building block for many types of bread the chef will follow these twelve principle steps of bread baking to produce a variety of crusty lean dough breads scaling mixing bulk fermentation folding over dividing pre shaping benchrest shaping final fermentation scoring baking and cooling we will touch on the principles of baking behind the steps and show you some common pitfalls to avoid we will discuss the properties of the ingredients and explain the tools and equipment you'll need the steps are a guideline for producing baked bread with each step the baker makes choices for instance there are several mixing methods your choice could influence the action of the ingredients the quality of the final product even the schedule of production in your bake shop by using the relatively straightforward straight dough mixing method the bread can be produced in about 6 hours from start to finish so to begin the essential ingredients of lean bread dough are flour water yeast and salt other dough's may call for sugar eggs fat or other enriching agents flour is the backbone of our lean dough there are dozens of types of flours and grain products ground to different textures and combinations or with flavorings added for our demonstrations we will work with hard winter wheat flour it contains more high-quality protein soft wheat flour cakes when compressed it is higher in starch making it more suitable for cake type products for most yeast raised breads it is best to use hard winter wheat with good gluten quality gluten is a wheat protein substance that's formed when you add water to wheat flour and as you mix for example you are bonding the various gluten components and they tighten and this chain forms and as it gets tighter it develops the elasticity and ability for the dough to stretch this tight web traps the gases created as the dough Rises we will use unbleached flour because bleaching alters the taste of the flower and gets rid of the carotene pigment contained within it some Baker's prefer bleached flour because bleaching matures the flower and gives it a good baking quality bro mated flowers have a chemical additive which adds volume to the bread there are some serious health concerns about this additive so we will use unbranded flour Baker's should be aware of any of their state's regulations concerning the use of bro mated flours water is the ingredient which hydrates the flour use good potable water which is not highly chlorinated chemicals can easily alter yeast activity yeast Levins the bread that is makes it rise commercial yeast comes in many forms the most common are active dry instant and fresh yeast with yeast it is crucial to follow the manufacturer's instructions for our demonstration we will use fresh yeast yeast is a living organism as shown in this sample it consumes the starch in the flour and through a series of reactions called fermentation it produces the gas which leavens the bread salt flavors the bread but it also controls the yeast growth without salt dough Rises too fast once you are familiar with the properties of the basic ingredients you will learn how even the slightest variation can affect the finished bread it is much better to start with the correct amount of each ingredient than to try to fix mistakes when baking follow the precise formula that has been developed to work well in the conditions of your bake shop bakers conceptualize their formulas in percentages in fact the expression of a formula in percentages is referred to as the baker's percentage with this method the base ingredient flour is always labeled 100% the other ingredients are expressed as a percentage relative to the total amount of flaw which again is always labeled 100% in chef cottages formula you can see that the amount of each of the other ingredients is a percentage relative to the total flour weight for example the water will always weigh 65 percent of what the flower weighs when all the ingredients are mixed together they'll weigh 168 point five percent of the original flour weight Baker's use the percentage formula to calculate the correct amount of each ingredient as they increase or decrease the dough yield if they want a greater yield they'll first increase the amount of flour then they'll mathematically apply the percentages indicated in the formula and the amounts of the other ingredients will increase proportionally the weight of each ingredient may change but the percentage in relation to the total flour weight remains the same will show this lindo formula again at the end of the program and review how to increase or decrease the yield so let's make loaves the first of the 12 steps is to weigh the ingredients on a scale to the specifications of your bread formula there are various types of scales this is a common balance beam scale a counterweight is used to offset the weight of the container additional weights reflect the weight of the ingredient this is a spring scale you must zero out the scale or subtract the weight of the container to get an accurate reading of the weight of your ingredient chef Coppedge uses a digital scale for our demonstration he immediately cancels out the weight of the container by putting the dial at zero first the water in general when baking it is easier and more accurate to measure by weight instead of by volume then the fresh yeast and flour the ingredient that forms most of the dough notice the care taken to measure with accuracy now salt a small amount but still important for flavor and to control the growth of the yeast once you have weighed all the ingredients then you mix them Baker's have a wide choice of mixers oblique spiral huge industrial machines or small home mixers of course mixing by hand is the best way to learn how the dough actually develops in fact in France a lot of Baker's as part of their apprenticeship to master their knowledge they have to mix a large batch of dough by hand and then fabricate the entire product all by hand in our demonstration we are using the straight dough mixing method this means that all of the ingredients are mixed together from scratch without using any previously fermented dough as an ingredient although dough's which ferment for a longer time often have the best taste the straight dough method gives you an excellent bread in a comparatively short work time start to finish there are four stages of the mixing process the pick up stage the cleanup stage the development stage and the final stage good mixing will produce a smooth dough in which all the ingredients are thoroughly incorporated also at the end of the mixing the dough should be roughly room-temperature therefore at the beginning of the mixing the water should be at a temperature to help you achieve the desired dough temperature the final dough temperature is important because a higher dough temperature will increase the rate of fermentation a lower temperature will do the opposite the rate of fermentation strongly affects the characteristics and flavor of the bread in Baker's language the desired dough temperature is determined by taking into account the total temperature factor the factor incorporates the temperatures of three different elements in the bake shop room temperature flour temperature and mixer friction that is the warming of the dough produced by mixing the room temperature and the flour temperature can be measured easily with a thermometer harder to measure is the heat created within the dough by the action of mixing all mixers produce friction which warms the dough but each mixer produces it to a different degree therefore your calculation cannot be entirely accurate until you learn to gauge the effect of the mixer you use at the end of this program we will show you how to figure out the friction factor for your mixer of all the variables the Baker can influence in order to attain the desired dough temperature the easiest element to change is the water temperature chef Coppedge wants a final dough temperature of 75 degrees Fahrenheit the bakeshop is 70 degrees the flour is 68 degrees from experience he knows that his mixer produces a friction factor of 24 degrees Fahrenheit he calculates that a water temperature of about 63 degrees Fahrenheit will help him to reach the desired dough temperature of about 75 degrees now for the fresh yeast for efficiency break up the yeast chunks by hand and mix them with the water the flour is added to the water and yeast because salt instantly affects the action of the yeast it is best to add it last ordinarily mixers do not operate unless the guard is down but we have adjusted this one for demonstration purposes in the first stage called pick up the mixing begins on low speed the ingredients need to slowly come together and form a bond we are using a spiral mixer good mixing is not just for combining ingredients it distributes the ingredients evenly and develops the gluten it doesn't matter the type of mixer but you have to learn to look at the way things are coming together during that mixing the water picks up the flour the flour the water and the dough begins to collect on the hook in the cleanup stage the mixing bowl appears to be getting clean as if the hook was a magnet picking up dough this also takes place at low speed here you are achieving uniform incorporation of the ingredients well Baker has to learn to adjust to the humidity level that's in the air because the dough can take you on that humidity be absorbed by the flower and you end up with a dough that's too sticky the pickup and cleanup stages lasts a total of about three minutes on low speed the development and final stages lasts a total of three to four minutes on high speed gluten is the protein substance which gives the dough structure elasticity and tenacity the ability to hold gases at this point the dough should pull away from the bowl more readily at the development stage the gluten is strengthening toward the end of the mixing process the dough develops a stretchable quality called extensibility look for a lighter color and a smooth silky texture you might even hear a popping sound as more air is incorporated be extremely careful when mixing don't operate your mixer until you've read the instructions by the final stage the dough is a uniform mixture with good gluten development and the right amount of extensibility and elasticity if the initial water temperature was properly calculated the dough will have reached the desired temperature this batch is 75 degrees just as planned you have to listen look touch feel stretch the dough out properly mixing the ingredients will permit the proper fermentation and development of the dough an under mixed dough will look like this the dough is inelastic and dry and it gives away a lot sooner than it should the gluten is underdeveloped using a spiral mixer can save you a lot of time and money because it mixes the dough very quickly we have to also be on the lookout for mixing too long which can sometimes be an extra thirty seconds because it's going to work so quickly it's going to break your gluten structure down an over mixed dough will look like this the dough is very sticky and too extensible or stretchy it breaks down because the gluten is overdeveloped over mixing causes the dough to lose flavor because of excessive oxidation this adverse chemical reaction takes place when too much air is incorporated into the dough during mixing this dough sample is mixed correctly the next step is bulk fermentation you'll need a tub or Bowl and a cover or plastic wrap the aim of bulk fermentation is to give the dough volume and a porous structure it also adds flavor during fermentation we want the dough to expand and as is trying to expand we don't want any crust formation which can restrict the movement of the dough so we keep it covered with a plastic cover or in some cases a cloth if it's in the proof box where it's warm and humid then it does not need to be covered because that's going to give it that extra humidity on the surface the living yeast starts to digest carbohydrates within the flour and produces carbon dioxide as a result enzymes in the flour break the starches into simple sugars this simple form of carbohydrate becomes the available food source for the yeast fermentation also produces alcohol which evaporates completely in the heat of baking but basically with the yeast when it's finished what you get in the end are these waste products which make the dough rise which makes the dough have the porous structure it makes it more tender it makes it more flavorful it makes it easier to handle the gluten is strengthened during bulk fermentation gaining more of the elastic and silky qualities that started to form during the mixing in a way gluten is the counterpart of yeast it creates a resistant web which contains the gases produced by the yeast you can see in this time-lapse demonstration of bulk fermentation just how much volume the do--it yves when you're making bread your product is alive from approximately 20 minutes after mixing until the time you start to bake that product so fermentation is very critical as one Baker in the past has told me you know a yeast dough waits for no one and when it's ready you have to be ready or else it's going to leave you behind a young dough means the dough is under fermented this dough has fermented too long it is too old to use with experience you will learn how to balance the relationship between gluten and yeast if you let one go more than the other for example with the too much fermentation then you have a bread that has too much of an alcoholic aroma the formula we are using calls for two hours of bulk fermentation about halfway through bulk fermentation the dough is folded over some Baker's refer to it as punching or knocking back but it requires a gentler touch than either of those imply the yeast has been doing its job creating air pockets within the dough which leavens the bread folding over boosts the process by redistributing the yeasts source of food expelling carbon dioxide equalizing the temperature throughout the dough and developing the gluten strands press down on the dough piece with two hands and then fold it in thirds as if you were wrapping a package with different mixing methods or fermentation methods the dough's performance may improve with more than one folding over during the bulk fermentation after folding over rest the dough for the duration of the bulk fermentation this batch will rest about 60 minutes then it will be ready for the next step dividing now you have a good workable dough to divide into the pieces which will eventually become baked goods dividing the dough requires a scale because weighing with precision is all-important with this step here we'll use the balance beam scale to measure out the pieces of dough to their pre baked weight these twelve ounce dough pieces will be used for baguettes about ten percent of the weight will be lost through evaporation during the baking process these round loaves are divided into one-pound pieces fermentation is going on even as you divide the dough each time you cut gas is released so working quickly efficiently and in order is essential this is an efficient way of scaling the dough for 36 dinner rolls for example first cut one piece weighing about five pounds using a plate design for this purpose place the dough piece into the mechanical dividing machine each dough piece weighs two and a quarter ounces division accomplished pree shaping is for Loosli molding the dough into a form that roughly resembles the final shape round for the round loaves oblong for the baguettes and so on rest them on the bench in an orderly fashion you are getting the pieces ready for the next phase of fermentation called bench rest bulk fermentation and pre shaping stretched and aligned the gluten the strands of protein now literally have to relax again before the final shaping can take place it takes about 15 minutes of bench rest for the dough to recover the dough is covered with cloth or plastic to protect the surface from drying out you don't want your dough to form an elephant's skin because if the dough forms a skin that looks kind of like an elephant skin where it's very dry and cracked you can't tell what's happening underneath that skin when the dough feels softer it is ready for shaping molding a piece of dough by hand is where the skills of the Baker really come to the fore this is where you can conform to the traditional shapes or experiment the traditional round lobes should be smooth and spherical with tight seams they are placed in baskets which preserve their shapes during the next phase of fermentation to shape a baguette flatten the dough to dig a sit a bit but don't handle it so hard that you damage the airy quality of the dough take the bottom edge and tuck it in about two-thirds of the way up be careful not to flatten the interior fold over the top edge and press it down to create a seam using the thumb and heel of your hand seal the dough the length of the piece again be gentle with the interior start rolling with one hand in the center and work your way outward with both hands create a cylinder like shape with tapered ends the seam is like the final weld it will be on the bottom during baking in order to preserve the shape of the baguettes Coppedge places them in narrow channels formed in pieces of canvas cloth carelessness in the shaping will definitely show in the finished product the chef demonstrates the shaping of a baguette dough piece that has a crooked seam and an uneven diameter it's the top piece in this cast of poorly made baguettes the dough for the pan bread is treated in a slightly different manner because the end product is meant to have an even fine crumb structure the dough itself is too gas aggressively and tightly shaped then the dough rests in metal loaf pans the divided rolls can be formed by hand into round or oblong shapes handle them in an orderly fashion as you prepare them for the next phase place them on a clean surface with their seams on the bottom don't crowd them through practice and experience you will learn to gently mold the various shapes so as not to damage the dough modern bakers have the advantages of mechanization if they need to save time for instance if they have to produce a lot of dinner rolls quickly if you choose the steps from dividing to shaping can be done in pretty short order by using machines they divide the dough into exact pieces ready for bench rest many Baker's use a molding machine to shape their baguettes remember that machines are certainly helpful for efficiency but experienced Baker's hands are ingredients that can't be mechanized for the final fermentation the dough pieces are placed in a temperature and humidity controlled cabinet called a proof box in this context the word proof means fermentation during bulk fermentation the dough gained its basic flavor and the leavening gases were generated during bench rest the dough relaxed prior to shaping now the aim of the final fermentation is to give the dough added volume before it is baked it needs the right environment to ferment and grow typically the dough will almost double its volume in about an hour and a half at 75 degrees Fahrenheit and a humidity of 75% the dough will still ferment in a bake shop with similar conditions of temperature and humidity let it rest from one and a half to two hours assess when it is ready for baking by looking and feeling while learning the feel for when a product is properly proofed this it's like scoring it's like shaping it's all through experience time repeating it you know when it's hot and humid your dough is going to run a lot faster when it's cold and dry you're going to have to give your dough more time the proof of the proof is in the bread this dough has been adequately proofed it has almost doubled its volume the finished bread has a porous looking interior and an off-white color an under proofed or young dough will produce bread with a dense white interior it may look almost soggy the crust will be too thick and overproofed or old dough will collapse from weakness almost ready for baking first the proofed pieces are placed onto the loading belt for scoring although they do help to create a pleasing appearance the cuts on a doe piece just before baking are also functional scoring provides a weak spot on the doe surface for the bread to expand to its maximum potential and to retain proper shape and rigidity during the bake without scoring the bread will expand unevenly with some of the dough shapes a loosely rendered scoring is acceptable however with certain shapes like baguettes for example the scoring is crucial for achieving the exact properties which define backend so you have to go at it in the right manner with the right angle but a sharp tool a light handling of that tool because you're dealing with a piece of dough that's very fragile use a sharp tool like a serrated paring knife or a LOM which is specifically designed for the purpose of scoring handle it carefully scoring releases additional expansion during the bake producing a more open crumb structure good scoring provides lightness and volume while improving structure and rigidity scoring is a precise art with baguettes make the cuts about the same length roughly one quarter inch deep angled slightly score the length of the baguette overlapping the lines of the cuts a bit this cutaway section shows how proper scoring creates the pleasing ear shape on the baguette in the finished product you can see the variations in color where the interior dough has been free to expand and release some moisture thanks to the scoring you should be striving for a light structured interior with a well-formed crust don't underestimate the importance of scoring to achieve that in now to the baking where you can finally smell the aroma of freshly baked bread baking converts the dough into an edible product this is a hearth or deck oven your bake shop may have a rack or convection oven ovens and steam are hot when opening the oven door be cautious no matter what type of oven you use this hearth oven is set to four hundred and seventy degrees Fahrenheit inject some steam into the chamber just before and just after the dough pieces enter the oven the steam helps moisten the dough surface to allow it to expand and to develop into a thin and crunchy crust in the span of about 22 minutes heat and steam will transform 12-ounce baguettes shaped dough pieces into finished baguettes baking times and temperatures will vary depending upon the density and size of the various shapes in the minutes the dough is in the oven several changes take place some observable some not this time-lapse montage shows you roughly what happens during the baking of baguettes for example the impact of the oven heat immediately causes the baguette to expand noticeably that effect is called oven spring the gases within the dough expand as the dough temperature goes from about 130 degrees to 176 degrees Fahrenheit a process called gelatinize ation takes place the heated starches absorb moisture from the dough and the starches swell and firm up forming the structure of the crumb within the bread on the exterior the starches form a shiny crusty surface when the surface temperature approaches 300 degrees Fahrenheit other changes occur to form the reddish brown color and crisp eNOS of the crust through caramelization and what's called the my yard reaction sugar and other compounds within the starches undergo a series of complex chemical reactions the happy result is the rich brown color and intense flavor of the bread remember that the heat of the oven evaporates about 10% of the moisture within the dough about three minutes before the end of the bake vent the oven this releases some of the humidity so baking continues evenly without burning the crust this is especially important in humid weather to maintain a crispy crust not quite ready to eat the bread must cool it is exciting to hear the crackling of the bread as the crust takes its final shape check it by tapping the love you should hear a hollow resonant noise that means a light not a heavy wet interior you may place the loaves on a cooling rack or in baskets by placing the loaves in a vertical position you are letting air circulate around them excess moisture will evaporate from the top the bread will assume its final structure and then it will be ready to eat check the quality of the bread once it's properly cooled then it's able to be evaluated when we evaluate the bread you know we check the following criteria we check the shape we check the color we check the crust we check the slicing capabilities of the bread then we go into the interior and we check the aroma and the crumb and the taste and in an overall total impression of the product from the lean dough we've produced some bowls or ball shape some hard dinner rolls and some loaf bread the main difference other than visual symmetry and shape is going to be in the interior the finest one tightest texture is going to be the loaf bread because when I shape that I really took as much of the air pockets out as possible the bull is going to be somewhere to the baguette but with a thicker crust because of its round shape it's going to be exposed to more heat so there's going to be more caramelization and hardening of the crust and the dinner rolls or peti pond small breads are going to be a very fast fermenting and baking product but we still have a good difference in color from where it was split when I look at the loaf bread the sound is not as hollow it's more tight again based on the way I shaped and it was also baked in a pan so when I slice the interior I have a hard crust to go through but now I have a very fine crumb line some large air pockets but the majority are very small okay when I check the quality aspects of the baguette I first look at the shape the baguette basically refers to a wine shape so I want a long long tapered end it should not be crooked or excessively bulbous on any part of the baguette I also then look at the color and the color should be very golden brown almost yellow like everywhere it should be golden brown except in the surface where it's been scored which will be a little lighter because of the lack of exposure to heat moisture during baking then I go to the crust crust should be a hard crust the next criteria would be the slice looking at the interior the feel checking the cell structure if you look at the bottom you can see where it is tried to lift off during the baking or that oven spring or oven kick and just a different size of the holes some are large some are small after evaluating the crumb then I want to check for the aroma I'm going to smell the interior along with the exterior but I want to pick up for a wheat like aroma without a yeast or alcohol flavor in that product when I check for taste I check for that nutty wheat like aroma but I also check how does it chew is the crust hard is the interior chewy you know as opposed to being soft and gummy or homogeneous I want that I want to feel the bread and I want to leave a good taste in my mouth when you look at the total impression of the baguette it's like walking into a bakery with your hard-earned money so you look over the counter and you look at all the baguettes and then when you take it home and you share it with your friends or your family they all know that you know what you're looking for in that product and a quality oriented baguette one of the best things about knowing how to bake bread is being able to eat it when it's fresh because it doesn't have a long shelf life if you learn to appreciate the way it tastes when it's fresh you'll want to have that product on a regular basis review the 12 steps of basic bread baking that we have demonstrated you you you you you to show you how to increase or decrease the dough yield let's look at the formula we showed you earlier first simplify the math and convert all of the weights into ounces the lowest common denominator this example is easy because the flour weight becomes 100 ounces you see the other ingredients follow relative to the formulas percentages if you want to increase the dough yield start by increasing the amount of flour that amount is always 100 percent with 10 pounds of flour for example convert it to 160 ounces then apply the percentages to the other ingredients start with the water convert 65 percent to its decimal form 0.65 and multiply that by 160 ounces to get 104 ounces use the same principle for the salt and the yeast with the yeast for example multiply 160 ounces by point zero one five the decimal form of 1.5% to get two point four ounces of yeast in a bake shop the amount of dough that will be produced is the starting point for the calculations from there the Baker applies the Baker's percentage to determine first the amount of flour and then the amounts of all the other ingredients earlier we showed you how to calculate the water temperature to achieve the desired dough temperature you need to figure out the friction factor for your mixer by performing a series of tests the friction factor will be affected by batch size mixer type mixing time type of dough and the temperatures of the mixing bowl and the room to conduct your test make a trial batch of dough put the room flour and water temperatures into the equation then check the final dough temperature the remaining variable is the friction factor for that batch do this test several times and note down the results you will then have a good idea of the friction factor to use under those conditions with practice you will learn to make the adjustments that suit the conditions of your bake shop now get the best ingredients get organized and get started enjoy you", "Q0ibMQUHLso": "hello everyone welcome back to my Kido journey so today I am going to be making some pizza some Italian sausage pizza and you know usually I make my pizza by doing the fat of dough and doing all that process and I didn't feel like doing that honestly I like the crunchiness of like French bread dough and so we're gonna make a mock French bread okay it is really a mock French bread no French and so anyway I'm gonna put you down here and we're gonna go ahead and get started okay so for this we're gonna be using our keto brick and we're gonna use three slices and basically what we're gonna do is I'm taking a bread knife and I am gently cutting off the edge of this bread okay and then I'm going to cut off this edge now don't throw those ends away because if you saw my other video you would know that I saved those and make that wonderful French Toast Casserole okay to talk okay so what we're gonna do is layer this right here and then I'm gonna cut this end off now I've done this once before and it worked pretty good so I'm gonna take my rolling pin and just roll over those seams but you got to put it together first huh to make that one piece though it stays together that did not do a good job of course it's not gonna work because I'm on camera you got to make sure it stays together okay and then we're going to take this piece and do the same thing you know we all used to smash bread together will your kids you know you did I did don't know why but okay now what we're gonna do is I have this baking mat and it goes in the oven is to cook things on there that you don't want you know you won't air to get around but you don't want to burn or whatever we are going to toast this first before we put our pizza together because we want it to be firm enough that it will hold our sauce and stuff without without leaking through and making a big soggy mess so I'll be right back okay so we're out of the toaster oven so what I'm doing is just taking my hand and pressing down on the bread it's quite hot and just kind of make it like a little whale in the middle there we go alright so then I'm just gonna add a little bit of sauce now I use r\u00edos sauce most of the time I couldn't afford r\u00edos this time so I got mama Mary's which has the same amount of carbs as the r\u00edos does so I'm using that but I'm using a whole lot less than a serving because yo I'm not a real big fan of Peter sauce that per se I just don't care for it too much and this has basil and stuff in it but okay okay so now I'm just gonna add a little regonize on to it just a dash and just a dash of garlic okay now I went ahead and pre did all my my stuff so I have mozzarella cheese that I graded myself and I'm just adding a little mozzarella on the bread just to give it a little base and help stick it all together per se okay and you can't never have too much cheese and then I went ahead and what I did was I sauteed about two ounces of Italian sausage this came in a roll from all these and it had zero carbs I took about two tablespoons of onion and about one tablespoon of red pepper and I just sauteed that all together and it might even be too much for all this that may not even be using all of it but I just don't like raw onions or on my pizza okay we might get it all on there I don't know we're gonna put it all on there just because I want it okay then I also sauteed a few mushrooms and put that on there on top see why we had to toast the bread first okay now we're gonna take I feel like my fingers off the cheese I'm putting on top that's gonna act like the glue you gonna hold this all together and it's fun on this silicon mat but so the amount of cheese I used was probably about maybe about an ounce graded up like 1/4 of a thing of a 8 ounce block of cheese okay and then I'm gonna really guilty well you can just sprinkle a little Parmesan cheese on top of that now this is going back in the oven at 375 degrees just until the cheese melts let me open the oven door and when it gets back we'll be back all right guys seven minutes in the oven and we were good to go so tonight my dinner what I was staring with so I'm gonna have water my pizza and then I just fixed a little salad which is the salad mix from aldis and what I do is I shake the bag really hard so all the carrots and most of the real high pervy stuff falls to the bottom and so I just get the lettuce out a little bit of purple cabbage and then I just added one strip off of a bell pepper and cut it up and put that on there a little bit of cheese and some bacon ranch dressing but look at this piece it does it not look yummy so we're gonna cut into this hear that crunch just like a french bread pizza oh my goodness I don't even want to think about it don't even want to think about it okay I'm gonna put you up here we're gonna give it a taste test thought I'd give you one more close-up before I get into it that looks really good doesn't it okay I'm gonna try not to take too big of a bite this time take the little small piece I cut out of the middle mm perfect it's nice it's crunchy has all the flavors of pizza this is a home run yo so I hope you'll give it a try and you can do it any flavor you want to you can do a traditional pizza just the red sauce cheese pepperoni you can put any pizza topping on it you want so I hope you'll give this a try now I'm getting off here because I'm hungry and I'm ready to eat please make sure that if you not join my channel yet you go ahead and do that by hitting

favorite sandwiches and all-around favorite things to eat a vegan bon me with homemade bread and mushroom pate [Music] all right so to get things started we're going to be making some vietnamese style baguettes for our bond mies you of course can use store-bought baguettes or french bread and you'll still wind up with a perfectly delicious sandwich so if you're not planning on making the bread just skip ahead i'll be putting some time stamps in the description so that you can go to the sections of the video that you want to see let's start with our ingredients we have 500 grams or about four and a quarter cups of bread flour you can also use all-purpose flour and you won't see much of a difference in final texture of the bread just be aware that all-purpose flour doesn't tend to absorb quite as much water so you might want to take a tablespoon or two out of your water for yeast we have one and a half teaspoons of instant yeast you can use the same amount of active dry yeast or if you only have fresh yeast on hand you can bump that up to about a tablespoon for sugar we have one tablespoon of sugar this just feeds the yeast helps promote activity and helps it rise a little bit faster we have two teaspoons of kosher salt if you only have fine salt on hand that's fine just use one or one and a half teaspoons instead we have a tablespoon of a neutral tasting oil this happens to be light olive oil but you can use canola sunflower anything else you can also use a vegan butter or coconut oil if you prefer and we have 330 grams or about one and two thirds cups of water so to get things started we're going to put our flour in the bowl of our stand mixer and then we're going to add the yeast salt and sugar kind of on opposite sides of the bowl then mix all those dry ingredients together i like to use the dough hook since we're going to get it dirty later anyway and then we're going to start adding our water so you want to add it maybe about a quarter cup at a time and use that dough hook to stir it in and incorporate as you go toward the end when you're almost out of water pour in the oil you don't want to add the oil right away because it can coat the grains and interfere with gluten development so mix that in add the last little bit of water stir it all together and then cover it i like to use a shower cap because it's reusable but you can use a damp cloth or a piece of plastic wrap just let it rest for about 10 minutes this time allows the flour to fully hydrate and makes the mixing period a little bit easier now that it's had some time to rest put it in a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment and turn the speed up to medium low if you don't have a stand mixer you can use a food processor and just mix the ingredients together for about a minute or you can knead this dough by hand because there's a relatively large amount of water it's a pretty easy dough to work with by hand so if you'd like to get into hand kneading this is a great place to start just let it mix in the stand mixer for about 10 minutes or until the dough comes together and starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl then turn the mixer off remove the dough and knead it on the counter just for a minute or two to make sure that you have the right texture it should be a pretty soft dough you can punch into pretty easily but it should still have a good amount of elasticity and spring back readily when you press down on it we're going to place this in a proofing container or in a bowl covered with a damp cloth and let it rise for about an hour a great place to let it rise is in your oven with the door closed and the light on just to get a little bit of residual heat to help promote the rise once your dough has doubled in volume you're going to want to remove it from the proofing container and return it to the counter divide it into six equal portions if you're using a scale each portion will weigh about 143 grams and then pre-shape working with one piece of dough at a time pull and press the edges into the center then flip upside down and drag on the countertop to form into a nice smooth ball the friction between the dough and the countertop will pull some tension into the ball and help eliminate the seam once you've finished pre-shaping your dough balls cover them with a damp cloth and let them rest for about 10 or 15 minutes in the meantime you're going to want to prepare a kitchen towel for your baguettes to rise in just take a large clean kitchen towel and dust it generously with flour in this case i'm using rice flour for a couple of reasons number one it doesn't stick as much to the cloth itself making it much easier to clean later and number two it doesn't stick to the baguettes as much making them much easier to release once they're finished rising now that our dough has had some time to rest it's time to shape our baguettes so working with one ball of dough at a time and keeping the rest covered we're going to first pull the four corners of the dough ball into the center and then working from the top down gently coil the dough together almost like a jelly roll once we've formed a small log we're going to place our log seam side down on the counter and roll it into a log about eight inches long make sure to roll your log evenly and press firmly at the ends to give them a nice tapered appearance once you're finished place the shaped bag at seam side up on your flowered kitchen towel and tuck the towel around either side to help keep its shape repeat with the remaining dough balls and arrange on the kitchen towel like so cover your baguettes with a damp kitchen towel and allow them to proof at room temperature for about 45 minutes or an hour in the meantime preheat your oven to 450 degrees and if you have a baking steel or baking stone place it on the center rack to check and make sure that they finished proofing just cover your finger lightly with a little bit of flour and poke the surface of the baguette gently it should spring back partially but slowly and leave a small indentation if it springs back too quickly it's not quite finished proofing and if it doesn't spring back at all then it's overproofed transfer the shaped baguettes gently but quickly to an inverted baking sheet topped with parchment paper we're going to want to arrange these in a kind of staggered fashion so that they don't expand into each other but you don't have to leave a huge gap in between we're going to take a long or a clean razor blade or even a sharp knife and make a deep slash in the surface of each baguette running from tip to tip once that's done open your oven and use the parchment paper to slide them in if you don't have a baking stone or baking steel you can just bake these directly on the baking sheet bake them for about 10 minutes and then remove the parchment paper gently and distribute your baguettes evenly on the baking sheet baking steel or baking stone bake for a further 10 minutes and then remove from the oven and allow to cool for about a half hour to an hour on a wire rack next up we're going to be making our mushroom pate like the homemade baguettes this is technically optional and you can make a perfectly delicious bond me without it so if you're not feeling up to making a pate skip ahead to the later parts of the video we're going to be using about six large criminy mushrooms you can also use white or button mushrooms or maybe about one to one and a half portabello mushrooms we're going to use a red onion or if you'd prefer you can use a couple of shallots and we're going to use one large clove of garlic in addition to that we're going to have a half a cup of walnuts one tablespoon of miso paste i happen to use red miso but just use whatever you have on hand and a half a cup of rinsed french lentils you can also use green lentils or brown lentils start by giving your onion a nice fine dice then press and mince the garlic and cut those mushrooms in half and then slice them thinly in the meantime bring a small pot of water to a boil add a pinch or two of salt and then stir in your french lentils cook those for about 25 minutes or until they're tender then drain them in a colander and put them off to the side while your lentils are boiling toast your walnuts in a dry skillet for about 5 minutes or until they just start to turn brown and become aromatic remove your toasted walnuts from the pan set them aside and return the pan to the heat set the heat to medium and add your mushrooms to the dry pan with a couple of pinches of salt stir the mushrooms around and the salt will help the mushrooms release their liquid this should take about five minutes once the liquid is mostly evaporated and mushrooms start sticking to the pan add about two tablespoons of vegan butter and then stir for another five minutes or so until the mushrooms start to brown then you can add your minced onion stir until it softens and becomes translucent then add the garlic and one more tablespoon of vegan butter once you start to see some brown bits sticking to the bottom of your skillet pour in a couple tablespoons of cooking wine stock or even just plain water to deglaze then stir in your miso paste lower the heat and stir everything together to combine shut off the heat and let your mixture cool for a couple of minutes and then add your lentils walnuts and mushroom mixture to a food processor process for a couple of minutes or until it comes together in a nice smooth paste then remove from the processor and put in a dish it might not be winning any beauty contests but i promise you it'll add a delicious depth of flavor to your finished bon mis cover your finished pate with plastic wrap or a lid and let it chill in the fridge while you prepare the other ingredients next we're going to be preparing some tofu to serve as the main protein in our bon me if you have a real aversion to tofu feel free to substitute a different protein of your choice but if you give this method a chance i promise you'll be happy with the results start by mixing up two tablespoons of cornstarch one tablespoon of soy sauce two tablespoons of cooking wine like shaoxing wine mirin or dry sherry and two tablespoons of a neutral oil stir those all together to mix and then let's move on to the tofu you want to use firm or extra firm tofu and in this case i'm using a block of extra firm tofu that i've pre-frozen and thawed because i find that freezing makes it easier to remove the water and results in a chewier denser texture either way remove as much of the water as you can from your block of tofu and then slice it along the wider edge into about 12 evenly sized slabs dip the slabs into your cornstarch mixture and turn to make sure that they're nice and evenly coated and then arrange the slabs on a wire rack set on top of a rimmed baking sheet the tofu does sometimes stick a bit to the wire rack so either coat it with some cooking spray or if you prefer you can just set the tofu directly on a baking sheet or on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper just make sure to flip it upside down about halfway through the baking time if your oven has a convection setting preheat it to about 450 degrees convection or 475 degrees a normal setting and then bake the tofu for about 25 minutes after 25 minutes has passed remove your tofu from the oven and brush either side with a mixture of one tablespoon each hoisin sauce and oil then return to the oven and bake for 10 minutes more remove from the oven and allow to cool on the wire rack next we're going to be making a garlic and sriracha-infused butter obviously mayo is a more traditional condiment and feel free to use a vegan mayo as your base if you'd rather but i happen to prefer the flavor and texture of butter instead so all you're going to do is take three tablespoons of butter microwave it for about 30 seconds until it's melted and then add one clove of finely minced garlic and about five teaspoons of sriracha stir it together then cover it lightly with plastic wrap and place in your fridge to thicken up and set and last but not least we're going to prep some veggies to top our bonvie we have here two small cucumbers but you can use any kind of cucumber that you have on hand one jalapeno pepper one piece of purple daikon radish this is just what they happen to have at the store but white daikon is perfectly fine you can also just use regular old radishes if that's all you have available and one very large carrot we're just going to give our cucumbers a nice quick slice then set those slices off to the side and do the same with our jalapeno pepper then we're going to make our pickled daikon and carrot mixture cut the daikon into thin slabs and then slice the slabs lengthwise to make thin matchsticks repeat this process with the carrot cutting the carrot into about three chunks first so that you wind up with matchsticks of a more manageable length add your daikon and carrot to a medium-sized mixing bowl and toss with a couple of pinches of salt the salt will help extract some of the natural water in both the daikon and the carrot finally add about two tablespoons of rice vinegar and one tablespoon of agave sugar or any sweetener of your choice toss to combine and set aside and finally the moment we've all been waiting for it's time to assemble our bon me slice open one of your baguettes lengthwise and slather the bottom slice with some of your sriracha butter then spread a generous amount of pate on your top slice now add two slabs of your baked tofu some of the veggies that we just prepared and finally finish it off with a generous amount of cilantro and fresh thai basil if you happen to have it available and there you have it a delicious homemade vegan bon me enjoy if you enjoyed the video please give it a like consider subscribing to the channel and let me know in the comments section if you have any questions or you'd like to see any other specific recipes in the future", "zrVYnFYL2Uc": "for those of you that don't know me my name is trish maris claystat i am the class of 80. i'm the parent of two alumni uh class of 09 and 11 i forget they're uh been out of college so long they are wonderful bantams as well um and i have for the last 11 years chaired the women's leadership network we started this council rather we started this group as a way to engage alumni with undergraduates and help support their journey and to help support the journey of our alumni and we've grown the group from about 40 people to uh over 700 and if any of you are anyone on this call is interested in joining our group um melissa bronzina reagan is who you should contact and she's going to put her information in the chat um so that you could just reach out to her um the um you know we are an amazing network of women and we zoom has been a silver lining for us because we've been able to reach more people i mean lee is coming from coming to us from denver um we've had women reach out to us as a result of all these zoom offerings that have never attended an event because they live in a remote place not near hartford so this has really been a lot of fun we wanted to tell you that we have two two dates on the calendar coming up right now tuesday march 23rd um we have an event called women's rights across the our globe our alumni at work and there's two women one from saudi arabia i believe and one from mali who are going to be talking about the work that they do and on monday april 26 we're going to have an event called words of wisdom women in leadership and it's a discussion across three generations about the role of leadership in the roles of women and it features one of our members well three of our members but terry roos who is a class of 74 i believe so um she's an amazing woman and it's worth tuning in if you can um tonight i want to introduce lee um we're in the same class together she is an accomplished cookbook author chef public speaker tv personality um and dear friend um her i mean her her bio is so long it's like hard for me to even i couldn't possibly get through it in the amount of time but let's just start that she's start her first dinner party was when she was 16. um and her first cookbook a well-seasoned kitchen she wrote with her mother and her second cookbook which is called fresh taste she published in in 2015. she is uh won so many awards i can barely list them but um what i wanted to really tell you what i know about lee is that the statue of limitations has has classed on this so that i can talk about it uh it could be called hibachi gate in 1978 that would be when cynthia and lee decided they would barter cooking in someone's room that had a cooking facility of course a lot of us lived in dorms with you know it was a big barter deal to have a refrigerator um this is back in the dark ages um and perhaps the hibachi might have been heated up on a wooden uh fire escape i don't know who makes fire escapes that are wood and perhaps the hibachi did burn through said fire escape and they had to come up with another way to cook the steak but anyway she and cynthia loved cooking and lee made it into an incredible career so with that i'm going to turn it over to lee and let's enjoy the evening i'm not going to have my cocktail until afterwards but i can't wait all right well thanks trish thanks and and welcome all my fellow trinity alums to my denver kitchen it's great fun to have you here this evening because that's what i'm all about is making cooking and entertaining easy elegant and fun and you can tell by trish's story i do like fun i'm sure cynthia will probably be putting comments um into the chat she's here this evening for those of you who aren't in the class of 80 and didn't don't know me or cynthia we were put together as freshmen at trinity randomly i was from denver she was from montreal and we're still best friends today so she was my my co-chef when we were starting to want to do dinner parties and things when we were in college as trish said i really started entertaining even in high school i loved having dinner parties i grew up in a household with a mother who was a consummate cooking hostess there were always dinner parties in our house growing up once a week or more and now what i like to do is share all those fabulous things that i learned from my mom and and other chefs and people along the way with you so you can feel comfortable and fun entertaining in your home and i know that's been something that's been very difficult for us but for all of us in the past year but things are getting a little bit better we're going into the summer we're going to be able to start getting together at least with social distance gatherings and one of my favorite things to serve at any cocktail party but especially one during these type of events where you have to stay social distance are these one and two bite appetizers nobody's reaching into a shared chip bowl nobody's having to use the same spreader to put a cheese bread or something on a cracker everybody gets their own little pieces to eat they're also great even when we come out of this hopefully by late summer or the fall they're also really fun to serve in your at your cocktail party because people don't have to put their drink down again to go dip or to spread they can just grab these right off of a plate and eat them they're really delicious and they're really fun so i'm looking forward to sharing the recipes with you as well as some of my tips and techniques and things that i've kind of learned along the way to help you again with that easy component in your kitchen so um if you again i think trish might have said but i can't remember if you have any questions go ahead and put them into the chat everything will go into the chat you can make comments if you can't see anything clearly put it in there what trish is going to do is field all those questions if something needs to really be answered immediately or it's like you can't see something she'll let me know otherwise there's going to be a break for a minute or two between each recipe when i kind of clear out the stuff from one recipe and bring in the ingredients for the end the dish and the and the cookware whatever i need for the next one and then that's when i really have the opportunity to answer a lot of questions i might so if i'm running around my kitchen i can still chat with you it's not a problem um i wanted to introduce to everybody my husband robert who is my assistant and sous chef this evening he will be helping me um he's going to help a little he's the bartender in the household so he's going to help for sure with the drink and then with a few other things so you might see him um bopping in and out we also have two dogs so if you start to hear them he will he he will go and take care of them to make sure they don't disrupt the class so let's get cooking i don't want to go over any more introduction i'll talk a little bit more in detail as we go through but let's start first with the cocktail and there is both a cocktail as you can see in your packets grab your recipe packet pages two and three of the full packet have both the cocktail and then the next page is the mocktail version so if you want to have something that you can also serve that's non-alcoholic the beauty of this is the other than the alcohol part that you substitute with ginger beer the rest of the recipe is the same so it's really easy to kind of make it so you can kind of go both ways depending on who you're having over to your house or what you feel like drinking so um i really love this recipe it's got a really wonderful blend and combination of flavors it's got bourbon in it i'm i'm kind of partial to jack daniels my mother grew up in kentucky bourbon was her drink a little bit more than mine i'm more of a vodka girl but she really loved bourbon and she really loved jack so that's kind of my primary selection for the bourbon you can i do get some questions um about this because there are several people who say oh i'm not really a bourbon person you can make this with rye which is a little bit less sweet so kind of a little bit milder you could also make it with rum you can make it with vodka i have not tried it with gin but it probably would work with that as well it's a really flexible recipe and the main ingredients in it are lemon ginger rosemary um the bourbon that's you know those those are really the primary flavors in this and they really are very flexible flavors and they'll work with any of those liquors so if you're if you're making it along get out your ingredients if you haven't done that already get your glasses ready sometimes somebody asked the question thank you very much for doing that i like to serve it in old-fashioned glasses you won't can't see this because i put the icing already but there is a trinity uh logo on here these are my trinity glasses and now just so you know if you see me looking down over here at this computer this is where i control my camera angles and this handy dandy little thing right here happens to be my iphone that's going to give you a little bit more of a close-up shot so we're going to go like this and so you can see here as well as there so hopefully you'll be able to see everything so if you look at the recipe and you saw in your instructions that um your make-ahead homework was to make a rosemary simple syrup which i already have in here that's simply just honey and water and rosemary cooked together until the honey dissolves and blends in really nicely with the water i usually kind of cook it also till i can kind of smell the rosemary a little bit then you just take that off the heat cover it and just let it steep to really get that rosemary flavor infused through the cocktail and so the rosemary syrup is now in the shaker with the ice and i'm going to add some fresh lemon juice the bourbon and the canton ginger liqueur which is where the ginger flavor comes from and the canton bottle is really you can find it if for those of you that haven't gotten it yet it looks like this it's a very unique shape bottle this is the brand of ginger liqueur i like there's two i only know of the two from france i'm not sure if anybody else is making it this is my preferred one in my sense the one that seems to be more readily available so that's in there and then we're going to put in some bitters if this part all up until here is exactly the same for the mocktail and the cocktail now you can just put in your bitters now if you're making the mocktail i'm using lemon bitters here by the way uh you can also make this with orange bitters which are a little bit easier to find however okay sorry he's got to go take the dog out i had a feeling that might happen but um the orange bitters and most angostera made bitters um have alcohol in them i mean you're only putting in a few drops but there is alcohol so you need to decide if you want to use it these lemon bitters that i found from fee brothers i'll show you up close if i can figure out where to put it um that i found on amazon does not have alcohol so just fyi on that we had a question yes it is a shaker or just a glass with ice you can do a glass with ice but you've got to figure out how you're going to cover it and shake it and i really you don't have to shake this up you could just put it in a glass and stir it the reason i like to really shake it up is because the ice helps crush the rosemary even more and gets even more of the rosemary flavor sorry i was looking at the wrong place it gets even more the rosemary flavor into the drink and so i just think it adds a little bit more but if oops if you don't have the shaker you don't then you can stir it you could um use a muddler actually um you know one of those flat things like you used to make a mojito where you met that you use or you're making a mint julep and use a muddler to mash the mint you could do that so once you shake all that up together then you pour it over ice into your glasses and this kind of a strainer um is what we out robert always uses when he makes his famous martinis which are on my website but and i like to use it for this recipe just because if you the rosemary is still in there and the majority of the rosemary leaves are not going to go into your drink you might get one or two and that's okay but if you try and strain it through the strainer here i find the rosemary gets it blocked up so it kind of doesn't work so well so anyway and then i just like to garnish it with a little sprig of rosemary and a slice of lemon so let me just give it a taste oh yeah that's really good really good and it's really good as a mocktail too instead of the bourbon and the ginger i came up with this thing to use ginger beer i tried it with soda water and i tried it with um tonic water and i tried it with ginger ale and this is the ticket it this it's just amazing it's what a mocktail to me should be which is that it's full of flavor so you don't want to gulp it you want to sip it just like a cocktail and i particularly like this q brand i believe i put that in your packets because their mixers are designed to be mixers so the ginger beer is not really designed to be consumed on its own it's consumed to be in a drink and i just think it works really really well in this okay so why don't you put your questions into the chat and trish can pass those on to me and then i am going to clean this up oh i know one thing i wanted to mention because i get a lot of questions about utens uh sort of kitchen utensils this is what i like to use to juice my lemons and limes and even my oranges one of those because the littler ones fit in here the bigger ones fit in here and you can really get all of the juice out so i wanted to mention that um i just want you to know that doug bennett said that if you don't know what if you don't have a shaker you might not have gone to trinity that would be that silly me why would i think that in the 80s and remember the drinking age was younger so of course we had flasks and shakers that's true we're getting wonderful feedback everyone's really been enjoying the mocktail and i know for one um i really like a good mocktail and um i'm really excited to have one um so i think that you know that that's just kind of just to give you the feedback and i thought i want that we should mention that at the end of this you're going to um give some links to some of this cooking equipment that you use so that people can find it where they find it besides amazon yes well the links all go to amazon but um it's on the last page of the packet and i can go over that at the end i can tell you some other places where i think you can buy those i usually just put the amazon links in since people are coming from all over the country um it's kind of hard but there are some chains that i can talk to you about where you can get some of this stuff okay other um other questions for now uh for now uh no no other questions just um okay great um well actually one other thing is just we everyone attending would like trinity to send them a pair of trinity uh classes aren't they cute i love those glasses i know the last time i went back i'm not sure they had them in that shape but they're a really nice size and a really great glass so hopefully they still have them in the bookstore so anyway now we are going to go on to the mushroom pate recipe and i love this recipe cynthia's going to come up again because i created this recipe a few years ago when cynthia was coming to from boston where she lived then to denver actually to visit her two sons who live here the old of the older of which is my godson but they were she she and her husband tom were coming in and i was having everybody over for dinner and i wanted a new fun appetizer and i had a bunch of mushrooms in my refrigerator and so i ended up creating this recipe and i really i really wanted to introduce it tonight because it's a basic pate that yes in you know postcovid times you can serve it as a dip with with crackers but during you know doing social distancing i'm really trying to stay away from using spreaders as i mentioned earlier and so this recipe really adapts perfectly to work on toasted bread sort of like a toast crostini and i actually kind of got the inspiration for that idea because when i was talking to trish and to melissa about doing this cooking demo they said well you know it's women's history month and i went oh that's interesting well you know let's kind of bring that in and obviously there's a lot of famous women chefs over the years julia child and all the ones everybody knows but one of the ones that's always really resonated with me is alice waters because all those things that we now think are so important in our cooking fresh ingredients local ingredients organic and you know non-processed alice was doing all of that way before anybody else she was really a pioneer but how that ties back to this recipe is when she first opened chapenice one of the most popular appetizers was a mushroom crostini so which happens to be a favorite recipe of mine as well it's different than my pate but it's a really delicious recipe i honestly don't know if it's in her cookbook or not because my chai penis cookbook is in storage but if you want that recipe just let me know you know you can contact me directly on every page of your packet on the bottom is my website and my email address so if you want that recipe email me and i'll send it to you i found it online on a food blogger site so i can send you the link but anyway let's go on to the mushroom recipe um i'm just going to turn this on and i'm going to ask my trusty assistant to come here and get that going for me i'm waiting to have mine until we're done so anyway let's just quickly talk about mushrooms okay so this recipe i like to use cremini mushrooms cremini mushrooms are also known as baby portabellas or baby bellows can you see that best probably if i just leave it there and um and they are they look very similar to a white mushroom basically the spectrum of mushrooms goes from white and then the next step up is the these brown ones the baby bellas or the criminy and cremini i guess that's how you say it and then the the next step up would be a full portobello mushroom the the big ones and so the flavor goes from mild to strongest sort of less earthy to the most earthy so these are kind of in the middle which is why i like them they have a little bit more flavor a little bit more earthiness into the recipe they're probably my favorite mushroom to cook with so and you usually can find them pretty regularly now if i get a lot of questions about how you clean mushrooms and i've gotten into arguments with chefs over the professional uh restaurant chefs over this because a restaurant chef you know there's all this discussion or maybe i don't know if you guys follow a lot of food blogs but there's a lot of discussion about whether or not you wash mushrooms because they're very absorbent and oh it's like oh if you wash them they're going to absorb water and then you know you're going to have a hard time cooking it's not really true if you wash them right before you excuse me right before you cook them then you can certainly rinse them and they're not going to have time to absorb water my personal feeling is i don't feel like i get them very clean when i just run them in put them in a strainer and run them under water so what i like to do is take paper towel and run damp you know get it wet bring it out and then take that and then just very quickly wipe around the heads of the mushrooms and i know it looks a little tedious but it goes really fast and that i mean that's how much time that's all it takes and then if some of the skin is loose you can take it off but i just really find you get that grit out of there i also don't particularly like to use the the stems if you do want to and it's your choice if you do want to use them i really recommend cutting off the end because that can be rubbery but i just sometimes find the stems are chewy so i pull them out and then oh i forgot to show you let me put that one back together again that's one of the ways you can tell if a portobello mushroom is fresh because um you don't want to see the i'm sorry a cremini or a baby bella is fresh you don't want to see those little um dark feathery things that are in there with a full portobello that's not that they're it's different part of its growth cycle but with these you really don't want to see that so that's one of the ways to see if they're fresh so i just pop up the stems and then for you know and then just start chopping it i for this one because i'm going to put them on the crostini i'm going to chop them a little bit finer than just in half and sliced as the standard recipe calls for i'm probably going to cut them into thirds and then just quickly chop them up and then you know remember as you know with mushrooms they're going to shrink up so but i think that's going to be a pretty good size so give me a second now i am going to get the right camera on and then i'm going to move my close-up back over here and take you over to the cooktop here i'm just going to leave you on that camera because all you'd be doing is looking at my back so anyway i have already started this recipe i melted the butter and then put in the chopped garlic and the mushrooms and i've cooked it down as you can see the liquid is pretty much all out of this i did that ahead so now i'm going to go ahead and put in the dry sherry when you cook with sherry i like to use cherry you know a nice cherry but you don't need to go for really expensive stuff but don't go for the super cheap stuff either because it is it you're putting it in to add flavor so you want it to add some nice flavor and really use dry sherry so then now what i'm going to do put in the sherry and the green onions and now i'm just going to stir this around the sherry's just going to layer in some flavor in here a little bit more into the mushrooms the butter started that i'm always a big one in my cooking about layering flavors you saw that a little bit in the cocktail with the rosemary that went right into the simple syrup so instead of just adding rosemary in as a garnish to maybe add some flavor if you really cook it into the syrup it really layers in that flavor really nicely and you get more of that flavor and same you know sherry just goes really really well with mushrooms if you're trying to stay away from alcohol you could probably do this with chicken broth or frankly probably just skip this step if you wanted to but um one question was what is the brand and size of the pan that you're using oh everybody always wants to know that it is um it's all clad limited which is actually a line of all clad that i don't believe they make anymore but they do have all clad limited too and it's a stainless steel saute pan when you see it if you see it it's kind of darker on the outside and then shiny on the inside i'm sure you could probably find it you know this exact pan on ebay but my guess is all cloud still has something similar in one of the other like the limited to line or one of the other ones so now i put in some chopped fresh thyme and now i'm putting in the cream cheese i've cubed up the cream cheese just because it's um a little bit easier to get it to melt and blend in that way and i'm just mixing that in it just adds a nice sort of creaminess to it a little bit slight tang the thyme just brings in a little herbiness it's just a really wonderful flavor of stuff that goes great with mushroom one of the things for the crostini i like to have i'll show you in a minute when we get over to plate this i like crostini that are small and for this recipe i like making them with a baguette and sometimes baguettes can be you know two to three inches or more you know really more like three or four inches which is i just don't like them that big and so i found i mean i know like people like trish in new york who has you know limitless resources can find the right size baguette anywhere in denver and then i spend we spend the majority of our time at our house up in the mountains it's not so easy and so there's a brand available in the kroger grocery stores called la brea bakery and the baguettes come in there and they're small i'll show you i love the size okay so now while i'm finishing um another question what's the heat set in there are you doing this over low medium high like it was on medium until i added the cream cheese and then i turned it down to low and then uh once that cream cheese is completely melted i'm gonna turn the heat off um i put in this a little bit of cayenne and now i'm gonna start adding some lemon juice i get questions sometimes between like well how many tablespoons are in a lemon and um you know it's hard to answer because you know lemons can be this big or they can be this big but the standard rule of thumb in sort of the recipe world is one average lemon equals three tablespoons because that can vary so significantly by lemon size i always recommend starting little like this has got a whole lemon worth of juice in it i put in half and so i always recommend i'm going to turn that off now because the cheese is melted i always recommend putting it in and tasting it and then seeing what you think so at this point now i'm also going to quickly put in some salt and pepper um lee one question came up um are any other ideas uh that you could make this recipe with other than mushrooms oh wow that's an interesting question um let me see with the cream cheese and the sherry and the lemon you know it might be good with crab if you're a a seafood eater or maybe some cooked shrimp um that might be a possibility i don't know i haven't tried it okay so then i just put in some toasted pecans and mixing it together one thing i wanted to mention about the lemon and then i'm going to taste it i'm big on tasting taste taste taste okay perfect i already put in too much lemon if you put in too much lemon don't reach for the sugar before you reach for the sugar reach for the salt and very slowly add more salt um i'm not a chemist maybe somebody else on the call or on the on the zoom is but it's a chemical relationship and so if you get something too tart just add more sugar i mean don't add sugar add more salt you know sometimes if you're making a tomato sauce and you have some really acidic tomatoes and there's almost like a tartness to the sauce and you feel like wow i should add some sugar to this add salt first you'll be amazed just do it slowly so you don't get it too salty at the same time and it works every time um so here are my crostini let's see let's do it this way here are my little crostini i need to get a clean spoon and see how little they are i mean i just love the size of these little labreas they're they're really a two bite and no more than that um little crostini and then to finish this recipe off all you do okay first of all what i really recommend what i like to do is to take this mushroom pate and you know put it like in a in a tupperware or a bowl and cover it and refrigerate it and really let the flavors blend because the you need to really let it sit for a couple hours let that time get infused in there let that sherry get infused in the lemon and really let everything mellow together in a beautiful way and and and let the flavors rest and then i take it out and you just simply put it on the little crostinis like this sorry i'm trying to figure out where the best place is to show you there you go that's a little more um like that and then if you want you can add some time here i don't know what i did with it you can just take some time leaves and you know the best way to really get thyme leaves off quickly the leaves grow up this way take it with it with the leaves going up and then you just pull your fingers down and then you can just scatter some of those on the top you know if you want to put some a bigger piece on there you can even put a twig on there it just makes it really nice and they're super yummy super delicious okay um any other questions about the the mushroom recipe before we go on oh no they want to know the name of the dogs oh karina and tina they're oh they're both looking at me now they're legato romagnolos which are the italian water dogs also known as the truffle hunting dogs in italy so and they're very cute you might get to see them before the end of the evening okay i now am going to move on to the shrimp recipe this shrimp these are called what i call shrimp curry bites this is a new recipe that i created just for my march classes so it's thoroughly one quick question back to them sure um what temperature do you serve them at i serve them at room temperature um i really think works the best okay i love this recipe it um i've been was work i've been working on this recipe for a really really long time and just couldn't really get it right and finally about a month ago i figured out the right combination of flavors and i was quite excited okay let me see let me get you guys far enough away so sorry that was probably making me dizzy all right so one of the things i want to talk about in this recipe before we get going is about shrimp this recipe calls for 12 ounces of cooked shelled deveined shrimp if like me you live in the middle of the country so you're going to be buying your shrimp frozen you need to keep in mind that frozen shrimp weighs more frozen cooked shrimp sorry weighs more than thad cooked shrimp because it ends up with a lot of water in it and so when you thaw it that water goes away when i was setting up for this recipe for tonight i bought a pound of shrimp frozen cooked shelled thawed it and then dried it out and it weighed 13.7 ounces not 16. so excuse me i just realized i need to grab the shrimp i forgot to do that one question on this recipe is um can the shrimp be made without curry yes definitely cool definitely um you know you could probably yeah i mean i'm not even sure i would add something else but yeah you could if you're not if you're not a curry fan um you definitely could so and then i'll speak on the subject of the the shrimp as well once i thought my favorite way to thaw the shrimp is in a colander under kind of tepid running water it doesn't take very long to thaw that way or you can put it in your refrigerator in a colander like on a tray so the water drains off as it thaws but i like to you can see here in the big camera i think put the shrimp on a double layer of paper towel on a pan and just let it let it drain and dry that way and then i'll take another paper towel and pat the top and just let it sit there while i make the rest of the recipe so that it really gets nice and dry because you don't want this to get watery you know and if it sits for any length of time as you know if you've ever made a shrimp sort of a appetizer recipe without getting enough water out it can it can get watery so we don't want that so in the cuisinart what type of curry powder do you use that was another question i um you know it's a good question because there's a lot of different kinds of of curry out there you know because as you know curry is a blend i there's a local spice store in denver called savory spice where i really like to go and and buy my curry and i just try different ones but what i also wanted to show you that i got for making the recipe tonight was this one because i found it at um whole foods and i've seen it at a number of different whole foods you know i go my robert and i travel around the country and do cooking demonstrations on and i do cooking demonstrations on tv and do book signings and stuff so i'm buying ingredients all over the country and i've been able to find this frontier co-op in whole foods in a number of different cities and i happen to think it's a very good blend so it's it's a good one um oh the other thing with curry too good to keep in mind like you'll notice in here um i'm pretty far down in the jar so this has been open for a little bit longer so i might need a little bit more you always need to keep in mind with any of your jarred spices that once you open it when you first open it it's going to be the most fresh the most flavorful the most pungent and then the the longer it sits in there that flavor is going to start to decline so i always tell people to kind of think about that when you're measuring in spices if you just open the jar you might want to start with a little bit less and taste it conversely if you're at the bottom definitely start with what the recipe calls for and see if you don't need to add a little bit more so what's in the cuisinart in here is the cream cheese which i cubed up and put in here with the butter and the mayonnaise and that's already been blended up just to get us a little bit of a head start and so what i'm going to put in next you don't need to mix these ahead i just did this as a time saver but there's the garlic powder and the curry powder in here and if you are a non-garlic lover or you have friends that can eat garlic or don't like garlic you can certainly leave out the powder and throw some chopped fresh salads in here or if they're vampires my husband says but um and so you can just throw some chopped shallots in or just leave it out all together but shallots would go nicely in this too and then in here i have the worcestershire sauce the lemon juice the tabasco what am i forgetting dijon mustard i'm gonna pour all that in there and i'm gonna turn this on add some cranks i'm gonna need to scrape it down a little bit get this going this recipe is one as well that you could serve as a as a dip post covered if you want but again i love it in the bites um you're going to see in a minute that i just like to serve it in those little um um phyllo mini phyllo tart tartlets i guess they're called or tarts that you can buy just in a box in the freezer section at your grocery store if you are doing a recipe that you want to use those tarts for and you're in um it's not all completely mixing together you can probably see that down in there but i'm just going to stir it together because it's it's a little bit by hand because the liquids kind of getting stuck in the middle but one thing if you're going to be doing a recipe with these the little tartlets around the holidays um i would suggest buying them in advance and throwing them in your freezer because i've gotten stuck before where the grocery store runs out so now i put some chopped green onion in there some chopped cilantro if you're not a cilantro person cilantro tastes like soap to you i i don't know if you all know this or not but that's actually genetic you have a certain gene and if you have that gene cilantro tastes like soap so if you have that gene or one of your family members does or a friend does just use parsley uh chopped fresh italian parsley would be just as good in this i'm just gonna i do go ahead and chop the onion and the cilantro ahead of time for this because i found if you don't if you put it in in big hunks by the time the cuisinart is done chopping it you've really kind of over mixed a little bit the rest of the ingredients so i don't like to do that okay so now we're going to take this out just scrape that off um just while you're cooking a couple questions okay where do you get those beaker measuring containers oh these i got uh i didn't put a link in for these they're made by oxo oxo you can get them on amazon i've also seen them at bed bath and beyond but anywhere that they sell that oxo brand you should be able to find them they're my favorite i really love them so i'm going to scrape this out i'm not going to worry too much about getting every single bit out because i'm going to chop the shrimp in here next and then it's all going together in the end i just find that if you try to put the shrimp in here and chop it with everything else everything else just gets over processed so it's better just to do that and just to take that part out and then quickly do the shrimp my husband's asking a question i don't know if you can hear him i purposely didn't give him a mic if cilantro tastes like soap to you how do you know it's so tasty he wants to know he said if so if cilantro tastes like soap to you how do you know what soap tastes like well if you're the generation of me and my classmates it would be if you said something bad as a child you've got to sit with a bar of soap in your mouth but anyway so i have i'm putting the shrimp in here i find that i think medium is the perfect size shrimp for this recipe because it's small enough to chop up quickly but not so much so small that you end up with the shrimp puree because you don't want it too too pureed you want it just you know you still want some hunks of shrimp in there so i just take it oops here we go kind of moving there you go just do this just take some pulses this is going to be really yummy if you live in an area where you actually get to buy um shrimp fresh there's just those of us in this part of the world but they're doing a really good job with the frozen so anyway it's chopped so just so you can really kind of see the consistency in there okay and then honey you can take the cuisinart out of the way thank you i'll bring this over here [Music] and then dump the shrimp that's now sort of picked up any of the sauce that i left in the cuisinart and then you just stir it all together and then you put it in those little filo cups and then if you want you can garnish it with more chopped cilantro or parsley more chopped onion sometimes i find it just almost doesn't even really need a garnish because it's got all these really pretty green uh flecks through it and it's sort of that pretty you know kind of goldeny yellowy slightly grainy curry color with the flecks from the onion and the cilantro already and you've got the little pink pieces of shrimp showing through so it's really pretty so you just stir all that me while you're stirring yep um if someone lives in the denver area and you know wants to find about cooking classes or demonstrations you're doing what's the best way to find you on my website or and or follow me excuse me follow me on social media my brand name i didn't mention that earlier my bad is a well-seasoned kitchen so you'll see again in your packet on every page is my website but there's an event tab in there but i will always also post stuff on facebook for sure and sometimes on instagram if i can figure out how to do that but always on on facebook so here are the little phyllo tartlets i did just um cook these off per the rest of the box instructions so you put them in a i don't know i think it's like a 350 degree oven or something for like four or five minutes just so they get crispy and kind of sometimes get this little tinge of color on them and then you take this oh you salt and pepper it too which um i didn't do but that's okay i'll do it later and then i just take a spoon and kind of fill them in there like that and then like i said if you want you could use some green onion or i just happen to have some chopped cilantro here and then you can just you know sprinkle the little leaves on the top give it a little pop on the plate like that and then serve them and again you can make the shrimp ahead i would recommend again probably making it ahead letting it sit for an hour or two let those flavors really get all nicely blended together i don't know if i mentioned this with the mushroom but usually after i've let something sit i'm you know i do this if you have one of my cookbooks or look at the recipes on my site you'll see me talking about letting things sit a lot because letting those flavors blend i think is really important but then one after you've let it sit you should taste it again and just make sure you know maybe with this one does it need a little more curry powder does it need a little more salt does it need something else and then you can um and then you can adjust it before you serve it and i would serve these also at room temperature i like the mushroom croustats okay so we have one more thing how are we doing on time oh we're not doing too bad okay um and the next one is really actually pretty quick hey lee i was able to put your um your website on uh oh wait bonnie put in i wanted the instagram account so i'm just putting trying to put these things in the chat so i am i'm seasoned kitchen on everything pinterest facebook instagram youtube i might be but it's a little bit trickier to get there because some little girl in taiwan decided she wanted it i don't know why because i own that on every other tick tock i own it on everything except it's i think you have to put something else in there on but anyway if you go to youtube and put in a well-seasoned kitchen or put in lee roper season kitchen you'll go to my page okay the last recipe that we're making is called prosciutto fig and goat cheese tarts this recipe is in my second cookbook fresh tastes it is super easy it is as you can tell with all these recipes because something that's always been pretty important to me is being able to make stuff ahead and all these recipes you can make ahead and this one you have to make ahead because you really need to freeze them before you bake them if you don't actually let's turn this around if you don't um they're gonna blow up out of their little tins so i'll tell you about that in a second okay so prosciutto fig and goat cheese tarts there is this is um a riff on a recipe that's in my first cookbook a well seasoned kitchen called cheddar chutney tarts in terms of that it's the same technique which is your what we're going to do is just take purchased puff pastry you get a sheet out you thought you know it's important to work with puff pastry when it's cool so you thought as i'm sure you know from the box at room temperature 35 40 minutes it should be thawed you're ready to go but if it starts to get too warm while you're working with it or you left it out too long you're going to want to put it back in the refrigerator and chill it up again a little bit because if it gets too warm it gets really stretchy and difficult to work with and you're not going to be happy with the results so that's my tip on puff pastry so this mat i'm using is you have a link to this on the last page in your packet and it's called do easy doe easy and you can get this on amazon here it is there's that's what it looks like see this is how we roll no fuss in a flowery mask because you don't need to use flour with this mat and it comes with these really cool guides so like if you're rolling out cookies and pastry you can put the guides down and then if you need to be one-eighth of an inch thick or a quarter of an inch thick you don't need to worry so it's really cool and then on this side there's guides for the size of your you know how far you want if you want to do 14 inch round 12 inch 9 inch it's all here there's a ruler around the outside so it really makes things easy and i really it's it's and and it doesn't stick actually when you're i'm not going to do it now and i'll show you in a minute but you can actually fold this over and roll here if you're doing pie dough i find it dust still needs a little bit of flour the other thing that i really like and it was so funny when i did one of my first cooking classes and somebody's like what's that thing on your rolling pin well i was raised in a household with a mother who had this on a rolling pin so i just thought everybody did it's like a sleeve and it fits over your rolling pin and again you need minimal flour to keep it from sticking comes off goes in the washing machine i usually have two if i'm doing any gluten-free cooking i'm going to use one i only use it for that even though i wash it and then i have a second one for doing the rest of my cooking so if i've got my gluten-free friends coming over i can be safe for them so and we didn't talk about that earlier by the way remind me i'll come back to gluten free because you can easily do gluten-free versions of the other two recipes this one's a little bit harder but anyway i've already pre-rolled this out um i'd have shrunk a little i had it oh no it's still the right size and um and so you roll it out and then you cut into two inch squares so you can kind of just get your guide up there what i usually do is kind of put it up there and then come down here go over around two inches connect the dots you can get a ruler to help you too and just put a ruler down and then you just cut this into two inch squares just like that that one might be a little bit small some of these might be and if you end up you know you find oh it's not you know maybe cut it a little small you can just pull them like this and get them apart and then what you're going to do is take a mini muffin tin a little bit take a mini i've already done some of these up here but i'll show you down here you take a mini muffin tin you put your little square in there and then you can push it down gently with your fingers like that or you can put it in and then use this which is called a mini pastry tamper and you have a link for this too the pampered chef brand is the one i bought about i don't know 20 years ago 25 years ago and i this is it and i still use it and you can get this exact one on amazon but there's a lot of them that look like this and they're really great to have for when you're putting things in mini muffin tins for a recipe for some mushroom croustats where you do you cut out rounds of bread and the bread is a lot harder to get in there with your hands you can just really push it down with this and get it to stay in there so once you put the little pastries in there then you take a fork you poke it once or twice in the bottom then you're going to take some fig spread this is just the stand this standard dum damasha fig spread that you can get any any major grocery store that i've been in they have it in the deli and there's different brands and different kinds you can play around with it and substitute different things but i really am i really like this particular brand and then you're just going to put a little bit in each one it's the exact measurement remember teaspoon half a teaspoon i don't remember what i put in there and then you're gonna sprinkle some chopped prosciutto you can just get any prosciutto i'm partial to italian getting the italian ones i i find for this recipe though if i go to the deli counter in my grocery store and buy it there i can control how thick they cut it because prosciutto tends to be shaved really thin if you buy it pre-cut which makes it harder to chop so if you go to the deli counter then you can buy slices a little bit thicker and it's a little bit easier to chop up for this recipe i also trim off some of the real fatty ends so somebody doesn't end up with a big hunk of fat and then what i'm doing is putting some goat cheese in here some goat cheese crumbles sprinkling it in i just bought these as crumbles one thing i want to point out to you this is this vermont brand when you're buying crunch like feta cheese blue cheese goat cheese crumbles if you're buying pre-shredded cheese please please please check the ingredients there this does not have it because i bought it but sometimes often there's an ingredient called cellulose cellulose is ground cardboard so obviously the fda has allowed it in small doses but if you eat a lot of cheese and a lot of stuff that's pre-shredded and pre-crumbled just you're eating a lot of ground cardboard which can't really be good for you so i recommend staying away from it and it's just a quick scan of the ingredients you you with goat cheese crumbles and feta i've always been able to find ones parmesan cheese is the same i've always been able to find them that don't have the cellulose in them it's harder with grated cheese you might have to grate your own cheese if you eat as much cheese as i do and stay away from that but with the crumbles parmesan romano it's not a problem so anyway once you get these all filled then you freeze this until they're frozen solid and then what i do is usually then just um pop them out of the little thing and put them in a ziploc baggie frozen back in my freezer and then they're ready to go you can make them up to two months before your party excuse me and they're ready to go you take them back out of the baggie put them back in the tins and bake them when they're frozen and i mean they can throw a little while the oven's preheating but you don't want to thaw them too much because if you cook these when they're not frozen the insides can kind of blow up you know that the pastry puffs too much and it sort of blows everything out and it kind of runs all over the pan it makes a mess doesn't look very pretty and so speaking of looking pretty when they are okay let me see now i have to get back to my zoom i'm just going to share my screen okay that's what they look like when they're cooked so they're just really pretty they're you know they're they're a little puffy they've got some wonderful flavors going on between the you know just between the prosciutto and the and the cheese the tang of the cheese and the the sweetness of the fig and it just really blends together and it's really um super fun uh super fun flavors and super fun to serve and looks pretty on the plate all those things that were important to my mom and are important to me too okay um trish are there questions before i go on the last few things just some comments oh mainly because the comments are we love all the fun facts you know you know me personally i love the cilantro fact because my husband hates it and i really love to know one average lemon is about three tablespoons because i'm too lazy to squeeze it into the to the spoon i'm a guesstimator i'm a home cook guesstimator and yeah and i love knowing that fact good good i'm glad you're welcome so on page eight oh here let me get rid of this i don't you don't need two screens now i'm just gonna be talking unless you ask me a question i need to show you one other one question that came up is um any other tips for drinks to go along with these appetizers you know i was thinking about this on my website is my family's um and well really my adaptation of my mother's family's mint julep recipe which is um you'll see a lot of similarity it has a simple syrup that i that's the difference my mom's family recipe what i added in is i put a mint infused simple syrup in there to make into it but that would also go in this my husband's manhattan recipe which is i think on the website it's in my cookbook fresh taste i'm pretty sure i put it on the website and his martini recipe which is on the website would go really well with these um i think a rum most rum drinks would go too i think would really blend well with these recipes so on page eight of your packet are some other ideas for one and two bite appetizers i'm going to share my screen again this um and these are just some things that you can quickly do for you know one and two bite or social distance i really should say they're not necessarily one and two but ideas for serving orders appetizers and you can see them in the picture one is you just take a little small plastic or glass these little ones that you see in the photo are plastic they come from party city but you can get little glass ones i've seen a ton of them at bed bath and just put you know fill it half three quarters full with your favorite veggie dip recipe or ranch dressing ranch dip something and then just put spears of fresh vegetables in there you can do like in the picture that's red pepper and celery and carrot and you can do a little piece of asparagus whatever you want another one up here on the top is a dessert one so if you want to put out something sweet same idea but just put like that's a parfait of um pound cake and a strawberry salsa you can do chocolate mousse in there you can do shot glasses with your you know favorite soups in them i've done both hot and cold works the best kind of with pureed or quasi-pureed soups so and then if you want to serve a dip you really want to serve like a dip that goes with crackers just put together little individual plates if you're doing a smaller social distance gathering you know maybe you're going to have four friends over have a small plate for each one or if you're having four couples do like a shared plate for each couple i find a charger plate is the perfect size for sort of a shared couple thing especially if you're doing like a cheese and prosciutto plate so there's a lot of ways that you can do this and really keep it so that people are safe and comfortable on the page nine of your packet i promised in the description for the class that i would talk to you about um how to make menus work for appetizers how much food to plan for how you know how many portions all of that and it's it's not an exact science but i explain it all on this page with some of my other tips so how you put together a menu so like how what i was thinking about when i was putting these three hors d'oeuvres together and this applies also most of what's on here would also apply if you're doing a dinner party menu and then the last page is where you have links to the different places to buy the various uh products that i talked about the only one i didn't talk about was the garlic press which i'll just quickly um mention let me stop sharing my screen so you can see um i like this i like these ones and there are several different brands i think i link to one because they're really easy to use and easy to clean see how that comes completely apart so when you do the press put the garlic in there and then you push it but then it just flips out so it's super easy to clean and i did a link to one of the brands there are there's a page on my website that link that has all of my favorite kitchen tools on it actually i'm going to put those oxo beakers on there because i realized i don't think they're on there but you can go on there and get all of these as well every like i said everything links to amazon just because nationally that's the easiest way to do it bed bath and beyond is a really good resource for a lot of these things so is surla table or william sonoma either online or in the stores but any of those major chains would also be a good place to go and then just on the bottom of that page i put links to where you can buy my cookbooks so if you're interested um amazon barnes and noble usually have always have both indiebound.org is a site that promotes all the independent bookstores around the country so you can go in there those books i have no idea who this is all handled through my distributor so i have no idea whoever has inventory but any of these links should take you to somebody who could order the book if they don't have it the only one i check regularly honestly is amazon and they usually always have both books so anyway that is the end of my presentation i'm sorry only 10 minutes over that wasn't too bad so anyway what other questions do you have wait it's mainly like everyone's saying how much they enjoyed it that they love a couple of people are already fans they own your cookbooks oh oh yeah and um they said it was educational and a lot of fun and i want to thank you on behalf of the women's leadership council and trinity for um agreeing to give your time to do this wonderful event what how great and and inspirational and we can't thank you enough um i want to say to every other participants that you're going to receive an email tomorrow with a post event survey this is um important uh for the college and metrics you know so if you wouldn't mind filling it out and giving us a positive rating we'd appreciate it um and we're putting some stuff in the chat about um uh the women's leadership council facebook page and a hopefully instagram page and we hope that you can you'll look on social media to find out about our upcoming events and we hope that you'll come to more of our events and um just everyone's just you know on cloud nine thank you so much lee i can't thank you enough i mean again thanks thanks i'm happy to do it it was fun thank you there have a great evening okay bye you", "l_hXRVk-7Uk": "here is a list of the ingredients here's what's nice with this recipe you take all of the ingredients and put them in the blender and just make sure there are no lumps once you have finished preparing the batter leave it to rest for at least an hour before starting the actual process of cooking the crepe make sure to blend the mixture once more check that your pan is hot before pouring anything on it you should see a hint of smoke add a little bit of butter and voila you are ready to go take some batter and put a very small amount just so that it covers the pan this is not a pancake so do not add too much or it will be too thick if there is excess just pour it out when you get the feeling that your crab is cooked or if you see the edges burning up get ready to flip it by unsticking the sides from the pan starting with your spatula and slowly getting to the middle [Music] while these crops are cooking let's debunk some stereotypes i've heard about french people while living here i would like to start by saying that we do not wear a marinara and the beret every day here's proof i don't even have a beret secondly the french language does not solely consist of the words we baguette and croissant and the way you pronounce those words is not we baguette or croissant speaking of baguettes we do not carry them around everywhere with us french people do not have a baguette under their arm unless they just went to the boulangerie there are so many more stereotypes that i could list but sadly we don't have the time today let's go back to cooking [Music] hello everyone my name is alice thank [Music] you this is how you make kong shaw ro my friend nadoke and i are at 99 ranch right now to get some thick cut pork belly after we've acquired the meat we cut the pork into bite sized cute pieces we then soak the pork for one hour changing the water halfway through to get rid of the odor after soaking the meat we will be boiling the meat in water make sure to have enough water to fully submerge the meat when the water starts boiling put a splash of rice wine in take the pot out of the heat drain the water out and rinse the boiled meat with warm water now cut some ginger lemon peel and green onion take three pieces of clove basil leaf cinnamon stick and peppercorn to taste in a pan put a splash of oil and two tablespoons of sugar stir until the sugar melts completely or when it turns brown put the meat in and continue add a little water to prevent the meat from burning then add soy sauce and the rest of the spices and ingredients that you've prepared before when the aroma of the ingredients start to come out add more water until the meat is fully submerged boil it on high heat until it starts to bubble then turn the heat down to medium low for another 30 minutes when the time is up turn the heat back to high open the lid and stir until the water is mostly evaporated leaving a thick sauce add some garlic if you like that extra kick you plate it and then you're done is foreign [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] it [Music] i'm [Music] could [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] like and my family is from russia and today i thought i'd like to share with you some of the most common foods in russian cuisine let's go this is black bread or chocolate it's made out of rye flour as opposed to wheat flour which is what the most common type of bread here is made out of and it's a very common staple in russian cuisine we can't live without it we eat it with everything this is a beetroot or just a beet that's bright red inside and one of the most common types of soup in russia called borscht uses this as this main ingredient it's this bright red soup with a lot of other vegetables floating in it this is buckwheat grecha in russian and some type of grain that's also commonly used as a side dish if you're boiled then it looks like this uh it's a very healthy type of grain and it's gluten free this canned drink is called kuvas it's basically a non-alcoholic type of beer or root beer that's made from bread so whereas if you're making beer you would ferment grain here you bake the grain into bread and then ferment the bread and to create quas so it's kind of a fizzy drink it has bubbles in it but it's it's not alcoholic like beer and there are many different types of class this is just a brand that i like but you can find many different brands these are are sprats or in russian all right that's basically smoked fish that's put in oil and kept in the can this right here is tea or chai in russian i know chai is a word that a lot of other languages use for it uh it's just black tea i think that's the most common type we have and this right here is a fancy cup holder that is used in russia very often so this is the glass that you put the tea in and then this is the old area you just keep it in there drink it like this uh this right here is a type of soup called rasoolnik it has a lot of interesting ingredients in it for example it has pickles floating in it you know pickles are something that's not very commonly put in soup in these parts but they are in russia uh these are called pilmena and they're basically a type of dumpling so they have meat on the inside they're frozen right now but you boil them and you cook them that way and they actually come from some of the cultures of the indigenous peoples of russia in this area of russia uh these are russian pancakes or blue me they're more similar to what we think of as crepes they are very thin they look like this they're so thin that you can just roll them up or fold them up whichever way you like and you eat them that way we usually put jam on them this is a black currant jam that is one of the most common types in russia uh all of the foods i just showed you are available at oakmont market which is a international grocery store that's on homestead road just down the road from homestead uh it's a really interesting place it has a lot of foods that aren't available anywhere else so i would recommend it thank you everyone sudanya hello my name is connor and today i'm going to show you how to fold a japanese paper crane before i start i just want to say that i'm using a pre-folded crane so it's easier to show to begin you need an origami paper or some other type of squared paper then you want to fold the paper in half into a rectangle fold it in half again so you have a square unfold your paper back into the big square then flip over your paper and do the same thing except instead of two rectangles you want to do two triangles unfold the triangles then you want to flip your paper back over and fold it into a rectangle again then take the top right corner and push it towards the middle bottom of the rectangle it should look something like this then take the bottom right corner of the small triangle and then push it towards the middle bottom of the page as well you should have something that looks like a square next you want to hold your paper like a diamond and fold the edges into the middle so it looks like a kite do this to both sides then fold the small triangle on top down and back up do this to both sides as well unfold the flaps back into a square next at the bottom take one flap and fold it up while doing this you'll need to fold the sides in at the same time it should go something like this once again you'll need to fold the side edges towards the middle you should have something that looks like little legs fold the leg looking things up and then back down do this on both sides then on the right or left side open up the flap and lift the leg into the open flap and then close the flap the process should look something like this do this on the other side then on one of the legs you just folded you want to open up the tip a bit and then fold it down this will be its little head the wings which are the bigger flaps on the side can be done two different ways you can do the simpler way of just folding them down or you can fold them all the way down and pull on them so that it looks like it has a body as well holding the wings should look something like this and there you go you have your very own paper crane in japanese culture ukraine represents hope inhaling during challenging times it is believed that folding one thousand paper grains called sen bazaru makes one wish come true for example when the giant tsunami started japan in 2011 people around the world sent 1 000 koreans to japan to express empathy and show support i hope you learned something new about japanese culture and thank you for watching sayonara konichiwa i'm chapman i'm half japanese and i'll be representing japan's culture is a game played in japan on new year's day there's a saying which means that happiness will come to laughing families like pin the tail on the donkey in which the player is blindfolded but instead of pinning the tail they'll be placing cutouts of facial features on okane who is believed to bring good luck in japanese culture so we'll kind of show you how it's done so people are able to give guidance on the side to where the player can put the facial features but if they wish to not they don't have to once the player is confident that they have tried their best they can remove their blindfold and do their creation usually the face does not end up looking that great and that leads to a laughter of the family [Music] hi everyone my name is tahiti and i'm from indo pack and i'll be talking a little bit about south asian awareness culture and just a couple things to keep in mind as we continue to interact with the south asian community and just as a quick disclaimer before we get started unfortunately for the sake of time we're not able to cover every single south asian country each one definitely contributes a lot to south asian culture but today we'll be focusing on three very prominent ones especially within our homes community which are india nepal and sri lanka so the first country that we'll be starting with is india um india is a very large geographic area um within south asia consisting of 29 states and six union territories and it has 18 official languages and 114 sub dialectical languages hindi is a national language of india but english is also very commonly used and it is the seventh largest country in the entire world with the population of 1.08 billion people and so india is especially known for its religious diversity um including hinduism islam buddhism jainism christianity and many more next we have nepal which is the 93rd largest country in the world with seven main provinces and 28.9 million people nepal has over 92 languages with nepali being the main primary language and it is also very religiously diverse with religions including hinduism buddhism islam and christianity next we have sri lanka which is also another south asian country with a population of around 21.8 million residents and so the three main languages spoken in sri lanka are sinhala tamil and english and the country gained its full independence in 1948 and one fun fact about sri lanka is that it is the world's fourth largest tea producer and the third largest tea exporter so now i'll be talking a little bit more about the south asian experience just a couple things that we wish more people had known about um kind of from the south asian perspective the first one i'll be going over is colorism and as i'm sure many of us know this is kind of the concept where one skin tone is considered to be more valuable or more beautiful than another and throughout history we've kind of seen this trend of individuals valuing lighter skin tones over darker skin tones and so fundamentally this concept is very flawed and in no way is one skin tone more beautiful or precious than another skin tone and so as a generation that has the power to spark a lot of really good social change it's really important to us south asians that we continue to not perpetuate this stereotype and just continue to develop a more inclusive and supportive and diverse community at homestead and so another concept that we tend to think about as south asians is this lack of representation that we see within media and so here are four very very influential south asian figures that have made their way into numerous career paths and have broken a lot of societal barriers to get to where they are today the first one is kamala harris who is a half indian and half black woman who is currently our vice president and attorney and next we have prabhal gurung who is a nepali fashion designer who made his way into american culture and has been very very successful over the past couple of years and we also have deepika matyala who is a beauty youtuber and a south asian woman who created her own company that especially supports people of color in the beauty industry and lastly we have jamat palihapidia who is a venture capitalist and executive who has done incredible things within the business world and so just in general um a couple things to keep in mind in terms of appreciating the diversity that we have not only at home said but also in the future as we continue to interact with south asians a lot of people tend to refer to anyone with brown skin as indian or hindu but just keep in mind that as we kind of went over today there are so so many different countries within south asia including nepal sri lanka india pakistan bangladesh the list goes on and so it's really important that we continue to use more inclusive terms like south asian as we kind of did throughout this presentation and also try to avoid common south asian stereotypes um and kind of this kind of colorism that we have seen going on for centuries and is which is still very prevalent in society today it's always better to ask instead of assuming and also it's totally fine to take part in south asian activities like doing yoga or um taking part in diwali festivals and holy festivals just make sure to know the significance and importance behind each culture and tradition and if you have any questions feel free to reach out to us and we would be more than happy to spread more information about it thank you so much for your time and we hope you were able to learn something new about the south asian experience today thank you", "l4BBilACiig":

bread my homemade multigrain bread [Music] okay here's what we have for my homemade multigrain bread and i'm making a big batch probably two large loaves just because that's all the bread we're eating right now we're not buying store-bought here i have six cups of my organic flour that i bought last year and put in the freezer two cups of my homemade multi-grain mix some sunflower oil some milk some eggs some warm water and in that little tub i have two teaspoons of salt two teaspoons of instant yeast and two teaspoons of sugar and two eggs right there right so let's get going okay so sam is going to be put through his paces today so here we have i don't know two and a half cups of hot water to which i'm going to add about a cup of two percent milk it's cold and that will even out the temperature you don't want to use hot water or you can kill your yeast unless you're going to be putting something in there to cool it down so let's put in our sugar our salt and our yeast and let's get sam up and remember if you're using the dough hook no more than two two eggs [Music] and a couple of tablespoons to a quarter cup of oil you can use butter if you like now this isn't necessarily going to beat those eggs up until we start adding things like flour and there's a lovely lady who gave me these three mixing bowls and they actually have a little pour spout on them and they're plastic so they make it easy to just shake that in there that's our six cups of flour and here go are two cups of multi-grain mix now my liquids weren't exactly measured so i'm keeping the flour on standby in case i need to add some and that still looks really soft so now we're up to eight i always start with less flour just in case now we're up to eight cups of flour and i'm going to add some more multi-grain mix today is saturday and this is our upcoming weekly bread one more cup of multigrain mix and three quarters of a cup of flour let's just stop this for a second and get this dough down oh oh i may have made it too heavy it was looking too wet but we'll see that's looking pretty perfect all right all right oh yeah that's nice so now what i'm gonna do and this may be more than two big loaves i'm gonna put a little bit of oil in the bottom here like i said you can use butter we're just going to coat this all over the outside with the oil and then i'm going to put this grocery bag over top and i have set my hub oven at 100 degrees and when it reached temperature i shut it off and this is going in the oven until it rises alrighty look isn't that beautiful all right i'm just going to take some flour here i keep these old cotton tablecloth just for kneading bread i can't find my dough scraper so i'm just going to grab this down here it really won't stick that bad because remember we oiled the outside of the dough there she be now i think this actually might be too much dough for two pans so we'll see so let's have a look let's get this cut down the center here this one might be a little bit smaller so all right let's roll it up try and spread it out to keep your your log kind of even right that's going to be beautiful pinch the ends whoops grabbing paper all over the place here kind of just shake it a little bit until it's the length of the inside of your pan like that the ends so we're just going to rest our two loaves here we're going to cover them just like that until they rise let's have a look oh isn't that beautiful now these are going into a 375 degree oven for 35 to 40 minutes our timer has gone off and here is our lovely hot out of the oven homemade bread ouch oh i had a piece stuck my parchment must have ripped oh well now you can a lot of people will butter i know i used to will butters or bread when it comes out of the oven to make the crust soft i don't and nice hollow sound means it's cooked what i do is i just re-wrap it back up in the tablecloth and let it sweat and what that does is it makes the crust soft without adding any oil or butter now i want to show you what sweating the bread does look look soft see nice and soft without having to grease it that beautiful this is the miss avovie from our half acre homestead and that is how i make my homemade multigrain bread take care god bless [Music]", "zZ1-HZXeaVY": "what's going on guys my name is Jeff also known as popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe I got a lot of lip videos on the way like today I'm gonna be smoking this pre-roll from Lux rolls now Lux rolls is a company that sells cones that you can stuff yourself to make these epic ass parade rolls I really like these some people can't roll as well as others so if you want a nice big fat joint for a special occasion sometimes it's hard to do so this company literally allows you to make a cone like the raw cones but these ones are way more bougie they come in these nice little tubes so they have one that looks like a hundred dollar bill they have even fatter ones then they have the classic cannon which is the one that we're gonna be smoking today personally this is my favorite size out of all the ones they make I really like that it comes with a wood tip I really like just the amount of wheat that fits in it it's about 3 grams maybe 4 I didn't actually scale it out but without further ado I said you spark this up [Music] I put live breath and keep on the outside of it oh yeah that keep his burden I really love the size of these joints bed they are [ __ ] huge so on the video where I cut open a $50 pre-roll I said that I could make one myself for less money and a couple of you guys told me to do it so that's what I'm doing in this video I stuffed Durbin poison flour in this joint there's sour tangi live resin coated on the outside and then I rolled that Keef we keep this bird away faster than the actual bug but I'm not too concerned as of now the Durbin poison flower that I put in here was gifted to me by my buddy he grew it himself and like I'm really picky about weed but I gotta say this dude's Durbin poison was like out of this world I truly appreciate it you know who you are bro thank you very much free weed is always the best weed especially when it's good [Music] I got a radio this very second guys like I said in the pre-roll video I think it concentrates and Keith belong on the inside of the joint but I wanted to actually recreate that $50 role so that's why I put it on the outside it's definitely wasteful like there's way more smoke coming out of this and a normal joint and that smoke that could be going in your lungs let me show you a little close to finish you can see the oil actually melting down I put it decent amount of live resin on the outside of this whoo it's just got me shaking dude this is the first day of smoke today I'm lit oh my god guys this thing is ripping so hard for those of you guys who don't follow me on snapchat you probably don't know I just had surgery on my nose I had a deviated septum so basically I couldn't breathe well through it so for the last week I've just been recovering and man holy [ __ ] like my collar ins went down so much good I didn't smoke normally I don't take tolerance breaks but in the situation I was like bucket let me just not really smoke a like one edible one day but ultimately my collar ins went down with a block time dude the flavor oh this is so good the sour tangi library is mixed with the Durbin poison it's just a super [ __ ] fruity medley of deliciousness when the key that's a nice touch to my Keef is like all PA dispensary medical weed Keef so it's like some delicious fire beautiful Keef this is definitely better than the pre-roll in the $50.00 pre-roll video just because I know the weed was fresher the oil was live resin not co2 oil and the kief was definitely like better keep a lot of the dispensary chief I just know it's just shitty Keef that's why it's so cheap versus like when you actually get Keef from your weed and your grinder like there's no Keef better than homemade Keef [ __ ] yo oh okay you hit guys your turn ritual toks I'm so glad to be boomer the surgery and pretty much recovered with a deviated septum I couldn't really breathe well through my nose it was like breathing through a coffee straw instead of like a McDonald's straw if I was congested at all I just like naturally could not breathe so I got the procedure it's a septoplasty and annoyed ectomy I honestly don't even really know what the procedure is like I just was like cooled up do what you got to do but now that that process is over I'm back to smoking and I not gonna lie guys I missed it like there's no withdrawal really from not smoking for me like the worst thing is like I can't sleep well that's like really the biggest issue with me when I don't smoke I am totally not too profitable and able to sleep like I smoke so much I should date myself basically by the end of the night I remember my entire childhood growing up I would never be able to fall asleep when it was bedtime like I would always land that for an hour - just trying to fall asleep I think that's why I started to like weed when I started smoking it so I was like oh my first time smoking weed I got so [ __ ] stoned you guys like mids and heads was like the two options back then and like people around me all smoked mids but for whatever reason this day that I decided to agree with these guys they had heads and before we didn't get back to the skatepark I am so [ __ ] stoned like I remember getting out of the car and walking back to the skate park and being like holy [ __ ] I've never experienced anything like this like I was just giggling colors were more vibrant and I just like everything was just funny and I was like in love with the feeling but what my mom picked me up and I got back home I remember I literally fell asleep in our living room like half on the Ottoman half on the couch and like my stomach was just like in like the open air between it like it literally was just like based out of sleep for some reason they just thought it had like a long day at the skate park and didn't say anything about it but how the stones [ __ ] once I got past the keep you guys and the oil it has just had a really nice slow even burn you see that notice bro can do French inhales all day now no problem buy one of these for yourself and just stuffing it with weed is so much cheaper than buying pre-rolls from the dispensary and then you know it's actually inside it even if the pre-roll is out the dispensaries were recently priced usually there's just [ __ ] mids in there so it's nice being able to stuff your own fire weed in there and there's only being like thirty bucks instead of fifty dollars to 100 bucks but seriously if you think about it this cone was like two bucks say an eight the weed is like $25 I maybe put like ten dollars worth of live resin on it which is really really stretching it so we're at like 35 bucks and then like keep this free but let's say five bucks forty dollars for something that is literally twice the size and twice the experience of what that $50 pre-roll was not in California not trying to be a hater on pre-rolls I just like I always would smoke them and I'd be like these are kind of shitty and now that I've like broken a couple it open did the science I'm just like yeah welcome I'd rather stuff my own getting rough I love the wood tip though you can just rip the [ __ ] out of it and it has that black and milds okay green and spicy vibe to it and I just like it so much more I forgot to actually have this one though this is probably their coolest kit they got they put you down for a second it comes with two in one two he comes with this giant cannon I think I felt like five grams and the last one I put in this and then it comes with another one tip cone pretty much like the one I'm smoking right now let me know if you want to see another mini of me doing something like this with these also I'm going to Colorado so you guys so expect a couple more Colorado videos coming up let me know if there's any products you want me to check out while I'm out there or if there's any strain specifically you want me to pick up or any companies you want me to try one thing I do definitely want to find is some like sauce cartridges or just some sort of cartridges with some crazy consistencies because I know there's a lot out there okay I'm so done I definitely just [ __ ] my day up especially now that I just don't really have a

to take my roller out for my bangs what's going on guys welcome back to another video today i'm gonna be making sourdough for the first time well not sourdough yet i'm making the starter right now that's the foundation of any good sourdough bread you can't have sourdough without a starter now i've never done this before so we're going to be on this journey together and i wanted to share the process because i don't know i thought it could be fun i will share you know the highs the lows you guys are going to get the real life ins and outs of making sourdough bread in case you don't know a lot about sourdough it's really difficult to make it's not like a regular old loaf of bread it takes a lot of finesse and practice and every loaf comes out different and you kind of don't know what's going to happen and that's why you have to experiment with it so i'm starting the process now i'm super excited so if you're into that sort of thing make sure you hit that thumbs up button subscribe if you haven't already if you're new here welcome hi and also comment down below and tell me if you are a sourdough maker any tips that you have anything that i miss in this video that you would suggest i do for next time so first things first we're gonna start with our starter i'm watching a um joshua weissman tutorial he shows you he's very he's a talented bread maker that man i swear to god so i'm gonna be watching one of his youtube videos where he breaks it down and um first things first you're gonna need a food scale this is very important because when you make the starter the measurements and everything have to be exact so that helps a lot and then you want a glass container for your starter so i'm using this quartz mason jar glass wide mouth mason jar glass a lid and then you're gonna need some organic unbleached flour so i have regular all-purpose organic unbleached and then i also have uh organic stone ground dark rye flour so that is what i'm going to use for my starter you definitely want to make sure you use organic flour i've heard that's very important if you don't it will affect i think the rise of your starter and also the flavor and then the only other thing you need is water so i have everything ready to go i'm gonna watch this tutorial and we're gonna start on our starter so this is gonna be a seven day process so like i said i'm taking you on this tree with me it's gonna be a long a long journey um so you're gonna start by adding 100 grams of dark rye flour to your container this is why having a scale is so important so now i need to add 150 grams of lukewarm water to i'm nervous that this is too hot so i'm going to wait a little bit but basically just add 150 grams of lukewarm water to your jar okay now we're going to stir this all around and you want to make sure there is no dry spots so you really want to make sure that you get that water in there good honey okay and then that's pretty much it for the first day you're going to put a loose fitting lid on it otherwise it will explode because when things firm it they bubble up and expand so loose fitting lid set this on on the counter for 24 hours and then we're gonna do our first refeed or our first feeding so i'll see you then hello okay so my sourdough starter is doing pretty good we're on day five so today is the fourth feeding that i'm giving my little baby and on day like two or three i waited like two hours too late to feed it i was out of the house and i didn't get back in time and ever since then it hasn't been as active like going up and down in the jar like sometimes you'll see it and it's like up to here and then sometimes it'll just be like down here but ever since then it's just kind of been hanging out here so i hope that it still is lively and good so i'm just gonna keep feeding it i have faith if i need to start over oh i will it'll annoy the out of me but you know it's gotta be done so anyway i'm gonna feed it and i'll show you the process of it and yeah so far it's been super easy the hardest part is really just remembering that you have to feed it you gotta feed it at the same time every day so i'm going to be feeding it with some organic dark rye flour and organic unbleached all-purpose so when you're feeding your sourdough the first thing you have to do is take out the mature starter a certain amount not everything replace it with some fresh flour and water so that's what i'm doing now i'm getting it to the correct weight and then i'm going to feed it some fresh flour so i'm thinking of naming my starter kerry bradshaw i wanted to come up with a cute um name for it although i didn't come up with it i think i googled it or something but i'm open for suggestion so if you guys have any fun cute names for a sourdough starter let a girl know so now we just mix it and then set it aside till our next feeding which is in 24 hours today is the day i'm finally making my sourdough loaves so this whole process you got to be very exact with water and flour and all the measurements and the timing and it's very exact it's kind of like a science so basically right now i'm making my auto lease which is just a mixture of flour and water in exact measurements and so i'm going to mix it together until just combined and the flour and water is fully hydrated you want don't over mix it let that sit for 30 minutes to an hour and then add in your starter so i took out some of my freshly made amazing starter and i let it ferment for a few hours before i started making this loaf and then you're going to take some water and spread out the starter by dimpling your fingers into the dough and slowly starting to incorporate it and they're gonna do this like weird slapping mixing situation which helps it mix together i don't know this honestly this part right here the slap and fold it was the hardest part for me because i just never felt like i really got it right and honestly this technique is what really forms your loaves your sourdough so if you don't get this right you're not going to have a very beautiful good looking sourdough it's not going to have a proper rise or form so i really wanted to take this seriously and do it right and i still don't know if i got it right so anyway this is the slap and fold this is how i looked doing it i looked like a maniac it was sticking to my fingers like crazy so then you're gonna add it back to your bowl add in some salt some water dimple it again with your fingers and incorporate it and then then you're going to do another round of that like slap against the bowl mixing motion and man it is quite the arm workout so then you are going to do another set of slap and fold which is my least favorite part of this whole process it's not fun at all and like i said i just don't think i'm doing it properly if you guys have any tips let me know in the comments um i just felt like this dough was so wet that it was really hard to handle and it was just sticking to me so i was getting a little discouraged at this point i was worried that it wouldn't turn out to be totally honest with you but i kept pushing ahead because i wanted to just make my freaking sourdough bread so here we go another uh round of slap and fold i did this for maybe like five to ten minutes i was just worried that i wasn't gonna get it was it was just so freaking wet and it wasn't forming correctly so now we're gonna do um our first set of like pull and folds so this is when you start your bulk ferment of four and a half hours and you're gonna do a series of six different stretch and folds like what you see me doing here a stretch and fold is basically where you like stretch a side of the dough and pull it over to the other side and you're gonna do that all around once fully and then you're gonna let your dough sit for 15 or 30 minutes the amount of time depends on where you're at in your bulk ferment so basically four and a half hours will pass and then finally it's time to form our dough balls so i'm gonna split this giant dough ball into two dough balls and i'm gonna form it like so and then let them sit for 20 minutes and then i'm going to sprinkle each one with flour rub it really sexually like that and then i'm going to flip it over and do another series of folds and this will be like really help with the formation of your sourdough loaf and then you're going to roll it up and put it in your banaten to proof overnight and you're going to put it in the fridge and you're going to need a plastic bag and i didn't have one big enough so i just used this sprouts plastic bag that i had leftover and then you're going to let it proof in the fridge for 12 to 14 hours overnight both of them it's finally the day that i'm making my loaf so i heated up my dutch oven at 500 for an hour you wanted to be screaming screaming hot i added some rice flour to the bottom added in my loaf very carefully i didn't want to burn myself and then i did this pathetic excuse of a score i don't have a bread score yet don't judge me so i added to the oven at 500 and it cooked for i believe 20 minutes and then you remove the lid and reduce the oven to 450 and then add it back to the oven for another 20 minutes and i forgot to reduce the oven heat to 450 rest in peace this first loaf of sourdough it still turned out fine but like not the greatest so anyway this is what it looks like when it's done it got way too much color because hello i didn't reduce the to 450 but what are you gonna do i learned on the next loaf it turned out great and get ready for some bread crackle asmr in three two one oh my gosh it's beautiful it's beautiful the time is here we're trying the sourdough for the first time oh it looks so good i know it's like kind of holy i don't know if that's good or bad i think it's bad but the crust is beautiful it's perfection the i mean i'm impressed with the rise that i got because i was worried about that we'll try it at the same time yeah [Music] i'm good um the crush is so good oh it has that sourdough flavor i taste it it's soft and pillowy on the middle on the inside and the crust is perfection oh it's so crunchy on the outside oh i love it i am so excited because this is my first loaf i know it's going to get better oh i was really worried that it wouldn't turn out that great but i'm very impressed with my first results not to shoot my own horn but beat beat i kind of killed it i like this loaf better than the slope i kind of screwed up with this one but anyway did you screw up i screwed up the temperature i forgot to turn it down to 450 after 20 minutes but this one i did it perfectly so it worked out great so thank you guys so much for tuning in on my sourdough journey if you want to see more videos like this let me know in the comments below don't forget to like subscribe and of course don't forget to take care of yourself this week eat good food and i will see you in the next one

This is Sherry, today we\u2019re going to make a hot dog bread Hot dog buns may bring out the childhood memories of many people The sausage hides in the bread, delicious and magical This time we are going to turn ordinary hot dog buns into bread both delicious and beautiful Moist and soft, unique in shape Simple decoration, not only adds flavour, but also has a lovely shape If you like my cooking video, please remember to like it \ud83d\udc4d and subscribe to my channel! Add 86g cold milk 50g whole egg Add 86g cold water and leave 10% to adjust the softness of the dough Add 340g bread flour 10g milk powder, 56g caster sugar, 4g salt Stir with low speed 2nd gear Adjust the amount of water according to the water absorption of the flour, so that the final mixed dough is soft and easy to handle Stir until there is no dry flour Add 5g instant yeast Stir until the dough is almost even You can see that the dough is about 20\u00b0C now Put the dough in the refrigerator to chill for 20 minutes (if the room temperature is below 20\u00b0C in winter, you don\u2019t need to refrigerate) The temperature of the dough drops to 18\u00b0C \u200b\u200bafter refrigeration Some gluten is also produced after the flour is hydrated Turn on medium speed 4 and beat until the dough is smoother. It takes about 4 minutes You can add butter when the dough can be pulled into a malleable, not very smooth membrane with jagged hole edge Add 50g of softened unsalted butter(19-23\u00b0C) Divide the dough into small pieces for easy mixing with the butter Turn on low speed 2 and stir until the butter is disappeared and forming a dough again. It takes about 3 minutes Then kneading at medium speed 4 for about 7 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic The dough will stick to the wall of the bowl during the kneading process, it needs to be cleaned up a few times The surface of the kneaded dough is smooth and elastic The dough can be easily pulled into a translucent membrane with almost no jagged teeth around the edge Fold the dough into a smooth ball Put it in the oiled bowl My room temperature is about 20-21\u00b0C. Although the cold water and cold milk was used, the temperature of the dough still rises a lot after kneading Cover and ferment to double size, takes about 60-90 minutes at 26\u00b0C Poke a hole in the dough with your fingers, the fermented dough will not shrink or collapse Divide the dough into 10 equal parts, each about 67g Deflate the bubbles and roll the dough into a smooth ball Rest for 30 minutes Prepare 1/2 cup of grated parmesan cheese Spread on a larger plate or container for later use Roll the dough into a 13x16cm rectangle Flip over Organize into a 13x16cm rectangle Slightly shorter than hot dog sausage Put a hot dog sausage (about 14cm long) Roll up from top to bottom, slightly tighten to prevent gaps Seam side down, brush a thin layer of water Roll on grated parmesan cheese Cut 4 knives and 5 segments evenly, with each cut only 2/3 over Circle into a flower shape Cover and proof until double size. At a temperature of 28-30\u00b0C, it takes about 40 minutes Cut a bit with scissors Garnish with a little mozzarella cheese and minced parsley Bake at middle rack in an oven preheated to 375\u00b0F/190\u00b0C for about 12 minutes until the surface is golden This hot dog bun is not only beautiful in appearance, but also attractive in colour The bread tissue is also moist, soft and delicate Hope to be another unforgettable delicacy in your memory If you like my cooking video, please remember to like it \ud83d\udc4d and subscribe to my channel!

sourdough from lavan to loaf and everything in between [Music] first off let's talk about creating a schedule here is an overview of the one i will be using today it consists of three separate parts the levan schedule the sourdough schedule and the baking schedule i have also provided it in the description below and will reference it multiple times throughout this video the schedule to me is a vital part of your recipe it helps keep you on track the interesting thing about the schedule is that it's not set in stone your schedule will more than likely be different than mine since we don't have the exact same variables or environmental conditions when making your bread examples of things that need to be taken into consideration when structuring your schedule are ambient temperature doe hydration percentages proofing methods and so forth i am providing my schedule for this recipe not as a set rule but more of a guideline for when creating your own it is 7 a.m 24 hours before i start my day of making the dough for my sourdough bread now i've already taken the liberty of warming up my starter one day in advance so we can get right into building and performing the first feeding for our levant using a scale measure out 50 grams of healthy room temperature starter add to that 50 grams of bread flour 50 grams of whole wheat flour and 100 grams of room temperature filtered water mix together until fully incorporated this ratio of starter to flour to water will build the much needed strength no pun intended to achieve a very springy oven spring like usual precisely place a rubber band around your jar at the top of your lavan allowing you to determine when it is doubled in size lightly place a lid on the top so it can breathe don't forget to give a kiss for good luck this can take anywhere from six to eight hours all depending on the ambient temperature and vitality of your starter here my starter is at peak fermentation it is bubbly active and doubled in size just where you'd like it to be before the next feeding you can bang your jar lightly on a countertop and if it deflates and collapse onto itself it is no longer growing and is ready for round two i will feed again at roughly 7 pm that same day letting ferment overnight before starting my long day of making the sourdough [Music] emergency hold up there for one second i wanted to give a quick overview of what today's sourdough schedule will actually look like as you can see there's quite a bit that needs to get done over the course of the day so hopefully you didn't have plans for the weekend like going to the mall or checking out the latest flick with your girl at the nearest film viewing establishment of course you did my boy it's scary business out there these days best stay home and bake bread moving right along let's perform our final feeding before introducing the lavan into our dough now returning to your normal viewing entertainment [Music] whoa welcome back i had this strangest dream last night something about the end of the world i don't really remember it's the next morning here and we are gonna do the final feeding for our lavan to get it nice and ready go ahead and use the same measurements that we previously used to feed the levan nothing different there once everything is properly mixed up put a lid and rubber band on your jar go ahead and place in a warm area in your house to ferment the levant will be ready for use once it's doubled in size and depending on the temperature that you are fermenting it in can take roughly five to seven hours i wanted to show you guys a time lapse of the levant itself look how lively it is it is bubbly and just climbing to the top of this jar this is the benefit of feeding your lavan multiple times leading up to actually using it in your sourdough bread the levant has been going for a couple of hours now and also for some reason i decided to change my shirt but at this point we're gonna make the sourdough but we have to do what's called an auto lease first the auto lease is a handy technique of simply adding water to flour and allowing to rest for a period of time before building gluten development in our sourdough it helps with dough elasticity and contributes towards the crumb flavor and overall quality of the bread as you can see here on our sourdough schedule we will let our auto lease sit for an hour and a half before introducing the levant now that you better understand what the auto lease is let's put it together for my dough i'm using 850 grams of bread flour 100 grams of whole wheat flour 50 grams of spelt flour and 700 grams of room temperature filtered water this gives us roughly 76 hydration for our dough i don't expect you to understand why the hydration is at 76 percent just trust me it's a combination of the amount of flour to water we use along with the hydration percent of our lavan in the original starter which fyi we're at 100 hydration this is some more advanced baker's math that isn't necessary to know to make great sourdough but if you decide to make your own recipes you'll definitely need to know at least the basics on hydration percentages i digress mix together the flour and the water until there is no dry flour in your bowl please do not be concerned about kneading or building gluten at this point you're just trying to incorporate all the flour with the water until fully homogenized creating what's called a shaggy dough cover in plastic wrap since you obviously hate liberal ideologies in the environment move to a warm place in your home preferably the same location your levant is at for one hour and 30 minutes the hour and a half has elapsed and we're going to test the suppleness and stretchiness of our auto leased dough with what's called the windowpane test go ahead and gently and confidently grab a portion of your dough and begin to stretch upward without ripping or tearing until you can literally see bits of light pierce through your dough like the stained glass windows at the sistine chapel you want to hear angels softly singing in the background now that your flower and water have transitioned into sainthood go ahead and add your levate it should have doubled in size at this point if not don't be afraid to wait a bit longer before adding to your autolysed dough lightly moisten your hands and begin to gently spread the levant around the surface of the dough once it fully covers the top re-wet your fingers and begin to dimple the dough politely introducing the levant to the dough like two young lovers holding hands for the first time okay i'm gonna i'm gonna stop with this bit because it's getting weird okay that's enough once properly dimpled mix together i like to use a hybrid method which includes two techniques one where i grab the dough and i violently fold it over onto itself excuse me and the other where i scoop underneath the dough and kind of just slap it back down into the bowl both methods work fine just try not to overly and aggressively knead the dough since we are still not really trying to promote gluten development yet at this point once the levant is folded into your liking cover and allow to rest for 30 minutes after the 30 minutes are up we're going to solve the snail wait i mean salt the dough geez i've been watching way too much it's always sunny during lockdown here i'm adding 20 grams of fine sea salt which is approximately 2 percent of the overall dough weight mix in the same way you did before with the levant until it is fully incorporated go ahead and now lightly spray a working surface area because we're going to liberally shape our dough before adding back into the bowl for another 30 minutes scoop out the dough with a moistened spatula and being careful as to not rip or tear gently pull the top end of your dough out and fold halfway onto itself repeat both on the left and right sides lastly take the bottom half and roll and fold the dough completely over use the wetness of your surface area and the stickiness of the dough to help round off into a round ball with a gentle and swift approach add back into your bowl and let rest for another hour now that the hour rest time has elapsed we can move on to the next step on our sourdough schedule which is the lamination process so a bit of a confession at this point i am no expert in the art of making sourdough and a lot of my process and recipes were inspired by greater bread makers than myself such as joshua weissman the bread code and foolproof baking which is actually where i learned the technique of laminating the dough all of these youtubers make great content and i'll make sure to credit their channels in the description below go ahead and give their videos a watch moving right along before this video gets too lengthy go ahead and lightly moisten your hands again along with a spatula and a surface area with some water and scoop your dough onto said surface begin to lightly stretch your dough evenly being careful as to not tear until you've created a large square like shape similar to the one that i'm making here the point is to stretch out evenly to where it is looking very thin and almost transparent take the left side of your oblong dough matter and fold one third onto the center one third of your dough if you notice any bubbles or air pockets feel free to pop them at this time repeat with the right side so that now your dough width is a third of the original size and now resembles more of an elongated rectangle you can do the same with the bottom and top portions of your dough just like i am demonstrating here at this point take a lightly dampened bench scraper and gently place your laminated dough into your fermentation vessel i'm using this cake pan because it's all i have but a glass casserole would probably work better cover with something that will give your dough plenty of space to grow and let sit for another one hour once the hour has passed we are on to our first round of coil folds what's a coil fold you might ask allow me to show you the coil fold is a technique we will use to finally build up that gluten with dampened hands begin to gently unstick your sticky dough from the sides of your fermentation vessel or as normal people call it a pan and get your hands underneath the middle section of the dough start to lift up the front section until it is completely separated from the pan oh dear this looks like it's going to be fun easy easy come on come on come on come on yeah there we go now take that section of remove dough and fold it underneath itself like i am showing here repeat again on the same side only this time you will fold in half the already folded in half dough thingy sorry i'm not articulating this well i guess you really need to watch me do this go ahead and repeat these same folds on all four sides of your rectangular dough blob once all sides have been properly folded onto themselves you have completed the first set of coil folds congratulations cover your dough and let rest for one hour now i'm not going to bore you by showing you each and every coil fold that i perform just note that i will do two more coil folds three coil folds in total or as my fellow line cooks say three coil folds all day you're gonna do the folds every hour on the hour once you've completed these three folds your dough would have been resting for a total three hours now the dough is going to undergo what is called the bulk fermentation and yes as you guessed it the bulk of the fermentation will happen during this time now i would like to give you an exact amount of time this will take but like i've discussed earlier in the video there are many factors that will dictate the amount of time this process will take given the ambient temperature in my house of roughly 72 degrees fahrenheit my dough took another four hours until it had sufficiently doubled in size so now your dough should be looking rather puffy and jiggly which is a good sign that your dough is ready to shape into a loaf scoop out that bad boy onto your moistened tabletop trying to very carefully not to degas the dough at this point the dough has been generating a lot of gas as a result of the bulk fermentation which is what is causing it to look so puffy and jiggly but we don't want to lose that consistency take a small amount of bread flour and sprinkle it down the center of your dough creating a line for where you will use your bench knife to cut the dough in half begin to use your bench knife to shape your sectioned off dough into nice little dough balls don't be intimidated by this it really is pretty easy just remember to be confident in your approach because the sourdough can smell fear don't ever show weakness around sourdough now that your dough is shaped into balls go ahead and flour your sourdough proofing baskets with rice flour rice flour is preferred at this point because it doesn't soak up as much moisture from the dough during the proofing process it really helps mitigate the dough from sticking to your basket which we definitely do not want so if you can use rice flour now make sure to completely saturate all nooks and crannies in your basket don't give your dough any reason to stick take some of that rice flour and sprinkle upon your dough rub the flour across the top of the dough balls in a gentle fashion with your bench scraper softly flip over your dough balls and get ready to shape them so i had some recorded footage of me folding the first loaf but for some reason i couldn't find it when editing this video so disregard that one it's already done but thankfully we have two lobes so i will demonstrate with that one start by taking one side of your dough and fold over into the center repeat on the other remaining side now that the sides have been folded take the top part of your dough and begin to roll it down onto itself just like i'm doing here again be very careful at this point not to degas your dough it is very delicate pinch the end of your dough closed so it has a more round loaf-like shape use your bench scraper to lift up and place your dough into its proofing basket just to ensure that you get the best possible shape for your bread go ahead and criss-cross applesauce your dough to create a nice and tight stitching to hold it together remember that the currently exposed part of your dough is actually the bottom of the loaf so it doesn't need to look perfect put a light coating of flour on it cover and then place in a fridge overnight that is roughly 38 to 40 degrees fahrenheit for 12 to 18 hours this portion of the recipe is called cold proofing and is nice because it allows you to take a break and get some rest before the big day of baking your dough so it is the next morning which is baking day you made it finally at this point you want to get your oven and cooking vessel smoking hot turn your oven on as high as it goes with a dutch oven or a bread baking vessel inside of it my oven goes all the way up to 275 celsius or 527 degrees fahrenheit to be exact once your oven has reached the temperature you want keep it there for another 30 minutes just to ensure that your dutch oven is completely and thoroughly heated through once the oven is hot and ready remove your dough from the fridge you'll know that your dough is done proofing with the poke test this test is done exactly the way you would think it would be by poking your dough gently poke your dough and if your dough bounces back quickly it's under proof if it does not bounce back at all it's overproofed you done messed up buddy you wanted to slowly and slightly bounce back from where you poked it now for me these next parts of the sourdough process are the most stressful and vital okay it is now time to bake remove your scalding hot dutch oven from the oven and sprinkle flour or as i'm using here semolina on the areas of which your dough will sit quickly flip out your dough from its basket take your sourdough lame or an extremely sharp knife and at an angle score down the entire loaf spray the inside of your dutch oven with some water to assist with the oven spring cover and put back into the oven for 25 minutes once the 25 minutes have elapsed we can take our first look at our bread and see if we did everything right now look at that big boy there the oven spring on this loaf might actually be too excessive it almost looks like a balloon more than a loaf this might be due to me not shaping the dough well enough bake uncovered at 220 degrees celsius or 425 degrees fahrenheit for 20 more minutes once it is done baking remove from the oven place on a wire rack and allow to cool for at least two to three hours before slicing if you really can't wait until it is completely cooled because you have to have warm bread with butter just note that it is still cooking while cooling off yeah called carry over cooking so your bread might not be completely done yet at this point repeat this process again for your second loaf making sure to reheat your dutch oven to the highest temp possible on your oven before baking your final bread now let's take a look at our second loaf i have a good feeling it's gonna look even better than our first one and oh my god what happened to our second loaf it looks like somebody ran over the back end of it poor little guy it's hideous i'm only joking i'm sure that even though it looks funny i bet it tastes just amazing speaking of amazing let's take a look at our final product [Music] amazing and that is sourdough people thank you so much for watching this video and sticking it out until the end i know this was a long one but the sourdough process is pretty long if you like this video please check out some of my other content i have another video where i give some tips and tricks on how to get better oven spring from your sourdough along with a

weird birds a lot of weird birds in this neighborhood and cats lots", "eTGXbTOKVjc": "hello hello beautiful people welcome to love for the oven thank you so much for stopping by i am rebecca and today i'm sharing with you a basic white bread recipe just four simple ingredients for us to make a wonderful bread perfect for toast or sandwiches we begin by adding 8.5 grams of salt to 420 grams of bread flour the amounts in cups and ounces will be down in the description box we whisk flour and salt together and now in another container we are going to add 294 grams of water together with five grams of active dry yeast you mix it until the yeast is dissolved and now we are gonna pass this on top of our dry ingredients i'm gonna use this white spatula that you see here to mix the ingredients you could use a wooden spoon or another type of spatula also you can use fresh yeast if you want to in that case it will be 15 grams of yeast instead of five now we incorporate this together and depending on the flour that you use it has to be a really strong white flour mine has 14 percent of protein content and this together with the fact that i live in a drier climate helps the flower absorb the amount of liquid i'm giving it and since it's absorbing it well i can then use my hands to finish incorporating if your dough is a little bit more sticky it may be because it has a less amount of protein or you live in a more humid environment if you want to just keep incorporating with the wooden spoon or with a spatula without using your hands and once everything is moistened all of the flour is wet you are going to just cover it with plastic wrap and let it rest for 20 minutes with that what we are doing is allowing the gluten network to start developing and as you can see now it's a bit more stretchy it is not ready but it will be easier to handle so now we are going to pass our dough to our work surface and we are not going to add any flour or any oil to the work surface i am basing this recipe in a video from richard bertine and his method for doing bread i will link the video that i used as a reference down in the description box below and now we are going to knead the dough for approximately 10 to 15 minutes until we have a very stretchy elastic dough try to knead it using mostly your fingers and pulling it from the bottom stretching it i'm gonna like i'm showing you you pull it from the bottom fold it you pull it from the bottom flip it stretch it and fold it and you repeat the motion until you feel that the dough is changing in your hands it will get more consistent and now i'm showing you that it is not ready yet because when i try to stretch it softly between my hands it's breaking apart easily so we need to keep working the dough but as you can see it is not sticking so much to the work surface again depending on the flower and your environment the dough may react differently and that's when you may need to help yourself with the bench scraper and try to make sure that the dough is recovered the one that is maybe sticking from the surface now as you can see when i stretch it it's almost translucent and it's not breaking apart so easily i consider my dough to be ready now i'm gonna make it into a bowl just bringing everything into the center and then i turn it around and another way of saying if our dough is ready is that it has a very nice smooth surface and also when you poke it with your finger it's la snaps right back it's very very elastic i show you here close-up of what the dough looks like now and of course you can do this if you want to on a stand-in mixer with the dough attachment then you also just need to in a medium-high speed knead it for 10 to 15 minutes until you get this consistency and in that case a 20 minute rest is not necessary now we pass our bowl of dough to the bowl we have oil the bowl so it doesn't stick to it cover it again with plastic wrap and now we are going to let it rest for 90 minutes or until it doubles in size and since this is a very wet dough it may look a little bit flatter instead of higher you will know when it's ready because if you poke it now it won't snap back the hole will stay there so now what you do is you put a little bit of flour but really just a little bit on the work surface and we're gonna put our dough in it and with our hands we're going to just squish it and press it down until we have taken out most of the air from the fermentation if necessary you can knead it like i am doing here for two or three minutes just to really make sure that we are taking out all of the air of the fermentation then we will make it again into a bowl and put it with the smooth side down press it down and make it into a cylinder like you're saying here like make it into the shape of a little cylinder of dough that we can close and with the seam side down we are going to roll it on the work surface and pass it to our loaf pan the loaf pan is prepared either with oil or with cooking spray as a baking spray so that our bread won't stick to it and now we are going to cover it again with the same plastic wrap we were using again cover in a little bit of oil so it doesn't stick to the dough and now we will let it rest for an hour or until it doubles in size and covers the whole surface of the loaf pan at this point we have preheated our oven to 240 degrees celsius 464 fahrenheit this is a very hot oven and then as soon as the bread is in we're going to spray some water in the oven to create moisture to create steam and we close the door and we're going to bake at this temperature for 10 minutes and then we will lower the temperature to 210 degrees celsius and bake it for 22 to 24 more minutes if your bread is getting too dark you can cover it with aluminum foil so it doesn't get too brown on the top after it's ready you can just take it out and immediately unmold it on a cooling rack and let it cool completely and once it's completely cooled this is the result you have wonderful white bread very soft perfect for toast perfect for sandwiches and very simple ingredients i hope you like this recipe i hope you give it a try and let me know what you think thank you so much for subscribing to the channel for liking this video and sharing it with your loved ones have a great morning afternoon evening or night wherever you are and i'll see

So many times I've come in here, and balancing between\ntechnology, wet hands, flour hands, and you never\nquite know which way to go. Half of mixing is just\nlike staying clean, really. So I thought the calculators would help. And then over time just\ngot very used to phones, so I still find myself going to the phone. So I'm just going to subtract the amount that I'm weighing out here. So I'm getting to a certain total. You can see we're not\nmaking one loaf of bread. I hope you can see that. A lot of people often\nask, or approach baking, I should say, from kind of the way that you approach a kitchen, a little bit of this,\na little bit of that. It doesn't work. You gotta get it right. You can't just change the water content by a little bit here or there. It will affect the final product. So yes, I'll weigh it to the gram. Now that our batch sizes are a lot bigger than they used to be, I give myself a little bit of forgiveness,\nlike maybe 50 grams out of this whole 35 liters\nof water that's in here. So walking over to our\ncustom blend of flour. Made by a local mill here. We started with, oops. We started with white flour\nwhen we first bought the bakery and bought it from a local store, like a national restaurant supplier. Thankful we don't do that anymore 'cause we can't buy more than one bag of flour at a time now\nthere in COVID days. A few years ago we were\namongst the first bakeries to use our new local stone mill. They have a fun story too\nwhere they just took over an old brand, Hayden Flour Mills. It's a mill that used to exist in Tempe and compete on a national\nscale with General Mills and some of the others, and over time it lost market share and\nwent out of business. The mill was gone for 12 years and then a new family bought the old name and started growing really old heritage grain wheat in Arizona, started milling it in kind\nof a rudimentary fashion like we started making bread years ago. And over time they got better and better, invested in their mill. We ended up buying a\nvariety of grains from them and mixing them ourselves, spending a year or two\njust trying to figure out what blends we like, doing\na little bit of this, a little bit of that. And then finally decided to\nask them to blend at the mill. So this flour I just dumped in\nseems really easy and simple but it's actually six different\nflours put together by us, formulated by us, and\nthen blended at the mill. So I'm going to throw this on. (mixer whirring) That's 120 loaves of bread. This first step is just mixing\nflour and water together. You can see that from the first moment we're using every bit of resource we have. That flour is a centimeter from the top. And this mixer has a story too. This, along with a lot\nof the things in here, lived a life before the life with us. This is some old Hobart that we found in a junkyard in California. We drove out especially for it, not knowing whether it worked or not. It certainly did not work. All the electrical boards were\nfried, didn't work at all. But we got it at a really good price. And at the time we didn't have any money for mixers whatsoever. So we've been hand mixing everything. This is really just a\nyear and a few months ago, it was about a year and a half, we were hand mixing everything. Now this thing comes in. None of the buttons worked,\neverything was burnt. And we went to our local\nelectrical supply store, found random switches and random buttons. We hijacked timer one with something completely different now. Now it's a bowl rotator\nso I can stop the bowl. It has nothing to do with timing anymore. But we got the thing to move and spin, and it's been doing a good job every since because Hobarts are built to last. The engine's great. The little stuff fried, but\nthe little stuff can be fixed. And we probably saved ourself $30,000 versus a new machine. You would think that I would have all this memorized in my head, and the thing is I don't, even though I've made these over and over again. I do have that one memorized. But this one I had to look up. And it's because we're constantly tweaking recipes still to this day. You know, we'll change a little\nbit of the water content, or we'll change the flour content. And when you make something\nevery day for years, some of those old formulas\nare plastered to your brain. So I'm still going back to\nold versions in my brain. I need to reference something\nto see what I've done with it. Do I recommending sticking\nyour hand in a mixing bowl? No. (laughs) So I didn't mix that fully by any means. I'm still missing ingredients. This is a very simple bread. It's as simple as bread\ngets, flour, water, and salt. There is sourdough starter, but I will explain why sourdough starter really is no more than flour and water. So you could say this is\na three ingredient bread. It's still missing the leaven\nand it's still missing salt. Three ingredients because\na sourdough starter, which we have right here, is\njust fed with flour and water. There's nothing else in here other than microbes, flour, and water. Just over a kilo of salt. Yeah, we're doing that kilo thing. If you want to go for just standard English measurements, go right ahead. But I don't like working\nin eighths and 16s and 12s. It was mind-blowing\nthat one liter of water equaled one kilogram to water\nto me, just mind-blowing. So I'm going to take\nthis sourdough starter which has already been measured out to the right amount that I need. We actually fed it to the\nright size for this mix so that all I would have\nto do in the morning is one of these numbers. So this was fed last night. I'm going to scrape the bowl. A lot of the people\nthat have worked for us here in the bakery over time\nhave come from kitchens. And people that work in kitchens don't like to do dishes as they go. Oftentimes they might have\nhad a dishwasher on staff. But in general that batching\nis just what they do. Everything is a batch. When it comes to dough\nand bowls, dry dough that's crusted on a bowl takes five times, or six times, or seven\ntimes longer to clean. And there's other things\nI want to do with my day. I've already gone through years of not having efficient processes\nand not being organized, and as a result not having time for myself at the end of the day where\nthe bakery was basically from the time I woke to\nthe time I went to bed. And so making sure\nthere's not a huge amount to clean up at the end of the day is one of the ways that\nI show care to myself. Starter's actually a little\nbit old for my liking. I can see the texture\nand consistency of it. For the sort of perfectionist in me, I just immediately feel like\nthere is a point of failure that needs to be improved\nupon for next time. (mixer whirring) This mix is getting close to completion. You can see the hook is starting\nto pull the dough with it and you're getting these nice long strands of dough that's smooth. That's actually the gluten development. Everybody, do you know that\ngluten is just the protein that is created when you bind\nflour and water together? Just to break it down from its kind of evil\nconnotation in the world. Gluten is actually a good thing for bread because it's a structure that\nwe need to make good bread. It's why wheat was\nchosen to make bread with in the first place, because it had gluten, and that gluten provided structure that was superior to all the\nother grasses that we found. Can we bake with other grasses? Yes. Are we learning how to make\ngluten-free sourdough right now? I'm not going to talk\nmore about that, but yes. Do most people need gluten-free bread? No. Most people need real\nbread that's been made over a longer period of\ntime to break down the wheat so it's not so hard for\nour bodies to digest. That's enough from you. Every batch will have\nsome layer of imperfection that you know about,\nwhether your customers know about it or not. And the question is, what\nkind of tolerance do you have for that little bit of imperfection? It's really important not\nto get too egotistical about the whole process either, because good food is good food, even if it's a little bit less aesthetically pleasing on your bad days. So the question is, should I just toss 20 loaves of bread that\nare slightly shorter, or slightly wider, or slightly taller than my ideal perfect loaf? Or should those loaves\nof bread still get eaten and cherished for the good\nwhole grains that they are? I don't think that a\nbaker 200 or 300 years ago would have just chucked such\na nutrient-dense object out if it didn't turn out well. I think they would have found a use. In fact, they did. That was the poor man's bread. You didn't buy bread 200\nyears ago like you do today. In fact, the big loaves that\nI've described to people before that were historically normal were not golden brown in color. In fact, they looked like\nthey were burnt to a crisp from the outside because\nthe loaves were so big that they took a long time\nto bake in wood-fired ovens, which are not known for their\nperfect consistency of heat. And so the resulting loaf was dark. People actually chiseled\naway at the crust, removed the crust, and\njust ate the insides, which is an interesting sidebar to justify those crust-less\nexperiences that your kids have, except that's not a crust\nwhen it's sandwich bread, at least I don't think so. Crust have to actually\nbe crusty to be a crust. And if you don't like the\nsuper crusty crust, I get it. Although the ones that we make on our artisan loaves are really nice. You know, texture's just\nsomething that we don't seem to be exposed to all the time in food. So oftentimes as kids\nwe are given soft mush and then more soft mush as we get old. And then something that's\ngot a little texture is almost like a foreign entity. I promise you that if you\nare one of those people that hasn't really incorporated\ntexture into your cooking that you might find a whole\nnew joy in experiencing texture once you get used to it and\nknow how to use it properly. So I'm scaling these out\nto a particular weight. We have done other things\nthat allow me by myself, for instance, to make a\nfair amount of breads. I got to be honest with you. We're not going to pay\nthe bills around here making 10 loaves of bread. And do the math. 10 loaves of bread, even\nif I sell 'em for $7, by the time I pay for ingredients,\nutilities, and all that, it's not really enough to make a living. And so one of the ways in\nwhich we do make more bread, enough to make a living,\nis we have some tools so that we don't need an\narmy to make 100 loaves. I'm scaling these to a level that my dough divider will take. So my dough divider will\nhandle batch sizes of 16. I'll drop it in a little later, and it's going to divide\n16 loaves of bread for me in a matter of minutes. Whereas by hand it would take potentially 20 to 30 minutes to do\nthe same amount of work. Our bread loaves are 800 grams, which is roughly two pounds,\njust shy of two pounds. And see how stretchy this dough\nis coming out of the mixer? So I can reach under it. And so as I'm doing this I guess I'll talk a little bit about how\nwhen you're pulling dough out of the mixer and trying to cut it, the key is to not grab it with your hands, but rather to pretty much\ngrab it with your wrist. So I'm gonna go underneath the dough and then pull up with my whole arm. And here you can see the\nstrength of the gluten. Then putting it in the bin is kind of like unpeeling it. It's not just like turn and go. The dough will stick to you. It's kind of like this weird\ntechnique of unpeeling it. So when people first\nstart, they get discouraged 'cause they'll watch me\ndo this somewhat quickly. And within a moment\nthey're covered in dough, they can't get it off their hands, they can't grab it out of the mixer. They can't seem to do anything without just getting frustratingly messy. And that is the life of a mixer. We're a little bit\nbehind on folding dough. It's 10:30. I'd like to get to shaping\nby noon at the latest. So we've got to get\nthree folds in right now, basically 10:30, 11:00, 11:30. And then by noon, this\ndough should pretty much be where I want it for shaping. The whole point in folding\ndough is to stretch it, strengthen those gluten strands, give the dough more structure so that it stands up\nbetter as we shape it. So I'm going to pull the\ndough up and stretch it to its max before it breaks. You don't want it to\nbreak during this process. And I'm turning it and stretching\nit in all three directions that I can sort of stretch it. And I'm done. Just see how stretchy this dough is. If you're baking and your\ndough's not stretching like this, you should be asking yourself why, 'cause you don't have very well-developed dough at the point. And that's definitely a first good step to producing great bread, is\ngetting it well developed. If you're a cake maker, or a pie maker, or a biscuit maker, and this is foreign, it's like a mindset change from not developing gluten\nto developing gluten. Notice I'm not being\nparticularly gentle either. So don't be afraid to kind of go after it when you stretch it. Just avoid tearing it. So I'm putting my hands in the side, trying to get underneath the dough. I'm again using, my entire base of my hand is almost like a shelf for the dough. I'm not gripping it so\nmuch as I'm scooping it. Stretching and then dropping. So to break this process down even more, there's multiple ways to do this. I'm going to stretch this way and over. You can do a variation\nwhich a lot of people around here like doing,\nwhich is backwards. I'll show you. You can actually grab the dough\nfrom the middle of the block and pull upward, and it's\ngoing to pull the edge, and you can fold forwards over that edge. So a different way of achieving\nessentially the same result. You're still stretching\nand folding it onto itself. Between every fold I'm rotating the bin. So I'm getting it from both ends, and then I'm getting it sideways. That's pretty much all I can stretch it. You really only want to stretch to the point of no diminishing return. So after a certain amount of stretches the dough's going to get too tough and you're not really going to be able to stretch it without tearing it. The moment that you're tearing it, you are really defeating the whole purpose of stretching it in the first place. So you're breaking your strength. All right. So now to stay organized,\njust going to make a little X. By the end all of these\nbins will have three Xs to indicate they've\nbeen folded three times. So the second fold is giving\nmore strength in the dough. In fact, once you get to the second fold you can really start to feel that the dough has more resistance when you're folding it. And that's a good thing. If it's stretching a\nlittle harder than it was, that means that you're\nsuccessfully building strength. If it feels exactly like it did, there's a chance you might be folding too early in the process. Folding right out of the\nmixer has less of an effect on strengthening than folding later in your bulk fermentation process. So this is the second of three\nfolds that we're going to do. Yeah, so it's, now this\ndough on its third fold is really coming together. I mean, when I did the three folds, it's no longer separating at\nall or kind of spreading out. It's really kind of holding\nits spot right here in the bin. And it's sort of hard to see visually to the same extent that I can feel it, but I can just feel that it's ready. I'm actually going to leave these bins out and just stack them on this cart. As it goes further in\nits fermentation process, with passing moments I get\na little bit more nervous. And it's mainly because I am using a piece of machinery to divide it. At home it's actually,\nyou don't have to worry as much to the minute. It's when you're working\nwith your hand you just have, remember no machine matches\nup to a human in adaptability. So machines are better for set processes. And for one, the divider\nstarts to really perform worse if the dough has too\nmuch gas built up in it. It'll start to cut the bread less evenly. And its entire purpose in life is to cut 16 loaves of bread evenly so that I don't have to\nmeasure them out separately. Once that process sort of breaks down then it's completely worthless. So just because you have\nmachines that do a task doesn't necessarily always\nmean you're in a better spot. My particular skill level dividing bread is maybe only off by 10% from\nthe speed of the machine. We have the dividers here\nnot really for my benefit, because if it was just me and Amanda we would probably just be\nbetter off dividing by hand. We've done it so much that\nwe're pretty fast at it. But the divider allows us\nto replicate the process with newer staff members\nwho haven't shaped 10,000, 20,000 loaves. And they can just jump on\nand start dividing bread within the right parameters. We still have to do some hand dividing. And they're just learning\nat a slightly slower pace on the hand dividing side. The big moment has arrived. It is now time to make loaves. So you got these bins of bread. I pulled this lid off\nand it wasn't exploding, so that's good, even\nthough we're coming to this a little later than I'd like. We're still in good shape. So I'm going to take this\nand empty it into the bin. At home you're not going to\nhave one of these dividers. I sure hope you don't have one of the these dividers\nlaying around your kitchen. So you just turn over however\nmuch dough you're working with on whatever table surface\nyou're working on. You might only be making\none loaf at a time, and that's fine. So you'll just do the same\nprocess, except times one. And you'll be done in a couple of minutes. I'll still be here making bread. I would say, if you make bread at home get yourself two Dutch ovens\nand make a pair of loaves every time you make loaves. For one, you then have something\nto share with someone else because I think part in\nthe joy of working so hard is letting someone else\ntell you how good it was. And if you're anything like we were when we first started making bread, the loaves that we made for ourselves didn't really make it all that far in our house before they were gone. But the other benefit of\nmaking more than one thing at a time is just a\nlittle bit more practice. I mean, two loaves isn't\ngoing to take you much longer than one, but it will give you exactly twice the amount of practice on shaping. It's still not very much. And so if you really, really\nwant to perfect making bread faster than say a year, which I think if you're baking at home\nand you're making bread and you're making bread\nwith any kind of regularity, let's say twice a week, and\nyou're making two loaves at a time, I'd say give yourself a year before you start really\ngetting upset at yourself for making mistake after\nmistake after mistake. Because every part requires practice. And the benefit that we\nget in the bakery over you is we just get to practice\nit hundreds of times at once. So there's really two ways\nin which you can get good. You can bake a little bit more just to make the speed\nhappen a little faster, but understand that it's\ngoing to take some time, and be patient with yourself, view it as a journey that you're on, not just the immediate result of this one loaf of bread you're making. But the other way is figure\nout what local bakeries exist in your area and see\nif they need some help. Chances are they might take you\non for free to do some work. We do this. And you can learn and practice. We've had people come stay here for a week and just practice making bread with us. So these things are already\ndivided at 800 grams each. They're in a nice form. They already got some\nsmooth surface to 'em. And so the normal way of doing\nthis without a bread divider is you will manually divide\non a scale to 800 grams. And from there it's probably going to be several pieces of dough that you're piecing together\nto get to that 800 grams. As you manually divide\nmore and more and more you're going to get closer\nto that ideal number every single time where\nyou can cut a loaf of bread basically at 800, almost\nperfectly precise. That'll take some\npractice in and of itself. But when you have multiple pieces of bread you've got to add a step,\nand that's pre-shaping. So pre-shaping, just to\nreally quickly show you, is taking one of these loafs of bread. It can be way shaggier than this. It can be multiple pieces too. And you just take your bench knife, and we're going to round it to develop a nice smooth surface. And so my left hand, or non-dominant hand, the hand that doesn't have my bench knife, I'm completing the circle\nof rounding, if you will. So I'm going around counterclockwise, pushing inward as I go,\nand then catching it at the 10 o'clock position, and finishing the round with my hand. I go around a couple of times. And this is now a pre-shaped loaf. The thing about our\ndivider and our process is we figured out how\nto get same final result without the pre-shaping. So we're not going to do that\nfor the rest of the bread. But this is what we used to do with every single loaf\nbefore we used that. So I'm going to sprinkle\nthe tops with flour. These tops are actually the\nouter crust of the loaf. When the divider's pushing the loaf up it's doing something similar to what we're doing when we pre-shape. It's creating some surface tension. And so then you have a nice\nsmooth surface to your crust, so when you do your forming it all comes together really nicely and you have a smooth\ncrust all around the loaf. So this part is literally the outside. Before I get going on\nshaping, I'm going to go ahead and load my divider with round two. And that way as we run out\nI can just get to dividing and we can have another\n16 loaves ready to go in a matter of a few seconds. So now I'm shaping. There are so many different ways to shape. I don't know that my way is any better than anyone else's way. But the key is to get a nice\nuniform loaf that holds up. So by holds up, meaning at\nthis stage it keeps its form. And so I'm going to\ntighten it a little more. When I say tighten it, what I'm doing is I'm taking the heels of my hands, making as flat of a surface as I can with my thumbs that I can. And I'm pushing the loaf, pushing the dough underneath the loaf and creating more tension at the surface. And Amanda's doing the same over here. I would argue that she's a\nstronger shaper than I am. She's just very good at\neverything that she does. So now the loaf goes into rice flour so that it doesn't stick\nto the form, the banneton. And then it goes into the\nform with the seam side up, meaning the side that's going\nto be the bottom of the loaf is actually facing up in the form 'cause it's going to be flipped\nover onto the baking board. So here, this is the top of the loaf, I'm going to flip it. I'll stretch it into a triangle. I'm going to fold the top over. Then I have these funny ends and I'm going to use them to stitch. This is a shaping\ntechnique called stitching where I'm taking these ends and basically creating layers. This last one I actually overlap. Then I stretch this into that middle hole. You don't really want any huge pockets of air in here as you go 'cause they might actually stay there, creating giant holes in your final loaf. So now I'm going to roll\nand tighten as I roll. So this is called the tuck and roll. I'm tucking the dough under\nthe loaf and then rolling it. So now I'm just creating more tension. Working with this type of bread requires gentle dough handling. Not only do you not really want to disturb the gas that's been\nbuilt up in the loaves, but you don't want it to stick to you. They say bakers' hands are a thing once you're dealt with dough enough times it doesn't stick to you. It's just a practice thing, like when you're taking\ndough out of the mixer you're sort of letting\nit unpeel from your hand as you drop it into a\nbin or a mixing bowl. And the same way here, you're\nnot trying to grab at it. You're still just trying\nto scoop it lightly. I'm barely touching it as I handle it. My fingers are resting below it. But I'm not gripping it so much\nso that I'm going to stick. And if I started to grip\nit, I would too stick like some of you might be\ndoing at home as you try. And again, this is probably one of the more frustrating aspects of baking is just the dough sticking to your hands and not being able to\nget this smooth result. Watching somebody else shape rapidly and get good result after good result, meanwhile you're at home wondering, \"Will I ever interact\nwith dough this way?\" And at least you're at home thinking that, and you probably have another\njob that pays the bills. Imagine my life in the\nbeginning of all this when I was wondering if I would ever make a loaf of bread well\nand not stick to myself, and I had to use this to make money. So there's always some silver lining. There's a nice thing\nnot having the pressure of your finances in your\nability to not stick to dough. So take a load off and just\nrelax your way through this and get a little bit better each time. Soon enough you'll be shaping like a pro. And if you join a bakery\nfor one or two weeks and volunteer your time, I promise you you'll come out the other end\nmuch better at this process. Chances are you'll shape\nmore loaves in one day at a bakery than you'll shape in an entire year of baking\nfor yourself at home. So how do I know that my bread is ready to scale in the first place? It has to have risen. And then you have to start asking yourself some questions like, when do\nI want to bake this bread? And how is it going to do its final rise, or the proofing stage? There's two main approaches. One is ambient and the other one is cold. The ambient method means\nthat once we form the loaves we'd probably wheel the\nloaves into the oven room where it's a little\nwarmer than it is in here. The loaves would proof pretty rapidly, in less than two hours for sure. I would probably bake these closer to an hour and a half from\nnow to get a similar result. The trade-off is that\nit's not very forgiving. You better nail that timing,\nbetter get it just right. And don't expect to have\nany fancy ornamental scoring on your loaves, because\ntrying to cut warm dough will not result in beautiful patterns. At best you'll get some\nhalfway decent markings that look like whatever you intended them to look in small resemblance form, like distant cousin of\nwhat you actually wanted. So you can probably tell\nthat we don't do a whole lot of ambient baking, although\nI respect the bakers that do. Their worlds are harder than mine where they're having to race the clock and race their sourdough starters or their yeast to the oven. And the fridge is much better for us, and I'd argue for most people, because you can throw\nthe dough in the fridge and so long as your fridge is working you can forget about it until tomorrow. I say so long as your fridge is working because try throwing huge quantities of warm dough into a fridge\nand watch every fridge start to break really quickly. If you're wondering, watching\nme use a dough divider, whether it's okay for an artisan bakery to use a piece of equipment\nthat speeds up the process, I just have a real\nsimple question for you. Do you want good bread\nor do you want bad bread? Because I have too many\npeople buying bread from me to be able to race the\ndough every day by hand. I'm fast, but I'm not that fast. And today is a light day,\nso dividing all this by hand wouldn't be that big a deal. But there's days where we're\nmaking three or four times this amount of bread in one day. And for that we just simply\nneed a little bit of assistance that a device like this provides. If you asked me two\nyears ago if I would ever have one of these in the bakery, I probably would have\ngiven a really hard no. But at the time I didn't\neven have a mixer. So the idea of having a dough divider was almost an unacceptable insult to me as I was hand mixing dough. I actually remember when\nwe first bought the oven, we were talking to the\nperson who sold the oven. It's like, \"Yeah, so you're gonna want \"to buy this, and this, and this.\" And I just remember thinking to myself, \"No, I'm going to mix everything by hand. \"I'm going to do everything\nthe slow old-fashioned way.\" and somewhere along the line\nyou start making decisions of, \"How can I keep making the bread better, \"objectively, but also sleeping?\" So how do you know this is ready to scale? It's risen. Double is usually too much. So if your dough is twice\nthe size of when it started, using I'm looking for about a 50 to 60% increase in overall volume. So take the volume you started with and add half that volume. And so in your bin you should be watching as the level of the dough rises, and you should be getting an idea. It doesn't have to be a bin. It can be a mixing bowl. But you should get an idea\nof when it hits that point where it's about 50% larger\nthan it was when you started. That's usually a good time to scale. If you're baking that day ambiently you might choose to\nbring it a little further because you're going to the oven quicker, so you want to get further in\nthe process before dividing. It all really has a lot\nto do with how you bake. But if you're going to go into the fridge, that 50% rule applies. So from here, these\nguys are going to end up in the walk-in where they're\ngoing to cool down overnight. They're going to keep\nfermenting at a slower pace. They're going to be building\nflavor in the fridge. Oftentimes the crust gets\nthis really cool effect in the fridge where it will end up getting these kind of crispy bubbles that form that only happen if you put\nyour dough in the fridge. For all those reasons and more, I'm a big advocate of that\ncold proofing process. So as I go, I'm applying a\nsimilar principle to this as I do when I do the stretch and folds. Every time that I pull on the dough I'm kind of trying to\nstretch it to the max amount that it will go before it\nbreaks, and then fold it over. So you could think of shaping loaves as that last time that\nyou're going to stretch them and fold them, because in reality shaping is stretching and folding too. I'm stretching the dough right now. You can see that I can't\nstretch it any further. It's going this far and\nthen it's bouncing back. So then when I stretch sideways I'm also getting to that breaking point. If I pull any further,\nthe dough will break. See, I can pull it a little further, and it is breaking there. I don't want that happening. Now we bake with pretty wet dough. Our dough is hydrated in the 80% range. And this is also sort of something that's an evolution in bread. If you go back into your family's history and find the closest\nperson in your lineage that baked bread and shared\na recipe with your family. Hopefully that's you, but\nmaybe it's your grandma or someone even further back. And maybe you'll find a recipe for bread that's in the 50s or 60%\nrange hydration wise. Those are stiff doughs. And so people talk about kneading bread. The way we knead bread is really\njust that stretch and fold. It's a pretty gentle process. It's not too difficult\nfrom a labor standpoint. But when you're dealing\nwith stiffer doughs, it's not that the bread is worse. It's different. It's more dry. And so most bakers don't like\nthat type of bread as much. But it's so stiff that it requires real kneading in order to develop. Our demand grew over the\nlast couple of months. And so we brought bakers\nthat used to work markets on Saturday into the bakery on Saturdays. I'm baking this on Monday. And this is two day old bread. It hasn't been baked yet, so\nit's not two day old bread. But it's two day old fermenting bread. It's completely possible to extend your sourdough process\nlonger, up to three days even. But every time that you change the timing, the whole routine has\nto change along with it. We've typically baked our bread\nthe day after we shape it. This bread is two days after we shaped it. And it's so that we can\nhave Sunday off, off. We'll do things like projects in the garden and that kind of thing. That's our off time. And really anything that sort of breathes a little bit of life back\ninto us that's not baking. We put a lot of effort into\nwhat we do in the bakery. A lot of it's very precise. A lot of it's sort of mentally taxing. And even though we have a\nlot of passion around it, you've got to find fuel for that passion. For me at least, I think this\nis different for everybody, I like to be fueled with just new knowledge or new learning. So our latest kick is the garden. We're working on that. And that basically translates into, well, I'm working on the garden now and I'm going to learn something\ncool from nature probably. And that's going to cause some changes or some inspiration in the bakery. And so in that way we\nsort of recycle energy. 'Cause if the only think you're doing, the common thing out there that people say is if you're starting a business all you can really do\nis work on the business. And to some extent that's true,\nespecially in the beginning. We wanted to build a garden years ago, but we're just kind of\ngetting after it now 'cause the last few years have\nbeen all about the bakery. What I noticed in the past season though is that I really needed to\nget some external stimulus in order to keep having\nenergy to do the same routines better, and better, and better over time. You know, the motivation\nhas changed over time. At the beginning it was good enough for me to know that people\nwould come on Saturday, even though we were working 24 hours, to just buy the stuff we baked. And that was the fuel that\nkept us going and going. Now we know people are\ngoing to come on Saturday. They come every Saturday,\nI can't get 'em away. They just keep coming\nback, which is great. But we need some other fuel in order to keep all\nof these people happy. Because if we're not fed,\nwe don't have anything to give when feeding others,\nquite literally with food. The issue with two days versus one is figuring out when to scale this bread so that it doesn't overproof,\neven in the fridge. I'm touching it right now and it seems to still have a decent amount of spring, a decent amount of life to it. I'm hoping that it turns\nout just a little bit better than last Monday where it had\nseemingly a little less life. And then I couldn't\nquite get the aesthetic. So the bread was delicious, but it didn't have kind of our iconic\nartistic flair at the end because it didn't have enough\nenergy still in the loaf. If you look at this dough,\nit's like a ball of energy. But it's a finite ball of energy. So the starter in here is fermented and we've tried to manage the temperature so that when it hits the\noven it still has a burst and let's the bread rise. If you catch it at the wrong time, the bread will rise but it\nwon't rise quite as far. It'll be a little flatter. And so then when I'm\ntrying to get that ear, that bakers ear which you can see in this bread that's been left over here, this ear, it won't happen. Some of the fancy designs\nthat we put in at the end, these are meant to be kind of the reflection of all\nthe work that we've put on the inside of the loaf\nthat you can't really see. So we spend a little time\nwith these guys before just popping them in the oven. So I've got them on boards. And if you were in just\nabout any other bakery, for the most part, bakers\nthat are working at volume at hundreds of loaves a day aren't going to do much more than just put a slash through\nall these really quick. 30 seconds, in the oven, done, move on. I've got four ovens to load. By the time I load the fourth one it'll be back to number\none, and I can keep going. We add a layer here. So I'm going to spray all these down. And by no means am I the best\nperson at this job anymore. There was a time where I was. And on Mondays it's me,\nbecause I need practice too. I can't just be doing business\nadministration all the time. I've got to get in here\nand practice my craft. But I have hired somebody\nwho works this role and does a far better job. She's literally an artist. If she wasn't doing this I imagine she'd be doing some artwork. All these stencils, she's made over time. So I bought her some stencil paper and she's just been making\nthese cool stencils over time. So this is just a simple proof stencil. Always replace your razor blades. These things don't cost very much. I don't even know if one\nrazor blade costs a penny. We buy them by the thousand\npack for a few dollars. And after one round of baking\nloaves, the blade does dull. So I'm just going to rotate this one. I can probably get one\nmore life out of it. This is called a Wire Monkey lame. You can look these guys\nup online, Wire Monkey. They decided to get into the business of making a more\nfunctional lame for bakers. This is the traditional lame\nthat you'll find on Amazon. What's annoying is that\nonce I get going with this, the razor blade's going to fall off in a few loaves. So it's not very practical. The design of those lames doesn't prevent the baker from using\nthe back of the blade. And the thing about these blades is if you catch the back of the blade it will actually tear up your score. You really only want to be using the front part of the blade. So this score opens up the\nloaf, creates that ear. It allows the loaf to rise upward. What happens if you don't score is as the bread rises in the oven it will find the weak point in the loaf, which often is on the sides,\nand burst out the weak point. So if you don't do this cut, you'll find that your loaves look like Ts\ninstead of like a nice oval. So I've got these done. I'm going to put them back\non the rack momentarily. Doesn't seem like where they would go, but we're going to load two\novens at once instead of one. And the key to pretty much\nall kitchen work is batching. So rather than loading one oven at a time, I'm batching this activity. By doing so I'm going to\njust be a tad more efficient. You might be wondering\nwhat this magic dust is that I'm putting on the boards. It's kind of cool because\nit's actually the stuff that was not included in the flour that we got milled for us. So it's still that same\nflour blend that we're using in our bread, but it's the\n15% that's been sifted out. So it's mostly wheat bran. We use primarily a Type 85 flour. What that means is it's like 85% of the full wheat berry is intact. All parts of the wheat berry are there but the millers have sifted\nout the biggest chunks of bran, that outer coating of the wheat berry. Now what does bran do in nature? It actually prevents the\ngerm of the wheat berry from germinating until the right season. So it acts as a moisture barrier so that moisture can't get in too quickly as that wheat has not\ntumbled onto the ground and is turning into new seed\nfor the next crop of wheat. So eventually water does get in. But we're actually using\nbran in the same exact way. It's in a powdered form now. But we're using it as a\nbarrier between the board and the wet dough that\nwe're putting on it, so we can slide the dough into the oven without it sticking to the board. The result of not using\nbran is really ugly and I don't want to share it with you. We've been there, we've done that. A lot of people use cornmeal. And I don't know about you, but I just don't need\nanother use for corn. I think there's plenty of uses for corn. I'd rather stick with\nwheat and not introduce some sort of corn into this wheat product. We're actually able to get\nthat bran as a byproduct from our mill 'cause they sift it out of the flour that they produce for us, and then they don't\nknow what to do with it. It's good for some animal food. But we can actually use it right here. So we just request that they make separate bags of bran for us. And as we need it, we use it. We end up using a lot of powdered forms of flour that help with moisture. Flour really does trap\nmoisture pretty well. It's why people dust their\ndough on the tabletop so it doesn't get too wet and sticky. The rice flour that we're\nusing on top of these loaves has a similar overall function to that, except rice flour traps\nmoisture differently than wheat flour does. It doesn't dust off. So if I used regular flour here on top the stencil wouldn't really hold. So right after we remove it from the oven it would just kind of dust off. But for whatever reason, rice flour has more of a sticky effect. We also use rice flour on our bread forms. So rice flour is what's\npreventing the dough from sticking to the bannetons when it's living in the bannetons. We could use bran for that as well. But we choose to use rice\nflour because of its color so that we don't end up with\nthis weird layer of brown all around the loaf that people\nthen ask us what that is. Just the way that things are right now, we already once in a while get\nquestions from new customers. One person in particular bought\na multigrain loaf from us and stuck it in her freezer for a week. No problems there. She took it out a week\nlater and thawed the loaf. But I don't think she\nregularly bought artisan bread. And she began to get concerned with things that she was observing on her bread that came directly out of the freezer. So she noticed that the\nbread had a white top. And it was actually the rice flour that I was dusting on it the week before when I was baking it. But she had sort of\nforgotten that that was there when she bought the loaf and was terrified that that might be mold\ncoming out of the freezer. And so I explained to her\nthat it was rice flour. And she was satisfied. But then she turned her\nloaf over and she noticed that there was a coating\nof almost a yellowish, brownish, orangish thing on the bottom. It's like, \"Oh, that's the bran \"and that's so that it doesn't\nstick to the baking boards.\" But just another note to\nthe sort of artisan nature of our role in a bakery like this. You don't see the bran residue in an industrial baked product because it's typically baking in a baking pan, not directly on a stone. And further more, the\nlarger the bakery is, the more likely that the\noven that they're using, even if they're baking artisan loaves, has something called a loader. It's this big conveyor-type thing that protrudes from the\noven, you put loaves on it, and then you just slide\nit in and slide it out. No bran needed. And so the larger the bakery\nis that you bake from, the less likely you're going to see any kind of a moisture residue, moisture barrier residue\nat the bottom of your loaf. This functional score's\ngoing to give us a nice ear. The ear's going to match the\nshape of the curve that I cut. So you can manipulate how your ear looks based on how you score. Some bakers score at a slightly\ndifferent set of angles. So each oven load is 12 loaves. When we first bought the bakery we had this pizza oven that\ndidn't have steam injection. It wasn't as wide as this one so you could fit two boards, not one. So it could fit eight loaves at a time. Since it wasn't a bread\noven it also wasn't sealed. So as you were baking, oh, and the thermostats were busted. And the wiring was all messed up and crazy over the course of however\nmany 20 years of its life, people tinkering with it. So the effect on us was that we could bake eight\nloaves in an entire hour. And the entire time we\nhad to stand at the oven. So you're probably doing\nsomething similar at home to what we were doing\nwith our original oven. You can either put a\npan of water in the oven that will evaporate. I personally prefer that method now that I know a little more. But I didn't know that in the beginning. And so we took a weed sprayer that you would find at Home Depot, sanitize it, clean it all\nout, filled it with water, and we would spray that\nwater into the hot oven to generate steam and then hope that it didn't all evaporate out of the all the pores in the oven. We definitely got ashy looking loaves. So you can look at this\nloaf and see all the shine kind of in that crust layer. And it's sort of present in each one, a little bit of a sheen on top. Without steam you end up getting something that's sort of dull and ashy. There's no shine to it. Final round, I've released the steam. These are little dampers that, they're like a little valve\nat the back of the oven that lets air either\nget trapped in the oven when it's closed or flow freely out to the hood when it's open. I've released that air,\nwhich releases the steam that was trapped in that oven chamber. And without the steam now the crust can develop and gain more color. When the steams there it\nsort of protects the crust from actually browning too quickly while also providing that\ndeep color to your loaf. Without the steam you\nget this kind of ashy, almost gross looking brown. And with the steam you\nget this gradient shine that starts from a light\nbrown and goes all the way to the darkest acceptable\nshade of brown before burnt. Pretty happy with those. I would say that overall\nwe did a lot better on the two day proof\nthis week than last week. We got nice ears on most of these. And you can tell just by the shape of the loaf that the\nfermentation was solid. The loaf is kind of even\nand it's just a risen form of the shape that we tried to give it when putting them together. If a loaf is too tall or too flat, a lot of people confuse\nwhen they're first starting that oh, they get a really\nnice ear, really sharp ear, really tall loaf, but\noftentimes the middle is really, really tall\nand it contracts the sides so you get a really uneven rise. And that's actually a sign\nof it being underproofed. I like the timing of this\none a little bit better. And the funny thing is that\nthe loaves are slightly darker. So to you, this may be\nburnt, I don't know. Everybody's got a different\nperception of color. And I sort of wonder how much this sort of mimics our\nwhitewashing in society in general. We just seem to think\nthat lighter is better. But when it comes to bread, I disagree. And I really like to push the boundaries of even our customers that are accustomed to a really, really\nlight brown doughy bread. I don't get it. Because if I let the whole loaf look like this really light portion here, then when I go to poke\nit, there's no crust. It's not there. And I'm not really going for that. So there are a lot of people that want their loaf that color. And I guess for them it's probably best to stick with the sandwich bread until you figure out the\nintention of this artisan bread. Remember that this is\nessentially like the child of that bread that we\nbought 100 years ago, that really, really large month-long loaf that came in black because it\nbaked so long to get to done. This is the modern version of that. And so it's not going to be too light. This is the light part of my oven. And here's what I mean. I can't send this out into the world. You might look at it and like it. But see how that's just\nreally spongy still. That's not a crust. If you don't like it, well, fortunately there's a lot of\nbread out there in the world. We're just trying to make it\nthe way we like it really. And we hope to share what\nwe like with the world and hope that enough people like it too.", "O1RhgH2C1es": "hi oh please just done couple years there in a box at the time and the pensioner diesel said well your people was good obviously a bit for today I fought I picked up this a niche boys skills pre-roll they're gonna see a little creaminess trade skills 1.5 grams nature boys all that stuff I think this major points to get always pretty role I was just going to smoke it before you know what might do something a bit different much good it just to see what's inside it you know in the spirit of like you what some of pre-roll West case we reviews on a Instagram see that minding some pretty roles and stuff seen exactly what's inside in that and I see these native boys peels and put quite a bit hard round at the moment a lot of people smoking on them like you know the business and that sort of for you know what let's cut one op see exactly what's inside it yeah it's only gonna be a short video like there wasn't quite as I can see what's inside to make sure they like stem use and often show that which I really don't think that will be you know nature would do the absolute business so I highly doubt it's gonna be anything sort [ __ ] in here but yeah let's get this a pre roll out and see exactly the same sue there is the pre-roll to start of it's a case then I'll show you as well we do have like a little glass I've wanted to be a little bit of weed in mind just unfortunate looking this being a bad stuff well yeah come to my class which obviously I'm gonna keep and reusing stuff damn certainly looks nice certainly smells nice as well really nice or skittle smoke coming up there so sweet through II sort of smell Klim yeah just a as well be is raining outside so I do apologize about that didn't hear that stuff but yeah anyway nature boys skittles pyrrole as you see you there let's get this opened up see what's inside it oh just got that cut open as you can see look all our weed there let's go certainly on Thursdays fictions it's looking at the business Google drive's anything that shouldn't be that's all the pulp order stove our classrooms everything you'll save a little bit in the middle well yeah natureboy skits you know you got break your dad didn't roll really nice damn yeah well I expected just really nice ground-up flour doesn't realize anything in there that shouldn't be in there absolutely don't think I can see anything anyway find it all stem is that just a sugar leaf you know it actually is sugar leaf they're so round itself [Music] yeah maybe it's honey's best I don't feel like a stem nut feels proper song might be Tony's bit stoner part from that looking pretty [ __ ] silent it's a nice ground flour it's not amazing that I put it out suppose for some great skills yeah certainly some diggin dogs as well which is just maybe it's been hand ground other than I probably Grandal to be fair a grinder this certain is it's a nice and well ground and I saw some really nice flower I don't know what I was expecting but I thought we were gonna see obviously I'm a DS need to boys pre-order many boom really nicely and stuff I just for whatever to one see exactly what's in there you know I've seen in the spirit of lots of a pre-roll and West case we review them and an Instagram afford apron assault so we could have another loss certainly seems like nothing untoward at the ordinary there's nice ground or flower Labadie the specs so yeah Nature Boy skills pyrrole well I have to do is we roll this now actually gets focus making it but yeah I must see the flash run quickly as well just so you can see that what and where I'm seeing just saw some really nice brown flour yeah it's we the flash on not really helping us see anything who have already seen things this you see for some nice grams of flour really really nice I rise today from that flush is doing anything frizz really is it yeah natureboy stick it was pretty rolled 1.5 grams maybe those are tiny that was stemming now I'm still not even sure if that was the spending it was proper soft and that look it might have been a tiny little step in there but apart from that it's all obviously for fire very nice ground-up flower so yeah and I we see comes with you little lacerations well fun you know sort of forget about Rosie a nice little feature on the pre-roll yellow flash boots like that grieve that that will certainly get some use out of so time to roll this [ __ ] back up like I said that's your meter boy skills 1.5 grab pre-roll go in just to check everything's what it should be in there yeah sound is always bigger major boys as well ways bringing as that fire and yeah what we do this so maybe different if you wanna see me got some more pretty girls let me know its best pure whatever Gordon actually a lot what's inside but yeah there we go Nature Boy skill was lucky a real soon with some washing your people I just wanted to hop on really quickly so bringing into this video obviously I just got that skittles pre-roll I have actually smoked it now as well well I've actually a build-up to spliffs out of what was left of it to sort of nice press smoke one absolutely fire banging taste to it some of the nicest skills I've tasted and the skills are reviewed the skills of my channel was definitely a ladder flavor the UK grade one and boy I would have said wow this the skittles wasn't necessarily as quite loud a flavor of some skills of smoke before the actual taste was bang on like initially tasted like some skittles like the sweet sort of thing no absolutely [ __ ] banging so yeah obviously I just wanted to hop on and say you know end of this pre-roll video have you seen what's inside there even sorted all right that was a little stem I personally not even sure that was still estab if it was it was certain very small stem but it was also not mud softened but certainly didn't affect you know or wouldn't have affected I'd imagine the way the pre-roll would have smoked yeah because it was been him you made bright white ash as you'd expect from eh boys so yeah I just wanted to hop on and just sort of bring that to an end bring it to a close sort of thing you know like anyway actually fought to the flower when I smoked it what's absolutely banging and if you want to see me got more pre-rolls you know see what's inside him and stuff let me know because I can do that yeah I also just want to say we're nearly at 2,000 subscribers it's a big everyone that subscribed really does mean a lot and we've got a cherry gelato and a dosey doe UK two different trains UK reviews coming soon and also going to do a little sort of 2k celebration sort of adventure maybe sort of video so you've got that to look forward to as well but yeah just want to hop hard and bring this video to a close let you know that that the skills was actually banging to smoke as well rather than us seeing what's inside it but yeah Bingle

"hello everybody okay today I have a super quick tutorial walkthrough if you will we have a lot of people really interested in CBD joints but have actually expressed that they don't know how to use CBD joints so I'll kind of walk through this you know product this is made with industrial hemp flour it is a full one gram joint it's rolled with raw papers it does have kind of you know like a paper filter in there so when you're in handling the part doesn't go into your mouth and so with that this is the part that goes on your mouth it will say we're all on it and it's more like the slender side at the bottom of the joint and then on this end is actually what you're going to light with fire with flame I'm gonna use matches we also sell hemp wick in our store here we start CBD you're welcome to use lighters pretty much anything that will make fire is how you're going to light the pre-roll but I'm just gonna basically show you how to light the pre-roll on how to put the pre-roll out Oh quick other thing to note because is a full gram I don't recommend smoking the whole thing out once this is a really great product to share amongst your friends this is also a really good product for yourself but just to know that you don't need to take puffs to complete the whole joint you kind of smoke until you feel it so usually for me when I'm smoking enjoy by myself I'll take you know anywhere from three to five hits kind of let it rest see how my body is responding to that and then if you want you know there's no harm in smoking more just know that to get the effect of smoking CBD you don't have to smoke this whole one gram joint that's actually a lot of CBD in my opinion and I'm Allison to go on this piece and this is a side that I'm going to light and we're just gonna do a quick little minor joint if I can light it so the point is to light the paper kind of light that hole first you know circumference of the joint you do take a few puffs really big inhalation is just to kind of like get that cherry on the end of it lighted and then from there you can just kind of inhale and take as many drags as you want like I size you through to four drags but the other thing that I wanted to show you guys is how to properly put a joint out so I recommend using a metal ashtray there's also ceramic ashtrays if you happen to be outside concrete is fine you definitely don't put it out on anything wooden because this is a flame but you're gonna basically take the end and so this is how I'm gonna preserve the joint so I can smoke it later if I choose to I'm just gonna gently kind of tap it out you basically want to suffocate the flame sometimes depending on how much you smoke you can kind of push that lit piece out and again I just kind of dampen it out you know just to make sure that flame isn't still lit but you can put it out and basically when I wanted to refocus I would just light from the end again but that'd be south and basically you're trying to suck the heat from the end all the way through using your lungs that's what's lighting it and pulling and burning that hemp butt of that hemp flower set you can have the effect of smoking CBD so hope you guys like that video if you have other questions for us you're too afraid to ask feel free to you know DM us on Instagram also come visit us in our store at restart CBD we're always happy to talk to you guys in person and yeah we actually sell these pre-rolled joints both in our store here at restart and online at restart CBD calm we carry about six to seven different strains both in loose bud and pre-rolls but yeah girls are a great way to have the convenience of smoke CBD without the pipe without the grinder without all the accessories and a really good fun way to experience this specifically in group settings like taking these to parties so thanks again for watching we appreciate you and check out below for more video", "OvmpO1vjoc4": "in this video we are going to show you how to make pre-rolls fast using a cone filling machine first and foremost please wash your hands before handling any material to avoid contamination place your vibration table stabilization mat on the surface you will be working off place the vibration table on the stabilization map plug the extension cord into the wall outlet plug the vibration table into the extension cord place the cone filling machine on top of the vibration table set the cone riser aside for now load your cone filling machine with empty cones [Music] grab the material that you will be filling your cones with today we are using menthol meadow an herbal smoking blend from herbal spirits use the switch on the extension cable to turn the vibration table on once your vibration table has turned on begin filling the machine with your material the vibration action of the machine will shake your material into the cones use the included cone packing tool to pack the cones while the vibration table is off continue filling the Machine and packing until the cones are full once the cones are full turn the vibration table off using the switch on the extension cord place the cone filling machine with the cone riser underneath it on a flat surface rotate the cone filling machines while lightly applying downward pressure on the riser the machine will eventually slide down on top of the riser while simultaneously lifting the filled cones remove each cone from the machine fold and twist the end to finish [Music] congratulations you have just used a cone filling machine to make a lot of pre rolls in a short period of time [Music]", "Bpmg8qJiumA": "[Music] what's going on guys it's knives here and today i'm going to be reviewing this girl scout cookies cbd pre-roll from the goods so around september october last year i went out and i bought this little vape and some cbd juice just to see if i liked it or not took a break from smoking weed tried out the vape and honestly i really i didn't like it didn't really like the flavor it was i think it was kiwi skunk in this right now and i don't mind kiwi but i didn't really care for it so i put it down and i've not really touched it for a little bit so fast forward to boxing day and i've nearly smoked through over an hour and a half in december and i'm thinking i really should probably have a break come january so i went on the hemphealth website and i saw these things here this is the grape cbd vape pen from the goods i got this and opened it looked at it looks really nice really sleek but it didn't last very long this only lasted me a day and i'm not a heavy smoker i don't smoke half as much as you guys think i do and i don't vape at all like i don't smoke cigarettes or and i don't vape so i bought this purely for the cbd because there's nothing else in it tried it out i didn't really like the flavor it tastes like well it tastes like grape but it tastes like grape medicine if that makes sense didn't taste very nice to me personally i didn't really like it after three hits on this i started feeling really sick which happened also on this so i don't know if it's cbd vapes that make me feel sick or whether it's just cbd in general so i decided i was gonna try and smoke some cbd flour this pre-roll was actually free when i ordered this because one of my friends used my friend code and that gave me enough points to get this for free so if you would like to try something use my friend code down in the description you get points i get points i'm not sponsored at all i bought these with my own well i didn't buy this this was with points but i bought this with my own money but if you want to use my code you get yourself some points i get myself some points and you also get a 15 discount which is pretty cool so what you're waiting for go and try it now so let's jump into this and let's open it up and when i open it up you can see on the top there it's got a little quality seal the camera [ __ ] so it doesn't show what it says but it's a little foil seal i think that says just says the goods it smells a little bit before you even peel off the seal i haven't opened this it smells um it doesn't smell like weed smells like cbd if you know what i mean if you've never tried cbd it's faintly weedy but it's it's not at the same time so i'm just gonna open it take the seal off it smells a lot stronger now smells smells quite fruity actually no not free like piney it smells like pine like sweet pine though that's where i'm getting the fruitiness from it's like sweet pine but it definitely smells like cbd [Music] so you can see those close-ups this is actually really nicely rolled it's bending a little bit when i hold it up that's not very good but yeah um it's very nicely rolled it's rolled a lot better than i could let's be honest i'm just gonna go weigh it really quickly so this is a one gram girl scout cookie cbd flower pre-rolled yeah i'm just going to dry to okay and see what it tastes like definitely piney it really does taste like girl scout cookies i've tried actual girl scout cookies and i really enjoyed it so i was kind of excited to try this it does really taste like girl scout cookies it's got the pineness down to pretty much exactly like girl scout cookies [Music] yeah i don't know how to describe it other than it does taste like girl scout cookies if you've ever tasted it definitely piney definitely sweet yeah i'm just gonna spot this up because i'm actually kind of excited now [Music] you can see there just when i was lighting it the tip's gone really really floppy like really floppy [Music] taste is different man that's nice that's actually nice it's really hard to get hit because of this floppy tip man [Music] i don't know why it's gone like that i was just [ __ ] stupid but [Music] gotta really pull out it to get hit but when you do get one it's nice tastes quite floral doesn't taste like weed taste is really nice so far really nice and white this is burning whiter than pretty much any weed i've ever had so take it from that what you will i just fell on my radiator [ __ ] so yeah whilst i'm smoking this i'm gonna read what it says on the outside of the packaging so it says the goods pre-roll girl scout cookies on the front then you turn it over it's got barcode qr code and next to that it says directions visit got thegoods.com keep out of reach from children it must be 18 plus to use and that's just the address it says underneath the address batch and then there's nothing and it says expires and there's also nothing so i'm guessing pre-rolls don't expire [Music] we'll stop it all other glides [Music] says 10 cbd ingredients organic organic proprietary herbal blend cbd isolate terpenes minor cannabinoids can include cbg and cbc this is still chiefing along really nicely the ash on this is on my floor now it's incredible though so i'm not feeling anything right now [Music] obviously you don't feel high because there's no um sword thc there's no thc in this but there is other cannabinoids so you might feel buzzed if you say for example you've never smoked weed before or you've have and you don't smoke it anymore or regular enough to know the effects then this might give you a little bit of a buzz obviously you will not feel high i'm not saying that it's going to make you stoned because it won't it's cbd it's not thc but it'll make you feel good i feel well to be honest i was having a pretty shitty day i woke up i had a bad dream i woke up and i was just in a [ __ ] mood took my dog out it was a little bastard came home to smoke this make this video and i feel better actually i feel calm and i feel alright [Music] i'm having to hold the joint weird like a bit of the way down it because it's just it's just so floppy man i know i didn't bend it or if i go back and i edit this and i see that i did bend it then that's on me but i don't think i did bend this i was holding it well it was flat whilst i was filming um the close-ups and then it was flat in the palm of my hand so i don't know where the bends come from [ __ ] helmet i'm not even stoned but the amount of ash that i've dropped off of this is not funny i'm gonna have to hoover when i finish this [Music] i don't feel sick and that for me is one of the main things i don't like about vaping cbd because after three or four hits i i feel really sick to the point where i have to sit down and just breathe through it because if i don't and if i like stand up again i feel like i'm actually gonna physically throw up so i don't know if that's a chemical in the in what makes it liquid to vape it or yeah it's [ __ ] good i don't know if it's a chemical um in the liquid that makes you able to vape it that doesn't agree with me but i feel fine on this flower cbd so so i'm really enjoying this pre-roll um cbd flower might be the way to go for me i think i really do want to try more in the future so like i said if you want 15 off and some points use a link in the description that's my friend code i also get points from that not a sponsor but i do want to keep trying this and it's quite expensive i will say for cbd well cbd is expensive in general but if like me you also smoke weed to them like buy cbd which is essentially the same thing without the high it's not worth it for me personally i would rather go out and buy an eight but that's not being said that that's not to be said that i won't buy more of this because i really am enjoying this i think when i take tolerance breaks in the future which is what i bought this vape for instead of vaping i'll just buy like a three five of some cbd mix because for me the act of rolling or the acts of grinding your weed and packing the bong is just as good as the actual smoking for me i've noticed person i'm rambling now i'm not even stoned i should get the goods and ask them to buy me a new carpet because i'm just i'm enjoying this so much that i keep forgetting to ash which is well you know swings around about i'm really enjoying the cbd joint flow full of ash what are you going to do [Music] tell me in the comments i've heard conflicting things i've heard that cbd brings you down when you're really really high which is true for the most part i think but i've also heard that cbd can counteract your high so let me know in the comments if it would work me buying an eighth of weed and an eighth of cbd and mixing them together to smoke to prolong it or whether it be completely counteractive and the cbd would counteract the txc and you just wouldn't get stoned leave me a comment if you know the answer to that because i've googled it and there's so much conflicting opinions i don't know this is really nice i know i keep repeating it but i'm actually i'm really enjoying it i don't know if it's placebo but like i usually do when i'm making these videos i'm staring off over there at the trees in the clouds and my vision is doing the thing like it does when i'm stoned where everything looks a little bit more hd and a little bit nicer i know that i'm not high i just want to keep reiterating this this is a joint but it will not get you high there's no tobacco in this there's no thc in this all it'll do is just make you feel good like relaxed there may be like cannabinoids that show up in a test if you smoke cbd flower i don't know don't take my words as law don't smoke one of these before a drug test or just ask the person who's doing it that's probably the best thing you can do is ask your employer before smoking cbd so i'm about halfway through this it's still sagging but not as bad because the the weight is not there anymore still sagging but it's smoking pretty nicely you just have to hold it um a bit further down the joint until you get to there obviously but by then i don't think it'll be a problem so i'm just going to jump straight into the rating of this for looks 10 out of 10 rolls really well looked really neat really nice i can't complain smell i don't really like the smell of cbd it's got like this weird almost like chemically not quite weed smell to it which i personally don't like but that's just me so i think man one more ash one [ __ ] wash the smell you can definitely smell the pine so i'm i'm gonna go put my bias aside for not liking the smell of cbd i'm gonna give it another eight because it does smell like girl scout cookies and the taste [ __ ] you know i'm just gonna leave that in you can still choke on cbd did i do taste yet i don't know i can't remember the taste of it lit is gonna get [Music] i'm gonna give it a seven because you can taste the pine but there's also something else in there like you can taste the cbd as well and i don't like the taste of it but it's like very very minimal you're mainly getting like sweet pine so i'm gonna give it [Music] i'm gonna give it eight this is getting eight all around because i'm very very pleasantly surprised i was going into this fully expecting to not like it because i didn't like this that much but i'm really really liking this i'm really enjoying it it's burning nice and slow it's absolutely pure white i can't fault it it's not gone out once usually i have to re-light my joints because i'm just a [ __ ] piss-poor roller and it goes out but this not once this is really really good [Music] so overall i'm gonna give this girl scout cookies cbd pre-roll from the goods an eight out of ten i really really like this just [ __ ] like stored over my words up i'm really really enjoying this for tolerance breaks in the future i will definitely definitely get some more pre-rolls um i don't know i don't know how these will do with relighting because this is big and i don't like i wouldn't usually smoke a joint this big when i got halfway i was considering pointing out but because i'm not high and it doesn't really matter i'm not going to for this video but if this was if this had thc in it i would have put it out like half a joint i got so for that reason i don't think these will last me personally as long on a tolerance break as they would i lost my train of thought yeah i think i would have to buy either i think i would buy the um the mix instead of the pre-rolls because then i could roll my own size of joints but yeah i can't i can't fold this there's no there's no false it's not getting 10 out of 10 because because of my personal tastes i'd say i think there's room for improvement but overall eight out of ten these are really good so if you want to try these definitely check out hemphealth my links in the description if you want to use that you get 15 discount i get some points 100 not sponsored whatsoever i'm just very much enjoying this so yeah um 8 out of 10 for the cbd girl scout cookies pre-roll from the

guys welcome back if you watched the last video and uh hello if you're new here um today we're about to smoke one of these west coast cure pre-rolls provided to us by jacob thank you very much jacob thank you i'm really hyped about those i've heard a lot of good reviews on west coast cures um i've never smoked one before i don't y'all never smoked one before right that's happening i tapped two hits off of one of these but haven't really got like a full experience okay cool and um i'll let you spark this thing up buddy this is chrisley i like how they put it in raw joints i like raw papers so i think that's pretty cool use that all natural taste yeah [Music] a little harsh [Music] damn this is pulling yeah you can't hear the [ __ ] section it stinks damn duncan it smells like some gas for me this is gonna be an easy hot box it does so now that i've gotten into it a little bit it's got a nice little it's got a nice little gassy taste to it under the i swear i think it's that keef it's super it's got a little stink to it for sure dude i mean it looks very hard so that [ __ ] pulls like i mean it pulls like shotgun like i really don't think it tastes that bad compared to other pre-rules we've had not many at least i mean it does have that pre-roll flavor but it's i i expected it to be hard yeah i mean this is [Music] perfect [Music] i hope our youtube channel gives you nostalgic memories and when you used to hang out with your bros and you smoke up or you're chilling with your brains and watching yes we're all bros here this is not bad it's not bad at all i mean [Music] that [ __ ] was yellow yeah he took a [ __ ] that was kind of nasty it's not bad i mean you can you could tell like it's probably a little a little old you know what i mean not the pre-roll of the bud sitting on the shelf a little too long yeah you got to get a pre-roll like the day they made that [ __ ] i mean like at least a week after they made it but like i mean [ __ ] bird there's no telling when they made think about it and you roll a joint right and you just have that [ __ ] sitting there for like a month right it's not going to taste like it did you do that exactly yeah that's what i mean like they need that you need to like if somebody rolled that [ __ ] or made that [ __ ] like that day that's fire i don't want a [ __ ] live resident or keith that's been sitting there for like a month or some [ __ ] bro like yeah facts look at him god damn it that's more expensive than milo and he doesn't even realize that's two of him like they make you buy cats be called or like buy pets really i mean when you go to a pet store and you have to buy it for like 40 dollars like you were just saying bro that's like it's just weird like you're kind of helping them you're helping them out by taking that cat off their hands so it's like i don't know why you're having fun and pay for it yeah that's what i'm saying like that i got it from an actual shelter and like they uh they make you pay adoption fees for the shots and they give it a chip beforehand and all that stuff and they also give you free they give you free like a chip yeah there's a chip in it just in case it got lost and they brought it back to the pound they could check it for a chip and it's got my number on it inside of them yeah it's like under his ear bro he's like [ __ ] he's like a clone bro order 66 right right like this like dude imagine one day just like all the cats that have chips and him like just [ __ ] somebody from the pet store is like executed 466 they just all start killing their [ __ ] owners and cats with [ __ ] machine guns [ __ ] blazer machine guns taking them out there's like yes my lord there's her like it's like the slice and jacob starting to sleep and she's liking rick and morty with the the dog had the [ __ ] robot suit yeah yeah that's a dude that was a good [ __ ] episode dude while he's taking that little hit here you want to talk a little bit about what you thought of that west coast uh yeah i mean i thought it was all right i mean like i said it's definitely not a fresh pre-roll so it's hard to tell like if it was like a brand new one i guarantee you it's really [ __ ] fire you'd definitely tell that was like it's pretty old but it got me high but that's all that matters i guess at the end of the day you know what i mean but yeah i mean the taste and everything it wasn't really there it was it was okay it was all right it was i gave it about like a a six and a half because it got me like high but like taste wise and stuff it was not there in my opinion but that like i said that's an older one so i'm not going to sit there and say like west coast here suck because i've heard really good things about them so i might have got like a dud kind of yeah i mean i bought this a week ago for the video yeah exactly so yeah i mean there and it probably was like made weeks before that so yeah if not yeah so this is what you the price you pay when you're getting a a three roll in my opinion i think the pre-roll it wasn't i'm on the same page but ever wasn't anything special when it came to the flavor um but i definitely would say it accelerated my heart yeah yeah for sure we were already kind of getting before we started so yeah i mean it got me high so i feel like it just um it's cool all in all like it was good it got me high and like that's what i want um i just feel like the taste wasn't there you know like it just it and i mean that is that's what you're you know you're gonna get with pre-roll that's what i said today yeah so all in all it was a pretty good point i mean i or joint it got me high i mean that's that's what matters yeah so pretty much we all said the same thing yeah i i pretty much about have the same the same thing to say i mean it was really it got me high it was a nice uh a nice feel and everything it was smooth but the flavor that i wanted out of pre-roll for that kind of price just wasn't there yeah i expect more of it it's probably like trim or shake that's been sitting in that you know in that joint for like months and i mean it's like i said earlier you know if you if you roll a joint of some gas right top shelf even you sit that [ __ ] in in the cabinet for like what a month even if you put it in a nice little glass jar sealed up it's not going to taste the same it's just not dude and that that's the case i got high i mean i know there's some gas in there because i'm high and there was five heads on that so i mean i noticed some gas dude don't get me wrong um especially if you take a dab after that you know you get really stunned there's some pre-rolls though that like are [ __ ] insane bro but like it's just like you're asking for like a hundred dollars for one joint so that's just just not me but like that's okay you're smoking like four grams in one joint which is cool i get it like it honestly it equals up to 100 but like i just don't want to smoke all that at once i want to save my [ __ ] but that [ __ ] is probably like where it's at that's probably those are probably the pre-rolls you're really going for you're probably not gonna find a solid pre-roll that's only like a gram and it's just strictly but you know i mean like you need to pre-roll with dabs or some live resin in it some [ __ ] like that really get a good taste out of it but you get to say the option buddy okay uh what do i need to say did you just say it dude now y'all got me like thinking all that [ __ ] guys all right i gotta get um wait a second all right so uh yeah thanks for watching the video um so or all right whatever milo is hungry dude dude just do it then if you want to do i don't know the [ __ ] favor all right do you want to do it again endeavor yeah um all right

"hi and welcome back to our how-to and product review videos here at es studios today we'll be discussing the raw cone filler this relatively new product was created by raw with the intention of easing and expediting the process of packing raw pre-rolled cones they come in both king-size and 101 quarter to fit every smokers needs let's go ahead and take a look at what this ingenious new packing tool has to offer attach the raw cone filler itself you'll also find a bamboo packing stick as well as an additional packing tool which detaches from the bottom of the cone filler to make it easier to pack the trench an extra mouth tip for the filler and a short instruction manual are also included will take you step-by-step to show you how these nifty tools will come in handy when filling your pre-rolled cones now that you've unpacked all of your cool new tools you're going to want to take your ground up over tobacco and begin filling the top of the filler with it then using the packing tool that comes attached to the bottom of the cone filler pack down the herb into the trough until you can securely closed the filler then you're going to take your pre-rolled cone and slip it onto the mouth tip of the cone filler being careful not to wrinkle the paper now close the top of the filler ensuring it grasps onto the tip of the cone then at a slow and steady pace slide the top part all the way forward then all the way back to its original position being cautious not to detach the cone as you go some users like to partially slide the top back and forth a second time to pack it further while others use the bamboo packing stick to slide the rest of it through the mouth tip and into the cone as always pack your herb further down into the pre-rolled cone using your bamboo packing stick to ensure your cone is packed evenly throughout finally twist off the top of the cone and there you have it a perfectly packed pre-rolled raw cone despite the fact that Rob's a great care when creating this innovative and effective product we have run into a few minor issues with it and have received several complaints from customers regarding them personally the biggest issue we've come to find is that the cone filler will oftentimes leave a partially unpacked space near the filter tip causing the cone to be flimsy our solution to this has been to pre pack the cone slightly before using the cone filler in order to avoid cos the complaint which we have received them most from our customers however is that the pre-rolled cones will at times not fit onto the mouth tip of the cone loader unfortunately this issue has been addressed by Josh himself the founder of raw rolling papers as he has stated that because of the fact that free rolled cones are all hand rolled there will always be instances where they will not fit perfectly onto the comb through it in any case the product itself is still quite effective and convenient as it makes the process of packing pre-rolled cones ten times faster and simpler thanks for watching our video we'll continue to release videos every week if you have any questions suggestions or comments feel free to leave

graham pre-roll right here this was a penny pretty [ __ ] wicked look at this guys one penny joint what's the point of charge your opinion because they have to wring it up or something so they char they got to charge you something i think that's how it is but all right guys cheers i don't know what is it it tastes like it's not already it's supposed to be it's kind of hard to pull especially pre-roll's always hard to pull i always have to end so small like that yeah i know the thing's kind of [ __ ] up right there [Music] okay dude so he gets smoked slow hmm for a one penny joint i guess you can't say it's bad because it's literally a penny so i don't know how you can complain but i wouldn't say it's like some [ __ ] gas ass weed i don't know we'll see i'm i'm not high yet off first rotation so if second rotation gets me fried we'll see if it's some good joint but so far i'd say it's like average weed i'm sorry about that you shake look at this yeah do you look at it hope you

i'm going with the six only because it was a penny i would never spend twenty dollars on this pre-roll the dispensary it's been pretty good you know going there i would say it could be a little bit

third iteration of cooking with ricardi today uh we are going to make homemade bread you know this is a i think out of all the recipes that we're gonna go over um and what we've already cooked this is really my favorite recipe um it's a family recipe this is a recipe that my grandmother made back during the depression to feed her 10 kids it's also a recipe that was handed down to my mother and she would make it as well so i have really fond memories of getting little loaves of bread for my grandma and then my mom would make them for us as well and then we'd cut them up and make toast and spread butter and jam over the bread and it was just such a yummy uh appetite excuse not appetite but it was a yummy uh dessert and even breakfast in the morning and when i think about bread you just think about the building blocks of civilization and society really bread is something that is really an unheralded piece of food that has been instrumental in building society and building civilization so i'm really excited to be able to present this to you and show you how to make homemade bread i've been doing this for about a year uh in fact uh i got the recipe from my cousin michael who's been making bread for over two decades and uh he handed it down to me um and uh i started making bread when we all went into copic quarantine about a year ago so i'm really excited this is probably about the seventh or eighth batch that i've made um and we'll we'll go through in a few minutes talking about all of the ingredients and then we'll start mixing our water and show that kind of chemistry that comes together in making the bread all right so what we're going to start with is in any kind of bread that we're going to make we're going to start with 3 tablespoons of yeast with that yeast i have one teaspoon of sugar so we're going to put these together because this is what we're going to use when we combine it into the warm water of about 113 114 degrees you really don't want to go any higher than 114 you're really getting to a limit at 115 because you don't want the yeast to overact because that's going to cause problems with your dough later on down the line i have six tablespoons of sugar that will go in this bowl with nine cups of warm water and then i will stir that in until the sugar dissolves as we move over i've got three quarters of a cup of vegetable oil any oil will work i wouldn't use olive oil um we just use a a basic vegetable oil no canola oil it's totally fine and then what i have is out of the 10 pounds of flour i've put in five pounds of flour into my big mixing bowl here and in conjunction with that i have four tablespoons of salt while we're mixing the two different sets of water one with the yeast and the tablespoon of sugar and then the nine cups of water with six tablespoons of sugar we will mix this up get the salt and the flour all together then once the uh once the sugar is dissolved in the nine cups of warm water and our we have our yeast water that is really bubbled up and you'll see that that chemistry come together then we'll combine all of that into the mixed up flour we will start mixing it up with the oil and it'll really come out to like a thick pancake batter and then once that is all done we're gonna let it rest for about five minutes and then i will add in the last five pounds and that's where we get into the kneading um and we get in with our hands all right everybody so we're gonna start with our water i've already poured nine cups of water it's about 114 and a half degrees and i've used this meat thermometer and you just place it underneath the water to get your temperature right where you want it and that's where remember what i said earlier i don't want to get it any warmer than 115 degrees and we got it to about 114 and a half which is really about a perfect perfect temperature for doing this so right away what we're gonna do is we're gonna pour in our yeast and we're gonna which is three tablespoons and then we're gonna pour in our table a teaspoon of sugar and we are just going to mix this up and it is going to smell outstanding in here it's going to smell like a bakery so we're just going to stir this around and it takes a little bit of time to you know dissolve it once you if you get any chunks you just kind of press them up against the side of the uh of the bowl here and just it's just kind of chunky and chalky but that's all right you just keep stirring it in and then once we get it down to that consistency where you have all the chunks completed and they're and they're squashed and it's very milky and frothy um but we'll let it sit for about five six minutes we'll stir this up make sure that our our sugar in the nine cups of warm water is completely dissolved and then from there we'll mix up our flour and salt combination and then by that time we should be pretty set for adding the water and the oil and starting to mix up the uh the first half of the solution now that we've got our yeast and you can kind of see it already it's nice and frothy and it's starting to build up we're gonna let that sit in here for about five six minutes i've already dissolved the sugar in the water you can see at the bottom all that sugar was sitting in there that's six tablespoons and i've mixed it up so um you can't even see the sugar anymore it's completely one with the water now we're just going to be efficient and we're going to start to mix up our flour and salt just so that when we combine the two different waters the yeast water and the sugar water that they go in and we've already got the salt kind of combined and at one with the uh with the wheat with the flour so we're just gonna mix this up just give it a couple stirs make sure that we get it nice and flipped over and combined just and i you know i some people use different techniques i just kind of twirl the the bowl with the you know clockwise with the way i'm stirring and then we just kind of get underneath it and that's it i think once we give it a few more stirs we're good because we're going to get in with our hands once we've combined all the water uh and we've given it a proper stirring once we get it to like a pancake batter solution so what we're going to do now is we're going to combine our yeast water with our sugar water now what i'm going to do is this is a technique that my cousin taught me i'm going to pour in the yeast water first and then i'm going to pour this so that we get all that yeast right out of the bowl and then that assures you of getting the yeast right out of the bowl so another thing that i want to do here is just and i've cleaned my countertops pretty well here just make sure we get all that yeast so because we're going to use these countertops to um knead the bread and knead the during that time when we are getting it kind of loosened up and and and stiffened up here so what i'm going to do right now is i'm just going to start stirring in the flour with the sugar water the yeast and our three-quarters of a cup of oil we're just going to stir this around work it together and you know right now it's a little tough but you just have to have a little elbow grease and you should just start mixing it up and like i said it's gonna as you start to mix it up and you can see that you just have to be real vicious with it i guess and it's just going to come together like a nice thick pancake batter on a saturday morning or a sunday morning and we're just going to keep getting it and you want to make sure that you're getting underneath it because you've got flour that sits underneath and you want to get that flour combined with everything so you want to get nice and underneath that all right i think i'm trying to add too much color to this um it's it's kind of straightforward you know and when i say color i'm talking about commentary um you know it's bread is it's a it's a weird thing because there's not a ton of ingredients as you saw but it's incredibly complex because of the chemistry that goes into making this and you as a as a baker you have to be very precise with how you with your ingredients and your measurements because if you're not precise it's going to cause problems with the rising and then you're not going to get a very good product once you bake it all right everybody it's been five minutes we've got our batter um our bread batter that like i said it comes out to a like a pancake consistency um so now and it is it is a bit of like a solution a little bit more um of a liquidy type of a thicker liquid if you will now we have the rest of our five pounds of flour and this is a ten pound bag so what this ten pound bag will yield is about eight loaves not about it's exactly eight loaves in uh nine by five pan so what we do is we just get that in there and you just kind of spread out the flower above the solution you can see it moves around kind of like a water bed of course anybody that is too young you won't uh you won't get that reference water beds are from like the 70s and the 80s but our older folks will definitely uh understand that so now we just go ahead and you know i've washed my hands and we just start gently mixing in you don't want to go too tough early on or too vigorous i guess is is the word because you're just gonna splash flour all around and make a huge mess and i'm not real big on cleaning up big messes so uh we're just gonna kind of gingerly mix in that flour and we're gonna make sure because we're trying to avoid is the clumps and i can feel clumps starting to form so we're just going to kind of it's gooey right you just want to get in and underneath and kind of fold it over that's what we call folding you just start getting in from the sides and under and then pushing it under and over now that we've gotten uh we kind of need this with our hands we're gonna let this rest for five minutes and then after five minutes um we're gonna put it out on the counter we're gonna roll it around and knead it on the counter and it's really gonna get to a silky smooth consistency and then then we're going to wash our bowl oil it put the kneaded and smooth um uh flour or bread back in the bowl and then we're gonna let it rise for 90 minutes so right now we've let our dough kind of rest we are going to there's a little bit of flour still in here so i'm just going to put it right over the top all right and now we are just going to start working the dough and this is where you know i'll press it down and i'll fold it over and you just kind of do it in whatever direction you want and i can already feel as i'm working it that it's starting to get a little bit more kind of silky and smooth on the surface put that down and just kind of keep working it over folding it from under to over and how long do you need to knead it mr ricardo's gonna need it for about seven eight minutes and i was telling mr earlier i had to turn the heat down in the house because uh you know this is where you're really working your arms and you kind of start to work up a bit of a sweat i won't make bread if it's above 65 degrees because it just gets too warm this is definitely something that i do in the cooler months winter spring in the fall but you will not find me making any bread in the summertime because uh it's just too hot we're down to like the final 20 30 seconds here and what we're gonna do is we are going to you can kind of see with the dough it's definitely a much silkier and smoother consistency so we're getting really close to being done with needing this and we've gone over it a lot you can kind of you can hear from my breath that i'm a little winded because this is 10 pounds of flour that we're moving around i poured a little bit of vegetable oil back in my pan that's been cleaned and all i'm going to do is just kind of baste the sides and the bottom with my brush of oil and i'm just going to go around the edges here and this will help with any kind of sticking and it just adds a little bit of flavor as well you'll notice if you do make this the bread tends to be a little bit oilier than any standard issue bread that you're going to get at at the store but it has a ton of flavor and it's absolutely fantastic so what we're going to do is we're just going to put our kneaded bread right in there and i'm just using plastic wrap it works it gets the job done exactly how i want it so we're just going to cover one side of the bowl and we're going to do this get it nice and tight and then we're going to do this perfect and you want to make sure that there's no air in there so we that's why we've kind of overlapped it here then i'm just going to pinch this off and now i've got a nice seal on here all right there's no air getting in we're going to set it up on the counter it's 90 minutes after the fact you'll notice that i have eight bread pans they're all nine by five i've laid them out they've all been oiled with the same oil that we use in the dough and now i'm taking off our plastic wrap and the first step that we need to do here in this process is get all the air out so all you're going to do is just stick your fingers in to the dough and just get the air out that's all we're doing all right now that we've gotten the air out we're going to do our final need we're going to do it for about six or seven minutes and i always set a timer just so that i'm not going over and your bread you know obviously as it comes out of the of the mixing bowl it's got all the oil on it and you just again you just want to fold it over and work the dough it's very silk and smooth uh very silky and smooth and you just want to work it over for about six minutes and that's all we're gonna do we're just gonna work it over and then when we're done in six minutes we'll start cutting it up and putting it into the bread pans so right now i'm just kind of trying to roll this out into a form of like a look like a a big sub sandwich if you will um and we're just trying to get it even so that when i go through and start to slice it out we get some nice even loaves of bread so we'll just get it nice and compact and then i just sharpened this whatever this is called and i just go in like that and we'll try to get eight pieces obviously towards the middle because it kind of bows out a little bit a little bit bigger so what i'll end up doing is going back and stealing a few pieces from some of the bigger pieces and then putting the smaller ones and we have eight so all we're going to do is we're just going to start rolling these out and we're going to get them nice and just kind of keep going over it and then we just want to roll it a little bit so we get a nice top and then we'll just place it right in there and we'll do the same thing for every single loaf i once thought hey just open a bakery there's no way i can do that i give those guys tons of credit they are very good at what they do okay everybody uh we've had the second uh part of the rising 90 minutes all of our uh dough has risen as you can see nicely done so now we've heated the oven to 370. these are going to go in the oven we i can cook four of them at a time so we'll just throw them in here at 370 for 35 minutes just like that and we're off to the races and we will get that batch done in 35 minutes and we'll throw in the second batch and we'll come back with all of those welcome back the final segment of cooking with ricardi the bread version we are we've hit our time limit of 35 minutes i'm just gonna pull out these loaves of bread don't they smell good mr laird they do and look at them they're like the perfect color yes absolutely now i will say this my cousin likes to cook these at 375 i cook them just a little less at 370. and i think that five degrees makes all the world of difference some might you know argue against that but i think 375 was just a little um they were just a little overdone and a bit dry for my liking so that's why i cut back on the temperature so that it was a little bit more moist in the center so here are our first four loaves and what we're gonna do is you know i need another 35 minutes on the second batch and what i'll do is when my second batch is at about 15 minutes left what i'll do is i'll let these cool in here i don't want to take them out yet i'll just let them cool down for 20 minutes then i'll take them out and put them on the rack and let them cool um and then we'll probably bag them up after about 90 minutes after they've completely cooled down because what you don't want to do is put them in bags and they're still cooling down and then you get condensation in the bags they get soggy so you really want to make sure that the bread is completely cooled down outside of that you'll get out of a 10 pound bag eight loaves so that's your yield and the total cost to make this batch besides the five to five and a half hours that it takes it you're really looking at about five or six bucks but i would say this ladies and gentlemen this is uh it's a labor of love it's something that everybody should learn how to do and there's a certain satisfaction that comes with making breath what i will do is i'll make sure that we get um the recipe online so that if anybody's interested in trying this you know feel free if you want to reach out through email feel free to do that as well i hope everybody enjoyed this episode of cooking with ricardi and hopefully we can make it to the next one thanks so much", "McyyS1F183k": "hey guys what's up welcome to my channel welcome back to my channel today I'm going to be doing a review on this CBD pre-roll joint vegan on my name's Robin change get you changed big buddy range no we're not the same I found my

cush and it is to see your city rose to free Rose that our CBD and it says in the comment you suck you how they think how they say later on there and at the bottom it says organic cannabis flower so we got to see what secret nature's all about I've never tried them before or anything they actually are from Rogue Valley Oregon hmm so if I ever go to Oregon if I like I might have to go and check this out but this is what it looks like and then it just has a little tube this is so cute like you can keep your ashes in here if you want you can keep your yeah joints whatever you smoke but it is

high that's really how you got to do it anyway like in order to find what you really want and check out new people in trying to shake you just gotta try shape but make sure it is the lab tested okay even if there's not and you just want to try it give it a try because I still do the [ __ ] but I try to make sure that I do see lab tested somewhere on their website just because you just don't want

and love say hi you guys [Music]", "Dz9r3vNRxPA": "hi everyone is Helen here finally today I'm making the Vietnamese baguette is commonly in Vietnamese this is one of the best things that the Vietnamese learn from the French during the colonial period the Vietnamese family is a lot more airy and has thin across than Western market is shutter super light with golden crackly crust with pretty hollow Center it takes a lot of hard work and experience to make the perfect law for bun Lee at a local production in Vietnam our ingredients are well mixed in a processor then they let the dough rest and divided into equal portions after that they shape the buckets proof them one more time make sashes and then bake them in the oven you can check out my sister's channel then i Cozine to see the whole video about the local production in Vietnam and we also put the links in the description box below the video I've been working on this recipes for the longest period of time and I've attached this over and over for more than there's no secret in this recipe you only just need flour yeast water and salt just like any other cutter breath the ratio of flour and water might vary depending on where you live for example if you live in a warm place and with high humidity you might want to reduce the water amount a little bit but the technique is really important and you have to follow exactly the steps it's not an representing the same at the market that you can buy in Vietnam but I think is quite close we may say 80 85 percent and I'm not an expert in baking or making brass in general but I really try really hard and I hope that you're gonna be contented with the results so let's begin [Music] you will need to recite a gram of all-purpose flour it equals to two cups if you are to measure by loosely powering the flour into the cups in a large mixing bowl add in three quarter cups or 180 ml of lukewarm water and sprinkle one 1/2 teaspoon of active dry yeast over the surface you can also add in about one tablespoon of sugar to easy activate the yeast then stir well to get everything well dissolved after that add half of the flour into the mixture and stir well you will get a thick mixture like pancake batter is called sponge cover with a piece of plastic wrap or a towel and keep it in a warm place for around two to three hours or overnight until you see bubbles appear all over the surface like this now we're going to add in the rest of the flour together with a teaspoon absorbs and stir with a wooden spoon to come by everything together all right so when it's roughly comes together and become less sticky transferred to a lightly floured working surface and lit well until is come together into a job first you want to knead by folding method after that you fold and push it away from you this helps the gluten in the dough to develop try not pushing too hard to avoid tearing the door and you knead the dough you will notice that is transformed into something much smoother and more elastic if you're getting tired during the process just switch them between two hands like this is the really good exercise here the down arrow has become a soft smooth and elastic core which is really nice to touch of course it's gonna be a lot more convenient with a mixer but kneading by hand also fun sometimes after kneading for 10 minutes I gather the dough and finish the edges together and form it into a nice ball like this the surface is as smooth as a baby's bottom place the dough back to the mixing bowl cover with the kitchen towel and keep it in a warm place for about an hour until it's doubled in size if you're living in a cold place just put it in the oven which is the lights on and maybe a tray of hot water underneath after an hour my dough has rising doubles in size carefully remove the dough and transfer it onto a working surface with there are kneading or deflating the air inside divide it all into three equal portions each portion should wait around under 30 gram you can see that the upper part is kind of dry but the inside is still very moist and soft now we're going to form each portion into a ball by stacking the dry surface outside into the center like this just trick the inside out pinch the edges together and form it into a nice ball then cover with the kitchen tower and let the door relax for 10 minutes now take out one piece of door banging three times on the counter use the rest of your hand to flatten it out roll it and pink the edges together play ball hands on top of the dough and roll it back and forth on the counter apply more pressure on your baby finger and less pressure on your thumb that way you can form a bucket that is broader in the middle and slimmer at both ends now place the doll on a piece of parchment paper and cover let it rest for one more hour until it's doubled in size now preheat the oven and the baking tray at least 15 minutes before baking next we're gonna make slashes on the bucket I'm using a paper cut knife but you can also you a razor blade give you an eye at a 45\u00b0 angle and make a quick and determined / a long side of the bucket if you see windows like this that means I need to Schloss Wester slashing is an art and even a professional Baker mix many years to perfect that skill so it's really texts and practice after reheating in the oven check out the hot tray and lift up the parchment paper to transfer the buckets onto the tray the oven is now will be heated as you can see I place a tray of hot water underneath I also spray water on the both sides of the oven and on to the buckets themselves after baking for eight minutes I spray water on the markets one more time and rotate the tray or the parchment paper so that the buckets are proud evenly after 20 minutes baking in the oven these are our final products not bad huh let the bucket Kunda a little on a rack and you might be able to hear the crackling cells from the crust it's very important that you preheat the oven and the baking tray really well before baking so it can rust the bucket open through the slashes it should be easy to press it and you can feel that it's really hollow inside the crust should have many cracks on it and I should have a flip it over to brown the bottom part a little more the money is really standardized in Vietnam and all the markets you can buy anywhere and it's trick cutters are just the same and I didn't really appreciate it that much until I went abroad and started YouTube and you got accosted me to make fun way which comes really as a surprise to me because you know why was someone make packet at home you can just go to the store and buy one of those for a really low price for example this is the small food cart selling magnetic nu which is report baguette sandwich on the street in denim you can smell the curry apart from far far away and when I saw them on the street I just couldn't resist for the feelings she put in some sweet chili sauce mayonnaise party some fresh herbs cucumber a lot of Korea Pok and even more puff floss and all of that is selling for just $10,000 which is like only 50 cents us I know that's why I hardly any Vietnamese my bun me or buckets at home firstly because we normally don't hand mixer or oven at home and secondly is so easy and inexpensive just to go to any street corner and trap one and this is my special version of Vietnamese sandwich is one made ugly I have a video showing how to make other item for this sandwich you can click on the picture to go to the video recipe or follow the links in the description box below given the fact that I didn't use any special equipments or ingredients no mixer no baking stone or no bucket loaf pan no special flour everything will mix by hand from scratch I'm pretty proud of myself for this result and you know what even you are paying me 10 or 20 euros for this sandwich I'm not gonna sell it gee I hope you're gonna give this recipe a try

colleagues welcome to the first in our series of webinars that we have jointly created with the moody rabbit report in light of the continued global crisis and the effects on travel retail we at apra felt it was even more important to maintain a dialogue share ideas and face challenges together all in line with apra's mission to nurture strengthen and protect our industry there will be pivotal points during our industry recovery which will challenge us to change the way we work the way we trade and the way we devise new solutions bringing members together is important and despite the current status quo asia pacific remains the undisputed engine of the global travel retail industry we wanted to set up a platform to discuss progress to challenge ideas and to learn from innovation that has taken place of recent events for today's opening address we have invited our members from changi airport group and i would like to welcome ms lim beckham the executive vice president who will share changi's perspective on emerging stronger together a message of reflection and moving forward which we can all benefit from thank you very much for attending today's session and i would now like to hand over to christina oliver who's the executive director of aptra thank you over to you christina thanks sunil thanks so much everyone for attending today we've got a global audience in different time zones we're really grateful for your time so a little bit about atra aptra is the regional association representing travel retail the only association that brings together the trinity under one so our members consist of airports retailers and brands and other associations our work has a strong focus on advocacy which has been absolutely vital during this crisis launching no less than seven region-wide campaigns across asia pacific we've been advocating for financial support relief measures advocating to be recognized as essential services under aviation appealing with aviation authorities to be part of the ecosystem we've reached out to iko on a regional level to suggest the retail operating standards when borders do open up and we've appealed for harmonized travel protocols to eliminate the need for quarantine when the use of testing can be done we've also had a joint campaign with our colleagues across aci pata and iata to strengthen the region's voice so our advocacy work is continuous and this is an addition to all of the work that we do in country specific regulatory needs but we also work across knowledge and networking and that was the main motivation to create the asia-pacific dialogue webinar series with our partners the moody davit report so it was important for us to look at thought-provoking content things that encourage a discussion encourage the debate and to really add value in this pivotal time so today we've got an exciting new launch of a new trinity white paper which the team will take you through today and after members can access these reports and many others on the actual knowledge bank if you have any questions regarding aptra regarding the work that we do across asia pacific or regarding any membership queries please do not hesitate to contact us the asia pacific dialogue is in association with the moody devon report and i will now hand you back over to mr martin moody who will take you through today's session thank you thanks very much christina okay well let's let's get down to business today's session is split into two main parts and we're going to start by turning to one of the great airports in the asia pacific region and indeed the world and that is singapore changi airport now like so many of its counterparts around the world changi has been hit terribly hard by the covert 19 pandemic changi airport passenger traffic dropped by almost 83 year-on-year in 2020 to just 11.8 million and at one point during what were known as the circuit breaker months of april and may traffic was off by 99.5 they're almost impossible numbers um to hear and but they were true very true clearly that kind of traffic collapse had drastic and alarming repercussions for changi airport groups retail and other commercial revenue services so how did changi apple group respond well to answer that question and to provide what i think is a very useful contact for the discussion that will follow on the trinity white paper we're delighted to present a short film from certainly one of the most respected figures in our industry and that's the executive vice president commercial at changi airport group ms lim play the film please now [Music] dear friends and partners from the industry it's my pleasure to give the opening address for today's inaugural aptra apec dialogue webinar held in association with the moody david report it's been just over a year since the global covet 19 pandemic started and the impact of covet 19 still weighs on singapore and countries around the world the economic and social disruption caused by the pandemic has been devastating air travel everywhere has plunged particularly here in changi because we have no domestic air traffic we witnessed an unprecedented 99 drop in our packs traffic during the initial period and with few travelers enhanced meters and creators footfall at our landsat shops and at juvochangi airport was badly affected despite these challenges we at changi have always understood our mission to connect singapore to the world and the world to singapore changi has to remain open to facilitate travel for those trying to go home to be with their loved ones to support cargo flows to and from singapore especially for essential goods like ppes and masks and now the safe transportation and efficient distribution of coveted 19 vaccines so how have we at cag been responding to the covid crisis as the operator of an important air hub we had to ensure that changi can remain open and to also operate sustainably this meant scaling down our operations to optimize resources and to better match the drop in passenger traffic and flight operations and so we made the painful decision to temporarily stop operations in two of our four terminals and to consolidate our operations in the remaining two this allowed cag our airlines and aviation partners as well as our concession partners to consolidate their business operations save on running costs and to operate more sustainably beyond that immediate response we also quickly realized that with covet demand for air travel was being determined primarily by the cross-border travel controls and policies implemented by the different states and this was in turn shaped by the epidemiological situation in the respective states such as the rates of covate infection and the rates of vaccination these awase the risk appetite of the different states as such for cag to play a strategic role in the recovery of air travel in singapore we need to actively participate in and shape the formulation of cross-border travel policies at the national level and to that end we have been proactively participating in various national committees and providing our inputs and support to both the ministries of health and of transport in singapore for example cag is part of the national emerging stronger task force this task force developed and trialled its first prototype for safe trade shows and exhibitions the first of which was held in november last year at apec's first international travel trade show travel revive this was attended by over 1 000 local and international participants who took part in the safe bubble wrapped program changi was also part of a consortium which developed a specially built hotel cam business center called connected changi which recently opened in february this year this facility was specially designed to allow business travelers from around the world to stay and safely conduct face-to-face meetings in singapore without the need to serve quarantine on arrival these efforts will help singapore to resume international business meetings and speed up the recovery of our mice and hospitality sectors another important consideration we had was to ensure that changi is covet safe and the health of our travelers airport workers and visitors is safeguarded apart from implementing a stepped-up cleaning and disinfection program within the terminals and also at duo our airport facilities have also been upgraded to offer more contactless processing from checking in to immigration to the trialling of uvc light for this infection all aiming to give our staff and travelers alike greater peace of mind we also set up on-site facilities to support swabbing for up to 10 000 passengers a day and this is supplemented by a dedicated kovit 19 testing lab at the airport itself the singapore government has also prioritized vaccination for the airport community to facilitate not just the reopening of borders but more importantly to safeguard the airport community following the suspension of operations in t4 changi converted the terminal into a kovit 19 vaccination center to support singapore's vaccination efforts to date over 22 000 members of the airport community including over 80 percent of our frontline staff from our shops and restaurants have received their first dose of the vaccine we expect the numbers to increase as more come forward with adequate testing capacity and an increasing percentage of our local population receiving their vaccinations we will be in a better place to positively influence our health and border control policies and work towards the reopening of the changi hub it's been obvious to us from the onset that changi's survival and success alone is not sufficient as just one party in the aviation ecosystem the survival and success of the changi air hub depends on the survival and success of all our partners and we are resolved to support and work with them to ride out the storm together one of the first impact of covet and the plunge in business was the intense pressure to cut costs and re-change staff one of our earliest priorities therefore was to protect and save as many jobs as possible we lobbied the government to ensure that our travel retail partners are treated as part of the aviation industry which has been disproportionately impacted and would hence qualify for enhanced job assistance games and grants at the same time we also worked with the relevant government agencies to help our tenants in retraining and upskilling of their workforce and providing them with absentee payroll support and also in job matching and job placement cag has also been supporting our retailers and partners with additional rebates and waivers on charges and rentals beyond that offered by the singapore government more importantly we have been partnering our tenants to grow sales with our pax traffic decimated we have been forced to rethink many issues including who our customers really are pre-coveted changing used to serve 68 million passengers annually but now we have no more passengers but does this mean that we have no more customers to serve that was our old mindset but we quickly realized that our customers are still our customers they are just stuck at home unable to fly due to the travel restrictions but we should still continue to engage them and to serve them and with this mindset shift we have been pivoting our business strategy towards better serving this non-traveling market with the support of our retailers for example our e-commerce portal i shop changi we quickly switched its focus from being one that's a largely buy and fly business model to become a non-traveler marketplace that actively targets the local residents in singapore with the support of our retailers we now offer all singapore residents tax absorbed home delivered shopping without the need to fly shoppers who are non-travelers now contribute over 97 of ishop's chinese sales which has been growing beyond pre-copied levels and still continues to grow we've also transformed our fmb business with the launch of our very own food delivery service changi eats this allows our fmb operators to expand their market catchment island bite and grow their business beyond chinese airport we have also curated many other initiatives to drive footfall to the airport this has included running airside shopping tours for specially invited guests from our changi reports program and from key partners as well as special tasting and buying events we're specially invited guests are able to buy tax and duty paid wines and spirits at special prices another notable campaign was our christmas event the changi festive village where changi transformed into a one-stop entertainment hub for the whole family offering everything from glamping under the stars night go cutting to a fun snow house for many singapore residents changi holds a special place in their hearts and we hope that these activities not only show changi's resilience even in our darkest moments but also bring some joy and delight and some semblance of a return to normalcy for our fellow singaporeans in the midst of this pandemic changi remains committed to making the necessary investments needed to emerge stronger from this crisis for example we are plowing a hit with our terminal 2 expansion project which will increase our overall handling capacity and enhance the airport experience besides our physical infrastructure cag is also investing in our people and building our tech and digital capabilities now the airport traditionally offers mostly a physical or offline experience to our customers but we are making use of this lul to build new digital products that will allow our customers to engage with us digitally and to offer a truly omni-channel experience for example last year we introduced new features to our ichangi app that will allow our customers to book activities and events like those that we organized in christmas to redeem shopping promotions and premiums and even parking promotions all done digitally of course and as part of our covet safe travel initiatives the app also allows the booking of slots for check-in and also departure security screening and we will be further revamping the app this year to include even more new features and services including the introduction of changi's own e-wallet changi pay which will offer contactless payment both online and offline at the airport in closing 2020 is over but we are still in the middle of the pandemic nonetheless we remain deeply hopeful we believe that the human desire for face-to-face connections and the thirst for wonderlast remains strong and the demand for air travel will return with the roll out of cobit 19 vaccines around the world things will get better in the meantime we must remain resilient and agile to change whether it be in new ways or working with our customers new ways of working with our partners or new ways of experiencing the airport we believe that with this mindset and by working closely with our partners in the trinity retailers and brands like yourselves we can and will emerge stronger from this crisis thank you all very much well there you have it an almost definitive case study isn't it of an airport that plays a role of critical national national importance bearing catastrophe in the face actually using a word like survival to underline the challenge it is faced think about that for a moment and changi as we know is not alone but i think it is a fine example of an airport group that pivoted used one of those buzzwords of 2020 to come up with different ways of doing things while continuing to play the core operational role that the country needs it to and which can never be allowed to fail so thank you and all the great team at changi airport group for putting together a film and a message that i think managed to be both realistic and uplifting at the same time and that i can tell you is not an easy troubled world so that film has provided the perfect segue i think to our main subject today let me introduce them last year as covert really started fight all around the world and i guess around about a year today it started to be felt far in here from where it began um marrow anastasia partner of bain and company italy and jack mcgowan director at castle consulting in ireland also well known to many of you of course as an eminent ceo of international earlier in his career the two gentlemen collaborated on an important paper they a series of private discussions with industry stakeholders for something called the trinity initiative and some public discussions via a series of webinars that we ran last year and the purpose of those was to evaluate and to wayfind if you like the future consumer commercial and contractual nature of the airport retail sector and those discussions have culminated in a white paper which will be published after today's event now like all such documents in fact like just about anything during covert any findings are constantly having to be tweaked in light of a constantly changing sometimes bewildering set of circumstances so marrow and jack today are going to lead us through their latest research projections and conclusions and then we're going to be joined by an esteemed panel for their thoughts on marrows and jack's work and their observations on the state of the nation if you like from their company's perspective um we'll also be taking questions from you via the live chat button you'll see it down there you've probably all well used to in this zoom world that we live in um feel free to make observations ask questions we'll try and get through as many of them as possible we've got some questions already sent in earlier and some i know it's just starting to appear now i'm going to introduce our panelists very briefly as as time is of the essence but it's a fantastic panel and a really broad cross-section of interest we're joined by doug bagley the managing director asia pacific or william grant and sons and doug of course heads up uh the independent distillers travel retail interests as well dan cabell known to so many of you as a walking talking trinity man he's worked for supplier airport and retailer he's currently the chief commercial officer of ontario international airport authority in the states lucy thomas from my country down in new zealand she's the head of retail at auckland airport and i have to say no doubt a very happy lucy thomas after the kiwis retained the america's cup today against the italian channel challenges so i'm sorry apart from maro who i will introduce in a moment uh who is italian to any of our other italian listeners on this call for the joy that is showing on lucy and my respective faces they're joined by dag rasmussen of course well known to you all ceo of lagadir travel retail one of the industry giant's interests right across the board from duty-free to specialist retail to convenience to food and beverage and once again sydney tully who i've introduced earlier the actual president and group ceo of king power group here in hong kong so there are panelists i will be facilitating the discussion alongside my business partner david president of the moody uh the moody david report he's coming to us all the way from galway in ireland and of course it's another important day in the world it's it's st patrick's day so happy st patrick's day to you derma and jack mcgowan in particular and any of our irish friends and i know there are a lot listening to this around the world so with the pleasantries over and no further ado it's my pleasure to welcome maro anastasi and jack mcgowan mauro would you put up the first chart please just loading mauro's presentation and here we here we go so lest we forget where what we what we used to do in our industry we used to work in this is a uh it's not showing correctly on my chart at the moment but lest we forget what we came from where we came from this chart we put up last year it hasn't changed um and it it just shows that this was the most attractive fast-growing retail channel the channel that was probably the most exciting and fast-growing channel in the world and its very strength has um shown in how it has responded to this crisis if you contrast it with uh for example um uk retail where we've had a number of very high casualties you can see how strong the industry was and that eight percent kaggar is very very hard to replicate in any other industry and channel that being said we had seen and noticed a declining pass passenger average spend and you know that's probably to be expected with that sort of top-line growth but we were starting to see new consumers having more influence uh coming in with different attitudes and brand choices and preferences and it seems uh a long time ago since we had this this issue i i believe it's still there but it's it's good just to remember before we go into the charts which uh mauro is going to carry on that the core benefits of the travel retail business are still very much there there's a deep need to connect to explore to travel there's the excitement of getting on a journey the wow when you walk into a great airport shop and those uh those excitements those feelings they're not gone away and it is only a matter of time before we get back to doing what no other channel and no other retail can do which is to deliver an emotional shopping experience which is based on value service and exclusive exclusivity so i think it's worth pondering there where we were and now i'll hand over to marrow to take us through uh much of the much of the analysis that we've done thank you jack so maybe go through a few of the slides that we already used and discussed in similar meetings uh last year and then we we go into some additional parts of of the work that jack and myself has as as it's done again this was this comes from uh from last year uh and i would like to start i mean normally you start with these webinars starting from traffic evolution and traffic forecast let's start from the other part that is passenger behaviors and passenger profiles i mean some relatively obvious numbers but i guess what is not fully considered in the industry until now is really what this would mean in terms of change on what we uh what our passengers will buy and how they would buy the new generations will be they are they wear before cavite less than 30 percent of the volume we project they will be far more than 50 percent for with two for two reasons one is obviously demographic change but the one the other big one is the significant shift and the average age of the people that we move and we and we travel especially intercontinental and long term we know these people want luxury won't travel retail but they want different things they want experienced products and not standard typical personal products for example uh another obvious thing we believe more than 30 percent of the sales in travel retail in airport specifically will be directly influenced by online meaning there will be an explicit benchmark with an online website being it alibaba amazon or any other before the decision to buy in the airport uh this is today sorry before coffee that was in our estimations less than 10 percent obviously everybody's connecting everybody as a mobile phone but not everybody absolutely absolutely not everybody was benchmarking directly the specific sku uh they were going to buy or something similar in case of of travel or travel exclusives uh with the fundamental uh force trial of being that that the w of e-commerce where the world has gone through this percentage is going is going to increase when when real travel will start uh very quickly gaining a few years versus the past projections that were probably more linear share of white spenders this means uh some high spenders nationalities i believe chinese is the first one and the other big thing travel organized travel groups both of these are going in our projection to reduce significantly and we all know why these people are the this type of travelers are the fundamental engine of our industry last one again very i guess obvious is share of chinese specifically chinese luxury shopping within china it used to be less than one third something around 30 percent pre-copied in 2019 we project it we it will remain at more than 50 percent uh even postcard in 2025 and onwards and that's what it will continue to to grow what that means it means that that 20 plus of chinese luxury shopping will move from travel retail uh to mainland china uh visibly as implication from rent for brains but there's much more implications obviously for airports and for uh travel retailers and this is a mega trend that will continue uh forever let's say so we're not saying travel retail will not continue actually we believe as jack was saying this this industry has a fantastic future in front of it but there will be difference in what we sell and how we sell different categories different products different brands different store mix some numbers this is a super uh let's say condensed summary of research and the forecasting uh tool we have that is by airport by terminal uh because we all know that i mean regional or global averages are kind of meaningless we just put a global average to share the logic of all these so we see travel retain going back to 19 figures uh by 2025 most probably 20 30 and the part of it being actually on my channel meaning both at least order online or maybe even both online these as we know depends on the regulation uh that that is regional and we heard changi airport talk about this so forget our message is let's forget the eight percent growth that jack was showing for almost forever or for the foreseeable future meaning until 2030. obviously since we all know the dynamics of retail and retail store these will have impacts on ebitda so a btb stores fba before ends where we see a significant issue of the 2021 hour i mean this year but it complains a compressed ebitda even in 2022 and 2023 so the cash generation of stores uh in traveling today in airport retail will be significantly uh compressed at least for the next three plus years clearly this will be highly dependent on how many stores we will open slash remain closed during these years there is an hypothesis behind that uh that will change probably so i mean these numbers might change in the actuals but unfortunately we believe the high level range will remain so forget the cast generation from the business that we were used to until recovered for again the foreseeable future and this will have implications also on the investment envelope and we will discuss it later so last slide from what we discussed last year um what do we propose and some of these is provocative but obviously we uh we we want to share how we the level of change we see in the industry we get dialogue from from the panel what is we all know that penetration of travel retail excluding food and beverage is extremely low and we all know why all airports selected the right brands and the right price points to maximize range per square meter that is a perfect rational choice until you have not enough space for your retail and you need to choose we believe there will be a lot of vacant space or low profitability space in the next five years today obviously especially outside outside asia that is restarting as we all know but if you look at europe and and and us things are kind of frozen with a lot of terminus closed and a lot of contracts kind of froze the moment business we sorry passengers we restart we will see we believe we will see a lot of space that will be either vacant or with very low profitability that means we should think at how to introduce different categories and the increased significance of the penetration towards especially gearing towards the new generations and the new way of shopping we were discussing before second is improve the knowledge of the consumer and that ended up quickly this especially talking to our air i mean the airport's part of the trinity airports are naturally a relatively long-term uh player because at the end they are sophisticated real estate players and real estate is a long time uh a long term plan the problem is what will happen to the consumer how the consumer will start shopping and we react to the the to the postcode it's simply unknown nobody knows uh everybody of us including uh including us and being have views but the reality is nobody knows for sure and we there is no way to know so the way and the and the speed of change and adaptability we need to have to make sure we understand how the consumer is evolving and we respond is fundamental we need to be in our view much quicker than pre-copy and probably has huge implications on how we draft our contracts how we plan our investment uh and how we constantly adapt and change uh to that and only it's very difficult to do it with the traditional way of working of travel retail that is that that sees long-term let's say static agreements and space allocation the other thing is what we call data-driven commercial strategy meaning using all the huge data that is in trouble not only for travel retailers but only for the whole from the whole trinity uh plus online travel agencies airlines etc how can we use all this data to a sophisticated dynamic pricing that for example is the fundamental is a fundamental element to respond to the e-commerce price benchmark how can we optimize uh assortment through that how can we optimize promotion planning a fundamental element of our business through our division intelligence how we can optimize retail buying so the relationship between brands and retailers through data this is something that i mean if i would say something like that to downtown retailers anywhere in the world the answer would be thanks mauro we all know this we all do this so yeah you are right but that's all news from our discussions and and work uh between jack and myself we travel retailers for many of them i'm not saying everybody obviously that's still something to be invested in and to be done uh crn again many players in the industry have invested and they've done fantastic work on crm we believe there is still a lot of work to do in really leveraging crm at least for the part of the passengers that are that probably have a relatively high frequency uh again compared to what happens to retail downtown there is a huge gap uh that we need to to to to to feed um omnichannel we heard changi talk probably half of their uh of the of the theme about omnichannel uh somebody from the industry with which i talked two weeks ago talking about omni channel and also pax sorry brands mix he said mauro many people's copy this industry will start to do what customer wants now i think this is right a bit extreme i believe this industry has done what customers or passengers wanted but i i share let's say the message even if again maybe the the the way it was uh declared was a bit extreme uh omnichannel is there in the world we it will be there uh in travel retail i've heard in the last 10 years pre-copy many players say yeah yeah okay omni-channel we know we all know that but we you know we have different we have travel retail yes we are different but we strongly believe that thing will arrive and we obviously know a lot of players are investing significantly and last thing obviously i mentioned it through some of these other points all this means reading contract structure and we are not saying renegotiate reduce the rents increase the rents reduce the mark increase the mark that's only down to the negotiation i mean among the trinity players here we are saying really we think how the contract can best serve the other point we discussed and as we said again last time this is really the first the last slide from the previous point from the previous webinar this requires a lot of different topics this is a slide this is an actual example from a downtown retailer that has done in the last five years a significant shift to omnichannel and is now considered one of the global leaders in amnesia uh look at what they did they basically reduced by more than half the topics in stores to renew stores to make new stores etc and they've actually increasedly significantly the omni channel related topic that is of the it's digitally doubling supply chains these are true numbers from again a downtown a relevant large downtown retailer that's something we that will have we believe we will have it will happen in travel retail obviously we need to manage the the black part because we all know what it means and why we need significant capex investment in travel retail in physical stores to activate fame we all know that but we will need to make space for them for the red part what what do we we believe is changed from when we had the last webinar pre-christmas to now well the first thing is that we we have monthly as bain we have monthly reviews of our bottom up uh forecast mode packs forecast model that is by by old globally this is again a study that says basically we believe we have lost one year so versus the previous projections we see one year of additional uh time to get back to 2019 data in our base case then as you can see there are better cases i believe that we all hope they will realize and uh worst cases maybe the the most important the let me keep that and get to this a bit later to me the other thing is very fundamental is uh the the word from a travel from from a knife travel perspective is looking much more unequal asia is clearly extremely advanced in intra-regional travel meaning everything within asia being domestic or international we believe next year asia will be already above 2019. if you look at india uh if you look at china if you look at many other countries uh domestic travel is already very significantly close to 2019 and it's continuing to increase that's a fantastic news obviously next come north america intra-regional where the situation is only dire but we see significant progress and we believe in the 2024 beginning of 2025 they might be right back to where they used to be 2018 and restart the growth problem the big problem comes with europe if you let's start from europe intra region and we have a very if you want negative projection here where we don't see europe getting the enter original getting back online to 2019 before 2026. why because we see a relatively fast recovery until 2024 2023 2024 and then there will be a gap that will remain kind of forever because of structural change especially in terms of business travel so the recovery will be relatively quick we will get to probably 80 percent of what we will get uh of versus 2019 and then we will just restart growth from a lower level uh knowing the doubly pace of growth in europe will be always be lower versus the other macro regions because of macroeconomic uh elements the real issue for travel retail is that this will impact dramatically long goal well where europe is clearly a fundamental element so yes packs are relevant but as we all know for our industry quality of packs is much more relevant and we see the the high quality packs that is obviously the long haul uh coming back only in 2025-2026 last element is uh sdc share again this has always been depend by macro region but we see a dramatic increase of lcc share uh across the regions especially europe and and us but a lot also for for asia that will have significant impacts especially for airports and we'll get into that but before getting into that maybe a war from jack on the vaccine element that probably will be a fundamental part of this projection so it is uh i suppose to go back to the famous phrase we trust you mr gorbachev but we will verify as well that trust but verify comment was made several times by ronald reagan and i think every american thought he was putting it to them that they're going to check whether or not they're de-escalating their nuclear arsenal what many very few people know is that he was quoting vladimir lenin when doing so and today the countries that are accepting visitors from other countries are adopting the same and need to adopt the same approach we trust you but we want to verify and this covered digital passport project which has been championed by the eu and in fact they already have a draft law out is absolutely fundamental to the recovery and indeed if it doesn't happen for whatever reason then it would mean that our uh past our our relatively um long recovery would be even longer um so i i think look in i'm not going to um go into the detail of vaccine passports um john hume or somebody from hume brophy would be probably better equipped to do that and indeed we could do it at a later stage if it was required but just to say that iko have a set of guidelines i think they're published and they are going to go a long way towards building agreement across the global countries as to what passport digital passport standards will be and in the eu the draft law has already been published um and the structure of the eu is obviously helping speed up that agreement and implementation and the issue i suppose is not yet clear whether the passport will be implemented before or after a vaccine rollout and that is still not agreed by a number of countries so i'll pass back to you marrow yeah i guess the the the the final point here is the vaccine passport might be relevant frankly at least i don't have a clear view on that yet for sure it will be a meter element so we don't see vaccine passport real impact international travel for sure in 21 to 2021 and for sure in 2022 so great something to i mean keep in the radar but probably not for the next uh i mean for the foreseeable future for the next couple of years let's back get back to airports um so what you see here is pre-copy this is these are average ac aci data on a again average airport pnn structure as we all know every and the differences are fundamental by type by tier by macro region etc what will happen host copy well the first thing we believe is the reduction of international travel and the higher share of low cost will have an impact on aviation revenue those revenues will go down again for those two level levers and we all know that that these two levers will reduce obstacles unit revenues and and dark arrangements but we would like to have this and we believe we can have the same maybe tba because you still need to do to finance capex you still need to repay long-term debt as a real estate etc where these leaves airports where it leaves them to increase non-aviation and real estate so everything that is not pure aviation revenues and it leads them to reduce operating costs and this is very different i mean can be can be seen as small numbers but it's a huge difference in terms of what how an airport should think about and these are real numbers from various work we have done with real airports that have understood that need to go from the pre-copy to the post-cover picture and again let me position for a second many airports are kind of saying and seeing this as a negative element now many airports to which i talk to when you tell them you will have less long goal and more low cost they kind of tell see you and say you are telling me i'm a bad person i'm not saying that you are a bad person i'm just saying that you have a different visa model and make the same money so it's not bad it's just different but the result of that is that nowhere in the last uh i don't know thousands of years and non-aviation revenues being so fundamental for airports because again in the in the total evaluation goes down we need to compensate and the only way to compensate is the rest that is mostly non-aviation plus real estate so what what an airport should do uh and i go fast on everything except probably the the new navigation part that is more relevant to what we are discussing here on aviation revenues we believe there is there will be the need for a really differentiation strategy versus let's say competing airport this is something that has never been considered normally airport don't think in terms of competing having competitors they think about being a local monopoly infrastructure to serve the community that is absolutely truthful but especially in some areas we are starting and especially for part of the intercontinental sorry of the longer business compete aim for part of the local business competition will be a fundamental element think about middle east think about london in six airports and then double aggressive and planned avo marketing to to really bring fundamental partnership with relevant airlines with the relevant islands that will grow in the future that is not all airlines actually it's very it's a relatively low share of the existing island of the current existing airlines that will do the the buy from the growth let's talk about non-aviation as we said we believe we need to redesign retail footprint to increase penetration it's not the same stores not hundred percent of it so not everything will be wrong but the overall footprint needs to be updated and reviewed uh knowing that we need to work with the low capex envelope focus on strategic control on omnichannel crm and digital real estate what means strategic control in our viewing means that you don't need to do everything yourself as an airport but you will need to maintain the strategic control you need to maintain the ability to make the decisions why because this is digital real estate it's exactly your real estate it's just digital but it's exactly the same and it's your stuff it's your core uh property and core asset that you need to leverage of the parking and then we go through very quickly obviously you have issues on real estate especially linked to e-commerce cargo and logistics uh and you have an issue of service model and and cost structure that i would maybe skip even we're hopefully focused on traveling so that's what we need to do from an airport point of view where are we well again let's start from airports we need to manage and all of you are managing reopening balancing customer service and all the losses and operational issues we heard and we all know changi having close to terminals um you are all actively managing concessioners that means again it's not the seven year old contract that is there and we let me say just need to manage it uh we need to manage open enclosures mag liabilities renegotiations obviously of existing transnationals etc more importantly we need to listen test and learn and i believe again for many efforts i don't want to generalize but there is a significant step to be done in how do we understand the consumer and how we redirect these into our optimized uh space relocation and again we don't see a seven years or even a three-year cycle here it needs to be quicker uh because the precision of the forecast is much lower given where we are we need to build new retail capabilities many airports again not all obviously but they need to step up in everything digital or omnichannel and in some categories that maybe were not the focus before uh but but need to be the focus now i don't believe to to add to that on new generations of consumers of passengers that are great potential customers but again they are different and as we said as a result we need more flexibility into the planning cycles where does the middle east travel retailers no or wrong stock as a result of the full of the whole disruption very few new stores and a lot of capex very limited companies invested last year obviously and a lot of capex needed we are hearing travel retailers and networks saying yeah we need to restart the investment cycle except that we don't have capital we don't have money hopefully new passengers and lower spend power not today but the lower spend power but in the near future because of crisis this is especially obviously europe and u.s a lot of opportunities for consolidation we are hearing many travel retailers say we have clear plans to consolidate to do non-organic growth we have targets we know it's the right moment but obviously we want a bit of clarity before going ahead and different consumer behavior as we discussed already all again in a context where we lose money and there is no capex envelope for the next years or very little very lower than before the other element is how we we talked a lot about travel retailers and airports obviously let's talk one minute about the the third element of the treaties the brains well what are we hearing from the brands so let's see where the brands what the brands look how the brands look at the future first of all local versus tourists this is our projections bay into global projections but they are shared with most of the many brands across the world and i'm happy to share the full report after this discussion the local portion this is global the local portion of luxury goods market will grow from 50 percent to 70 percent and that's post coffee independent zero of coffee obviously will be it has been 80 percent obviously but even post covet this share will be extremely more relevant drilled by china but also by many other countries public tourist is not only travel retail is travel retail plus downtown in touristic destinations um second element where do i see the growth in my in my market as a brand well very simple answer online online online online travel retail we project we at best go back to the share it used to be 12 before copy seven percent of the total life remark so if you are a brand your priorities for the next decade are not really the same they are hyper localization and meaning maximizing the share of wallet you get from your local consumers and just go in a free free lockdown just go in milan paris or london and you see the huge shift in brands stores from targeting chinese or russians or others nationalities to targeting lockers and obviously online on the channel that is a fundamental complex challenge for all brands those are the let me say obvious priorities and i don't think i'm saying anything new but these are the obvious priorities for the brands travel retail will be on the radar but will be less the fundamental growth driver that used to be in the in the previous decade so last slide before uh leaving it back to martin and and and the rest of the participants we tried to put with jack some hard targets for the industry how did we create them basically to try to get back to model back the industry total revenues uh in 19 in 2023 so what should we do to get the 2010 revenues as an industry as a travel retail industry already in 2023 that we don't believe it's possible in the let's say with status quo and and and again this was uh i mean the elements are the same we just discussed we said let's let's think about getting the average penetration from the 10 percent 10 a bit more than 10 today to plus the to more than 30 percent average and again these numbers would have to be declined by by airport can we think at 40 plus of states tracked by crm somebody is already there some airports are already there but not not the global average can we say 90 percent plus of commercial decisions are backed up by big data analytics meaning assortment travel buying brands negotiation uh store fittings and then why i said 90 well amazon is 99 maybe we can be we can be at 90 percent cra we already said something similar can we imagine instead of the 10 percent we are projecting through for 20 30 can you imagine that we have 25 percent plus say it's true omnichannel that doesn't mean ecommerce obviously but means omnichannel meaning a combination of e-commerce and of the digital interaction and the physical interaction as we said retained contrast structure and re-purpose travel retail capex we said we saw an example of somebody that has now 70 plus percent of capital x2 digital and supply chain can we say 50 of that is dedicated to digital real estate that means we need to make fantastic physical stores without the campex last word is we believe that to do this we need to work with an enlarged ecosystem in simple words partnerships nobody or almost nobody can do that on its own because the capabilities are so new and so complex that there is no scale and no possibility to build them quickly internally but there is the potential of partnerships and i mean let me mention you have something that everybody knows we have seen that all we have also in the partnership between dufresne alibaba on omnichannel and on china obviously we have all seen the reaction of from the markets to that that was incredible for incredibly positive to me that's a sign so the market is saying the stock market and the investors are saying it's great to partner because we all need to understand that we cannot do all this alone independence of how how good we are i'll stop here and give it back to you with the world party thank you very much maro i'm getting quite a few questions um and i i made the same observation about your um the lower share held by luxury of uh travel retail going forward and then you you kind of went from there to saying so if you're a brand owner this could be the conclusion not not all brand owners of course are in the luxury space tomorrow that's a point that's been being made to me um and i i just get a very quick definition from you if i may have how do you define luxury so the the way we define luxury in all the numbers we have seen in this report is by price point so it's not a category definition is a price point definition so you have you have luxury across any category is just that it's the premium price point up yeah all right very good well look we've got comments coming in on the chat which is those three dots down to the right above the word more and you can add those in there you can direct them at panelists for everybody a question and answer you see the q a you can throw your comments in there we've already got a whole lot um now just in terms of time keeping this the the schedule allows us to go uh for another 54 minutes we were planning to wrap it up around the half hour but we i'm going to kind of arbitrarily make the decision if i may uh to take us through to the three-quarter hour uh to quarter two and then if the questions are still flowing in this interest we'll go to the end of the hour when we must leave the room so thanks maro thanks jack very stimulating and at times provocative i'm going to go straight to our panel and actually pick up the top line reaction a key take out from that it can be a point of disagreement or or or simply something that you felt was particularly salient um dan cappell could i start with you as i say you've won you've won the three hats in your career dancing you're you're a rare character in that you have seen the pressures of all the stakeholder groups what do you make of all that um first of all thank you mario jack some absolutely fantastic ideas coming up in that if i was going to pick one thing out that i'd really like to expand on was when you said building more flexibility into planning cycles and next contracts you talked about lower capex you talked about greater flexibility in contracts um if you go back 10 years the average contract was a three plus two year option the industry was up in arms it moved to five years it moved to five to seven years and in certain cases moved to ten years and the ten-year period validated the capital investment and obviously the amortization of that over the uh over the length of the contract um it's a little bit of a chicken and an egg as to how you actually resolve more flexible contracts with lower capex with shorter terms um i can understand some of the mindset as to why you want my why you may wish to do that but at the same time that that is a real challenge from from an operator perspective but also from an airport perspective all right thanks very much i'll come over to doug doug's from a brand perspective um key take out there yeah thanks man look i think there's a couple of things which really come from me in terms of really important prerequisites as we sort of come out of post code i think the first is i don't think we should underestimate the need to try and ensure that we provide a consistent approach to on safety for staff and passengers so that they'd get a some self-assurance that it's safe to travel and particularly its confidence to be able to shop at an airport without any question of a doubt the purely getting through customs is going to be more complicated more time consuming so the ability or the desire to shop i think is going to be significantly impacted i think as jack said one thing we need to try and ensure where possible that we can have this common approach to vaccine testing and confirming um covert test results so that we can try and get travelers at scale but i think trying to be a little bit provocative earlier on in the discussion i think one of the points that i saw on the charts from jack namara it was very much a call to action and very from the video as well a a phrase we need to rethink um there's been a an acceleration prior to covert in terms of travel retail or losing some relevance um you can see that in terms of pack growth succeeding some some of the category growths we've certainly seen an explosion of e-commerce growth over the covered period price is no longer a key different differentiator the gap between domestic and travel retailers closed significantly i think it's time for us to really come together and really rethink i think covert must be a catalyst for change action is desperately needed before so we don't just blindly walk into a transformed future and i'm sure we'll come back to it later on but i do think the way in which we address omnichannel and offer a more seamless shopping experience for the consumer lies at the heart of what we need to do yeah well well said duggan the point being made in the chat there by uh by peter jacobs and actually saying amaro and jack's hard targets are actually no different in context of what the industry has been saying past 20 years but the burning platform is more global and obvious or hope would never come so that's propelling change accelerating it loosely you no doubt agree with the move to omni channel because you're doing it you're doing it very very successfully but i'll ask you about that in a moment perhaps you take out from that session i think the biggest one is the relevance of travel retail so building on what doug was talking about um in the new zealand market is um a really good hotbed of seeing this happen to us the categories have shifted on the high street liquor tobago fragrance used to be called duty-free or you know tax-free duty-free they are now individual categories that the high street is evolving really quickly and so e-commerce or even high street operators are far more competitive than we've ever had to face before so the key challenge is defining what does travel retail mean and you know in a post-cover time that on steroids in terms of going what do we own that retail in the high street doesn't own and you talked about it before um in the introduction jack travel is exciting even if you're traveling for business granted not all the all the time there is something intrinsically exciting about travel and travel retail so we can own that space but we've got to do some serious work as a trinity to think about what we're bringing to each of um those experiences and i think there's some work to be done and what a brand thinks that is what an airport thinks it is and what the retailer thinks it is never mind what the customer thinks it is all right eugene barry at dubai international airport has an acronym for the for the dynamic you just mentioned it's wacd what amazon cannot do and that's the challenge i i guess for the airports to embrace that acronym tag um over to you and as i said you bring this multi uh multi-pronged uh platform of food and beverage convenience news and books and duty-free so i suppose it's hard to ask you for a a general view because those sectors those sub-sectors may well vary in their prospects but um how did you read all that wearing your overall group hat so well i definitely agree with the conclusions uh which uh what we need is real partnership data sharing having airport being frontline on crm and so on i do see crab retail as the ultimate uh brick and mortar proposition i mean we have the best customers uh best customers in the world we don't have to take them uh saturday afternoon to come to contrast they just they are there and uh i mean we have to improve we have to reinvent ourselves but penetration is not that bad if you add uh food travel essentials duty-free fashion it's not that bad so let's take our strong parts and make them even stronger rather than say we don't do that well because there's not that many that many people buying perfume but you can travel without buying perfume what you need is to have a full proposition and uh what i really agree with is flexibility i mean uh if we have a 10-year contract we're speaking about a customer in 2030 what we don't know what we do know is that we don't know who it will be so we need to be able to change our concepts maybe even transform duty free to food or food to travel essentials because we have more low-cost travelers or less low-cost maybe the next generation will be chinese maybe not maybe indians maybe european who nobody knows so we have to adapt and i think that uh we're answering to what dan said we could very well imagine long-term contracts but flexible in terms of what we propose use close but clean type of store and that probably would go with at least the part of profit sharing rather than revenue share because then everybody is ready to invest because the payback is there so uh yeah lots of ideas and i'm very optimistic for the industry doug is the is the airport sector receptive to your message of flexibility uh yes i mean we do uh it's obviously something which takes time uh but i think the starting point is uh to see about how we share uh profit which basically means imagine a contract without rent we just share profit obviously the major part going to to the airport and that brings flexibility because then uh the agendas are fully aligned and we have small airports but also big airport groups which we're discussing with who really find that interesting and who see the benefit of it one key benefit would be that if that had existed there just wouldn't be any discussions on terms during covet because it's a very very resilient model yeah all right senator i know you you want to make a couple of observations well i mean okay first of all i'm not speaking on behalf of actra these are my personal views and opinions um as uh as mauro very correctly said in this presentation that a lot of the discussions that we are having just now on what the future will look like are we looking at a lot of unknowns we don't know what's going to happen we don't know when it's going to happen i was happy to see that mauro thinks that and jack that intra regional travel in asia will start in 2022 which i think is very optimistic i'll be very happy if it does uh obviously domestic flights within india and within china etc are there but that doesn't really concern us as duty-free retailers um at the moment as an operator uh and i know it's brands and other companies as well who are talking about are talking about survival more than anything else so so we have to uh you know figure out how to manage for this year and the next year or whatever time it takes the thing that i don't agree with with uh what you had said in the presentation is that things like china domestic market will be or or travel retail luxury shopping will move from travel retail to domestic look i'm a firm believer in travel retail and duty-free and i know it's going to come back whenever it comes back it will come back people will want to travel people will travel and people will spend money at airports shift from travel retail to duty-free also there's one important point that was not mentioned there is a price advantage at an airport okay so when you're buying duty-free as opposed to buying domestic there is a huge price advantage especially for luxury goods so i i think we're going to do okay once there is a full recovery um omni channel a lot of people keep talking about omnichannel and how it is or could be a competition to our business the bricks and mortar business at an airport so during covet obviously omni channel has picked up and there's been a lot of uh you know business going on it's so easy for people to just sit on their phone and order something you know delivered within 24 hours or whatever but i don't think that's going to continue to remain uh competition once business starts people will buy of course there are price advantages again buying through the omni channel sources but you know we've always had competition there's been the discounters there's been the parallel traders that's always been there in the industry but we've always managed to do well and come back and i think that's what's going to happen in the next year or whenever the recovery takes place all right good i i think um to be fair tomorrow uh he he was talking really about the wider romney channel so not just just e-commerce so uh and he was saying the future must be omnichannel not not not bricks-and-mortar digital omni-channel i was referring to the e-commerce but yeah all right okay and i think that's where it's going but but an important note of of resilience and optimism um there from funeral which if you marry that to peckham's very good comments about the human desire as well as need uh to travel going forward and then you marry that again tomorrow's comments about how airports must make their money in the future and we know they must make more from non-aeronautical revenues then that just underlines the emphatic importance of of our sector and i think that's a positive not a negative and i'm with cena on that one um look we it's always a sign of a good panel when we got a lot of presentation when we got a lot of questions and chat coming in so i'm very mindful of the time but i also to give my my panelists plenty of air time um and so we're gonna we're gonna go to them with with uh some direct questions first and then i'm gonna throw it open to as many as we can pick up from the chat and the question and answer box so i'm gonna go around the room again if i may lucy this time i'll start with you um and these these are kind of two questions the first is about the three most relevant changes you've seen in travel results post covert and in a moment but just answer that one please we'll talk about your three key priorities going forward what are the what are the three that stand out for you since this terrible virus came along oddly enough for three um big changes are actually my three priorities so i can keep it quite short um yeah the things we were facing prior to covert have now just been put on steroids so the um customer wanting information and the ability to to shop they want to shop using e-commerce or omni channels um that was prevalent before and now it is um even more of a priority for us so organ airport's made a very um strong play in that space um and it's it's well documented um we're confident that that's the right position because also when international travel is shut we've now pivoted sorry to domestic taxpayer duty paid and the demand for duty-free style products is really high customers still really want them um liquor tobacco fragrance not so much tobacco online actually um you know people still really really want those products so biggest change and biggest thing i'm dealing with is e-commerce and the way it's part of our business it's not it's not a competition it's not separate to us it is part of retail and we are part of retail so that's really important um i think the other thing is just soul-searching on are we when you don't have travel what are you if you're an airport um so for us it's been very much around uh you know what is it that we actually offer people what do we own what is the territory that we own that we can keep for the next you know one year to 10 years um and i like maro talking about 2025 but i don't know how many other people are like me where i'm actually worried about 2021 22 23 and 24. i'm actually really worried about what i do now let alone what i do in five years time because i've got a survival diversification priority and then i think the other thing for us is getting really clear on who our customers are and who matters i agree with maro saying there will be recovery and different asia pac is really complex it has so many different types of airports we've got government airports we've got privatized airports you know we're a shareholding company so some of the priorities and options that we have available to us are very different to the somewhat inspiring changi um you know storyline that we saw at the very beginning of this there's a very different funding structure that can allow certain things to happen and what that means is when tenants come to me some of my priorities to be able to provide relief are dictated by my commercial realities by the aeronautical revenues that maro talked about you know if i don't have travel i don't have aviation so my priorities around providing relief and flexibility um are somewhat uh limited in some areas yeah yeah yeah and look um access to capital all of that remains true and so at the moment we're in the business of trying to work out how to create value without spending money which ironically enough i think brands retailers and airports all have that um in common um as does the high street as it turns out um so that's where we're really focused is um new zealand is well positioned so we're all very familiar with the way we've run our national approach to covert we're a small island nation um and what we've worked out is there if we switch on travel quickly there is a customer base that we really miss and that's the kiwis and aussies traveling because we understand them we know what they buy we know what's important to them and they're traveling for leisure reasons mostly so we understand the perfect storm of the valuable customer we're not so focused on long-haul one-off visitors they bring tourism money to new zealand but right now from a travel retail position it's different if i'm speaking as a as new zealand tourism i'm very focused on getting my lifetime value customers very like back into the world that i can talk to them and connect with them engage with them much like the panels talked about you've got to sort of get really um or changing as you spoke about it get really core on who your customers are and who counts that's my priority at the moment all right really well said lucy look to to keep the keep it linear as it were we'll go to dan to keep stay with the airport view then um same question obviously to you and then we'll come to the retailer and brand i think the first one obviously is the major reduction in in passengers we've benefited from not having such a reliance on international travel we're now at over 50 percent of um pre-covered levels which is you know one of the highest in the u.s we've managed to keep most of our retail and food and beverage outlets open during the last 15 months and that that in turn in terms of the changes going forwards i think we've really got to look at our product mix we are behind the game as far as omnichannel is concerned and and being honest with the exception of a handful of airports and i include auckland as one of the stars heathrow is another and obviously changi i i think the airport industry in general is way way behind the domestic market as far as online retail and and you know the brands are significantly more advanced and even on the operative side you know they dip their toes in it but i wouldn't really say that there's anyone who's out there and grabbed it by the scruff of the neck and really taken that forward um and that that that need to have a rapid evolution of e-commerce online um you know generation x and y they they live with everything online um what we're seeing though is that there's a whole generation who pre-covered probably only bought something online once a year and now they're doing it four or five times a week it's easy it's convenient um it represents great value and so that's that's a real challenge for us and we're actually developing our own online retail platform and and retail outlets online which is quite an exciting project and then the other one which i think is really important is the really yet unknown impact on business travel going forwards um business travel is a key driver for airline yield and obviously the airlines like everyone involved in the in the business have suffered catastrophic um profit and loss uh impacts with the result of uh so few people traveling and now that that business class passenger one is very important from a travel retail perspective they're very good customers with good spend potential but just as important as far as the airlines are concerned and i was slightly concerned when narrow said that he sees the lcc share increasing because that will just further impact airline profitability and when you link that to the regional flow and the recovery guidelines that he was giving based on the latest forecasts that's a concern as far as airline profitability and and obviously longevity all right dan thanks so much dad i'll come to you now and then i'll come to you in a moment doug doug bagley your uh three most relevant changes um and maybe let's weave in the question your three most relevant priorities going forward we'll cover two two for one with you doug okay so i think uh the most relevant change is uncertainty that's definitely the main change just impossible to predict what the passenger mix will be what their expectations of the customers will be and i think that's fascinating we just have to be open-minded to be agile flexible uh be ready for any kind of change i think uh that's a very very significant change and a fascinating one [Music] the second is the increased focus on digital digital is critical yes omni-channel on your channel is important although i think the e-commerce part of it is less relevant for us than for downtown for downtown it is just a life or death issue for us it's uh incremental that's how we see it where we're most developed which is in china on this omni channel we see we really see the added value and the incremental part so yes capex should be more digital but as mauro said digital is not only about omnichannel it's also about supply chain and for us it's a lot about physical in-store experience how we can make the passenger journey more seamless how we can speak to him how we can help our sales force better interact with them so globally how can we improve customers in-store experience and then the third change uh would be the evolution of business model towards uh greater value sharing with a greater potential obviously for this flexibility and agility which also becomes a priority among the priorities be more customer-centric and that's about working with the airport with the brands how can we share data how can we be less shy in sharing data i mean i don't care about owning data i want to work with airlines with airports with brands to know the customers better i mean i am a member of uh some loyalty cards what i get is an 50 discount subs on a magazine subscription every six months i mean we could do much better uh mr maru we know that you like this whisky we have a slightly better whiskey for you since it's you you'll get it for the price of the whiskey you used to buy but just try this one i mean we can do that kind of thing we can do it working together and this i'm really convinced it's the past and it's uh the top priority greater insight on passengers behaviors how we can increase touch points and speak with him and that's it's also to the benefit for the airline because an airline speaking to me just offering subscriptions it's really a waste of big data usage second is switch towards a more sustainable industry we are not the main i mean the main [Music] we are not the ones who would pollute the planet most in the value chain but i think that each of us have to show that we care and we can use our stores to better communicate on these issues on the planet and all the dimensions of csr people ethics planet and social our famous maps and then a third priority is to transition to this new business model uh it's something which takes time but which is so critical for everybody because that's how we can unlock value uh doug really really well but i just the point of clarification if i may um from uh noted that the point that she was making and then and in context of lucy's remarks is dengue is actually um while it's 100 owned by the ministry of finance they are very much a self-funded airport so they're very lucky it's not lucky they're well managed that they've built up a strong balance sheet over the last few years since you'll remember but like everyone else uh beckon says we are staring at our p l every day and worrying how we can survive ill recovery cuts so that's an important point um dug over to you for the brand perspective on this again i'll try and wrap this into one question sorry about that but with an eye on the clock the three three most relevant changes you've seen and your three most relevant uh priorities for for industry company and category go in there thanks man yeah look i'll try to combine a few because the number of points have have already been said i i think one of the important things that uh you know i heard lucy mentioned initially was around excitement and really bringing excitement back to shoppers and when we talked to gen x gen y around travel and the opportunity to travel again you know immediately or you're immersed in that excitement to to get out um and experience in the world so i think you know one of the things that we need to again come together is how can we really focus on bringing that excitement back into the shopping experience murray mentioned whether that's utilizing some of the vacant space where that exists within airports i'm not sure what the right idea is but i do think if we look at adjacent categories or adjacent retails whether it's luxury department stores whether it's what's happened in e-com with 11 11 or 12 12. how can we really bring some probably the wrong explanation but like a shopping bonanza or a festival back into airports when people come back and welcome back i think is really important we've had a number of conversations for the last eight months and what again takes the primary stage on how we bring excitement back is price and i don't think price is the way to excite consumers i think we have to come back to finding a better way of really building that penetration level dave mentioned that penetration levels aren't too bad well at low double digit levels i think there's a huge room for improvement um we we can look at by by whether it's be by sharing data and which could really be the impetus for our to try and enable that seamless shopping experience but that whole traveller journey and when you look at penetration levels you know we're only largely focused on who comes in the store and whose purchases but if you can actually look at that full path to purchase from when they begin their research to shop on a holiday online when they book the business trip wall whether it be their vacation through the online system and actually engage with them on that whole truck shopping journey then i think we can radically shift penetration and i think the the channel uh as sunil mentioned just plays so well to luxury brands and brands in general we can use that medium to tell you know really authentic brand stories we can talk about pre and post or with targeted messaging along the way um and that's what really excites excites me now that doesn't at all ignore the fact that we have enormous uncertainty but i am confident we will pass that uncertainty but we've got to get back again to something that's differentiated and brings us up and surpasses where we've got some other areas that are really competing with us in this sector at the moment all right dog i'm going to pick up on a point about price with dag in a minute but i just want to come to dan to complete the loop as it were in terms of your three most relevant priorities going forward dan did you cover those off um no martin i'm just going to add one on top of what's already been discussed and that i think is is something we i'm glad to hear dag refer to airlines but for me full integration of the airlines into this discussion is one of the most critical factors that we're missing um you know we share data but sharing data has been a topic of discussion for the last 25 years and we're no really further down the road than we were 25 years ago on sharing data the the airlines have you know they're the lifeblood of our industry um and if we can find a way and we really want to grow our business and make ourselves more relevant if we can find a way of integrating the airlines into part of the trinity and the business model using e-commerce having home delivery collection at airport on arrival or departure then i think we're well down the road in terms of capturing some of the market share that we've lost to to people like amazon and and increasing some of the relevance in the business all right dan well said doug just quickly i wanted to pick up on the price point and and link it to your experience of domestic terminal retailing we're seeing some extraordinary spend in chinese airport now i know the chinese can't travel abroad and i know they're a high spending consumer per se but you have no prop of price in in those domestic terminals and you're selling high value often luxury goods in them and you're selling them successfully and many of the standalone luxury brands are recording ben's way above even their downtown flagship in chinese domestic terminals what person of that for you and what does it offer in terms of how you approach your international retail yeah i think it's a great question martin i think the the the point around some of the important touch points that i guess we pushed in particularly in the heinen example were the touch points that play so much to this channel exclusivity um limited editions um something new and in hainan we launched a glenfitting chinese new year uh pop-up store and we had some gifting options which were exclusive exclusive to travelers but i one of the key learnings for us is how we integrated hainan as a destination and used that as the travel in terms of the whole campaign so we spoke to key opinion consumers and community opinion leaders and we did live stream live streaming and social selling campaigns within hainan itself and i think to make that travel destination a part of the whole campaign really added to the whole exclusivity and the experience of it and as you said we had some fantastic results best results we've ever had whether that be through um some of our engagement scores through richard weibo both in domestic and in travel retail um so for us it's a big learning and something that we'll take forward moving forward and and further build on that seamless experience for the consumer all right and and doug rasmussen very much the same question if we look at your your footprint in china the most interesting one yeah well it's basically the the same answer uh i mean the price has to be good it hasn't doesn't have to be best you have to have a good price but that's uh the first layer of the maslow pyramid and you need to add something more you need experience you need exclusive products you need great staff you need to communicate with the staff i mean we have more than 2 million people in our data i mean people we know we speak with them we live stream video with them uh great stores uh great service uh so it's uh adding up the experience sense of place i mean all everything we know but that's what we have to add to the price you have to be good on price but don't focus only on price or you're lost uh glenn williams uh just noted and he applauded your comment like a moment ago the process needs to be seamless touchless and provide a sense of space not just a sense of place nice terminology okay we've got about 15 minutes folks i'm going to run it to the end of the hour sooner you're good with that because we've got questions flowing in um good obviously if anyone has to go and make a cup of tea or pop into the office or whatever then um we'll make sure this this is reported and we'll have the text to you and the presentations as promised in case you have to leave but let's plow right on let's talk about the contractual nature of it and the relationship uh part of this whole debate how do you each see the evolution of the of the famed trinity relationship and i'm afraid i'm the one to blame for that term that's probably taken more abuse down the last 20 years than any other industry term so i've got sick in and you can say what you want about it i'm going to start with you doug doug rasmussen where do you see the trinity going uh well the trent it's very linked i think with our priorities it is about uh sharing it's about really working together uh yes you succeeded in uh having all of us speak about trinity but you didn't succeed into making the trinity and this is i would guess the the next challenge the partnerships need to be stronger i mean we had very tough discussions within the trinity with brands with airports uh we probably managed to get stronger out of it because uh it probably allowed us to understand ourselves better because we really went to the end of what was possible so i think it's probably fair discussions now and more transparent discussion but the next step would be to really come to this sharing not owning and that airlines understand that if they help the airport and the retailers to increase the sales and uh have better interchange with their passengers it will be uh for the benefit of them and uh airports and i mean the whole uh alternative i might say yeah and that's where the quaternary comes in of course that's right dan you were back with me in 2002 when we were both very young men of course um at that first trinity and we set off with you know noble ambitions uh you've tracked the past very closely in the intervening 19 years what's your take on how that trinity evolution should and will um take shape and just very quick recap 2002 the the main debate was margin um and concession fee um and minimum guarantee and and really that's been the focus of debate over many years and if ever there was a an opportunity to change the model it is now you've covered a lot in the last few weeks with some of the big operators and some of the major brands equal share equal risk equal reward and i don't think anybody um would argue against that my only comment is that ultimately whatever you compromise somebody's got to pay airports are highly highly capital intensive and pre-covered iata had a forecast to double traffic by 2035 um on a global scale so just put that back five years all right or even 10 years there are hundreds of billions of dollars that have got to be spent on infrastructure going forwards now we we can focus on on the non-aeroside yeah not an issue but not all airports have huge land banks um and if you're going to be significantly reducing your share of revenue on your non-aero you can then put it over onto the aero side and you can do a passenger service charge passenger facilitation charge or whatever but that in turn puts airline tickets up so my only my only thought in conversations you know i've always been open-minded as far as trying to come up with what what is the best way to move the business forward as importantly to increase penetration because it has been stagnant for years increase increase conversion and increase average spend but ultimately if you take away from one you've got to give on the other hand because unless the airports have got that that cash flow in order to justify the the the borrowing to to put in the infrastructure um we're not going to go anywhere we're changing the model lucy i see you nodding and smiling at various points in that i mean it's it's an obvious segway into into you as a as an airport that is running very expensive infrastructure and has ongoing needs so does the trinity does the trinity model um fit into your position um i think there's a few things going on so contractually does there need to be some innovation on how we handle flexibility and risk yes and again depending on the type of airport we're all going to approach it possibly a little bit different so as a tenant you may or as a retailer you may feel frustrated that one airport is approaching it um and one way and another is it approaching it another and that's largely due exactly to dan's point how we're funding how we've agreed to fund ourselves um you know what commitments we have to debt covenants for example or whatever it might be you know we're going to have to not all efforts will be the same so flexibility means different things to different people what i think i've worked out is from a trinity point of view if i put aside the fact that my personal opinion is and i've been in the industry for quite some time that when you coined the phrase trinity i was still around um i think we think uh we just have to work together and the reality is we have to acknowledge some of us have very different business drivers what works for the brand may not work for the retailer may not work for the airport we have got to recognize that there are some differences and it's going to be the space and the differences in us acknowledging that there might be some opportunity now if you put that to the side and go actually never mind the trinity airlines don't need us they can find a way to retail without us there are some airlines that are partnering with non-airport operations non-airport retailers and they can do home delivery so it's a bit like uber did for transport and taxis you know i don't think transport operators saw that coming um they don't need you don't need a fleet of employees ready to wait to be told to come and get you that they've reinvented that model so i think there's a trinity then there's the paternity then there's multiturnity there's alibaba there's all the ways people can sell things um and the the task for us is maybe to stop kidding ourselves on some of these things and have a really good hard look at what are we delivering i can see in some of the comments you know margins if we do too much of a good job online we're just going to write hammer home the point that price is really important and i think i'm leading up to one key point which is i was speaking to a retailer who is a global highly respected very good operator and they have a lot of square meters in a lot of airports and other places and it was really interesting to hear that their approach to selling currently is to stock the same products that they know will sell so most of the core of their stock will always be oriented on the things they know they can sell but the consumer when they go into a downtown shop has square meterage and a full range and a full experience but when they travel they don't get to see the things that they just saw in the high street because there's smaller square meterage there's smaller stock because the retailers are committed to selling what sells and so there's a real double blind for us now is airport retailer brand in terms of what do we bring and if customers are expecting range excitement and variety and they get to the airport and they see the same stuff they saw two years ago because that's what sells to the majority of the people we've got a bit of a challenge on our hands and i'm not sure i don't quite correct how we're going to work it but i don't know if maybe we need to stop thinking about how we're all going to work together and maybe just go what are we bringing to the party and where do we need to change some of that will be contracts it's a it's a critical point lucy and it's unfair to call that dumbing down of range but obviously because of what's happened the economic pressures on those retailers uh yeah they are they are going to narrow down their range and therefore and i have i have a hand in that as an airport i am part of that situation where the tenant's going well i'll i've told you how much i'm going to pay you so i better sell the stuff i know i can get in the door yeah so where does that sit with what amazon can't do it's a conundrum as lucy said and that brings us i suppose superbly to you doug because doug bagley because there you are with some of the you know most beautiful drinks brands in the world um you you've spoken very highly of the environment in the airport um how does this trinity model though underline i'm sorry undermine your ability to bring those bring those brands to life going in the future and invest in them heavily in that airport environment look i don't pull us as a brand out of trinity we're very much a part of trinity and involved in it so you know i'm part of the problem and hopefully part of the solution but um i i do think you know what uh what dan was saying whether we've lost five years whether we've lost ten years and with the uncertainty could be one or the other one thing i hope cohort can bring is not an i guess the question not an evolution of the trinity right um relationship but a bit of a revolution um as lucy said whether it's uber whether it's alibaba whether it's amazon whatever it may be have reven reinvented themselves every six months every one month entering into new categories at pace we need to reinvent ourselves we need to start a different way of operating all it takes i think i feel is one trinity model wherever it may be in one particular location to have a successful change and i think it'll drive away from change through the industry and i think i come back to dag's point if we're able to focus on that consumer experience that will ultimately drive football it will ultimately deliver more value for the partners and consumers and whoever it may be and try and find a way of linking concession rates and fees to a pay performance model that focuses on that maybe it moves us in the right way um you know as long as as long as i've been around i've heard a lot around why we can't data share and there's great reasons for and there's great reasons against but there must be a solution as to how data can sit at the heart of how we can all leverage each other's strength whatever the focus may be but purely saying we can't share for confidentiality or secrecy or greed or whatever it may be i don't think it's the solution moving forward no all right well one thing that strikes me that does bond all members of the trinity right now and everyone on this call is so much commonality in what you're all saying is that you're all in this together to try and revive a really important business and you saw from maurice and jack slides how important this sector is going forward so we're all we're all in it together um as it were and to to to drive that increased penetration to drive a revived business we're going to need innovation like any like any business needs innovation there's a bloodline we've got just a few minutes so i want a short answer from each of the panelists please as to what does innovation in our sector represent to you and they have to be short answers sorry about that i'll start with you dan capelle um i think the rapid integration of technology from a to z across the customer experience including all airport pro um all airport processing biometric scans etc all right i'm going to go down my grid to you doug bagley i think innovation lies at the heart of our opportunity moving forward i don't i think the real touch points for the consumer as i mentioned before exclusivity limited edition remains at the heart of what we do if you overlay that with as we've discussed before that omni experience so you've got that on online and offline world for the always-on consumer i think that's the key innovation we need in the step change all right lucy thomas thank you doug um apart from most people want me to say innovating our contracts um which hopefully means thinking slightly more innovatively than asking for just mag to be removed um because that's not innovation that's just a request um i think the main focus is um looking at what works for the customer and the boom and omni and digital and social media is going it's not what we're selling it's how we're selling and it's who we're talking to and what relationships we have with the customer so that's the main focus for me well said lucy all right doug and then i'm going to come to center with you briefly for the final word please and we've got to be we've got to be brief doug rasmussen please okay so for me uh innovation here is more how we understand the evolution of the customer uh we learn some multi-stakeholder research interviews with brands with airports with our own stuff to understand what the customer becomes that's critical but i must say there's one opportunity we have which is one of our weaknesses we have to reinvent ourselves at the end of each contract so we just re-capex everything which downtown doesn't do so we can have much shorter cycles than a heavy high street location that's an opportunity so let us seize it all right thank you thank you doug and so now a quick final word from you please and then i'll wrap up in the next minute or two before we get cut off mitchell so talking about innovation as lucy mentioned from my point of view as a retailer it is about contracts which retailers have with airports not saying that we're asking for mags to be removed there are different models that have been worked out and i know that from my personal experience that we have worked out future models even at changi airport which are which are good for everybody so i'm not removing mags not roaring maps or whatever it is but there are different ways uh of doing so and uh if i recall correctly correctly dan when he was in abu dhabi was part of a uh when they were planning the midfield terminal then you would come up with some sort of a solution to a contract that worked for both the retailer and the airport which i thought was very good we won't go into details of that just now but you know if anybody wants to ask that and if you can give that information it would be good to know for for everyone but that would be the main innovation as far as i'm concerned as a retailer that i would like to talk to mine learn lots about helpful and very flexible if anything the covet has brought the trinity together closer and you know retailers are talking to airports airports are responding uh brands suppliers you know it's brought brought everybody together which i think is a good thing to finish on well ladies and gentlemen all around the world thank you uh for being with us first of all uh very large audience today and some of you got up very very early and some of you are up very late some of you just going to work now it's great to see this kind of international melting pot of an industry we are coming together great to see so much commonality of thought um and of optimism and desire to make things better among all the indus the trinity stakeholders on this call and that to me uh was inspiring as was peck coon's uh video that is a great deal of innovation and creativity um in this business so i want to thank the uh the audience i want to thank mauro and jack who have put time tirelessly uh in recent months into this project and i know from personal experience how many hours that they've done and we've got great professionalism from two of the best minds in this business uh to produce what they what they have produced and i thank them both for that i thank our panelists of course what fantastic team of men and women uh we had on board today so thank you for that uh from durman and myself also thank you to actress tully uh your board and and and great team christina and sharon for the opportunity to work with you i think it's been a very good um a very good webinar it's not the last um so the actual dialogue will continue and there will be a webinar we'll let you know the subject matter uh and the timing in in the very near future but i think we've certainly got off to a promising start thank you to our sponsors too yam singh and filter ching hwa so that all helps of course get this show on the road so

ever piece of glass I bought it was if you could see [ __ ] if you can see that [ __ ] just diamond glass this was the first rig I bought I bought this [ __ ] off 420 in San Francisco on Haight Street just because by huh be cool ja needed add a brick to take a dab out of so I was like [ __ ] I mean let me cops up so we can take some dabs she was taking dabs on 420 with my homie cool John that was reason why I bought this piece but then it ended up breaking I didn't break this piece but it ended up breaking and it's just what happens when you have glass man [ __ ] breaks so yeah I'm a little salty that this shit's broken because it was like my best setup that I have for an email and my mom gave me just peace so it was like you know didn't cost me nothing but [ __ ] it lost me everything do you feel me because this it was tight so that's his god broke-ass it sucks this is still going it's burning just fine it's burning like pretty slow for being just one person token on it it's hella nice is burning evenly now that I finally got it going it's [ __ ] blue brah that's just my favorite I wish this was blue but my older brother got it for me his favorite color is red so that's the only reason why we're cuz my brother got it for me for Christmas so shoutouts to my brother you guys think about this area should get along whoo so yeah guys that's what I've been up to just working on the [ __ ] grind making sure my finger don't bleed out just been working you feel me putting these videos out let me know if you guys like this style here or if you like it over there where I sit on a couch I'm on the other side of the couch and this is like where I sleep so [ __ ] if you leave a comment down below if you like it this style view like looking like this to the side having to cuz I get a better lighting from here when I'm over here on this side I use a [ __ ] lamp light and this burnt out so yeah if you like that should I have to go get another lamp light to be able or a different type of light I'll invest into a better light if you guys like it on a couch better on that couch side of you or if you like it on my bed couch with the window open leave a comment down below what you guys like to see better yeah it's going pretty nice so yeah man all right Pete to the custom grow 420 really that was like to clean this piece to use on my email this because it had the least air restriction it was like a juggler you dumb you just like you can you can just take a toke on that as hard as you wanted to in you filming you was getting your whole dab unlike this piece right here because of all the [ __ ] little [ __ ] and [ __ ] in here all these little [ __ ] you kind of have to hit it harder to get more airflow this one you just and it would just come at you didn't even have to that had no restriction at all [Music] sidecar [ __ ] super slid the fuses I [ __ ] was bomb but r.i.p we got anymore come on you mentally smoke too much flour on this channel but we'll try and come out with some more content with flour I do like some open oil it's my shake that's pretty nice the ash is pretty white guys my review on this since I've been smoking it this [ __ ] got me [ __ ] loaded so it's a pass you feel me it's easy on the throat it's easy on the lungs you get fat clouds out of it and this one in particular is actually rolled way better cuz I actually if you will go watch my [ __ ] what video maybe it's not even in a video yet [ __ ] well I [ __ ] had two of these right so I had this one and I had this one which was the red one and the red would damn near was trash you feel me I didn't really like the red one now I'm not hating on it because it was [ __ ] red but like when you [ __ ] took a toke on it like for some reason it would just like it would hit like you could get a cloud off it and I smoked it to the face and I don't feel like I got loaded off it it tasted cool was black cherry but I don't really like that one but this blue one is [ __ ] bomb cuz like my eyes are already low as [ __ ] is this I'm just higher can't even it's hard to explain it it's way better and I was damn you're gonna smoke another one with you guys for the [ __ ] of it yes this one the sour tangi because i got two of these too and I still have both of them that I need to throw up and it's from the same company so they got these where's that [Music] damn cuz I was gonna put a fella forgot because I was gonna put this [ __ ] out and light one of these [ __ ] right here because one of these is tangi sour tangi sour tangi and this one is [ __ ] juice this is a good old uh and this is a indica and this one is a hybrid you feel me I forgot I was only gonna smoke half of this and then smoke one of these down but [ __ ] damn this [ __ ] just went out so this one just went out I'm actually gonna [ __ ] spark one of these [ __ ] it I'm Lexie I'm gonna just our tangi I think so lucky sour tangi this one here okay so this one just to recap really quick high voltage it was a pre-roll raw cone had top-shelf blood in it I don't even think I said this Kylie's finest og mix for life president it doesn't even say [ __ ] on here covered with OG key and it has live resin inside and I'm assuming it has you know top gel blood in it because that [ __ ] was pretty fired this one here is a premium cannabis rolled with the foot Premium Canada strolled in nature and natural leaf nature I'm cuttin hi this right here nature's combs premium cannabis rolled in natural leaf nature's calm calm distributed by Kings coast tan GOG hybrid tested 1.2 grams tested by SC labs 31.3 40 Hz so yeah there's that I'll show you guys this get it glare off it comes with this [ __ ] on the top I'm assuming that's just so just so just so just so yeah so the none of

As you can see, I've already got some nice\nbrie and some nice butter. So, there's only one thing missing. Some bakery fresh Persian baguettes. Which we're going to make by starting with an overnight poolish. Which is a very fun word used\nto describe a quick preferment that improves both texture and flavor. We're simply mixing together\n120 grams of bread flour, a little tiny pinch of instant yeast, and half a cup, or 118 grams, cool water. Tiny whisk until no dry flour remains. And you're left with a\nsufficiently gooey goo. Cover, and let it sit at room temperature for at least 12 hours, up to 18. When you return, it should\nlook very much the same, but, upon removing the lid and plunging your fingers into it, you will find it has transformed into a nice fermented\nsmelling, very sticky, ectoplasmic goop. Which we are now going to\nadd to the final bread batch. 420 grams of bread flour, four and a half grams, or one and a half\nteaspoons, instant yeast, and tiny whisk in order to\nprotect the yeast from the salt. 12 grams, or two teaspoons,\nworth of kosher salt. And a little more than\na cup, or 255 grams, of lukewarm water, along with our starter. Mixed together with a rubber\nspatula until just combined. And then it's time to start\ngetting your hands dirty. Because we are kneading\nthis dough by hand. Once a shaggy dough forms, turn it out onto an unflour-ed work\nsurface, and get to kneading. Now, this is a pretty high\nhydration dough, about 68%. So, it's going to be very, very sticky. Which, if you are a decidedly\nunprofessional baker, like me, is going to be\nvery, very hard to knead. So, we're going to resort to\nthe good old slap-and-fold. Basically, just pick the dough up, slap it down on the table,\nand fold it over itself. Repeating for anywhere\nfrom eight to 15 minutes, depending on your forearm strength. If you need a break from this\nrepetitive and violent act, you can stop and do a\nlittle traditional kneading. No matter how you do it, the end game here is gluten formation. Either way, all you're really doing is stretching the dough out, and folding it over on itself, until the dough is soft and elastic, and passes the window pane test. Indicating that you have a strong and well-developed gluten network, ready for a one and one\nhalf hour long bulk ferment. That is the act of letting\nthe unshaped dough rise, covered at room temperature\nfor an hour and a half. But, we're going to cheat, and strengthen our dough's gluten network by doing a couple lift-and-folds. Halfway through the bulk ferment, we're going to lift\nthe dough from the edge and fold it into the center, five or six times, rotating as we go. This is going to help compensate for our lack of experience\nand upper body strength. After another 45 minutes, we ought to see some good bubble action. And it will be time to\ndivide and shape the dough on a lightly oiled work surface. I'm dividing this dough to four parts, which is going to make for\nsome pretty small baguettes. Something that, at the\ntime, I didn't know. So, we're going to pretend that\nthis is our practice round, as we shape these pieces into balls, stretching and tucking\nthe dough under itself until the top is taut. Covering and letting rest for 15 minutes, so the gluten relaxes, and then beginning the\nbaguette shaping process. First with patting the whole thing out into a rough rectangle. No particular size, just as\nrectangle-y as you can get it. Then starting, with the\nside closest to you, we're going to fold in towards the center. Repeating with the\nother side of the dough, and pressing vigorously to seal. Then we're repeating this action, but just one little bit at a time, pressing down with the heel of our hand, making sure that the\nseam is tightly sealed. You should also hear lots\nof air bubbles poof-ing out, like miniature farts. With that done, we're\ngoing to start pressing and rolling out from the center, increasing the pressure as we get towards the\noutside of the dough, so as to taper the ends, forming the dough into something sort of\nresembling a baguette. Which, I'm going to try\nbaking two different ways. First, in a baguette loaf pan, which is a sort of trench shaped pan, filled with lots and lots of little holes. We're to place this\ninside of a proofing bag, and inflate it, like a\nchild's birthday balloon. And let it rise for about 45 minutes. The other two, we're going\nto do the traditional way, in what the French call a couche. Which, is basically\njust a large linen cloth that we're going to heavily\nflour and fold into trenches, in which our loaves can rise\nunder a lightly dampened cloth. Again, for about 45 minutes. Once everybody's just\nabout doubled in size, it's time to score. Which, ideally you want to do with a bread lame or razor blade, but, we're just going to do\nwith the sharpest knife we got. Five long diagonal slashes, the ends of which should overlap. The other two loaves I'm placing on a well flour-ed pizza peel, because they're headed onto a pizza stone. 450 Fahrenheit for anywhere\nfrom 17 to 20 minutes. As you can see, the loaves from the specialized\nbaguette pan look nice and evenly brown. We want an internal temp between 195 and 205 degrees Fahrenheit and a deep brown crust. And as you can see, my scores\nwere not nearly deep enough, which resulted in some blowouts\non the side of the loaf. But, this is still some\nreally gorgeous bread. A shatteringly crisp crust\nand a chewy open crumb, and a nice complex flavor\nfrom the overnight ferment. They say that eating bread\nstill hot out of the oven will give you a stomach ache, and I could not give less of a (bleep). Now our pizza stone loaves\nare headed out of the oven, and they kind of look a\nlittle bit nicer to me. A little lighter on the bottom, a little darker on the top, and as you can see, I did a\nslightly better job of scoring. It's still not good enough. So, we're starting again, this time using a stand\nmixer for obvious reasons. Everything the same, except I'm upping the\nsecondary water to 270 grams, giving the dough a hydration of 72%. And this time, for more robust baguettes, I'm dividing the dough in half instead of quarters. Rolling out and shaping, proofing in my couche, this time for a full hour to make sure that\nthey're not under-proved. And just for another experiment, I'm baking one on a rim baking sheet and the other on the pizza stone. And both are being sprayed generously with water before going into the oven. Does this comply with\nthe scientific method? No, not at all. But the pizza stone method\nprevailed once again. And the spritzing of water gave us an incredibly crackly crust. They say that you can hear good breads. So, let's listen in. (bread crunching) Now that's the kind of crust I'd want to demolish the roof of my mouth when I eat this sandwich. First, we're going to cut\nit in half length-wise, and inspect our nice,\nirregular, air-y crumb. And then, this sandwich\nonly has three ingredients. Read, the absolute best\nhigh quality French butter that you can get your hands on, which we're going to slather\non both sides of the bread, and lightly salt if\nyour butter is unsalted. And lastly, a generous\nstack of sliced French brie. Remember that when\nyou're following a recipe as simple as this one, you want the absolute best ingredients that you can get your hands on. Top it up, and that's it. All there\nis left to do is consume it with all the slime-ball energy\nof a \"Benjamin Horne\" type. First, we're going to give\nit an uncomfortable sniff, and tear into it from the side, like some kind of animal. And, I'm going to speak to you honestly, from the heart right now, this was genuinely one\nof the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life. Rich, creamy butter and brie, tucked into a flavorful,\nchewy, crispy baguette, still warm out the oven. It seriously makes you want\nto eat it like a sociopath. And, as you can see from my body language, I like it. But, this is \"Binging with Babish\", and we're not letting a sandwich go by without a cross section. Even if it's kind of lame looking. It doesn't taste lame\nlooking (muffled speaking). (upbeat music)", "2HDiagzjtYA": "I just love baking bread as it releases all your stress hello and welcome to Sanjeev Kapoor Khazana and the ultimate baking series with me chef brass today I am going to show you a very fantastic bread recipe of Bhagat so let's quickly start first I'm going to activate the east so I'm going to take a tablespoon of east or or you can say 10 grams of fresh yeast I'm going to break the East nicely and then to the east I'm going to add a pinch of sugar sugar really helps to disintegrate the East fast and then around 2 tablespoon of water and then I'm going to microwave this for round 10 seconds so after microwaving it for 10 seconds I'm going to give this a nice mix and I'm going to set this aside to activate next I'm going to grab a big bowl I'm going to sieve refined flour around 225 grams of refined flour I'm going to pass this from a sieve so that we don't find any small particle next I'm going to add some salt and then I'm going to add some more sugar into the flour give this a nice mix next I'm going to make well in the center I'm going to add the activated East as you can see the air bubbles on the top that means the East has activated now in goes the East and now let's make this nicely with the refined flour and then I'm going to start adding water and knead this into a soft dough so now as you see the flour has come together at this stage I'm going to take this out on my work table then I'm going to lightly dust my work table with some refined flour and now I'm going to start stretching this so now that you see our dough is ready you need to make a nice soft dough and now I'm going to dust some refined flour in that same bowl place this in and then I'm going to cover this with a wet muslin cloth and now I'm going to keep this in a warm place for proving for around 10 to 15 minutes now after 15 minutes as you see the dough has doubled in size now quickly I'm going to dust some refined flour and then I'm going to knock back the dough and take out all the air from it and now I'm going to roll this into thin rectangular sheet and now after rolling this into a thin rectangular sheet I'm going to start rolling this from one edge and then from the side I'm going to take the topmost layer and just tuck this in and now we need us some refined love on a parchment paper which I've lined on a baking tray and then I'm going to transfer this and now again I'm going to cover this with a wet muslin cloth and keep this for proofing for around 25 to 30 minutes now after proving it around 20 to 25 minutes you can see again it has become double in size and now I would score this and now after scoring the bed I'm going to give some milk wash on the top and now this will go in a preheated oven at 200 degree Celsius for around 15 to 20 minutes so here it is a baguette has perfectly baked a classic baguette recipe easy to make at home and this can be used to make over idea of recipes if you liked the videos that we share on YouTube do subscribe to us on our YouTube channel", "WpQ8dghSgVw": "in this video I want to show how to shape bread so this is a dough that has already been kneaded and it has raised one time so now it has to be shaped and then it has to be raised again and now on the website I have a portion and an example of a recipe and this is a double portion so I have to split this one in two because this is twice the recipe I have on the website the first thing I want to show is a nun shaped bread you simply take your piece it though you pull it a bit of long it's longer than its wide and then you let it rise that makes it a little prettier and looks like this and you can bake it and then it looks like this not too bad but it can be better he rustic French bread is made in the beginning like almost all the other breads I have to start by making a ball so I take the the edges and fold them towards the center and then I turn it over and fold the edges into the bread and I keep doing that until I have a tight and smooth surface on the piece and to shape this I I press down with my thumbs and then I just fold it and sometimes the dough has to rest a little bit more so it's easier to work with but otherwise you just keep doing this use your thumb to make a hole and then fold it and then when you cannot fold it anymore you press it together so you'll get a connection or if ya joint in the bottom that's it and they look like this that's the difference in a shape one I brush with milk get a shiny or surface then I score with the knife at an angle can do one long score like this that opens up the bread when it bakes it makes it it gives it a spring in the oven it's called Z omits it's it has opened up it's it's it's become you're almost twice the size if you want to make something bake it like a ball one of those classic round breads folded into Watson Center the edges and then fold it up in itself until you get a tight surface you can also do it like do it like this if you have a dough that doesn't stick too much and you can tighten it up by pulling it along the table and holding the other side it gives a nice tight service too and there has to be a small hole in the bottom I brushed that one too and I can score it like a small square or on the Hess sign you know from the computer this is not a very good knife so it's not too pretty but it'll work that will look like this the classic French bread again start by making a ball then I fold again I use my thumbs to make a sort of a small u-shape over which I can fold the dough then at some times when I cannot fold it anymore I press it together this and then I put put the seam downwards and it has to be about as wide as the baking pan like this and the seam downwards I'd have to tell it has to rise or I make sure it's a it has the even with all of the length of the bread this I try to press with an egg wash so it's nice and shiny and pretty they're not a lot this is poppy seeds you shouldn't put put on too much egg wash and I caught at a 45 I score it's called at a 45 degree angles and I make sure that they overlap a little bit so there's a score all along the length of the bread and it will look like this that's a classic shape hot dog bread well it's basically the same just in much smaller sizes I just fold it then I cut it I want 12 from this so I caught in three sizes first and then in four sizes again again I start by making a small bowl and then I fold it just like a very small French bread and at this stage I then roll it out to the size of the sausage hot dog sauce and so I want to put in it I'll eat those rice prosit some have been possible egg was and some with milk you see doesn't make a lot of difference and now forget I cut the portions into four I collect it loosely then I fold it to get a tight surface press the seam together just like a on a larger French bread but only with a smaller piece of dough and I roll it out to the desired length and that should be the the length of your baking pan everybody is impressed by a long baguette and after it has raised I process and again I cut at the 45-degree angle holding the knife as flat as possible and they look like this one there fades the previous one was impressed at all this one was pressed with X and this one with milk so there's a slight difference in the sheen well rolls and burger buns this portion also makes 12 now I start by dividing in 3 and then in 4 3 times 4 that is 12 I find this the the easiest way to do it without having to use a weight then I make small balls just like in the larger portions I take the edges and roll it into the center and then I roll it into itself until I get a tight surface if the finger sticks I add a little bit of flour so nice and pretty you can also do it like this against the table you have P eagleclaws and then you just roll around you cannot do that with the last portions unfortunately your hands are too small better with small bumps it's the easiest way then when they are round you roll them fat if you want to have burger buns so now they have raisin and this is the same portions of dough and a flat on a round version it a nice breakfast rolls we use poppy seeds and even the small rolls like this it's a good idea to score them so they get a better spring see the difference between the very small bread repair right up first and the other ones I braided bread it looks impressive it doesn't taste any different but it looks nice and it's easy to do start by making loose balls and then just like making a again we we use the same technique and now I show it towards the camera it looks a bit a bit off but that's here's to make it easier for you to see but I want to roll them as long as it is absolutely possible like this then I take the one from the furthest side and I break and put it to into the center always the last one I have touched I take that and put it into the center so I operate with three three strings that's very easy and that should not be scored when it has when it's done rising it should be brushed and here a use an egg wash that looks like this have beautiful bread so now you know how to shape most spritz enjoy and you can find the list of ingredients and the recipe on belly food", "MhgixaJCLY8": "they rolled up to Lamar is served by a pothead smoking on one of my evening bless that's the flavor you let me put it all spin move let me we'll be looking at a vibes free roll call without further ado jumps a close-up get into the review I burped up some old bird Moody's flap in the comment section have you take a look at the date pre-roll cone today we're looking at vibes and this is a rice cone oh the rice paper kind of burns up completely the word doesn't really leave a s I'm hoping that it also doesn't have that process of rolling paper taste we're going to do and get these out the pack so you can see what they look like alright burn club these are the vibes rice papers pretty decent papers I'm gonna go ahead and run all our chests on that one census looks kind of funky so we're going to use our lean green machine to hold this in place gonna stuff it up with some of this week and see how the smoke so let's get this thing filled up and see what it do [Music] [Music] hi Bertha got this vibe rice cone rolled up and it's real easy to feel we use the lean green machine that's like one of my favorite cone filling devices you're gonna do your own sapphire on in front of this and see where smoke-like begin I'm hoping that their taste of process paper isn't that strong in this but we'll get some firewood see what it do all right bear claw I think it's a fire oh just buy rice drink just raining so my dear to hear that but I do like to smoke on a rainy day so go ahead get some fire on this why be drink see what the first size to each matter was like [Music] all right well there is the descent of process paper um it's not that strong but it is definitely here we're going to take the first poll to see what the smoke actually tastes like I'm thinking that it might not taste that strong because it's not that strong in this ice cream but again I never want to get ahead of myself let's see what this thing you're doing yo now roads up there is a a fine line of paper taste going off the side street but it doesn't show up that strong in the taste other side of smoke like light I mostly just tasting the bud and it's a very Turkey but and that's really all just coming through right now there's very very light very light one of want to taste of it now I've had other rice papers and they perform basically the same way there's a very light underlying taste of rolling paper or both seniors who taste when you smoke powdery rice papers is weak now that side strength as it comes off of the earth is gone into my nose that smells just like processed paper does yeah there's no way of guess around that scent coming off the side string because all of them have that same thing but again the taste of this paper so far is one of the least strongest process paper tape again it doesn't mean that it's not there because I do still taste it it's just a very minimal we look at the ash on this what you see on there is really just the weed this burning of the paper that burns completely to where we look at it you can't you can't see the ash of it at all first bleep well hurry up there winds out there howling right now through trees a very good smoke coming dry like I'm I feel like my esophagus is very dry whoo Smokies that is my bra cubes I brought you a drop it is smoking with them mama daily say this when you see these do me try they know to think if you try them how did you like me again it taste for me it's minimal compared to a lot of the other rolling

welcome to the head shop close to me it's the one that goes to to get a lot of my stuff and the lady behind the counter was like um the vibes just came out I was when I did the employ oh the Hempleman was pretty good like this race one better the process paper taste is fainter on this that that help one has a vegetative taste bud and the stronger process paper tape still one more hit we got to do

about these little smokes so these low smoke CBDs are around $35 it comes with seven pre-rolls so that's around $5 per pre-roll I've been using them for a couple months now these are all the old containers I have what I like about these CD joints is a you had to keep that body hive that you get from smoking THC products but you also keep a mental clarity so you can really think and you're not as foggy I guess is the best way I could put it my favorite thing about this product is the packaging the packaging is just so premium it can be reusable that's why I kept all my cases because you can fit your pre rolls or joints in there that you made yourself and just use s container it has a magnetic flap so it won't open random little matchbox addition to it is a very handy just in case you forget a lighter but overall other than the price it's a very good product and I would definitely recommend anyone that would like to try any CBD drones and also get a cool package", "RD8Otxc9JxE": "[Music] [Music] here are all the ingredients we need to make some fresh crunchy soft Vietnamese bunny but get 500 grams of bread flour you want to use a flower that has a high protein content we have 8 grains of kosher salt if you using regular salt you need to reduce the amount we have 6 grams of sugar three hundred fifty milliliter of water room temperature and one packet of instant rice is five simple ingredients one great recipe let's get started first step you're gonna combine all of the dry ingredients in your standing mixer we have the bread flour going in the kosher salt the sugar and the instant rice is just combine all of the ingredients attach the kneading hook to your standing mixer turn on your mixer on speed setting number two and then add the water to all of the dry ingredients now you want to mix it for a couple minutes until all of the dry ingredients are well combined once it's all well combined let the dough rest for about two to three minutes once the dough has rested for two to three minutes turn the stunning mixer back on to speed setting number four this time and move the dough for about five minutes let's take a look at the dough in its texture after five minutes of kneading at speed setting number four as you can see the dough is very sticky totally sticks to your hands and it's very wet and that's totally fine at this point of time cover it up and let it rest for five minutes after five minutes of resting we want to turn the standing mixer back on to speed setting number four and we don't on the day for another five minutes after another five minutes of kneading on speed setting number four the dough is still wet and sticky but when you do the stretch test you can stretch the dough to a very thin layer without the door tearing that's when you know the dough is ready to rest so this is what the dough looks like after 60 minutes of resting it has risen beautifully you can see there's a lot of air in there try to get out as much of the air pockets as possible just push the air pockets out when you're done with getting most of all of the air pockets out form it back to a nice round shape put it back in the bowl cover it up put it in the oven again with oven lights on for 30 minutes the dough after the second rise of 30 minutes and once again you want to try to work out as many of the air bubbles as possible once most of the air bubbles are out form the dough back into a round shape that will help divide up the dough into equal portions I divide up my dough into 8 equal portions I'm making some mini pockets you can of course use a scale to make sure that each portion is equal weight I just eyeball it that works for me after all the portions have been divided you work one portion at a time and for me to its final shape now the one step that is really important here is going to be the slapping of the dough onto your working surface if you have a very frustrating day this is really good exercise to let out all of your frustrations slap it onto your working surface or about six seven times that is the key to making the victim respond maybe get to be airy and fluffy and then shape it into its final form I roll them out so that the two ends are a little bit thinner than the center I love the crunchy part so the end parts are actually my favorite and just continue to work so with all of the portions that you have cut once you have shaped all of the dough into its final shape you need to let it rest for a third time the third time is also going to be for about thirty minutes or until your dough has doubled in size so I put it back into the oven for 15 minutes with the oven lights on after 15 minutes I take it out of the oven and let it continue to rise for another 15 minutes on the counter top in the meantime I will preheat my oven to about 450 to 475 degrees Fahrenheit [Music] so this is the final product a beautiful crunchy soft and airy Vietnamese bunny but get mmm it looks delicious I know the shape is not all perfect but I promise you they all taste the same so I'm gonna get these rests for a couple of minutes before I cut them open to show you what the inside looks like now listen to the sound and the crunch of the but yet you can hear how crunchy it is on the outside if you love crunchy bread this is your recipe and look on the inside it's nice and airy and fluffy and it's just to die for we eat Vietnamese baguette too many many different dishes today I will show you how to a sample of Vietnamese says you barbecue pork but me sandwich we have some pickled daikon and pickled carrots nice tangy in crunchy I will show you the recipe to make pickled vegetables in the coming weeks start out with the bread my bread is hollowed out my daughter eat the inside and I can stuff more goodies on the inside put some sliced cucumbers into your pocket the pickled daikon and the pickled carrots some cilantro fresh herbs are really really important in Vietnamese cuisine spicy jalapenos if that's what you like and then the barbecue pork now you see that my homemade sassy barbecue pork does not have the red color that you would normally see with store barbecue pork that's because I do not use any artificial coloring to top off the Vietnamese baguette you want to put some Maggi seasoning on there this is a must you cannot skip the mega seasoning this makes the bottom you forget almost upon me forget you can get these at the Asian stores or even in the American grocery stores nowadays Europen me sandwich is ready to be equal it's absolutely delicious I hope

[Music] you", "EBsj34sEROY": "hi guys welcome back to my channel hope you guys are all having a great day welcome back to another day of Kush my stash and go ahead and like comment and subscribe if we haven't already if you're new here go ahead and turn those posts on applications to be notified every single time I post a new vendor today I will be showing you guys how to pack a bra code when I pack a little bit I already go ahead and start pushing it not too hard so you don't take out the filter just cuz I like an extra tight impact you're trying to pack as much as we can into this Rock Honan this is a classic rock home and I just basically started stuffing I'm pushing I'm not the best at this but this is what works for me and yeah not everybody obviously does it the same way I don't like um stuffing too much all at once because I feel like it's harder to go back and push everything in and make it tighter for example like if I were to wait build all this up and barely started stuffing it right here it would have been much harder it would have been loose from the bottom that makes sense we want to have everything evenly typed I usually pack my clones all the way to the end I'm just gonna go ahead and I actually learned this little trick I'm closing it a different way and twisting it up and from Louie okay mr. Tate see you simply you start pushing the XS and this makes the paper burn the burn start from the inside and it makes the joint burn and I've tried this out and he really does work so yeah credit to him for that little trick and now you guys know that", "gBnHXX2MH4Q": "well hey friends welcome back to the cabin today we're making homemade bread this is my favorite go-to bread recipe that i've been making probably over 30 something years and i actually found the recipe in the reader's digest back to basics and i've had this book a long long time it's showing some wear and tear but i'm going to walk you through the steps of making it from this particular recipe but these bread making steps will apply to any yeast breads that you're going to be making pretty much so but the first thing i wanted to talk to you about was the yeast that i use when you go to the grocery store a lot of times you will see something like this it's going to say flashman's active dry and it's going to be in a jar or probably more commonly you're going to see something like this is going to be in the envelopes now i because i make a lot of bread i'll buy it in the jars but i keep it in the refrigerator and if you do that you want to be sure to set it out and let it come to room temperature the reason this says active dry is because i have to activate it i'm going to proof it i want to make sure that it's good and i want to wake it up it's asleep so what i did was in the bowl that i'm going to mix my dough in i put about a quarter cup of very warm water you want it to be somewhere around 110 degrees you don't want it too hot because it can kill your yeast and i i place two and one quarter teaspoons of my yeast in the bowl and i also stirred in about a teaspoon of honey now you you can use the sweetener of your choice you can use organic sugar plain white sugar i use plain white sugar for years the reason that you're doing that is because as the yeast wakes up it wants something to eat and that's just going to help it help it proliferate and be happy and healthy but i want you to look here you can see it's been about 10 minutes and there's a nice vibrant foam on top and that is telling me that this yeast is active and very happy now if you do this and you don't get a foam something's gone wrong maybe your water was too cool your water was too hot or your yeast was bad so you don't want to use it if you don't get that nice healthy foam while my yeast was proofing i had two cups of buttermilk warming on the stove but now this buttermilk is is not the type of buttermilk the sour cultured buttermilk like you would find in the grocery store this is actually a byproduct of my butter making when uh the butter comes in the churn there are the solid butter fat and then the skim look skim milk that's left behind and then when i pour it all off i save it a lot of times because i use it for making bread and biscuits and stuff and so that's what i did i wore that on the stove with two tablespoons of butter and one tablespoon of salt but while my yeast was proofing i allowed it to cool down you kind of have to time it a little bit because i don't want it hot to pour it into my yeast mixture because it can kill the yeast and we've got beautiful yeast here so we don't want to do that so it's moderately warm no warmer than the water that we started with and we're gonna blend this in once we've got that blended well then we're gonna start adding our flour now we're gonna end up using somewhere between six and seven cups of flour and the reason you can't be exact with that is because flour uh reacts with the atmosphere if it's very humid your flour may absorb more moisture and it may take less flour if you're uh if your flour is dry your climate is dry those type of things can affect how much flour it's actually going to take to make your bread so you want to have available about six to seven cups and one thing about your bread same thing you want to be sure that it's room temperature you don't want cold bread out of the refrigerator and if you're like me sometimes i store some things in the refrigerator like that but you want to make sure that you set it out and it's at the same temperature as the air around it so i started with a cup and what i'm basically going to do here is i'm going to beat this one cup in just a little bit and then when it gets blended it's going to be lumpy that's okay because we're going to we're going to keep working and working and the lumps are going to all blend in and i like to do one cup at a time to start with so we're going to we're going to do a total of three and then i'm going to start gauging how much flour from there it's going to take and it smells wonderful there's just something about yeast bread it just it just it's a peacefulness smells of home and love it's just a it's one thing that my daddy used to love he could smell it i think it could smell it down the road when i was making bread all right so this is cup number four all right now you see that the dough is beginning to really get some thickness to it and it's even pulling away from the sides a little bit you want as much flour as you need to have a workable dough but you don't want so much flour that you have a heavy dough now this is cup number five i'm not gonna i'm not gonna put the whole cup in there because i'm gonna start working i'm i'm thinking it's very very hot and humid here right now and i'm thinking it may even take less than six cups because that's not even a full five cups in here and it's really getting some life to it and some thickness to it some body while we're kneading we may be adding flour then as well so i'm i'm going to say because those were not exact sifted cups of flour i'm thinking we're getting pretty close i'm going to finish this cup number five and i think that's gonna be it i'm gonna set some over here to have for dustin when i get ready to knead oh yes yes yes yes we don't want any more than that as a matter of fact i'm going to stop right there now you'll see that there is some flour on the dough it's not all incorporated but we're going to be needing that's going to work it in and for the first few rolls i'm not going to use the palms of my hands i'm just going to kind of quarter turn and fold and that's going to be something you want to remember quarter turn you're going to you're going to need in quarter turns okay so what i'm doing is just kind of working some of that flour in there okay now when i've done this a little bit just like that okay now i'm going to start using the palms of my hands and you want to push away from you quarter turn and push and when it gets a little sticky put a little bit more flour on your hands and as you work if you feel like you need to add a little flour you can sprinkle flour on i can see there's some wet spots in here so i may need to [Music] do [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] what you're looking for as you're kneading is a smooth elastic dough and so we're getting close to that it won't be sticky and in just a second we're going to do the windowpane test it's really getting firm and smooth and it's been pretty close to 10 minutes scoop me up some more flour all right let's try it again flying my hands you see how i can stretch it and it's not tearing that's what we're looking for and it's a little opaque you see that that's what we're looking for just a couple more twists and turns to incorporate that little piece back in there and we'll get ready for the first rise i'll be right back with you okay so now that we've got our dough nice and smooth and kneaded for about 10 minutes and we did our window pane test and we were able to stretch it really pretty thin and get it kind of transparent that let us know that we had needed long enough so the next thing that we're going to do is do the first ryzen so i'm going to take some ghee or clarified butter it's known as both that i actually made and i'll link to that video right here and i'm going to line this bowl with it pretty thick and we're going to place our dough in here and we're going to roll it around so it gets covered with this ski really well and what that's going to do is help prevent it from drying out as it's rising and what we're looking for is for it to double in bulk okay so we're going to roll it around this gee smells so good it smells like candied popcorn almost my little yorkie's helping you can tell okay so there you go so now it's covered in the ghee and it's got a good layer on it and i'm going to actually cover it with a cloth and set it in my pilot lit oven and i'll let it rest to rise for probably about an hour and 15 minutes to an hour and a half and we're just going to watch for it to double in bulk and when we get to that point i'll be back with you okay so now we're done with our first rising and i'm about to reveal what it looked like as soon as it came out of the oven and as you can see we had a very successful first rise and it was actually in there about an hour and 25 minutes so your next step when after your first rise and you can you see that you take your two fingers and poke in there and you can see that they did stay a little bit right there so they'll let you know but you can look you can tell by looking at this that it's uh a very healthy rise okay so now what we're to do we're going to punch it down you just hit it one time don't beat it up just one time and what we're doing is we're deflating it while that's deflating i'm going to sprinkle some fresh flour on the counter here and i actually did clean this off because i wanted to start with a fresh surface and we're going to roll this dough out onto this flower like that and we're going to knead it for about two minutes so i'm actually just going to kind of fold it a couple of times quarter turn and fold because i want to get a little bit of flour on it so it's easy to work with okay all right and then we're going to do the same thing we're going to do quarter turn take our palms and push away from us and you're gonna see bubbles pop up and some of them may even pop but we're just refining the grain by doing this and you can hear the air releasing sometimes and this is a different type of need it's going to be a little bit harder to do we're going to scoop up some of that flour to keep it workable but not much we want to still get by with the least amount of flour as possible excess flour makes your dough heavy and when i say two minutes that's relative you just kind of know when it's ready this is a very traditional bread recipe much like would have been made years ago when homemakers made their own loaf bread okay so i'm thinking that's about where we need to be seems to be smooth and elastic and what we're gonna do i'm gonna do this one more time put just enough to keep the dough from sticking we're gonna roll it into a ball like this and i'm going to take this great dough scraper and the the rounded edge of your dough scraper is actually well either side but this is actually a cutter can be used to divide your dough and we're going to divide it in half i'm going to go this way because it'll be a little bit easier for me and you just see how that just really is a great cutter makes a nice clean cut and what we're going to do now is we're going to take these two halves turn them into a roll them into a ball and we're going to let them sit here and we're going to cover them with a towel and let them rest for about five minutes and i'll be back for the next step okay so now that we've allowed this to rest for about five minutes we're going to roll out each section of dough individually and turn it into our loaf and get it ready for its second rising so i'm going to set this one off over here kind of out of the way so you can see a little bit more flour we want to be as sparing as possible and what we're going to do now is we're going to roll this out into a rectangle and it's very elastic you watch the dough how it works and it wants to kind of roll back into itself when you roll it out it doesn't want to really stay out and if you have a little less flour on your counter that will actually help it to grip and stay in shape better and we're still you can probably see we're still pushing out air and you noticed i didn't even put flour on my rolling pin i actually forgot to but you can see that our dough is in such good shape it's not even sticking all right so there's our rectangle and next what i'm going to do and you can kind of pull it with your hands and and keep your rectangle shape kind of even and we're going to roll it like this and see when we get down here to the end and if it does stick too much you can always grab your dough scraper and that will help you to ease it off of the counter all right so now we've got a nice rectangle shape i'm going to actually pinch the end and fold it under pinch the end and fold it under like this and place it into my loaf pan i prefer the pampered chef stoneware pans they just seem to conduct heat so much better they're thick and i haven't had any problems and i've had these for years and years and i haven't had any problems with my crust overcooking before the bread was done on the inside so these are my go-to bread pans so let's get our second one done get our second section of loaf done all right so we're gonna make our rectangle and i've got a pretty pretty good amount of flour on the counter this time so the rectangle may not stay quite as good as the other one because the other one was actually just gripping the counter a little bit which was helping it hold its shape and you can see here that this one's really trying to kind of pull back into itself but that's okay because as i roll it i'm gonna stretch the dough and make sure it stays in a pretty good rectangle so there you go so we've got that so what i'm going to do just like i did with the first one i'll stretch it a little bit and start rolling it you want your seam side down pinch the ends and fold them under okay and here's my second bread pan now what we're going to do is i have some melted butter and i'm actually going to paint the dough this is some of lily's wonderful butter we are so blessed with that wonderful little jersey milk cow and i get so many things from her sweet creamy milk and butter is one of them the ghee that we use is also another and i invite you to go and check out the videos on all of that and you might find them pretty interesting and one reason why we're putting the melted butter on top is for the same reason that we used the ghee before it's going to help keep the dough from drying out also the butter will help develop a wonderful crust on this bread all right so i'm kind of generous with the butter you can see that we love to just kind of lather it on see if there's any going to drip out of there no that was about the perfect amount so now what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to set these two pans back in the oven cover them with the same cloth and we're going to let them rise a second time but the second time will actually be about half as long as the first so we're looking at about 45 minutes before the 45 minutes is up i will actually pull them gently out of the oven because i don't want them to fall and set them on my stovetop and then i will preheat my oven i'll do that about maybe 10 minutes before time to put them in the oven but i want to stress that you want to pull them out very gently so that they don't fall and you'll set them on top of the stove preheat your oven to um the book says the recipe says 400 degrees but i have had better luck with my stove at 375. so let me get these put in the oven and i'll be back with you right before we set them in to bake them oh what we're going to do with these loaves because they're so fresh out of the oven and very very hot we're actually going to turn them out onto a rack so that they can cool and you want to cool them on their side if possible and what that's doing is actually oh those were hot allowing the bottom of the bread to cool and not get soggy but it's hard to resist just to take a slice out of it but this bread is very very hot and it's actually going to finish cooking over the next hour or so inside so you'll have a really fine grain on the inside but you'll have it wonderful crust on the outside well i hope you enjoyed this video as much as i enjoyed making it and i hope you found some useful information to help you become a better bread baker and if you're a beginner i hope you take that step and you step out with confidence and if you have some failures then you just pack those away as experience because one thing you're not going to fail at is filling your house with that wonderful aroma of fresh homemade bread and you just keep on and keep on and you're going to get it it's a skill that you can master i love to share how to make bread with as many people as i can because i think it's so a needful skill especially in these uncertain days i want to leave you with

grow clean cannabis coming back to you here on channel 4 2008 today we're going to be determining is West Coast cure cured joints aka pre-rolls really worth 15 bucks a pop I think it's affordable for a pre-roll 15 books in it really bad I feel like that's how much pre-rolled should be costing across every brand alright I just depends like what store you go to sometimes you can find a 3-pack for 25 bucks this string that we're going to be smoking on is wedding cake they say there's one whole gram in here the packaging I like I like the way it's like simple black it comes in like maybe like I don't know how you guys smoke or Medicaid but if you do blunt this is like what a pack looks like for one so that's why I like it opening it up it has a really pungent smell to it like a very very strong weed smell loving the tasting west coast here I love west coast care brands you can never go wrong with west coast here whether it's a pin a pre-roll dabbing and I just really like this I cannot wait to spark this up this smells like wedding cake cookie actually so we're gonna spark this up my roommate bought me a new laptop for the channel I'm so excited so we're actually going to set up the laptop it sparked this at the same time see how highly actually okay so if you're not getting high right now whip up that blunt you've got that joint you've got that read and let's get it okay I'm gonna actually cut this pre-roll open just like the tip and then we can break it down the last 30 seconds of the video and see what's inside the taste is impeccable like this like I said the smell of the stream was fruity and pastry at the same time and that's what I'm getting from the taste to zone actually was gifted this laptop because I was complaining about editing and that's another reason why I haven't been even posting first simply cannot edit well the slow computer that I have so I'm gonna take this over and flip it over this is the Microsoft Surface go I wanted this laptop I didn't think I was gonna get it like I could literally like kiss my roommate for doing this for me like I have some great friends down he also got me this awesome board so that this is so complex like I cannot figure out open this we are in business we are in business and I'm so excited you guys are like this I couldn't leave a comment down below are you a joint person are you a boring person honestly I think I'm moving towards that's my preference what is yours again leave a comment down below I'm so into that type of stuff just knowing about you okay channel 420 so you know I wasn't gonna let you go anywhere without getting to the bottom of this print roll no I said I was gonna break it down and show you guys what was on the inside so there you have it honestly it was just a regular bud nothing special but shout out to West Coast cure for not giving us no nasty mid-shelf bud this is actually some premium bud good see those nice crystal lose nice colors and then here's your wrap just to tip a whole joint wrap yeah shout out you guys subscribe [Music]", "lgtNsrSizn4": "bread don't okay to hear this guy's this is how you make french bread so basically my dolls already done now I'm just spreading a little bit I'm squeezing almost like that at the same time okay I like the sushi roll first you're gonna want to push this world inside with your finger and pinch and then with this seam you're almost gonna have the same idea where you close it and pinch it or else it'll unravel yeah when you bake it so can you get it from the top sinking show huh mm-hm so you can see the difference here it's almost like a little raised Mountain yeah and then here you can see it still a little flap here okay yeah so you're just gonna continue to make sure you have no holes nothing peeking out because in New York you'll be able to do this because the dough is still soft from rising after you make the deal and on this side you're gonna want to do the same thing good idea

from food wishes comm with how to make your own sandwich rolls that's right during our recent and what the critics are calling groundbreaking bond me video i promised to show you how to make your very own homemade french rolls or is there more generically called sandwich rolls and that's exactly what i'm going to do and while these rolls won't be nearly as expensive as the ones from the store or contain all those additives and preservatives I still think you're really going to enjoy these and as you're about to see they are very very easy to make so let's go ahead an get started with the dough and to do that we'll toss a package of dry active yeast into the bowl of our stand mixer and to that we will add our warm water and we'll give that a mix and then usually we wait about ten minutes to see if the yeast is active but this time I didn't do that the yeast was brand new plus I was feeling kind of lucky so I proceeded to the last two ingredients some bread flour and sure you can use all-purpose here I mean it is afterall called all-purpose but if you have it I do prefer the texture using bread flour here and then last but not least we'll toss in some salt and that's it at this point what we'll do is grab our dough hook and head over to the stand mixer where we will knead this all together for about five minutes until we have a nice smooth soft slightly but not too sticky dough and if everything's gone according to plan it should look something like this and one clue that you did good see how the dough pulls away clean from the sides of the bowl as well as that dough hook that generally means you have just enough flour alright so if it seems like it's still a little bit wet and it's still kind of smearing or sticking to the bowl just toss in a little more flour but mine was looking just about right and assuming you've achieved something very similar what we'll do next is kind of form this into a smooth ball and we'll transfer that back into our bowl and then as usual we'll add just a few drops of vegetable oil and rub that all over our dough ball as well as the inside of the bowl which theoretically prevents the dough from drying out during the rising which is the next step so let's go ahead and cover that and transfer it to some warm draft-free place for about an hour to an hour and a half or until it doubles in size and as usual I just use the inside and my turned off oven and assuming our yeast was as active as we suspected about an hour to an hour and a half later your dough should look like this and then what we do at this point is poke it with our fingers to deflate it which is a lot of fun but completely unnecessary since we're also going to transfer this to a lightly floured work surface and kind of press it down into some sort of rectangle shape so what we're doing here would have deflated that dough anyway but having said that one of the great joys of making your own bread dough is poking it with your fingers after it's risen so enjoy yourself but anyway like I said we're going to press that down in some kind of uniform shape which is hopefully going to make it a little easier to divide this in the equal portions so I'm going to cut mine in half and then each half into three to make six rolls and by the way pro tip if you have a digital scale you can weigh all your dough in grams and then divide by six and then use that number to portion your dough exactly so once baked each roll would be pretty much exactly the same size so if you're into perfection that's one way you can do it or you can just I it like I usually do but anyway we'll divide that up into six equal portions and then by using our cupped hand in a circular motion we will roll those into six dough balls as smooth and his uniform as we can get them and then what we want to do at this point is cover these with a clean dry cloth and let them rest 15 minutes before we try to shape our rolls so we will fast forward about fifteen minutes at which point our dough should look like this so those will have risen just a little bit but we mostly did that to let the dough relax and then what we're going to do at this point is take one of those balls and press it out into sort of an oval rectangle there's probably a name for an over rectangle but I'm not sure what it is but anyway we'll flatten that out with our fingertips until we have something about six or seven inches wide and then we'll simply roll it up nice and tight like this and no need to be concerned about this seam that's going to pretty much disappear as we roll this and if not we'll make sure that ends up on the bottom and then what we'll do to finish these off is kind of taper the tips and how we'll do that is by angling our hands at about a forty-five degree angle and by applying a little extra pressure as we roll from the center out you should fairly easily form some nice pointy tips which for me gives these French style sandwich rolls their signature shape so like pretty much everything else in life that is optional but it only takes a couple seconds and is very easy so why wouldn't you do it but regardless once those are shaped we can transfer those onto a parchment lined baking sheet and we don't under crowd those so I'm going to do two pounds or three and once those are panned up they're ready for the Rize so we'll cover those with some clean dry towels and let those sit for about an hour or until they're doubled in size at which point hopefully they look something like this and then before we pop these in the oven we have to do two very important things the first of which would be to cut a slash down the length with a very very sharp knife and despite the weird stay near the top I like to use this knife that was Michelle's great-grandfather's because it's long thin and extremely sharp but I should mention an old-fashioned razor blade will do the same thing and we want to go in at about a 45 degree angle about a quarter-inch deep somewhere between the side and the top so that first one I did was a little too far down towards the side so those last two were a little better and please note these are not just for decoration although that's part of it but that slice is going to allow that crust to kind of expand as he's baked which really is an important factor for giving them the proper texture and then besides lacerating the dough the other thing we need to do before these go in the oven is spritz them with a little bit of water okay we just want some plain water in a spray bottle and we will give those a misting all over which is going to help form our crust and then once our rolls have been properly spritzed we can go ahead and transfer those into the center of a 450 degree oven for about 20 minutes and no you weren't seeing things there was a pan of water on the bottom of the oven and that's there for the same reason we sprayed our bread before we put it in that moisture in the oven helps develop the crust and then what we'll do about halfway through the cooking time well open the oven and give those a turn as well as one more spray of water so let's go ahead and rotate those pans which hopefully you'll accomplish much faster than I did I am surprisingly uncoordinated but anyway we'll give those a turn and then one more spray of water which I almost forgot but I didn't so we will give those one more spritz and we will push those back in and let those bake for another 10 minutes or so or until you're looking at a couple pans of the most beautiful sandwich rolls you've ever seen which is what I have right here and at this point we're almost done all we need to do now is transfer these to Iraq and let them cool completely before we try to cut them or tear them open or if you cut these while they're still piping hot you're going to lose a lot of moisture so please let these cool all the way down to room top before you try to cut into them or in my case tear into them and that right there my friends I think is the perfect sandwich roll we have that gorgeous thin chewy crust surrounding wood is a beautifully light and airy inside for me just the perfect combination for any kind of sandwich work and please keep in mind this is a techniques video and even though I showed you a dough at the beginning you really can make these with any bread recipe you want I mean you guys are the doctor Scholl's of your sandwich rolls and speaking of feet that reminds me our ciabatta bread which means slipper bread would probably work really nicely here but anyway that's it no matter which dough you use or what kind of sandwich you make from the exotic bound me to your common everyday run in the middle tuna sub I really do hope you give these a try soon so head over to food wishes comm for all the agreed amount and more info as usual and as always enjoy", "hOr8Tj_fHSs": "hey kids we're back again today we're gonna be taking a look at some pre-rolled joints

wants to do that anymore so let's let's change that welcome everybody this is anthony with boveda joined today by cody ziering with pac case how the hell are you buddy i'm good i'm good i'm coming off vacation so i'm still uh still a little bit of vacation mode um which is always a fun little area to be in no doubt uh best part about vacation is on the way their worst part of vacation is coming back to the office and seeing 18 000 emails waiting for you it happens all the time i know yeah so it's just been pitchforking out of that but um things are good yeah there's a lot going on here a lot of things to talk about today absolutely industry's booming boveda is booming pack cases booming let's get to it where do you want to start i mean you want to start with i guess how we kind of ran into each other years ago yeah absolutely this has been a long time coming no doubt um where was that i think mj biz vegas 2017 maybe yeah okay um yeah you guys what launched in 2016. just about yeah we uh we we came up with the idea very very early on like january 2nd 2016 we were still working for a vertically integrated cannabis company right near aspen colorado great experience gave us great insight into the industry and really what the cannabis market kind of demands uh and everything has come from there it was like it was one of my first very first trade shows i think when i walked over and saw you guys um it was a funny story we we bumped into you uh quite literally um saw your shirt and were like oh we know bobito we love that and we just started talking with you brett and i actually got invited brett's my business partner everybody in case uh nobody nobody knew that uh brettgelfan shout out to you buddy um brett and i actually went to that convention for free the cannabis company had purchased tickets for us and we had left before the show happened so we got to go on their dime and you know that's kind of when our world turned around and how did you how did you guys get into the space again um what was your background before pack case funny funny story uh i was working tech i was uh working for apple at the time i was an engineer um doing some annoying stuff on the phones with in between customers and engineering kind of realized that uh corporate life wasn't for me i needed a change and i was helping brett work on some website for some cannabis company uh two weeks later he said hey we need a director of marketing are you interested i jumped on the opportunities like all right we'll pack your stuff and get to colorado next month uh time to start so went out there a little bit of nepotism uh brett's uh brett's dad my dad and the guy that hired us have all been friends for 30 35 years i guess he wanted some smart cheap labor at the time and that's uh kind of how we got our invitation but a few months later unfortunately he got sick and it put brett and i in a position where we were running the show uh in our young 20s which is absurd to put 20 year olds in charge of a 15 million cannabis company but hey you know you got to do what you got to do in business it sure is yeah we have a similar story too um you know i want to hear it how did you get started please yeah no i was i was in tech as well like straight out of college um under the fluorescent lights in a cube sea of cubes and i was like oh yes i'm getting out of school i'm gonna you know work and sell stuff and pay off my loans and you know it's a big fortune 500 company and uh after about a year and a half you know i was going through started out as like uh you know basically a quote guy you know early on learning the sales process and then moved through quickly but i know i wanted to to sell and to really own accounts and quarterback stuff and i talked to my boss and he's like well that's probably eight to ten years away for you and so i'm like oh i can be patient but uh not that patient [Laughter] and uh yeah luckily family friends um one of my family friends lived down the street from my cousin again nepotism here lucky right place right time but um kate holstein who's in charge of our international business she's been uh she actually got me to sidetrack even more she got me my first job um working like as a banquet server at weddings and so i've just i've known her since i was a kid basically and she's like hey i worked this company boveda and um now we make these humidity control packs we're in the cannabis space we're in the tobacco market and we're in the music industry and i heard those three things i said cool i mean yeah i'm in so i interviewed with them long story short um you know as employee number 12 and i think we're over 65 now and that was just four and a half years ago so um really fun fun place to work similar stories here we're basically um very similar in what we do our products and our services are very complementary to the things we're trying to address here to the cannabis industry 100 peanut butter and jelly uh especially for for pre-rolls we make something that's uh great for protecting them and you guys make sure that they stay fresh and tasty for as long as absolutely possible longer than most thought would be possible exactly so anthony i mean we've been talking we've known each other for a long time but really i don't know the the story behind boveda how how did that come about what is it like tell everybody what bovita is yeah so um it's a really simple product and that's that's what uh that's what we like most about it but it's very effective and it works pretty well um it started 25 years ago a couple of guys in the tobacco business they were cigar smokers saw a problem with uh humidification one-way humidification for regulators for cigar humidors um they said there's got to be a better way to do this so they worked um with a couple of engineers from general mills here in minnesota on coming up with a product that's able to basically self-control it's not you you don't have to add anything to it um and it's a two-way controller so in a deficit environment it'll add humidity and then when there's not enough it'll or when there's too much it'll it'll absorb some too so it's it's really getting rid of those peaks and hills and valleys of humidity um and so that that technology started for the like i said for the the cigars and tobacco business and then over time and we i'm sure this has been talked about on many of our other podcasts but um you know we started seeing these tobacco stores uh selling a lot of products in northern california um to the traditional market and um there's like wow there's there's a demand for this on the cannabis space too and that was probably 10 12 years ago now um and so we came up with our our 62 formula and um you know from there the the technology has really stayed the same but we've been finding out more about how this technology can um you know not just protect weight and help you know manage the moisture content or water activity but to also preserve terpenes and trichome integrity so it's been fun to to watch how it's how it's grown and what we've learned um that's that's really fun there's a huge feast of thought culture here feast of learning love of learning um that's that's something that's at our very core um and we have a lab down in um the basement of our hq here where a lot of these tests are being ran we have a lot of partners um different labs across the states and even internationally that help run tests and it's it's really cool uh so yeah that's you know it's a bit of a ramble there but that's uh no it it it sounds super cool i mean we did we've we've been doing r d on our products for four years you know always trying to come up with new stuff but we just have to make a really interesting design and make sure it's structurally integral you guys you have to do some chemical engineering which i can only imagine just ups the level of difficulty by you know to the umpteenth degree so good for you guys it's great that you guys can do everything downstairs and run humidity tests and i know that's a great segue into what we'll we'll talk about next because you can't really run a humidity test without measuring what you're trying to contain the humidity within uh which kind of leads me on to what we do over a pack case and we make these really amazing joint cases this is one of our awesome hemp clients father obsidian but check this out we call this product a jpeg it's our flagship so you'll notice inside this is what's amazing to bovida and everyone who uses it there's a gasket seal that lines the actual case to hold five payrolls um so when you close it you can actually hear the click that's how you know it's sealed and then our favorite part not so boveda is central but we have a extra little place that you can store roaches so you can't finish a joint you don't want to stink up the rest of uh the fresh ones inside the pack that was a really cool idea um so as we were developing this the whole reason we put a gasket in there was to make sure that pre-rolls stayed fresh unfortunately in this industry the pre-roll has been an underutilized product skew for so long such an easy product to produce it's something that from a beginner to an intermediate to a super heady everyone loves smoking joints everyone loves smoking bloods and when we first got in the industry back in 2016 everyone was just taking trim that shitty extra leftover whatever stuffing in a pre-roll and saying okay good enough today now it's totally different story people use only flower premium everything sometimes they're even caviar which means that they may have a core with some hash or are wrapped with some keef and some extra little bits on the outside and can exceed retail values of over 50 bucks in fact last time i was in vegas at the show we went to a dispensary planet 13 and they were selling a can of cigar for a thousand dollars uh so the pre-roll game has totally evolved now think about this anthony what would what would you do if you went out you bought a blood that was a thousand dollars and it was dry i would immediately want to return it right and can you probably not probably not so products like that have to be in something that's airtight and gasket sealed and if you're doing it the right way you have a bill vita pack in there as well yeah no doubt um you you brought up some really interesting stuff cody um do you mind expanding a little bit on how you've seen um you know we're we're more on the you know we certainly work with a lot of companies that manufacture pre-rolls um but also you know people that are just packaging grams or eighths or quarters or ounces or pounds um but it seems you know i mean you guys have a focus on pre-rolls do you want to elaborate on how that's changed throughout like the last four or five years um you know going into this more premium stuff versus just the consumable hey you know the dispensary is running a deal and you get a free pre-roll and it's kind of just like everyone expects oh it's it's probably gonna be dry it's probably not gonna taste very good but i mean how is it where is it changed and where is it changing where is it going yeah absolutely like i had said before when we first got into it no one really cared they just took a pre-roll they were sometimes even making them in the dispensary with leftover whatever after bagging out you know an eighth for a customer there's maybe another gram or two in the jar so the manager said screw it let's grind it up throw it in some pre-rolls and now we can sell it today the pre-roll is a main sku in the industry i think it accounts for maybe 10 15 20 somewhere in there depending on the month of total cannabis sales in the entire country so clearly they're here to stay and it's a product that people love so very quickly back in 2016 and 17 when we were starting pack case we realized that the pre-roll was super underutilized it wasn't really given the appreciation that it should have i mean it's a top level sku it's a real money maker and it doesn't take a lot of money to actually start producing them so we created our product because there wasn't any premium offerings like i said everyone was just throwing [ __ ] in a tube and or a bag and that was it there really wasn't like a uh a big demand for people asking for quality pre-rolls and we didn't understand that because as pre-roll enthusiasts someone who we smoke joints all the time especially when we went skiing or out for hikes or whatever joints are the way to go um no one really had anything that was nice or worth talking about bringing home so instead we just buy flour and roll our own but it left a huge amount of market opportunity for all these cannabis companies who weren't doing something to make a premium sku that addresses a huge market need so there was an incredible amount of demand and no supply whatsoever and that's where pac case came in to fill the gap and give opportunities to companies like this to be able to sell a premium pre-roll so was pac case kind of born on the mountain per se it's funny uh we quickly came up with the idea late at night uh the second night that brett and i had ever met um just because we were talking about going skiing and taking joints before we ever had a prototype uh i had actually uh three or four joints like in my chest pocket um took a little kicker while i was skiing and totally yard sale ate [ __ ] skis went flying worst part though uh i was kind of hurt and the joints were all broken so not only was i like in pain i couldn't smoke so it was it was rough so brett and i very quickly jumped on finding someone to help us out with the design and we quite literally used our prototype our very first one which i have right here super basic shitty design but uh this i used for an entire winter to hold pre-rolls and make sure that they wouldn't break so connor was uh was born out of uh two things a we needed a person we had a personal need we needed to be able to carry joints on the mountain or going for hikes or wherever uh and at the same time we knew that the cannabis market needed it too so it was a little bit of a selfish uh build it was kind of doing it for us and then realized there was a business behind it too that's that's exactly it though i mean that's how great products and ideas are born what's what's uh what's a problem i'm facing in my world today like some broken pre-rolls and then you know there's gonna be thousands of other people that have the same problem so cool stuff i've always loved your guys products um and you guys um you have your your five pack obviously what's what's more of your consumer facing um your duo right do you have you don't have a single though because who's gonna smoke a single joint i mean you're always gonna have one for a buddy so you would think that we uh we do have a we may or may not i cannot confirm or deny that we have a single in the works um but it won't be ready for a while if in fact we're working on something uh really though like one is never enough right like two is always better than one three is better than two and [ __ ] if you can have five will have five um so it's it's what's most amazing and what i find most interesting about our product and why it it works so well on both sides of the aisle um it's a packaging product it was always developed to be a packaging product and whole allow cannabis companies to sell pre-rolls but over the course of a year or two as we were our social media was growing and people were starting to find out about what we were doing people started asking for these just like hey i don't live in a cannabis state how do i get one um so we put them up on amazon and let it ride and uh two years later we've sold you know more than 50 000 units and are absolutely crushing a thousand reviews which blows my mind and we have over four and a half stars which on a product intended for packaging that gets sold as an accessory yeah blows my mind every time 100 and um one thing that i've always loved about your guys product is that um you know you can you can customize it um you know the the business can go put their branding on it and customize it however they want um that's a huge thing especially up in canada and some other markets that um you know they can't necessarily advertise or brand do you have any experience there um helping companies really market their brand with your guys packaging technology i'm glad that you asked that anthony pack case technically is a packaging company right that's the product that we sell but really when you get down to things we consider ourselves a marketing company we give our clients an ability to brand and promote products in ways that they wouldn't be able to before our packaging may be slightly more expensive than everyone else on the market but that's obviously because it's a premium feel what other packaging can go out and say hey i sell for 20 on amazon but instead you can come to my dispensary take five of my best highest quality joints with delicious flour have my brand on it and then now go and walk around with it so we give these companies not just an opportunity to create beautiful packaging that's going to create an amazing customer experience but we also allow their customers to then become a walking advertisement for their company think about it you buy a jpack from somebody that means you have five joints so you take one joint out to smoke with a friend well you're obviously gonna close the pack put it back in your pocket again you still have four left so you're gonna hold on to the packaging for a long time which means anytime you smoke with somebody and you take that out your brand as a company gets exposed to their friend who's now likely to become a customer their self themselves yeah well and let's let's back up to a second so let's talk about um the premium aspect so and what that value can can mean not only to a business but to the consumer so your guys you go i mean let's and we can even back up to that leap down study that we helped you guys do so that by let's explain this to the the people so yeah boba can take uh packaging and put it into a um a dry chamber put above the pack in there and then we can basically estimate the shelf life or stability how long the boba packs can last how long the product is going to stay fresh um versus no active humidity control versus having a boat pack in there and then we can compare that um against the control and give you hey this is going gonna you know add an extra week two weeks a month some cases um let's should we chat about uh how that went and what that kind of means for brands and consumers as far as you know brands are gonna be able to go into more inventory and that's something that we've seen on on the boveda side is um you know a big concern or a big problem facing a lot of these operators was hey we're just trying to get product on the shelf because the supply and demand chart is totally kitty wampus and you know we've had cultivators operators say we're we're trying to like they're torn especially these commercial ones because they want to have a longer cure on their their flower and they wanna couldn't really control that quality um but then they have um people in the supply chain saying hey this dispensary's been out of said strain this amount of flour for x amount of days and like we just we need to get on the shelf it's just flying off the shelf that we have seen as i have seen personally that's kind of slowing down and people are able to go into more inventory and carry more um but our products together can help assure that that shelf life is there and so product isn't sitting for two three months and then it's sold dry that's one of the benefits of being able to use pack case and boveda together um these operators who you know think about it if you have a production team of 10 well you don't necessarily want to have two people doing pre-rolls and two people doing edibles and spread out your labor force a lot of the times it's more efficient and our clients have told us this that you know i want to put my entire production team have them do an entire run start to finish bang it out and then move on to the next project now when you do that with flour with pre-roll with something that's not necessarily super shelf stable like a concentrate or an edible you have to have velocity so not only do you have to package it up quickly you have to get it out the door you have to get it to the dispensary they have to shelve it and then they have to get it out to the consumer now that process can take a lot longer than it would take a cannabis to dehumidify and then dry out lose terpenes lose flavor lose potency and mess with um with effects right like if uh some thc converts into cbd that flower that you smoke once it's converted is gonna make you feel totally different than if it didn't exactly so with boveda and pack case because they're such a tremendous seal these producers have the ability to make an entire run of pre-rolls leave them in their factory if they have to and as long as it's properly sealed and the boveda pack is fresh these pre-rolls are going to last a lot longer which means that their production problems that come along with having to do massive runs and then making it like sit on it as opposed to doing smaller runs and moving them quicker and making a regular process makes life a lot easier for them they can sit down bang out all of their pre-rolls that they need for a month and two days and then not have to worry about the quality at all because of the protection that pacquiao boveda provides yeah and a term that comes to mind that i hear a lot is consistency um and that's that's what a lot these brands want to deliver because they know in a lot of these markets especially on the east coast where i've been working predominantly it's medicine so uh you know it's if you can the cannabis plant in the flower is not a it's not a pill and it's very volatile and so like you said um you start getting that trichome degradation and you're gonna lose medicinal benefits um and it's like you know going to get your prescription and your short your short two pills and there's an extra one magical pill tossed in there you know it's like you you want to make sure that the product is consistent and delivered same same smell same taste same flavor same effect every time and uh yeah i think i think our our two products definitely can help um in that in that regard absolutely cannabis obviously is a product that affects headspace and if you find something that works for you and you find something that you like you want to make sure that if you buy it again it's going to have the same exact effect uh there's only one way to do that in terms of flour and pre-rolls and that's control the humidity making sure that the product stays the same on day one as it is on day 30 and potentially even out to day 60s so it's important i know that a lot of people that consume cannabis for medical reasons um which there are many that's how this whole industry really started right um they need that they need consistency of dose they need consistency of effect and you can only do that by controlling terpene and humidity content right yup yup there's no doubt about that and then um you know let's another thing that i've been seeing um and sorry this is so salesy just because that's the world that i live in every day is just sales but um you know competition between brands um i i like to think of the cannabis industry as a more friendly um competition uh than any than any other industry that i've been in or or seen where it's you know really we're we're all in this together with one common goal and that's to bring uh relief to a lot of people and liberty to a lot of people um to do what they want with their lives consume what they want and um just not step on anyone else's toes but competition on shelf space um is the pack case boveda combo is that something that people can use to set their their brands apart from others is that can you take these these two common value adds and educate the consumer to say hey i'm gonna my pre-rolls are gonna probably be better in here by the time i get them depending on when they were packaged and you know i'm gonna have an extra two three weeks to go through these um with the boveda pack and then you know i have the pack case forever um these are these are things that consumers care about and are gonna want is that messaging from the consumer is that getting driven to these brands that are making these decisions on packaging yet it's a good question some of the brands who really have a premium focus and a premium attention absolutely they understand that their customers keep coming back to them because their products are so good some of the there's a lot of a lot unfortunate but there's a lot of cannabis companies out there that really don't cater to a premium market um and don't really care about the quality of their products um you know like i said a lot of them are still back in the model of 2016. let's take any leftover [ __ ] that we have let's toss it in a pre-roll put it in the doob tube and just send it whatever happens happens i don't know about you but whenever i consume something that affects headspace uh alcohol cannabis whatever else it may be i always want to make sure that i'm getting something that's quality and consistent um price isn't so much uh a concern of mine right i would much rather pay an extra 20 or 30 bucks to know that uh the quality that i'm getting is there versus having to deal with some [ __ ] for a much cheaper cost i believe that if you're gonna intake something it should only be the the best quality you know it's affecting you like you as yourself not a car not a house you and your health so for me as a consumer i always want to make sure i'm getting high quality and i think that there's a lot of companies that value my sentiment and cater towards a client like me when you have a customer that doesn't you end up with shitty product and that creates a negative loop sure you're going to get the sale once or twice because it's a cheap product but i doubt that person's coming back to you there's no consistency there's no flavor it's all dry harsh smoke it's no good no one likes that yeah and that's i think that's changing too i think as more people get introduced to cannabis i mean we talk about all these people taking baby steps i mean i was down in in florida i had a dispensary doing a visit and i i witnessed what i always knew was going on down there but never had witness for myself which was a woman that looked just like my grandma going into a dispensary for the first time and she has all of her paperwork and she looks at the the person at the front desk and she's kind of you know pretty coy and her her husband's behind her um you know they're just kind of looking around and she goes i'm here to um purchase some marijuana it's so cool to see that but there's so many people that need to be become educated on you know multiple different aspects of cannabis um but it's there's so many new people coming into it and uh that's that's a that's a big piece of the education piece and you know knowing what you're consuming how it's gonna make you feel um you know what you like essentially there are a lot of people figuring out what they like and um you know here in minnesota it's tough for me uh because we don't have um you know like we don't have adult use here so i can't just go in and say hey you know i'm wanting this today and that's uh that's something that a lot of new states are having which is is great um and uh sorry i kind of lost my train of thought here it's all good those are those were always my fate when when i was back at the cannabis company those are always my favorite people you know there were times and days where you know as just a higher level employee at the company uh the dispensary was short-handed so i'd have to go in there and maybe put a quick shift in and just talk to cool people about wheat all day it was honestly not a bad way to uh spend a couple hours outside of my normal role my favorite customers were always the older folks who really had never id any idea they'd walk in they'd always be like hey can i like can i buy some weed yeah and it's like you don't have to whisper it's legal welcome to the cannabis store let me show you what what are you what are you interested in what would you like to try are you interested in smoking something would you like to vape something would you like to try an edible it's always great introducing those people to the entire world something that as an enthusiast we've been living for decades right but i don't want to date myself but [ __ ] it's been a long time um yeah it's it's it's remarkable the clearly the direction of the country the world is totally changing our neighbors up to the north were a lot smarter than we were legalized a lot quicker and look what happened now they have five or six companies in cannabis worth over a billion dollars you ever think that there'd be a unicorn in cannabis now there's five it's insane yep ellen what do you think is i mean comparing the canada to the u.s right now um especially these last couple weeks um just these these larger operators and what what is that what does this mean for cannabis in 2021 um as far as these these bigger companies you know that and you know four or five years ago in the grassroots cannabis movement semi grassroots cannabis movement um you know a lot of it was the the buzz around trade shows in the industry was all these you know these big companies are gonna come in and they're gonna start getting swooped up and the commercialization does cannabis in your opinion cody does it kind of model what happened uh recently this last decade with beer craft beer and you know your big domestic beer is there gonna be a commercial side of cannabis and then also room for the craft cultivator um that's really focused on small quality good stuff um that's gonna be competing against you know price and volume from some of these giants that's a great question the beer model is one that is perfect to use as an analogy um i think myself a lot of these major cannabis companies are swooping up a lot of the smaller ones there's a lot of conglomeration that's going on in the industry obviously when you kind of grow as a company or you want to expand you either need additional growth space which requires additional licensing so a lot of the small guys or the guys that were in quickly did some decent growing started as a startup and made it to mid-sized company those are ideal acquisition targets for the big boys so i think what's going to happen at least the next three four years is that all the big boys are going to start to swoop up a lot of the smaller guys that's where you emerge the budweiser the coors light all the the general high volume lower quality lower price type products from that will come the grassroots movement again so i think everything is going to kind of go underground for a little while and all these craft companies in maybe three four years will start to emerge when people really care about quality and it's not so much about bottom dollar anymore yeah we have a huge canadian client that we love working with when we first started with them they had a huge huge initiative and focus on innovation it was 2018 they had an opportunity to really try and control the market with an innovative awesome product uh cost was no object they said [ __ ] it we want the coolest best highest quality product that we can provide and it worked out great for them they quickly jumped into one of the leaders positions in the industry in canada and everything was was great it towards the end of 2019 and then with uh early covid uh early 2020 uh their share price fell dramatically they were you know their balance sheets showed that they were just outlaying cash left and right for the innovation without necessarily realizing that when you spend so much on innovation it takes a long time for it to come back right roi on innovation is a year year and a half process minimum for us for example you know we started designing jpeg trio in 2018 it didn't get launched until you know mid 2019 it took 12 16 months 18 months to get the product out there so with this cannabis company even though they were so amazingly focused on innovation for the first part once legalization happened now they realize that it's all about bottom dollar and how do we reduce cost of goods so now instead of trying to produce flowers that may be tastier but take an extra two weeks now they're producing lower quality genetics that harvest faster that they can just turn around and sell and cheaper packaging and i think that's now the start of where you see the the budweiser and the the coors lights versus like uh you know a small batch brewing company really focused on delivering a delicious tasty product i mean one has consistency one has flavor yup but you know which would you prefer to drink budweiser or the the local craft beer pretty easy decision in my opinion yeah well for me too it's a time and place thing sometimes uh you know being from minnesota and uh going up to the cabin a busch light just kind of brings you back you know i love those you mean can't hate on that i'm a big coors guy i went to school in colorado spent a few years in co i love course especially like any tailgate absolutely but then you know you're trying to drink 16 18 beers potentially and really have yourself an afternoon that's not so much the case when you're drinking something that's a little bit tastier and perhaps next to a steak and maybe you're gonna have one or two very different days though the pairing is everything bingo and the season two i'm a big seasoned guy when it comes to those things absolutely you brought up uh i don't know how much time we have here ramsay um but you brought up uh kovid um how do you think that's been um impacting i guess pros and cons um your guys customers people you've been working with um you know if i can touch briefly i can just say what i've noticed is um i think a lot of these quality things sops standard practices best practices a lot of these procedural things are starting to really get drilled into um on paper and people are starting to like really figure their their [ __ ] out um and that's i think making a little bit extra room for products and services that focus on true value-add and um you know roi that you know we can bovada specifically too can can really tell you hey your flower your inventory your entire inventory weighs this today um and here's the percent moisture content um if you added two percent moisture content to that entire inventory here's the literal change in fair market value of your inventory i think those things now it's not it's not everything's not moving so fast where it's hey package it get it you know it doesn't matter if it cures on the shelf whatever we just we got to get it in stores because we don't have any and people are buying it anyway um i think covid kind of or the lockdown specifically um kind of help people really look at their what they're doing their day-to-day operations and where they can make changes have you guys noticed that too absolutely it gave you know business operators a chance to sit back and not be surrounded by the buzz of a hopping office and they actually had a few moments to think about like hey what can we do better what can we do to improve like our everything our process is top to bottom from growing the production of packaging to sales yeah um what's interesting is that you know this is what makes me happy is that a lot of the country deemed cannabis in a central industry um okay would you ever have been able to imagine that 10 years ago probably not i mean even back in 2014 but government said hey people need cannabis especially in california and all the cannabis companies stayed open so i think having those cannabis restrictions that got imposed on everybody required all these business operators to really sit back and understand how can we do things more efficiently because [ __ ] i used to run my growing operation with 40 people well now i can only have 15 in the building so how are we still going to manage the same output but with less than half of the labor staff forces you to sit back and really think about what you're doing and if you guys are cutting short you know corners trying to take a shortcut when that's not necessarily the best thing to do or neces or even necessary you know small little changes in process like adding a movita pack into your curing box can potentially generate an extra 300 000 a year for a mid-sized cannabis company it's substantial and that tiny little you know how much could that really end up costing you a couple thousand dollars over the course of a year when you can end up you know that can let you back a couple hundred thousand so a lot of these guys with cannabis you just you've been running and like you you ever try and get on a treadmill when it's set at 10 you there's no warm-up time you just have to get down and start sprinting yeah college a couple times yeah i'm not sure if those ended well but that's that's what working in a cannabis company is like the moment that your product goes out the door for the first time it's off to the races you have now an endless uh endless demand for your product and you have to continuously handle that that with good supply um and they don't haven't had a lot of time to think about it as soon as they got on that treadmill it's just off to the races full sprint covent gave them a chance to sit back take a second step off the treadmill and try and figure out what they should actually be doing yeah i completely agree um definitely notice that as well on our end um all right cody uh what's next for paccase great question we have a couple cool new packaging products coming out but that's not really what what tickles me i get very excited about the consumer market i love bringing products to people that will actually use it so we have a really awesome new case that should be launching the next five six months uh think jpac an iphone had a baby that's about all i can touch on it yeah well that's uh that's intriguing um because i think i think i know where that's going um don't wanna don't want to speculate too much but um and where can you pick these up so i know you said amazon um i know you guys have uh point of purchase displays too so i'm assuming that it's this is getting into more mass retail absolutely yeah we uh we sell in a couple different places you can go out and check uh jpac products out on amazon number one uh our shopping website packcase.com i'm sorry packcase.shop you can get there from packcase.com as well um and now they're we're starting to be available in retailers so there's a whole bunch of distributors starting to pick these up so you should start seeing them in retail stores over the next few months and if you're a retailer and interested in picking up our products we have a wonderful wholesale section on paccase.shop so make sure to stop there put in a little vendor request and we'll make sure to get to you so you guys can start selling pack cases yourself cool cool yeah same thing for boveda um we're on amazon we're in the retail stores uh we have a direct site businesses we have a wholesale site too um yeah you guys go out there up your pre-roll game if you get it in a cardboard box and it's uh they're dry grab yourself a pack case throw above it in there let it sit for 24 hours your experience will be completely different than smoking a dry pre-roll nobody wants to do that anymore so let's change that [Music] you", "ffgZP-ZKKtI": "Claudia Romeo: Baguettes. Can you name a more\nquintessential French food? The recipe is quite simple. You just need flour,\nwater, yeast, and salt. Yet, here in France, it's\nnot just any loaf of bread that anybody can make at home. We're in Paris in the 14th district, and we're about to meet\nwith Mahmoud M'seddi. He's an artisanal baker, son of a baker, who's been making bread basically ever since he can remember. This is his shop. Let's walk in. [bread crackling]\nMahmoud is a master of bread. Look at this giant loaf! He even won an award for\nthe best baguette in Paris. What he's going to show us\nis not your average baguette, but the baguette tradition, which is a baguette made\non-site with simple ingredients. Claudia: Making a baguette\nis much more complex and time consuming than you'd think. Every step requires inside\nknowledge, skill, and expertise. It all starts with the dough. Mahmoud starts making the dough at 5 a.m. with only flour and water, kneads it, then at 8 a.m. he adds yeast\nand salt and water again. Claudia: You can hear\nthe sounds of the dough. [dough squelching] Claudia: When the dough is\nready, it rests for one hour. Then it is taken out in small batches. Claudia: The batches of dough will be left to rest until the following day, while batches from the day before are going to be cut in pieces and shaped. This is when the dough starts\nto resemble a baguette. Claudia: One batch of dough\nwill make about 20 baguettes, and about 200 baguettes will come out from the whole of the dough. [crunching] Wow. It smells so nice. So soft inside.", "XbUr98Z7MII": "[ __ ] video on hello rso sosa and today i've made it up the granddaddy dances and i've done a [ __ ] video i've come up here we're falling everywhere we're falling

recipe and it's all about French baguettes I really love baguettes because I like slapping them with soup or my favorite chai but you can go ahead and stop with anything you want so they are better crusty and chewy on the outside and very soft on the inside the good thing I like about making baguette is that it requires only four ingredients guys four ingredients so without saying more let's get started so we'll start by adding three cups of all-purpose flour into a bowl to that you will add one tablespoon of yeast two teaspoons of salt and mix that well next we will add warm water so I'm using two cups of warm water and then we are going to give this a good knead until it forms a very nice taquito [Music] once you are done mixing we are going to cover the dough and keep it in a warm place let it rise for one and a half hours so I had another dough rising earlier and here it is so this has risen for one hour not even one and a half hours so we're going to add flour on top and then you're going to transfer all the door to a flat surface make sure your surface has more extra flour because this process needs a lot of kneading so you're transferring all the top of the ball to the flat puppies make sure sockets have more more flour cause at this point the dough is too sticky so we are going to just add more flour and then start kneading remember all we need is just a soft and smooth dough so I'm just adding more flour and we're going to need this for a good ten minutes as you can see I'm trying to just fold it in and roll it out whichever technique to using make sure your door is not too much sticky you can use a stand mixer which will speed up the process but I'm just using my hands so the dough is ready and we are going to cut it into six equal pieces once then take each piece and roll into small small balls so now it's time to shape the Pug a subject each dough piece try to pull the edges of the dough into the center then after that we are going to roll it until we get very nice long vacation this process is not easy it just requires patience in time so you're going to fit off the process for all the remaining dough pieces until you're done [Music] once done line them on a tray that is flat make sure there is a space between them so that they don't come into contact when they are rising so you're going to prove this for another 45 minutes just cover and set them in a warm place after 45 minutes they have doubled in size I can see mines have touched each other this means that I used a very small choice but there was no space but anyway after baking they still came out great so I'm making small slits on top of each pocket this going to give them like a nice nice shape and then a sprinkle a little bit of flour after that I'm going to bake this in the oven for a good 20 minutes until they are done and nicely crispy and browned and that's it guys there you have it freshly baked buckets [Music] so if you like this video go ahead and give it a thumbs up don't forget subscribe don't forget to comment and share and also you can find me on instagram on clothes for kitchen or on facebook at their kitchen so till my next video bye [Music]

comment and share peace", "amkIIBED-3w": "I want to show you how to divide the dough and so we can divide it and shape it into baguette with your rolls and it'll loaf as well so our dough has been rested now for about two hours so you can see it just nice and plump in here we want to keep our top and our bottom I'm not sure to do this so put of your flour table very lightly that was - pepper I'm just going to release the top in here turn it over so my sticky side now is on top and my top is underneath place the dough like that on the front of me and do kind of gentle frame around it drama handle table and then tap it gently in there now when the for the door towards me first my sticky side is there that's a nonstick side in here and this goes all over the top so your nonstick side is everywhere and when I started in the bakery at the age of 14 my boss in the morning used to give me that exactly that piece of the big bigger and putting my fingers and I was so scared of the doctor start exquisite I make it sticky but where I realized he never gave me sticky dough he gave me a piece of dough which is nonstick but I made it sticky I used to say in French beef format Rosella pad which turns out as shoulder those boss if you scatter the dough we got no chance so master that first make sure you doesn't stick to you and then you'll be fine and that's a good part of learning not to fear them so my seam is here my top is here and we'll turn the dough like so so my nonstick side is everywhere now to divide the dough if you make some rolls tell the dough in half this way all by 8 so I'm cutting the dough like that and your sticky side you can see now it's in it seal it with your finger as you go along done your sticky side or your sim is air so before you do anything to seal it again so your door doesn't stick and for somebody to use the batch on a gram of dough in the lens that and for the rolls you pronate bit smaller on the gram for your dough if you have to make a loaf in the tin then you need about um in some small tin or larger teen hundred gram is good for the tiny tin but you need bad form at 50 gram of dough for a larger team so I just quite operator bit like so now I'm gonna show you roll some it'll roll so it's capital way of doing it you can start with the dough your top being in here and start turning upside down so your bottom is a use your thumb and for the dog toward you over your thumb and go around each little corners back so turn it over you can do this all with your hand just pinch it underneath and it involves X so this in here what I'm doing there is what we could we call this the keep like clay in French you lock everything in and I'll give you strength nice and strong put a flower on top if you want to and then you get little blue shape one more time top upside down fold four or five time turn over together and seal all the edge together it's a same for a small team you have your dough there for some time you can just roll it back so what's happened when you roll on the table you don't want any flour you want the dough to stick a little bit so what's happened is the top being air you want the dough to go inside itself and gain stronger and stronger should be like your hand getting strong like so so you have top is nice and strong here you see that and you finish it off just by rolling or at your top never move your top is the same all the way through don't roll the dough with your hand out just like a pressure board make it stronger if you overdo it the dough will rip and get very sticky again top to shape a larger loaf for a team axle for this size Tinian is about 450 gram of the which is essentially again my top is in air the plenty of flour don't need to add any more press down turn the dough over so your top is under your bottom is a trouble which we move the door on the table I've pressed it down one corner to corner three and four so easiest way to do it put your hand like that bring one corner to the center you're the one over the top and if I'm a spying on the middle so you press in a center in it in a straight line and travel again bring the top into the center and gentle press in this in the span in air so your top started forming here put your thumb there turn the door on again always try to work with the door to audio fold over the spine again and one more time and see the two edge together under so there's a nice strong lavinia add to be a flower again for the top your spine is here your top is here put the spine down unity [Music] next I want to show you how to shut a baguette so flour your surface you can do it in here take your dough your top again is on the top in here I want to do is press it down so seeing of a pilot its length if you do that turn the dough over so your top is under and your bottom is up make a span on the middle then with your left hand in here your thumb is your guide your gonna fold with your left hand and see with your right hand so did story there all my finger are working there and bring the dough together in your spine in the middle that start to get stronger lift travel and turn man start again from that side form the spine into the center make it strong lift and one more time into the center and see the two edge together so my thumb's goes back in here but this time I seal everything in at the dough stick a bit to the table you can put it and stretch it the final touch hands in here and press hard to be the pointy bit for your baguette in here with your spine nice and clean your top in here goes into a crush so we make I get it so bad practice you've got to do 8 9 by 8 you don't learn by making just one so I do one full speed now spine and top [Music]", "Q2rLPq8oYCc": "[Music] hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with how to make perfect French baguette at home that's right I've gotten so many food wishes for this over the years and I would always reply to the person you know what you really can't make great French baguette at home and I would list all the reasons like the flour in the water and the steam injected oven but that was before I actually tried it but once I did I realized I was wrong again so I'm gonna show you how to make Parisian Bakery quality baguette in your very own home and I think you're gonna be fairly shocked at just how simple this is so we're gonna start with our French bread dough we're gonna use our famous no-knead method which means we're gonna start off with a very small amount of yeast that's just a quarter teaspoon we're gonna throw that in a mixing bowl along with some room-temperature water we don't need warm water for this I'm gonna give that a little stir but we don't need to let this sit like we usually do we don't need this or even want this to start rising quickly so quick stir I'm also gonna add in some salt and then of course the last ingredient flour and I'm not even using bread flour fists we're just gonna use regular all-purpose flour and we're gonna dump that in and we're gonna take a wooden spoon and we're gonna mix that up and at first you're gonna think wow this is way too wet and then as you continue stirring you're gonna thank man this is way too dry but then that'll pass and you'll realize this is gonna be perfect and as you keep stirring and stirring you're gonna get a super thick super sticky dough that will eventually pull all the flour away from the sides okay so just use your wooden spoon to work that lump of dough against the sides of the bowl and if you measure all the ingredients by weight which I'm gonna insist you do that's exactly what it should look like alright very moist very very very sticky but again it does come together enough to pull away from the sides of the bowl that's kind of important alright once we get to that stage we're gonna stop and then we'll simply wrap this in plastic throw a towel over it that really is mostly for looks and I'm gonna put that inside a turned off oven for 12 to 14 hours or until it doubles in size and if it happens a little sooner that's fine if it takes a little longer that's fine but basically it should resemble this this is what mine look like after 12 hours and then we're gonna take a spatula and kind of knock the air out of this you can see just how sticky and wet and elastic that is I probably should have floured the spatula but it's too late but basically we're just going to knock the air out of that dough by scraping it out and we're gonna do so on to a very well floured work surface so sprinkle a good amount of flour down first we're also gonna want to dust them over the top as well as have our hands very well floured and I keep stressing it but this dough is very sticky and has to stay that way so I just want you to use the minimum amount of flour you need to work with this and all we're gonna do is Pat that down into a rectangle all right the primary reason is to knock all the air out but it also will give us a shape that we can cut into four relatively even sized pieces and of course you could weigh these and get them perfectly even but I can't even pretend to care about stuff like that you think I'm scared of baguettes that aren't all the same size I don't think so so we're gonna divide that up into four pieces to make our loaves but before we start shaping that let's make sure we have our pan ready so I have a half sheet pan with a baking mat on it then I'm gonna dust with the cornmeal so that's prepped and ready for our loaves so let's get shaping and that is going to be extremely easy because all we're gonna do is take one of those pieces of dough and we'll give it a little dusting of flour again we're using the minimum we can get away with and I'm basically just gonna roll it up like that and then I'm simply gonna roll it with my fingers like this starting in the center and kind of rolling and stretching it out towards the ends and in just a few short seconds you're gonna have something that looks like that and that's really all it's necessary now if you have any obvious seams put those underneath but even that's not a big deal because once this Rises it's gonna look awesome and once our dough has been rolled out into a cylinder or something like that we're gonna transfer that onto our baking sheet and if you need to even it out a little bit you can do that here but don't worry too much about it like I said when this rises it's gonna look amazing Plus that a little bit of texture on the surface and those slight inconsistencies in the girth are all gonna add to that authentic French baguette appearance and once those are panned up one little quick optional step I do like to take a damp piece of paper towel and just kind of wipe off the excess cornmeal this is gonna go in a super hot oven like five fifty and that extra stuff could smoke in the oven and then we're gonna give the tops our loaves a generous dusting of flour and then very very very lightly drape this with plastic wrap and then once those are covered we're gonna let those rise for about an hour to an hour and a half or until just about doubled in size and I will admit halfway through I got totally paranoid my plastic was gonna stick so I decided to dust it very generously with flour and I put that back on there and I felt better so once you just flour your plastic wrap begin with but bottom line we're gonna leave those loaves to rise and this is what mine look like when they were done it was kind of chilly in my kitchen that day so this took about an hour and a half oh by the way you've probably noticed I'm just doing two loaves here this recipe makes four small baguettes or two regular-sized ones but since we're mostly this will be the largest pan you can get ahold of we're gonna do it this way so I'm gonna cook two I'll cook the other two later and at this point we are finally ready to bake so we're gonna preheat our oven to 550 or as high as your oven will go and we're also on the bottom rack gonna put a pan of water that's gonna keep the oven nice and humidified which is going to be critical to get that authentic crust so our oven is preheating and it's on to the last official step we have to take a razor and make some slashes in the dough but we're not gonna use a razor we're gonna use scissors it's so much easier so take some scissors hold them straight up and make a 45-degree cut but the only problem with the scissor method is it does leave these little sharp tips which you got to poke down I mean that's one of the first things you learn in bag at school if you're gonna snip you gotta tuck the tip alright so remember that so we're gonna poke those down and I said that was the last step but really this is the last official step before these go in the oven we got to take a spray bottle and we got to give these a nice miss teen make sure the surface of both loaves are covered and by the way keep that spray bottle close to you we're gonna use that again at that point we're gonna place it in our preheated oven and we're gonna bake that at 550 degrees for about 15 minutes or until done but don't go anywhere we got stuff to do after five minutes of baking I want you to quickly open up the oven door and give both loaves a really quick spray quickly close the door back up so that's the first spray about four or five minutes in and then we're gonna do one more spray after about ten minutes and while we do this second spray we're also gonna give the pan a turn just so it cooks nice and evenly and by the way at this point do not worry if it looks ugly it's gonna look a little spotty do not be scared because like four or five minutes later when you pull these out after about 50 minutes total cooking time you're gonna be looking at a couple incredibly gorgeous and absolutely authentic French baguettes and I check those out and I know those look so trade magnifique you want to eat it right away but you can't you have to let this cool put them on a rack until they completely cool do not cut these do not cut these warm but after they're cooled down you're gonna take a serrated knife and you're gonna hear something that sounds like this oh yeah in fact they can say you can tell how good a bag that's gonna taste by the sound I totally agree with that and this did not disappoint it just came out absolutely perfect that thin crispy crusty exterior and the insides very tender very light while at the same time they have that signature chewiness that the baguettes are known for and of course the only way to make this any better or any more French would be to put some butter on it so we're gonna burn that up and continue to enjoy what is truly one of the world's great pleasures in fact this came out so good I'd like to apologize to all the French bakeries we're gonna put out a business when this goes viral sorry guys but you had a good run so I really do hope you give this a try head over to food wishes com for all the ingredient amounts and more info as usual and as always enjoy [Music]", "efqe9Umxopc": "how do you tell a good Reddy's without testing now this man only quit red Sun this way the only way Colette's entered herself this is what great bread sounds like today we're making sandwich size of baguettes for a separate bond me video that I'm going to be doing but whatever you do with these these are going to make some of the best sandwiches of your life so the recipe is going to start right here but as always I want to cover a couple key cooking tips and knowledge by comparing this to my focaccia recipe there about 95% similar but there's a couple of key differences that we're going to cover also yes I like adding unnecessary affects the interest of these videos so my focaccia recipe and this baguette recipe are both 75% hydration dose which yields a thin crispy crust and an airy but even crumb the only difference in ingredients is there's no olive oil in the baguette recipe no olive oil just leads to a slightly different texture on the interior and different brownie on the outside besides the olive oil the recipe is the exact same up until shaping obviously focaccia is baked in a large pan but baguettes are usually in a tapered cylinder now shaping is probably the trickiest part to get down for first-timers but I'll show you guys how to do it no problem after shaping we need to score the dough which is absolutely critical those slashes you see on the dough aren't for decoration though they do look pretty good instead these slashes provide a vent for guests to escape while it's baking so our loaf opens up this is known as oven spring without scoring the gas will look for the weakest spot to escape which could be out the side or the bottom with scoring we're able to control where those gases are going to escape lastly we need steam while baking the baguettes this is critical to because the steam on the crust will help keep the dough soft allowing the yeast to expel more gas in the oven so the loaf is gonna spring open more additionally that steam will help start to coagulate on the surface giving us a nice shiny and brown crust so with all these bread videos hopefully you guys are starting to see the similarities and differences between various bread products I mean predominantly it's all the same process but there's just kind of subtle changes here in there that are gonna lead to a different baked product but anyway let's make these and I can't wait to make a bonhomie out of these start by pouring 375 milliliters of 100 degree water into a bowl to that we're going to add 5 grams of instant yeast along with a spoonful of flour and stir that until it is dissolved you're gonna let this mixture stand for 5 to 10 minutes until a light foam surfaces and little balls are visible this is proofing and it is done to test the viability of the yeast if there is no foam surface or little bubbles the yeast is likely dead and should be discarded for new yeast or else we won't get a rise in our baguettes meanwhile add 500 grams of all-purpose or bread flour and 10 grams of salt to a large mixing bowl once the yeast is proofed pour in the mixture and vigorously mix the dough with your hands until no dry flour remains in the bolt and a cohesive mass forms probably about 1 to 2 minutes the dough will be very sticky at this point so cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for 15 minutes resting will allow the flour to start hydrating all on its own and make the dough a little bit easier to work with when we start stretching and folding once rested grab a little bowl with water and dip your hands into it to help prevent sticking you're gonna perform a stretch and fold by grabbing a corner of the dough in the bowl lift straight up to stretch the dough as high as it will go without tearing and then fold it over to the other side you're gonna rotate the bulb and perform three more reps of stretch in folds once you have done four folds you're gonna turn the dough over onto itself covered again with plastic wrap and let it rest another 25 to 30 minutes this is one set of a stretching fold and you're gonna perform three more sets with 25 to 30 minutes of rest in between for each set of stretching folds the dough should feel more elastic and stretched further without tearing and it will start to capture some air bubbles on the outside the stretch and fold method is better suited than kneading for a high hydration dough like this because the dough is naturally sticky and this method reduces hand contact additionally the stretching fold will allow for a more open crumb when baked because we aren't pushing the air out of the dough we're just lightly stretching it up and folding it over after the fourth and final set of stretching folds you want to test for gluten development by cutting off a little piece of the dough and stretching it very thin to see if you can get a gluten window that is slightly transparent this gluten window test is the key to understanding if the flour has been hydrated enough meaning our gluten is developed if the dough tears before getting to a slightly translucent window let it rest for another 25 minutes and perform another set of stretching folds after the fourth and final set of stretching folds sprinkle a little bit of flour over your work surface now using a bench scraper we're gonna divide the dough into 6 equal portions roughly a hundred and forty-five grams each this is going to give us a nice sandwich sized baguette once portioned using your fingertips lightly press and stretch each piece of dough into a rough rectangle shape about five inches wide and a note on the flower try to use as little as possible just enough to be able to shape it and it's not overly sticking to your hands definitely don't overdo that flower though once everything is portioned and in a rough rectangle shape cover the dough pieces with a clean towel and let these rest for 15 minutes once the portions arrested spray some baking spray on your hand the dough and the work surface to help prevent sticking now take a rectangle of the dough and work it into a more even shape rectangle that we will fold into a baguette you're gonna fold the top edge of the dough down to the center pressing lightly to tighten the dough and form an edge now fold the dough in half again down to the bottom to form a seam you're gonna use the heel of your hand or your fingertips and lightly press that to seal the seam of the dough at the bottom at this point you should have a log of dough seal side down all you have to do for the tapered ends is place your hands on the outside edges of the dough and roll with a little bit of pressure this is what is going to give us that signature baguette shape I'll show you guys a shot of the process from my POV as well as before start with the dough in a rough rectangle and fold it to the center of the dough using your fingertips gently press the seam of the dough together and now fold again to the bottom of the dough and seal that seam with your fingertips or the heel of your hand for the tapered ends apply even pressure on both sides and roll the dough with your hands the key is to not overwork the dough here we want to maintain that airiness in our baguette and use that baking spray as needed to avoid sticking repeat this process with each baguette and place on a baking sheet sized piece of parchment paper I use two pieces of parchment paper three baguettes on each now cover the baguettes with a towel and let them proof until the I get sore about one and a half times in size this will probably take 45 to 60 minutes with 15 minutes of proofing left preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit on the convection setting 475 if you don't have convection now fill a baking pan halfway with water and place it on the bottom rack of the oven and place a metal baking sheet on the middle rack this pan of water will help create a steamy environment for that crisper crust and the baking sheet will be preheated so the baguettes can be slid on with the parchment paper and immediately start baking for a faster oven spring with the baguettes proofed and the oven setup we need to score each baguette with one long slash at a 45 degree angle to allow for the oven spring but before we do that here is the saddest thing that has ever happened to me while baking bread this small cutting board fell out of the overhead cabinet and absolutely flattened two of my precious proved loaves I was a little pissed off not gonna lie I ended up having to reshape and let them proof for another 45 minutes anyway let's get back to scoring for scoring I'm using a bread lame which is just a fancy way to hold a razor you could absolutely do the same thing with a sharp knife slice in about 1/2 inch into the dough in one long stroke now you could also do some small slashes if you like for a slightly different look once scored pull the preheated baking sheet out of the oven and slide the parchment paper with that baguettes onto it now to spritz them with a spray bottle of warm water this water is gonna sit on the surface of the crust before steaming which will help us with that shiny crisp crust now add the pan to the middle rack of your preheated oven and set a timer to bake for 5 minutes after 5 minutes you can open it up and we're gonna spritz these baguettes one more time you should be able to see some nice oven spring when you open up the dough after 5 minutes now continue baking the baguettes for another 12 to 15 minutes until the crust is nice and golden brown crispy and the bread sounds hollow when it is thump take the baguettes out of the oven and place them on a wire rack to completely cool before slicing in and enjoying and just listen to that sweet sweet sound once we slice in you can see that beautifully thin but crisp crust with a nice open interior of the crumb the texture is absolutely to die for as always the full recipe will be up on my website which would be linked below so you guys can make these for yourself and like I said anything you put in these is gonna be absolutely delicious for me I am making that bond me so the only goal that I have for the next 24 hours is to not finish these at least save one for the video tomorrow but that's gonna wrap it up for me hopefully you guys enjoyed if you're new definitely drop me a like and subscribe I'll catch you in the next one peace you you", "aoRg7_nPATE": "I guess it's me on the frugal chef I hope you're doing very well today this is my friend Marcellus hello she's from Argentina we're friends here in Guam and she's gonna make something very delicious for us what are you making I'm making french bread for you and I hope everybody can desert it make it and enjoy it Oh everybody will make it her instructions are pristine you're gonna love it I showed you a piece of her bread when we made the clam chowder remember I told you we are gonna be making this soon so as promised here we go French bread all right we're gonna do the French bread we're going to do it by with a food processor but you can do it by hand it's just to speed up speed up the process only in the food processor I have put 3 cups of bread flour also I have added with the bread flour a teaspoon of kosher salt the kosher salt I prefer kosher salt but by any means you can add regular salt is just fine what happens if you can't find bread flour can you make this without bread flour or do you have to make it with bread flour actually bread flour if you have gluten you can add one tablespoon of gluten per cup and a half of flour um so that will substitute the bread flour but there is no problem even if you don't have bread flour or gluten you can still do it with all-purpose without purpose ok that's all for the three cups of flour we're going to use a cup and a quarter of water we're just going to put in the microwave and get it warm until it's the core like a baby bar like a baby bottle exercise once the water is warm make sure to touch it and turn your finger inside just to make sure that the temperature is uh you know we're even right once we add the yeast we are going to add one teaspoon of sugar on top of it just sprinkle it what this sugar is going to do is going to help feed the yeast we're going to stir the yeast and the sugar and we're going to let it rest for about ten minutes so the yeast gets all fluffy and we can add it to the as you can see the yeast half is foaming is blooming so that is good we're going to add now the yeast water ah to the flour and now we're going to process it until it gets to all the ball in a bowl as you can see the consistency of the dough is pretty nice so we're going to take it out and we're going to knead it for a little bit by hand hey by the way if you're using a food processor don't use the middle knife you know to process food you need one of these dough oh I don't know thingamajiggy I really don't know what they're called but if you don't have this in your food processor you're better off doing all this by hand okay once we take the dough out of the processor we sprinkle a little flour on the board so we can knead it make sure when you need it you turn and incorporate lots of air that's going to help the French bread be a much nicer how long do you think you're going to need it if you're doing the whole bread by hand needed about eight minutes total if you are only kneading after using the food processor three four minutes is fine do not incorporate too much flour after you take it out of the food processor because you really don't need it and if you do the bread is not going to be as nice as you can see once you finish kneading the dough is really nice and if you press it in the middle it springs back this should be the stage where you put it in to the rice - rice once it's done the the kneading process you put it in a balls brave with a little bit of toilet cover it with a towel even plastic wrap works we're going to let the dough rest and rise in a drug-free place until it doubles in size usually takes about an hour okay it's been an hour and the dough looks great has risen very beautifully and now it's time to make it into low four rolls perfect ah we're going to punch down the air out look at how beautiful that dough is it's nice and even and real elastic it's beautiful and remember do not use too much flour okay you don't need it now we're going to let it rest for just a little bit now that we have let the dough rest for a few minutes we're going to divide into one part we're going to make it into a loaf until again and the other one we're going to divide it into equal parts and makes individual rolls we're going to cut and we're going to make into maybe 70 grams 60 to 70 grams of rolls if you are ounces that's a couple ounces get out 2.5 ounces that's size I make them we're gonna weigh it was 70 60 and 70 grams I think 60 will be just fine again guys this is optional you can eyeball this perfectly fine yeah it's not necessary to have one of these but if you want them to look professional that's actually a good thing now we're going to roll them the idea is to always make a ball but sealing everything so this is what I do we kind of like holding a softball or baseball roll softly don't close your hand too much and then you pinch pinch pinch pinch and that's it to make sure that we get that boat shape of a roll a beautiful roll we're going to press the sides without pressing the center we need the center to be aerated as much as we can to let them rest and rise again we have to let them rise twice I mean no a double in size we're going to put them in a pizza pan if you have Gnostic perfect you don't need any oil or anything if it's not you're going to use a little bit of cooking spray or oil just make sure it much of it so much it's better if it has little holes in it yes because that's going to help crisp underneath on the top now we're going to cover it and let it rise until they're double in size I will take about 30 more minutes now we're going to make the baguette we're going to press the air out a little bit if you need a little tiny bit of flour you can add it but most of the time you don't need it so please don't over flour your girl notice that mrs. is stretching out her dough she's kind of pulling it and now we're going to start rolling and pinching when we get to the edge we pinch pinch pinch make sure to pinch all the way to seal the whole bread we roll it a little bit high her down he is troubling right now but he loves my bread so oh well we pitch the ends we're going to use these that get mold you don't need to but if you have one this is the time to use it up you can actually use a little bit of cooking spray to make sure that it doesn't get stuck remember these this recipe has no oil so sometimes the flour sticks to to the surface once in the mall we're going to again let it rise until it doubles in size maybe 30 minutes or so as you can see this is the bread the rolls right after they have risen for the second time now we're going to make a slit in the center just to look prettier on the air to escape a little bit you have to do this with a very sharp knife before putting it in the oven we're going to spray it with water and then once it's in the oven we're going to spray it again and this is going to help crisp up the outside make the inside very nice so I recommend if you can find our sprayer do it while it is in the oven baking we're going to spray it every 5 to 7 minutes with water that's going to allow the crust to be nice crunchy and and shiny total cooking time between 15 to 20 minutes depending on how you like it if you like it darker or not here we have a divot that again we're going to make incisions in diagonal so it looks more bakery profession professional from the cream Wow ah same thing with like with the rose we're going to spray the clothes before putting it in the oven and then when it's in the oven we're going to repeat the spraying every 5 to 10 minutes with that we're going to insurance insurance the bread is awesome it's been seven minutes about seven minutes that these rolls have been in the oven look how beautiful they are we're going to spray them once again when I wha we're going to turn it around here is the final product as you see really nice and crispy on the outside one tip for you if you have leftovers sometimes you don't but if you do you can freeze it but always make sure that is completely cold before you put it in the freezer here I want to show you the sponge that it's formed in the middle it's beautiful see all the little bubbles of air that's what you obtain if you do not press when you are forming the baguette you don't press it in the middle same thing with the rolls we do buy one in half so you can see same thing all the little bubbles because we didn't squish too much the middle of it I am and put some butter on mine I don't need butter but that's okay mmm let's see I'm telling you that I give it a try this is awesome mm-hmm thank you my said this was awesome oh thank you so much for letting me enjoy this with you", "f6rx61QAf2E": "so today i'm just going to show you a couple of simple things uh first of all i'm going to show how i transfer my baguettes which has been resting on koosh how you transfer them from the koosh to the peel for the peel i just used a simple cookie sheet that does not have a rim that makes it easy to slide the baguettes once they're scored onto the baking steel so that makes that process simpler i have this brusher to brush off any excess salt i have my long for scoring i have a gla cup of waters to lubricate the blade this is an old-fashioned um transfer board this is just uh the top of a wine box i understand this is what a lot of french use at least when they're making shorter baguettes obviously if you're making really long baguettes you need something much larger than a wine box okay it's the first step and cover them so they've grown a bit so what you want to do is pull the koosh so the first one is spaced from the second using your transfer board place that close to the baguette you want to transfer and then give it a quick little flip okay so now it's on the board transfer it to the peel take a second just to straighten it out actually that's quite straight so that's good that's one hold the cushion again and do a little flip flip okay here we go this one ended up being a tiny bit too long slide them off so i'd like to try to make sure these are well spaced good so these are uh in the knees uh our annis wabsa baguette formula and the alteration i've made to this is to uh coat them with sesame seeds as you can see those are pretty good it's gonna actually there's not a lot of excess flour maybe on a couple so i'm just gonna bring these to the sink i'll be right back i'm going to brush off the underside so i don't have excess flour okay there really wasn't much in the way of excess flour let me see hopefully you'll be able to see how i score from this angle i hope this angle is good for you guys okay so lubricate the blade maybe i'll leave that here and i'm going to do four scores down the middle of the three lanes so down the center overlap them by about a third okay put a 30 degree angle from the surface and quick it's always a challenge when you have seeds no matter how good you think you may be at it it's always hard when you have seeds and the last score for the first one okay first one's done one two three it really does ski day along the salt the seeds really have to be fairly firm with scoring when you're doing it with seeds if i do it this angle maybe you can see better one two three okay that's it now i'm gonna load these into the oven i don't know if i can do this well like this okay get my boiled water here so i don't forget to put that in so we're going to load these guys into the oven they've been scored pull this stuff out the silvia towel has already been in there for half now with boiling water i have a cast iron skillet that's been in there the whole time the oven's pre eating okay this is always a bit hard and that's my space there pretty good go put him in just get that out of the way he won't step on it there we go that's it", "oZVF2vsOWJU": "[Music] what's that wavy [ __ ] trippy we got a special guest with us Jason a shout-out my boy Jason for coming through for today's video but today's video we're gonna be recording the one and only you guys have probably seen it exhibits collab with cookies it's a big-ass join you know how much is in there it's fast joints 8 grams there's some berry pie for y'all wondering and it's one gram of concentrates and seven grams of flour ok and that's what it's looking like you guys having smoke going in and I thought I got it smoke with trippy tag away from Modesto cookies that's a long way google map says it's like an hour and 35 minutes food up on the wavy fam that is real one merge because these are all dude the merch anytime there's a merge drops yeah you know I'm like after like one minutes available I'm like on the side joint is worth a hundred and eighty-five dollars at the club before we tell you guys 180 dollars she did not say right that's that fancy smoke first show and we're about to give you guys a review and let you guys know is it really worth 180 make sure you guys like this video subscribe and gonna let you guys know let me know what you guys think down below before we start would you buy this for 185 before we even light it look at it it's a grenade YUM you can pull the little thing and boo sure let me know down below what you guys like this baby of them so ready we are in the tent as you guys can see I don't bring it back and it's about to get night time for you guys cuz I know a lot of you I wanted to see the night time so stay tuned see if it gets night gang [Music] keep down please smoke everywhere we go [Music] let's go baby fam we got the joint lit as you can see it is ripping you guys you guys see the cherry on that thing I think it's back what you guys think about it yes I really like the tip that it has on it it's like I never seen a tip like that before but I'm really liking it because it keeps all the Scooby Snacks we're coming in your mouth and we also noticed that you don't have to get a hella hard like I thought that you had to be like you know how like when you roll hella fat you've got to hit it hard know that one you can hit it regular like a regular joint and it's hitting really good yeah I'm hitting it way too hard it is pretty heavy you guys there's hella [ __ ] weed in there I mean what the weed included but the tip is pretty heavy left away the tip itself see how much it that's some Gaston I didn't even know there was constant rain there either I just see like the celebrity spike scenes and I was like in aware how much to smoke on what should be cat he was saying that bringing a joint like this is like bringing like a bottle oh yeah like okay it's like usually when you go see like a family friend or just somebody like that's important to you bring him like a like a cake or a bottle you know something for like this nice gift big Oh join make sure if you have it comes to your size I mean if you ever go see your friends you pull up with one of these and yeah and if you live in a set you better keep its rental in your pocket in case you're looking up saw yeah it's kind of running a little bit late yeah that's the only thing that I'm trying to figure out how would you stop that or just [ __ ] probably start lighting the other side once I feel like you need to have like [ __ ] yeah look we did it work to catch it up old fashioned hello saliva you know stop the look going out right hopefully that works let me know what you guys do to stop your plants from running put it on but so far what do you guys what do you think I'm highest luck gets high in here it's boxy to be honest with you I'm gonna give mine to pee I'm not gonna if I go it's its exhibits joint the [ __ ] flavor is could be more flavor II like I've been smoking some SF cultivators wedding pie $61 out the door testing at 31% that [ __ ] is way better way better than this but I mean I don't know maybe maybe I maybe it's the concentrates too though I'm just doing a little bit of flavor yeah I mean honestly I'm gonna keep it really guys I feel like it's not hitting like a hundred percent it could be I think if you roll do be better but yeah you know I don't like the fact that it's running so bad I think that's like my main problem with it and yeah I feel like I'm wasting away I'm so high that I'm just like [ __ ] you know but it's like if I were to rolled it I'd be more pissed because it's like damn you exhibit homies these are hand rolled them I see them making them I'm pretty sure I have no idea what is each test bet just a big flex guys we're smoking a [ __ ] $184 joint what let me know if there's things that you guys feel like it's just for the foot I feel like designer is just for the Flex you know I know bass quality to this testing at 27 percent by the way pretty high 27 percent concentrate don't see any wax running or anything like that either so I'm not really sure where the concentrate is in the joint I mean it is like white ash though all the way yeah it definitely does the job oh yeah let's play baseball you know what I was thinking is that like it's a big guys joint you want it to last you how long Lee I don't know I didn't set a timer but it's feel like I'm going kind of fast yeah yeah you right sure it's eight I mean there's still no cuz it's hella fat but it's like you think you'll be just custom ah don't underestimate you guys and then I just want to remind you guys to go cup some lady where a wave emerged a very explosive second exclusive that we got the sweats on Ted I got them on today real one make sure you guys go cop it going real quick thank you guys for supporting us shout out the whole way and we appreciate you guys for getting us here we got bigger things coming you guys oh my god looks like gonna burn your lips I know follow me let me like the other side back because I really like easy burn me I have bad luck burning myself with it I bet you as the video when it started it was not that smoky and now it's like the only thing I don't like okay so we're getting to the end what are you guys thinking is this what is $285 honestly it's not $1 i'ma tell you why you guys polite you could just get so much weed with that money you could just roll so many blunts that just getting so much higher I don't know that's my s what I so I think creating for me was worth it listen out listen up so it's a pandemic I can't come to accept that much I only hang out with them so much I only have so much time so we got to get hella [ __ ] high in a short amount of time [Music] want to get hella high in a short amount of time that's a good way and there's a lot of money well but it was worth it yeah it was worth anything I think I would buy it if I was like gonna go see ya like a friend that I haven't seen him tell along and like your city just said you're gonna top the whole chain because this thing was a [ __ ] but she doesn't really need a [ __ ] damn I feel like I'm hella re inhaling all the smoke we want some water free I got you Brandon thank you like really even higher we just sitting here no you're not going we get in one hundred and eighty dollars worth of Highness dog like who do you know is smokin a pumps let me know down in the comments if you guys have tried this grenade like cookies rolls in the lift tickets so now I know where the concentrate is the concentrates in the paper so the papers made will concentrate yeah I've heard about CBD infused papers and even - yeah smoke vibes everything so we're here cookies I bought hell of I papers and I like wrong something wrong though do you really do you think vibes are better than wrong honestly it's like keeping I do I do is the rice ones they taste hell it feel like I've been smoking all the flour rice ones it's like almost like there's no paper I don't know I don't know what the everyone making papers so I you're right there like it's not healthy yeah it's just kind of like a competition with one another now I don't know I'm not gonna get into politics let me know if you guys could still see cats crying in the back I'm gonna open the window you guys know I know I will say there's a good graph look at that they turn on tasting you never know you just said it's a pup go I'm not tapping out let's do it I think it's been this boxy before us we only did it one time can we smoke that guy's let me know if you guys would go to the club and cop this guys you get it at the local cookie store I think they're limited edition right there's a lot of them made a certain amount only like a certain amount of people got to try out I've been lucky to try it after coming through yeah if you're I could use them and I still come see me I'm Jason yeah go visit him out cookies Modesto he works there shout out cookies right shout out the way be fair I hope you guys like this video and if you guys did make sure you guys like it subscribe make sure you guys comment down below my eyes are burning oh and we love you guys stay lit keep rolling I will see you guys in our next video I usually don't like getting smoking like crutches this alright coming to and you guys I'm about to crack the hot box for you guys let me hit that one more time for the long time I believe you guys I'm crying look you guys you see how much has run like the other side open look at that but I'm still live let's crack this thing go you guys ready with this to most Greg big real smoky yeah we love ya stay alert stay positive keep rollin you see on the next one [Music]", "O2k7bbz7imQ": "[Music] hi I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm today we're going to make a French baguette and this is what it looks like as you can see it has that really nice the classic long thin shape and nice crispy crust and then inside it's wonderfully soft and chewy and as you can see we've got the nice ears here that's what they're called these little rough edges which a baguette has so to make a baguette there's a couple different ways you can do it with machine but what today we're gonna make it just by hand is called a hand mix baguette really easy no kneading so I mean if you're new to making a baguette this is a good recipe to start with so in a large bowl I like one that's pretty wide I have okay first you need a scale I'm recommending the scale like I always do but really when you're measuring flour you're way more accurate if you use a scale you I'm gonna give you cups but really it's time to buy a scale so you will need 475 grams of bread flour that's 3 and 2/3 cups and I'm also using 65 grams 1/2 a cup of all-purpose flour you mean oh that is plain flour and you know the bread flour is what gives us a nice soft and chewy texture and then along with that we are going to use 2 grams which is 3/4 of a teaspoon of SAF Gold instant yeast this a little different than the act of dry this is used by professionals and we don't have to proof it which is really good and it's it this is type yeast is really good when you have a long fermentation period which we do with a baguette so you know you can find it online Amazon is where I got mine so just keep that in mind and then what we're another ingredient you may not be familiar with is we're going to add 3 grams which is 1 teaspoon of dry malt dye esthetic powder and what that does is yeast need sugar to feed on and then it releases gases and gives us that wonderful flavor so the this kind of malt power powder breaks down the starch into sugar which is and this is really good again when you have a long fermentation period and it also helps with browning our baguette give that wonderful golden-brown color again you can get it online so let's put that in there and then we need some salt for flavor plus it does ten salt tends to slow down the fermentation process which is really good again with this particular recipe so we're using 10 grams two and a half teaspoons I like to use a kosher salt so just dump that in and then we're gonna give that I'm just using my hand you'd use a whisk mix all that in and then we need water now like I said this dough is actually we're gonna do the first fermentation is three hours because we are not kneading the dough so it needs that long fermentation period and we don't want the dough to be too warm we want it room temperature and by room temperature I mean that's between 74 and 77 Fahrenheit which is 23 25 Celsius so we don't our water temperature is very important so I have a formula it's in the head note but I'll just give you an example my room temperature is 77 degrees Fahrenheit 25 C and that means my flowers at that temperature so I need a cool temperature of my water actually I'm doing it at about 68 degrees 19 C so to get that you will need an insta read the mom didn't put in there or Rick just happened to have in his tool box this infrared really fancy dance I just beam it on it like my my flower is 76.5 and the see that we can get a shot of that pretty cool kind of fun you just put it in check the temperature of your oven your wall whatever a lot of fun so anyways you will need 380 grams of water at your correct temperature so that will be this is again where grams is really good that would be one and a half cups plus one and a half tablespoons of water please get a scale so um put a you want a well in the center and we're just going to pour our water in like so and then we're just going to moisten our flour I like to use one of these just one of these plastic scrapers you could use a wooden spoon and then I'm just gonna move it around like this now we are making an authentic French baguette so I will tell you upfront there is a technique to this and it will take some practice but this is a crap and a wonderful one and I just love the process and if we're not making like just a white bread dough in them and then just rolling it into a log we're not really going to you know make it like they do in bakeries so and you know what the results are just wonderful so enjoy learning this it's a craft I just I just find it so therapeutic and relaxing and even if it's not perfect the results will be like I find even on my worst day there's my bread is still better than what I'm getting at my local grocery store so so now I've kind of got it moistened as much you know as I can you finding it looks like a lot of water and then it looks like I don't have enough water you do so now what we're gonna do we don't want to knead this dough so I have this violence bench scraper metal you could just use a knife we're not you don't want to tear the dough so what you're gonna do is just cut down so you could use a knife for this and then just lift this and stack it you don't want to pull it so just work like this work around and this as we keep working this it's going to moisten get all that flour moistened so as you can see here that I'm really starting to really clean the bowl of the flour say I'm kind of dragging it up so check that in a second yeah okay so there we got it's kind of a shaggy mess don't worry about it and I'm just gonna check it that looks good you want to kind of just feel it make sure there's no dry spots that's look I'm happy with that okay so now what I'm gonna do so we're done making our dough I know it doesn't really look like a dough very good one but trust me it will let's take it out so I'm just going I have to wash my bowl and so I'll do that and I'll be right back okay so now I have my clean bowl I'm just gonna pour a little flavorless oil I'm actually using canola oil vegetable light olive oil now I'm just taking a paper towel and then just lightly oiling the inside we don't want our door to stick too much and then so I'm just gonna take my dough like so and then I'm gonna flip it so that the the top of the the dough is oiled and there that looks lumpy kind of shaggy don't worry about it and look just for we are at 74 which is like if the low-end of our temperature which is good 74 which is what 23 see so that's good so now I'm just going to cover it with plastic wrap and then like I said if you don't need your dough a lot the kind of the thing is if you knead your dough a lot you have a short fermentation period conversely if you don't need your dough you have a long fermentation period and as we're going to do it for three hours and that's gonna really develop the flavor of our baguette but every 45 minutes we will have to stretch our dough which I will show you so what you want to do is just let this sit at room temperature and I'll see you back here in 45 minutes okay so it's been 45 minutes so we're going to do what is called our first fold and you know it just is a little tip I kind of write everything down the time time I made the dough and then my folds because sometimes you can forget what time you did it so it's good to have a little piece of paper and put that down so now to hold our dough what you do is take one end here just kind of stretch it gently and then fold it over onto itself turn it stretch this fold it back on itself this side and as you can see this is starting to smooth out this is what we want and like that and then we're going to do is just flip it over so bottom becomes the top and that's what is called our first fold if I kind of put my thing on there it's up to 75 0.5 which is wide about 24 so that's fine because we want to keep that within that range so now I'm just going to cover and the reason we do that is to equalize the temperature of our dough that stretching helps to do that so I'm just gonna cover it and now we're going to do another 45 minutes and then do what is called our second fold so we'll see you back then so it's been 45 minutes so we're going to do what is called our second fold again gently pull it fold it on a South another side and as I said this will equalize the temperature of our dough as you can see and then we're just gonna flip it it's getting nice and soft just how we want it so again that's all you do cover it and we let it ferment for another 45 minutes so now for our third and final fold now this dough looks I mean it's nice and soft but it is sticky so that is the way it's supposed to be so again just gently pull fold it over itself and yes again flip it and then we are going to cover it and let it sit another 45 minutes and then we will be ready to start shaping our baguettes before we start shaping our baguettes we need to talk about our oven and one of the problems home bakers have always had to make an authentic French baguette is we don't have a deck oven which is what artesian bakeries use but we can kind of simulate it and get really good results so in the oven I have actually two pizza stones I have one at the top here and I have one at the bottom I have if you don't have to I have done it with just the bottom one and that is what we're going to put the baguette on and I get pretty good results some people have even just bought unglazed tiles instead of a pizza stone the problem with that is I've talked to people and they said they do tend to break so just keep that in mind so um and then you have that and then you know the deck ovens in artesian bakeries what the great thing of that is when you put the baguettes in there you get this burst of steam and you need that so that's what how you get that really nice hard crispy crust but we also there is a way to kind of send me like that and what I've done is I've put a cast-iron frying pan in the bottom and we're gonna heat that up with the stones when we heat the oven and then what we're gonna do is we're going to throw in some ice cubes and that's going to instantly hit that cast iron we're gonna get to steam so this is kind of my setup that I have like I said if you only have one pizza stone you can you can do it with that so uh and the thing is we want we have to preheat our oven to 475 degrees Fahrenheit which is 245 degrees Celsius and we want those stones to get up to that temperature and that takes a while you know your your oven made beep and say it's ready but those stones take a lot longer I find to really get that up to to temperature it takes like an hour and a half so just keep that in mind when you're timing and if you have a convection oven a fan oven which I do I like to turn that off I don't like I don't have the fan on so just keep that in mind so when we come back we will start shaping our baguettes okay so now we're ready to start shaping our baguettes I like to do this in two stages do a little then let it rest and then finish shaping so first thing we need to do is flour surface because this is a soft it's a sticky dough and then what you want to do is you want the top of the dough to be facing down on your counter like so as you can see it's really nice and soft and then flour the top and then we're gonna divide from the where they sit we're gonna make three baguettes so we're gonna divide this into thirds now I like my scale should probably know you can eyeball this if if you don't have a scale so I my finds both 310 grams per big a so and you know try not to tear you want to just cut down and use a knife if you don't have one of these bench scrapers and just gather up the dough look and kind of go like this because you don't want to stretch it if you've ever made a baguette dough like with the Machine like and knead it this dough is a little more soft than then then a machine made when you need it but you know I think this is a great dopher if you're just starting to make big s because you don't have to worry about needing it and you know the window do I have that right and people get confused by that so I think this is a great way to start and then we move on to the other ways and see if that's all right okay that's right so now there's my oven beeping so you want to kind of put it into a rectangle kind of even and then kind of Pat it down cuz you're gonna have some large air bubbles and we just want to get rid of those so I'm doing it what's in maybe six by four inches so that's let me see well it's 16 by 10 centimeters it's not too critical so what we're gonna do - it's a little bit of technique here we're gonna take your hands like this and then just fold it into the center kind of seal it because we're trying to create a little bit of tension here on our our dough and that will give us that really nice shape of a baguette that won't spread out when it bakes so that's why we're doing and then just again just take this and fold it over and under and so that's what you forgot and then I'm gonna put that underneath and then I'm just gonna take my palms of my hands and kind of just go like to rock it back and forth and we're getting some tension there and then we're sealing that at the bottom like so and that's what you're looking for not that difficult and then what we want to do is just have a board or a baking sheet really whatever you have I'm just gonna use my wooden board here and just put that on there like so and just do the same thing just paddocks we want to get rid of to even out you want to kind of have an even thickness of your dough plus to get rid of there's any of the really large air bubbles but don't like really don't take out your anger and then let's add into the center seal it and then like that and then just rock it back forth and that's what you're looking for and same thing with the third one okay if you have any big one just pop those little big air bubbles and then we have it on our board and then I'm just gonna cover with plastic wrap now I'm just gonna you know let it relax our dough relax for about a half hour and then when we come back we'll do our final shaping of our big s so now we're ready for our final shaping of our baguettes so you can see they're nice and soft they have spread a little so what I want to do is lift them up and top goes down onto a floured counter so now I know in in a bakery baguettes are really long at home we are limited by the size of our oven and the size of our pizza stone so uh I'm going to make about 14 inch long baguettes that's about 35 centimeters so what you will need is a cloth I'm using just a linen tea towel if you want to do like the bakeries do they have they use a cloth called a Koosh you can actually buy them online but you know a linen tea towel clean lint it out just do the same thing and I like to lightly flour that so our dough does not stick so a little bit of technique here you know it takes practice you know you won't get stuck down first time and don't worry about it because it does you know it'll still turn out fantastic it's just something it's a craft something to work on it's kind of fun so now what we're going to do is just Pat our dough down gently kind of even get an even shape and if you have any large air bubbles we want to get rid of those now what we're gonna do is fold from the top over 1/3 and you do you do this by I take my left hand and I have my thumb and I just bring kind of take the dough and lift it over my thumb and then you can either use your heel of your right hand or just your fingers I'm going to press down to seal so just go along pressing pressing pressing we want to see all not get some tension and just you know a lot of times I just use like so and then we flip it around and we're going to do the same thing use your thumb and a third again all the way along so seal it that gets some tension gives us that a nice shape and then we're going to take again and go all the way over to the end here and seal it again I'm just using so it's a third a third and a half just remember that a third turned the dough another third and then a half and I don't you probably can't hear but there is some air bubbles breaking and then I have it sealed as you can see that's what we want and now what we're gonna do is we want to roll it gently to about 14 inches 35 centimeters or however long you know your pizza stone is you got a bigger one you can do it longer and then just gently roll it out that's I'm I think that's about 14 so what we want to do you can see there's that seam try to get it you know Nathan shape so we want seam side up you're putting it on the cloth kind of have and what we're going to do is just take the cloth and then to kind of give it a little thing to keep its shape as because we are going to let it proof a little so just kind of like that and then we're gonna do it again with the next one if you don't get it the perfect first time do not worry just do it the best you can practice makes perfect so again third over pop those air bubbles like sitting just kind of turn it again third seal it and then a half what bit air bubbles there I'm popping and if you don't if that's not just kind of take your fingers and make sure it's nice and sealed get the tension there of the nice shape and then just gently roll it get it as even as possible seam side up and and then just again it's a third one so that's our final one it's like so and then I'm just gonna cover it and we're just gonna let it sit at room temperature now depending on how warm your room is mine's at about 77 degrees Fahrenheit 25 degrees C so I'm I do about a half hour if your rooms a little cooler it could be an hour what you want is when you press your baguette pred gently press it it will pop up slowly so probably about a half an hour and we'll be back and we'll bake our baguettes so we are now ready to bake our baguettes I'm using a pizza paddle because we have to transfer the baguettes into the oven if you don't have one of these you could you just turn your a large baking sheet upside down and then what I did is I just spread some fine cornmeal because that way the baguettes will slide a little easier into the off of the board into the oven you can use semolina for that so I'm just gonna rub that in okay and now we're going to trim little tricky here transferring the baguettes to the board we want as I if you remember we have the seam side up we want now to put the seam side down on bort I'm using one of these this is actually just a piece of wood to transfer them you know you can use like a cutting board piece of just got a piece of plywood and a little tricky little technique I'm gonna lift this up and what we got to do is kind of flip it back and forth so I'm going to use kind of get my wrong side there get this under and then I'm going to flip it back and then flip it onto the board using the cloth and then you have that seam up and then transfer it seem down that's what you're going to do so now what we need to do is do those this kind of characteristic slits on the top of our baguettes you want to try to keep it in that top like the third of the top of your baguette I'm using actually using a razor blade you could use a sharp knife some people even use scissors so what you want to do is I'm for this length of baguette I'm going to do three slashes and if you can see here there is a slight overlap that's what you want so just kind of I think three is it's kind of time and we wanted fairly deep as you can see just quick action down like I said you could use the knife for this and that looks good so we are ready to transfer these to our piece of stone in the oven and you will also need I have on the side you will need some ice cubes about a cup and a half of ice cubes 306 I guess that's one 360 you're just a bunch of ice cubes and that's going to create that steam and we need that because we don't want the crowd we want the crust to be really crisp and you need that steam rate at the beginning so let's see if we can do this try to space can't really see me try to space your baguettes you don't want them too close together because otherwise the sides will be soft so leave a little space like so you can see that it's low right and then I'm just going to try to do that as quickly as you can I know it's a little difficult and we're going to bake those at 425 minutes until we get really nice and golden-brown and nice and crispy if you turn one over and kind of tap it it will be Hollow I mean normally my about twenty-five minutes now if by any chance you cannot fit all three in there which sometimes happens what you can do is kind of  the the unbaked baguettes while your first one is baking just so what you need to do is just put them on a baking sheet and put them in the fridge and then you can bake them off after your first one is done if you have that problem so 25 minutes and then we will have a beautiful baguette [Music] [Music] okay there's our big s aren't they gorgeous beautiful golden brown kind of tap them a little hot they're Hollow so that's just what we want and you know what's great about big ad should do a few they're all they all look different kind of and you can evaluate them I you know nice ears here some maybe not and then so then next time you know whether you should cut if they're you don't have good ear maybe you didn't cut deep enough or if they're really ragged maybe you didn't pull your ear razor or your knife fast enough through so it's kind of fun to just experiment learn the craft enjoy it so now I know we're smelling the brand it smells wonderful and who doesn't like hot red nice warm from them but please resist it ah to get the full flavor of your baguette it has to cool to room temperature sorry to say that but that's what we have to do so I'm gonna let them cool aunt like this on a wire rack it's probably going to take you know maybe a couple hours but when we come back we will try one okay so now we're ready to cut into our baguette so I like to use the serrated knife some people just like to tear off the chunk either way I don't know whether you can hear that sound lettuce so I love that sound oh so this is the inside of our bag app as you can see I mean it's wonderfully soft you have the crisp outside crust the soft interior and you can see they're fairly large air pockets in there that's because our the way we made our dough it was very soft and gassy and that's why you get this the holes in the finished product and okay you don't need to have butter on it I like it plain but you know I like butter too it's very good if you can if you have some pesto that's nice on there too you can tell I had chew a lot it is soft it's true in that wonderful crisp outside crust you know this I like making baguettes this way I mean you can make there's so many different ways you can use a stirrer like a foolish or a sponge but you know what to start out this is a really easy way to kind of get get going on making a big gets so try it and until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm [Music]", "XNZfcmZk0dk": "Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you how to make \nperfect homemade French Bread. Making your own French Bread at home is \nnot only ridiculously cheap, it's also fairly simple. It only requires a handful of ingredients, and it's really all about the technique, which makes this a great video recipe\nto share with you today, so I can show you every step of the way. We're gonna start with 2 cups of warm water. Your water should be just warm to the touch \nlike a baby's bath water. You want to keep it between \n100 and 110 degrees Fahrenheit. Then we're gonna add in 1 1/2 tablespoons of \ninstant dry yeast, I use instant because it doesn't require any proofing, along with 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt, and then 4 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour. We're gonna add somewhere between 4 1/2 and maybe 5 cups of flour in this recipe total. So we're going to start on the low end to play it safe. The actual amount of flour that you add during bread making changes depending on a variety of factors, like the weather, so we'll start on the low side and get this mixing. Now we'll watch it as it starts to mix \nand see if we need to add any more flour. You'll want to wait until the majority of the \nflour is mixed in before making the call on whether or not to add in more. Now I can see that the dough is having trouble sticking to the sides of the bowl, so that means it needs just a little bit more flour, so I'm going to add in about another 1/4 cup. Keep on adding flour a little bit at a time until your dough is able to pull away from the \nsides of the bowl and leave it clean. Next we're gonna transfer this to a \nlightly greased mixing bowl. I'm going to turn the dough over a couple times \nso it gets a little bit of grease on it, then cover it with a towel and let it rise until it's \ndouble in size which will take about an hour, give or take a little bit depending on how \nwarm your house is. Once your dough has risen, turn it out onto a clean surface \nand divide the dough in half, and then we're gonna roll each half into a large rectangle. I make mine about 18 inches long and 11 inches wide. Then we're gonna roll it up as tightly as we can \nfrom the long end. We want it to be nice and tight. Roll it all the way and then I'm gonna take it and roll it \nso that the ends get tapered off. This is the technique part of French bread\nmaking and you can see it's actually quite simple. Next you'll want to place your loaves \nonto your baking tray. You can use just a regular baking tray or you can use a French bread pan \nthat looks just like this. It has a whole bunch of holes in it for even cooking so that the heat can get all the way around the loaf. Whatever pan you're using you want it to be lightly greased and you want to place the loaf seam side down. If you plan on making French bread fairly\noften at home, I highly recommend buying the French bread loaf pan. I'll give a link in the video description. It's actually really cheap, and it does make a huge difference in giving you that bakery quality loaf right at home. Next we're gonna let these rise for about 40 minutes. After it's risen the second time, take a sharp knife and score the top of the loaves with little diagonal cuts that are about a quarter of an inch deep. Then take a beaten egg and brush it over\nthe top of the loaves to give it some shine. Then we're gonna bake these in a 375 degree oven for 35 to 40 minutes. Your bread is done when it's a nice\ngolden brown on top. Now just like other baked goods it's best within the first 24 hours. Thanks for watching. I hope you enjoy this French bread as much as we do. You can find the full written recipe in the\nvideo description.

See you later.", "3QdzHuhJ-ls": "[Music] so the lesson here is to see how to properly score a baguette and I always talk about an imaginary line down the center of the baguette and I'm going to use this permanent marker just as a guide and it again it's just a learning tool so this is what you have to imagine on a baguette you're then going to take your blade and you're going to make an incision like a paper cut the way that I hold the blade is like a spoon and I start here and I make about a 3-inch incision I repeat that over lapping by one third of the previous incision and again repeat repeat and the last time down here now again we're gonna do it without the lines repeat by one third coming in at a slight angle that will give you that beautiful ear that peels back I'm going to show you the incorrect way of doing this you cut you don't overlap and you start to where you've left your previous incision what this is going to give you is a bulge here a tightening here a bulge tightening bulge tighten bulge and the other incorrect way of doing this is making a sausage like cut where you go across the entire width of that baguette let's put these in the oven and observe them when they come out of the oven so here we have the baguettes out of the oven and you can see color wise again this is whatever you like I like a nice chestnut e color on the side and let's review the cutting technique here I had that line drawn along the side and you can still see the line now see this is not for consumption at this point this was the incisions where we didn't overlap by one third you can see it sort of bellied up on you and then this one right here you can see these horizontal lines that cut across the width of the baguette and it looks nothing like the baguette should so this I think is a nice developed nice ears are starting to open up you see that nice sharp edge long assigned and when we go to cut one of these things what I usually do is I take the nice exposed sides I cut into it with my knife and then cut in length and you can see these this beautiful open Crump structure so we're looking for here is a open creamy crumb irregular cell structure when you smell it it should have a nice sweet nutty flavor profile to it and again flavor-wise I have to admit that this baguette will taste the same but as a mouth filled a mouth chew is going to be very different so the lesson learned here is that make sure that your incisions are at a 45 degree angle and overlapping by one third of the previous cut and traditionally you're looking for five even incisions along the length of your back gap all the best and happy baking [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "5FduMMBM-dQ": "hi guys welcome back to Amy's cooking I hope you guys are having a fantastic day so today's recipe is another version of the Vietnamese band me the enemies when me actually has two different kinds you have one that has a thicker crust and a denser interior as opposed to the recipe that I will be sharing with you today has more of a super thin crust that is super crispy and the interior is very light and fluffy so if you want to take a look at this and listen to the sound that crispy sound just makes me want to salivate so this is the type of Bend me that you find most commonly at the sandwich shops it is very very light in weight when you look at the bun me it looks big but when you're holding it in your hand it's just super feather-light and you can tell why by looking at the interior of this sandwich here the dough itself has risen to the point where you have these super structures of nice gluten formations is so stretchy which is actually a classic traditional expectation of a Vietnamese bun me so to be able to get one of these and successfully make one of these at home there's quite a few details and tips that I will be providing in this video and I do hope and want you to successfully make this the very first time so just make sure that you are paying attention to the different points that I give throughout the video so if you want to make this let's get started we are using bread flour today and one question that comes up in a lot of my bread video from my subscriber is that can you use all-purpose flour in place of the bread flour and the answer is yes it's just not preferred because the all-purpose flour does not contain enough protein to be able to have that nice gluten formation so don't improve ER is something I don't typically use in my bread recipe but I am using it today in this particular recipe because it does need that to help with the structure of this type of bread the yeast that we are using today is instant yeast so if you do not have instant yeast and you are using active dry yeast you do have to use the water in this recipe to activate the yeast before you add it to the flour we will be needing a little bit of salt to add a dimension of flavor to the sandwich and we will be balancing it out with just a little bit of sugar so butter is not something that you typically find in a bunny recipe but for me it is really important to get this Airy fluffy texture to this recipe you don't need much you only need about two tablespoons which is equivalent to about thirty gram vitamin C gives a very aesthetic environment and the yeast love that and you don't need much just a pinch you can crush a tablet and also one whole egg the egg also does what the butter kind of does which really helps to fluffing up that dough and gives it an easier environment for it to rise water is really just water from the cold faucet it's not ice-cold water or it's not warm water it's just regular water that you get from the sink let's go ahead and combine everything we have a flower here and to it I'm adding the dough improver along with the sugar as well as the salt we will also be placing the pinch of that vitamin C in here and then we will be giving this a quick mix and just until everything is combined this is the butter that I have melted and we will be placing that into the flour here you can just also add that to the water and add it to the flour either way will work but once everything is mixed we will be placing our yeast now remember this is dry instantly so if you are using the active dry make sure that you bloom it in this water here until it's fully from foamy before you add it to the flour will also place in our one whole egg and today we will be using a dough hook with a stand mixer to knead this dough I am going to provide you with the speed as well as the timing the first couple minute or - you can just put it on stir or number - just until everything is fully combined and hooked on to your dough hook at that point increases speed to number six we will be needing this for a total of ten minutes on number six and let's take a look at the dough this is at the three minute mark we will be comparing the dough and the way it looks at the three minute the six minute and that at the ten minutes so here at the three minutes you can see the dough is kind of falling off the hook very easily it tears pretty easily as well what we want to do is we want to create a super elastic dough let's continue to knead this and then I will stop the machine when it gets to six minutes to show you what it looks like in six minutes so the whole purpose of creating a super elastic dough is so that it can trap the air easier so even when your dough Rises really poufy it can still retain that trapped air without causing it to collapse so here we are at six minutes as you can see the dough is still falling off the hook but it's starting to look a lot smoother and not as tacky so we'll go ahead and put it on number six again and let's knead it for another four minutes now depending on your KitchenAid or the the standard type of mixer that you use you may need a little bit less time or a little bit more time key point is whenever you get to this stage here is where you need to stop so as you can see as I'm pulling apart yes it is sticking to my finger that's okay it's it's going to be sticky what's more important is you spread the dough you will see how smooth the dough is it's just super smooth you can totally tell how elastic this is so let's go ahead and remove the dough grease a large bowl with either oil or butter and you want to place them in your hand as well so you can work with the dough a lot easier now no too when I am removing the stone you can tell how tough this dough is it's just super elastic again so for this type of on me and my recipe here the dough has to be like this for this to work otherwise if you don't create this plastic elastic dough when the dough starts to rise it is going to collapse and you are going to end up having super dense than me so when you're rolling this into a ball just make sure that you are forming a smooth surface this smooth surface is going to end up being the outermost layer of the crust and the smoother it is the more glossy your bread is going to be go ahead and place it back into the greased bowl and add a little bit more oil or butter to the top of this dough we will cover this up with plastic wraps and we will let it rise until it's about double or two-and-a-half times the original size every kitchen is different for me it takes about 30 minutes but essentially this is kind of what you're looking for if you want to use exact oil that I'm using as a reference that would be easier for you I will drop the link in the description box below along with all of the ingredients for this recipe go ahead and grease the working surface and dump out the dough and when you dump out the dough make sure that the top smooth layer stays on the bottom for this recipe I can make six bread but if you want smaller you just wait the entire dough and divide it into how many many ever pieces you want now note here I want to show you the edge of where I just cut can you see how smooth this is which means that this is so elastic that all the air that has been created from fermentation and the yeast working is able to trap in there without creating super a huge pocket that would have collapsed if we didn't do that when we pour out the dough so once you have them all either eyeballed and into cut into six pieces or use a scale and divide it up to your liking and place them all to the side and I will start walking you through the step and how to shape these dough into the traditional shape of and me when shaping these but me you always want to keep the smooth surface on the bottom because eventually that is going to be on top when you start rolling the dough inward so you want to take the piece of dough and just Mack it on the counter this will help to release a lot of the air and also it will give you the pointy tip where it will be helpful to start to roll the dough in and create this little larger area in the middle of Europe and me when you're rolling it make sure that you are pinching the side of the dough while pushing backward a little bit and at the end of the piece of dough just make sure that you flatten it pretty well so that I can stick to the dough a lot easier go ahead and bake place that onto your baking tray I'm going to show you one more time with a close-up so again the smooth side goes on the bottom slap the piece of dough onto the counter a couple of times you can even use a rolling pin to roll out the end of this dough to make that flat surface now only with the flat area stay on to the dough better when you roll it in but it can also help to create that then little thin crust that you are looking for so again look here if you're rolling it just pinch the side and pull it backward pinch push backward pinch push backward and just continue like that I'm going to move the camera here so I can show you the rest of it and you can see the tighter you rolled as the butter is going to trap that air and then that flat area it just sticks to the back of the bun me so well once all of them have been rolled out and shaped go ahead and grease it again and cover with the towel and we're going to rest that in the meantime we'll preheat the oven to 400 and ten degrees every ovens a little different so keep an eye on your bread make sure it doesn't get too browned base Venna me spend me requires a water trade to create steam the water trade goes on the lowest rack and the bread goes in the middle rack so this is the dough that's been rested for one hour in my kitchen it is super big fluffy and if you touch the dough it is not flimsy at all it actually has so much structure to it we will be spraying the surface with water so that when we start making the slashes and creating that classic look of the bunny that it the bread doesn't give the razor a hard time if it's if a straw is going to make this process really difficult you want to use a razor go at a 45-degree angle from top to bottom along the bread very nice and easy as you're seeing here so 45 degree angle top to bottom and just make one nice cut do that with all of the bread you don't want to cut too deep because that is going to cause your bread to spread really really big so just a very nice cut not too thick at all once you have made the cut go ahead and spray at the openings with more water to keep that area moist when it goes into the oven to help allow for even better oven spring so I want to kind of give you a close-up on what it should look like because the stove was so elastic so even with the dough the the how much it has risen it can trap all the air in there if it was not an elastic dough this entire thing would have collapsed so we will be baking this for 24 minutes I guess between 22 to 24 just really depends on your oven but two minutes into the baking process you want to open up the oven and use that water the spray bottle and spray the bread a little bit more the whole purpose here is to keep the bread cooler so it will allow the interior to kind of heat up and help it expand a lot more so this is the finish bread and you don't see the water tray in there anymore because you need to remove the water tray when there's 10 minutes left of bacon so that the bread can get golden brown look at these bread they are super super huge when the pizza dough was so small and it's gotten so big to wear all the sides of the bread are touching and it took up the entire space of this baking tray yeah so that's that's why it's so important to create that elastic dough and you can tell here just by the way it has expanded the bread you can tell that is super fluffy in the inside and super Airy you want to go ahead and just add some butter to it so he can give you a very nice gloss okay let me go ahead and cut this bread up so you guys can see how fluffy lian area is in the inside and if you like what you see I hope you will consider sharing this video with your friends your families your

ready to bake and two and a half hours but before we start I'd like to make one point bread recipes typically tell you to proof the dough until it doubles in size the problem is that can take one and a half hours to four hours which makes it difficult to plan what I'm going to do is show you how to create a favorable proofing environment so that your bread will be ready in one and a half hours so you can plan your day I will be using 13 ounces warm water 1 and 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 and 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast and 3 and 1/2 cups bread flour proofing tip 1 use warm water and don't use a cold mixing bowl it will cool the water rapidly and get the proofing off to a slow start let's get started first I make sure that my bowl is warm then it is 13 ounces warm tap water 1 and 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon is fitties and I'll give it a quick stir to combine it 3 and a half cups bread flour I'll start with 1/2 cup and I'll stir to combine note that I'm using the handle end of a spoon all I'm trying to do is hydrate the flour and getting the introducing the water to the flour watch how it comes together starting to come together I'm going to start rolling it a bit that's to try to get the flour off the sides I'll scrape the side of the bowl we'll get that last bit of flour into the bowl and I'll finish combining it and there we go I cover the dough with plastic wrap and it's ready to proof proofing tip number two the ideal temperature for proofing is 78 85 degrees but the typical home is 68 to 72 degrees so I'm going to use the oven light method for proving turn the oven light on put the dough in the oven close the door and the oven light will warm the oven to a little over 80 degrees which will give a warm draft-free environment for proofing and the dough will be ready in 1 and 1/2 hours turbo dough should be proof for one hour and 30 minutes in a warm draft-free environment the dough is proof for an hour and 30 minutes it's time to make the baguettes the dough has risen and more than doubled in size normally you would punch dough down at this time but noni bread I prefer a technique called de gas pull and stretch next step is I'm going to dust it with flour when it's still in the bowl this technique is called roll to coat dust it with a little more flour no flour under it and notice how much easier it is to handle right now I'm going to divide it into thirds I'll push two of these off to the side anytime you have wet just add a little flour and notice all of a sudden it's very easy to manipulate okay I'm going to put that off to the side so you stick in a little add a little flour and all of a sudden it's better I'm going to let it rest for 10 minutes the dough is rested ten minutes the bag has a rest for ten minutes but that does it makes it easier to shape that the first thing I need to do spray the tray with no-stick spray well does the workspace with a little flower here see how easy that was to shape now and over into the Train I want them to be about 16 inches long I'll cover with a lint-free towel to proof how we're set to go no need turbo dough should be proofed for 30 minutes and the oven should be preheated to 450 degrees the oven has come to temperature I place the baguettes in the oven and I set the timer for 20 minutes baguettes should be baked for 20 minutes at 450 degrees while we're waiting for the bread to bake I'd like to make an important point when I developed no new turbo bread I decided to use one and a quarter teaspoons each versus the typical tuna quarter about 1/2 I didn't want to juice the dough up with a lot of yeast I wanted to use sound proofing technique to develop a favorable proofing environment which would in turn develop a nice natural flavor which is why no need turbo bread has such a wonderful artisan flavor it's been 20 minutes and the baguettes are ready well take a look at these they're beautiful you for quick and easy access to noni bread videos and cookbooks go to noni breath central.com thanks for watching", "mCy37KOh25o": "okay cool so here we are in my thousandth post thought I'd do something a little different today and got this packwood's shout out to what's in my pre-roll for their inspiration such a simple concept with something so desperately needed in today's day and age so yeah this is legit Packwood's that I picked up it's prop 64 compliant not exactly sure what that means it does look like it is a normal blunt but I'm sure it's kind of like hemp wrap or something like that it doesn't exactly specify here on the packaging but as you can see it's got its holographic seal there it's got this wax but it's not real wax apparently and it's sealed by actual plastic so yeah let's go ahead and crack this thing open and see what we got looks like the dotted line is right here Packaging always gets the best of me all right cool all right so that came off pretty easily strip this does this just want to come off all right let's get the sticker going really self-conscious of my nails right now I definitely should have cut them but alright let's see oh there we go popping this off I guess this would be pretty problematic if it was actual wax oh that's just a screw top all right makes perfect sense plastic in there and there's what we're seeing from the top first a little preview there let's get this thing out of here no graceful way to really do this let's see there we go cool there it is it even has packwood's right there on the glass tip so yeah I mean looking decently keeped up guess that's the whole point this little guy escaped some like a little well let's just cut it open in reserved judgment here let's see if I can smell anything not really picking up on any Jack necessarily but it's probably just because it's overwhelmed by whatever this rap is made of got my little scissors out so here we go first cut definitely is stout whatever's in there oh damn oh no I was gonna try to patch this back together after this video but we'll see how that goes all right so there we go let's open it up get the focus on that alright well not exactly what you'd expect from their post on their Instagram page so you're getting at that looks like it'd be pretty hard to pull through falling apart pretty easily let's get a smell for this I mean it is looking fairly tricht yeah I'm not really picking up on any Jackson I know it's blackjack but I mean all the blackjack that I've ever smoked has just been predominantly Jack smelling it and I'm not really getting anything off of this let me grind it up a little bit that's what you this is what you're getting look tiny here let me get in here this is what you're getting I'm not shooting on this if you want to spend you know fifty sixty dollars to get this packed into you know keep tup want do it I mean I don't have a problem with that but that is what you're getting get you know it's ground up pretty well it's all smashed in there it's got some stems in it nothing no huge ones nothing like that I mean the note looks alright it's not anything amazing I see some perp in there but I'm sure I mean I'm not getting any smell off of my fingers at all which is kind of weird if anything maybe a little bit of sweetness but nothing jack like so that's what you get right there let's see what it comes out - oh wait you know there's a lot more there I mean not a lot more but there's more in here cut down a little more I'm saving this guy now is that it isn't where I'm at the tip there all right you guys couldn't see this but I'm trying to work it out it is just smashed in here look here so I mean maybe that would have smoked awesome laying here let me focus a little bit there we go so maybe that would it yeah it's like I don't know maybe that would have smoked great I don't think so [Music] I'll try to take a picture away in it cuz it's like honestly it's so caked in here I'd have to scoop it out so but yeah that's it that's what's inside right there you're looking at it pretty much all of it except for what's jammed right in there there's some Keef on the outside I don't know you know where the what is it co2 wax I guess maybe it's with in the nug like kind of blended in or maybe it's on the outside but honestly no Jackson it whatsoever and yeah I don't know that's what you get so if you want if you're cool with that and if you want to spend the kind of money to grab that then go for it but I mean I'd rather just grab something else and roll it myself there it is backwoods blackjack", "PviVVJrcxk4": "[Music] hey everyone sophia and welcome back to another video of me baking in my kitchen or another episode of epicure eats today i thought i'd make another paul hollywood recipe if you haven't seen my hollywood ciabatta recipe or attempt to make his recipe you can watch this little eye thing well the video um today i'm going to be attempting to make his baguette recipe and i think i've learned a little bit from the ciabatta recipe of how to shape the bread so fingers crossed this will come out better than the ciabatta did so without further ado let's get started all right so i've got all of my ingredients measured out i've got a quarter ounce of salt i'm just using kosher salt and then a quarter ounce of instant or fast acting yeast which also if you get those little packets of yeast that's just one of those so the recipe calls for bread flour i don't have bread flour so i'm going to use a mix of all purpose flour and this double zero flour that's normally used for like pizza dough um but i'm just gonna use it and see how it goes so it's 500 grams of flour so i'm going to kind of split it evenly among the all-purpose and double zero flour so 500 grams so 250 of each into a stand mixer [Music] so next in the bowl i'm going to add the yeast and the salt on the opposite side of the yeast sort of and now after that step we're going to uh put this onto the stand mixer so the reason i put the salt on the opposite side of the yeast is number one it says it in the recipe number two based on all the episodes i've watched of the great british baking show paul always says to not put them together because it could the yeast so in the end i think it all mixes together anyway so i'm just gonna do it all right so i've got this fitted with a hook mixer stand a hook attachment and it says to add three quarters of the water and begin on a low speed so three quarters i guess i'll just kind of estimate that [Applause] [Music] well might have been too much but that's all i have left so as the dough starts to come together then add the remaining water which i think it's starting to come together i'm just gonna dump the rest in and now i'm gonna increase the speed of the mixer to medium and then we're gonna knead it for five to seven minutes okay this looks pretty glossy and elastic if you ask me yes it's very sticky it's a bit wet of the dough i'm not i don't i don't know just like i did with the ciabatta bread recipe i'm rising it in like a square or rectangle container um the recipe says it should be two and a quarter liter this is 2.5 that's the closest thing i had to what he's looking for so i'm just gonna oil it a little bit make sure it doesn't stick up and i'm gonna dump the dough in there and let it rise for an hour [Music] so that looks pretty good okay so i'm just gonna cover it with some plastic wrap or cling film pure british and i'm gonna leave it alone and hopefully it will rise so while the dough is rising i thought it would probably be a practical idea to read through the recipe because normally i just kind of read it as i go and that's probably not a good thing especially for the shaping portion of these baguettes i think it's pretty methodical all right so after it is doubled step number four is to dredge a linen couch push croucher i have to look into that with flour and lightly dust the work surface with flour so maybe it's like a towel carefully tip the dough back onto the work surface rather than knocking it back handle it gently so don't knock it down keep the air into it which helps to create an irregular airy texture the dough will be wet to the touch but still lively so maybe it is supposed to be a little bit of a wet dough so that's that's good divide the dough into four pieces shape them into an oblong by flattening the dough i'm just going to make it into a shape of a bad guy lay the bag out along the linen push and pleat the koosh up against i have no idea if i'm saying that wrong i really don't know repeat the process for all four then cover them again for an hour then you pretty open and bake them so i think maybe i should watch a video maybe i should just go for it because this is attempts to make okay so the bread is almost done rising it's probably about eight minutes away but i found this towel and i'm gonna try to use it as a koosh which basically i think it helps to shape the bread and it's supposed to be like this i don't know if there's like a traditional one has something that keeps these up like that but we're just gonna kind of wing it and see how it goes so furthering my research i found a youtube video of someone making french baguettes at home and i thought it'd be a good idea just watch and see how they're shaped and how they're made okay so i'm gonna skip to the part where he makes reshapes them okay divide into four he's weighing them but i'm just gonna not [Music] so we kind of fold it up into a little roll so he does kind of push it down which is interesting paul says not to oh so he made those shapes and then he let them rest and now he's shaping them again i think i've got to just just kind of roll it into a little whoa so got an apron on and i put my hair back because this could get messy or could go really well so these sleeves do not go up very far okay so i've got my towel i'm just gonna lay it on the counter and based on the video the guy not called hollywood he did it in two separate steps rolled them let them proof and then rolled into the shape of a bed again but based on the directions it seems like paul does all of that in one cohesive step so there seems to be a lot of olive oil which always concerns me because it kind of absorbs the flour when i put the flour down i don't know so i'm gonna dust the surface with some flour i'm just using the double zero flour i don't exactly think it matters um and i'm gonna dust the koosh with some flour too okay so got that [Music] carefully dip the dough onto the work surface maybe i should try to absorb some of them i think that's a good idea only because it seems like there's kind of a lot on here it's still sticky all right nevermind very nice so now uh carefully divide the dough into four pieces i'm gonna try to dust it again i don't know if that's wrong but i'm gonna do it in half here gently separate it it's so sticky i don't know and again nice kind of looks like a baguette already and again [Music] i do have to say the dough is pretty lively so now we're going to shape each piece into an oblong by flattening the dough folding the sides into the middle uh-huh like that looks good i think and then the top should be smooth now beginning in the middle roll each sausage oh roll okay let's put this onto the couch there bad guy number one is in the koosh [Music] so i'm gonna do a little something like that i'm gonna do a little something like this i would say that this needs more flour in terms of shape these are not going to be from what i can tell correct but first time you got to do the best you can what you got no as long as i can make them somewhat uniform um i think it will be all right okay so that step is done now we're gonna do that cover the baguettes with a clean towel i'm just gonna use this christmas towel like this [Music] and then these are gonna rise again for an hour under this little cloth thing and we're going to preheat the oven and bake them so see you guys in an hour don't forget to preheat your oven to 240 degrees celsius or i did about 450 to 460 degrees fahrenheit i don't i just kind of assume that it's close um so yeah we're ready to put them on the tray and put them in the oven so one thing that the recipe says is to put like a baking dish or a roasting pan in the bottom of the oven and fill it with some hot water to create steam so i just did that splashed everywhere so oh so i'm gonna get my two trays because i'm pretty sure and i'm not sure if i should put parchment on i'm gonna go with no but maybe i'll try to put a little olive oil on so they don't stick a light drizzling now so you can see they kind of i mean they rose they're not they didn't get much bigger um but i think hopefully they'll kind of shape in the oven and the steam will help to create a crispier crust take these remove them splash each one four times okay then you're going to use this very sharp knife maybe i'll just try to like flop it onto here it's got to be an easier way ah just flip it over that's probably wrong probably wrong because it rose upward not like that anyway i'm just going to go with it it's rustic very rustic if that's the right way to do it it worked very well to just flip them over i'm assuming it is not okay so i'm gonna slash them across the top these look very similar to the ciabatta i made one two three four it's just completely ruining the shape it's good enough for me all right into the oven for 20 to 25 minutes uh here we go [Music] so these just came fresh out of the oven i did leave them in there for 20 minutes and overall i just i'd say the shape is not exactly correct but this one i think looks like a baguette hollow on the bottom this one got a little bit darker i'm not exactly sure why um so i'm very tempted to slice one open i think i'm going to i'll save the good ones for later but we'll start possibly with actually i'll try the darker one so the structure is pretty good i think and i'd say that the texture is very nice it has that like fluffy bread kind of look or feel i wish it was a little bit taller maybe it i should have left it to rise a little bit longer but i'm happy with the outcome i'm just gonna try it with a little bit of honey butter of course i think the steam in the bottom of the oven really helps create this like essential crust i

everyone today i'm here to show you our child resistant push pack this is a new packaging option from us that is perfect for pre-roll multi-packs the push pack is a premium paper packaging option that's perfect for pre-rolls at an affordable price since it's made out of paper it's far more environmentally friendly than the plastic cr options that we see on the market currently when we slide open the push pack we can really see the thickness of the paper board which makes up the package and gives it its rigidity and it's this rigidity that makes the package feel great when you hold it in your hand and helps to elevate your pre-roll brand [Music] in order to open the push back you push down on the silicone button and push forward in order to slide the tray out this can be opened both from the top and the bottom [Music] we have two premium insert options one with dividers and one with a compartment when you add dividers to the push pack it helps to divide up each pre-roll you could put in different strains or different sizes of pre-rolls whatever you want to do however when you do add the dividers to the push pack it reduces the number of pre-rolls that the push pack can hold we also have the compartment option and with the compartment you can either add a hemp wick a lighter or anything else that you may want to add to your pre-roll package for an additional cost we can also add matches and a strike strip we can make this package in any size with a variety of compartments and inserts and we can do this at an moq as low as a thousand this makes the push pack accessible to

lower than the other and sometimes when I'm rolling I can feel an air pocket inside so I'll give it a squeeze and then try to roll it back to shape so I think this was well got in your pocket day did you hear that collapse okay so let's try and get it back to a nice firm tube for Brooke there we go I like to put a little saran wrap a little plastic wrap on the balls while I'm waiting for them until I can get to them so they don't dry air because if they dry out then they're difficult to work with just fold it over itself and then I pinch it and one last folding squeeze it all together start rolling now if it resists you can just need it for a little few minutes just a little while for it to rest and then it'll start to cooperate again you can see I've got too much in the center here so I'm rolling it from that area and feel a near pocket here now we didn't hear it but there was one and see how firm my dough is it's not too wet not too dry it's just perfect today it's not you good boy there's a near pocket here hear that okay on the tray now get some cooking spray and some saran wrap we'll just spray that in Oh Salem we fed you my goodness there's nothing your video portrays this is not good make sure that it's completely covered otherwise it's for you to dry up [Applause] okay now I put a tea towel on top as well just keep it warm in my cold kitchen [Applause] one more piece of saran you just like one long piece another tea towel keep it warm and that's it okay it's now let me see five o'clock so I'll calculate how long I guess it's been a couple of hours and we're going to take a look to see how much our bread makes risen there we go it's but doubled in size oh this pan feels heavy there we go nice now this stage we have to be very careful when we lift off the Saran start with this single one first and we have to go very very slowly and carefully uh so far it's good no grabbing excellent okay so that looks easy now let's try these other two okay let's see where okay I can feel a little bit of grabbing there so I'm just going to go very slowly because if it grabs and pulls on the dough you're going to deflate what you are spent all this time working on or wait for not much work while well it's rising okay now this piece it's not too bad today very carefully I feel like grabbing a little bit so I'm going to go very slowly you can see it pulling yeah perfect okay I've preheated the oven I'm just waiting for it come to temperature now I have this great little shaker we're adding some flour to the bread see it has a screen and you just put some flour inside give it a little shake across your arm your breads there the ovens ready and now with a very very very sharp knife or you can use a razor just slice into the bread with deliberate little cuts don't see you can see this one this one here has flattened a little bit but it should rise up again in the oven now this one is really nice I don't know if you can see in relation to my hand how oh it's really quite quite large and nice okay so a little bit of flour and then when we do the slices we're gonna sharpen my knife again didn't feel like it was very sharp [Applause] okay I'm just going to wipe the blade with a towel make sure there's no shavings on it now let's try that slicing again okay that goes in a lot nicer this time I'm just going down about me to a quarter of an inch and it'll split apart where it's been sliced and so you'll get a nice difference happening between the areas that have flour sprinkled on it and and the cut slices are that don't have any problem [Music] okay into the oven Lopes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 22 to 25 minutes great yeah like to take them off the pants to cool on the rack soon as possible otherwise they'll get a little bit mushy on the bottom this way you can keep a nice crisp ah bottom to your cup if you put it on the cooling rack now this last one here that's the one that's closest to the camera is actually the one that I had going diagonally that was behaving so perfectly I could have sliced into it a little bit more I think because he can see on these other two but there's a nice difference with the slicing you get more definition with the cut I went a little bit deeper although my son and my husband will disagree that the the deeper slice is nice because it does make it a little bit trickier when they're making their sandwiches here it's just really that was I think that was about a quarter of an inch down and as it spread it became less shallow the the cut so it's really just patterning cosmetic patterning that we have on this slope whereas these ones it's a little bit more defined and I think it's more interesting oh pretty hot right now okay I think what we'll do now is we'll cut slice open one of these baguettes and so you can see how how it looks inside now it's still actually a little warm but let's just perfect [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "NKfkfz1HDl0": "hello everyone Amy's cooking and me and my mom are gonna be doing something we've never done before and you know the video about how to make than me we're gonna be making been me but okay so quick background story recently I posted I post on one of the social media group about how my daughter and I made the enemies minute but me it was kind of a random thing that we decided to do because she was at home and she was really bored and I was trying to find ways to entertain her I was making a lot of the but me too and so she wanted to do a you know mini version of it it was that's right yeah we stay up really really late anyhow so with all of the comments and feedback I wanted to go ahead and come up with an actual recipe because the previous one that I posted it was just pretty much using my Vietnamese but meat bread recipe for it and so this one is actually a brand new recipe that I came up with specifically for the mini but me I think that you guys will have a great time doing this with your loved ones your little girl a boy or even your friends I get together they are so amazing crunchy but soft inside you can make it into an actual bunny like with fillings in there or you can dip it with like condensed milk or dip it with cheese or do kind of a garlic butter butter style so anyhow I'm really excited to came up with Kaitlyn today right Kaitlyn oh you could also make a mini sandwich that's right yes you can make a mini sandwich like with little mini eggs right so anyhow I hope you guys truly enjoyed this for a new video and recipe I am so excited it took a little bit of time to be able to put this together but I promise you if you make this you are going to love this recipe now for everyone who is a subscriber already on my channel just want to say thank you so much you're amazing for anyone who hasn't subscribed yet and you like what you're seeing please go ahead and subscribe at the end of the video please give me some feedback I definitely want to hear from you guys let me know what you like that I'm doing what you don't like so I am up for any kind of comment any kind of feedback I truly appreciate it so anyhow Kaitlyn um are you ready to do this yeah all right so we are going to walk to you guys through step by step how to make thee so what should we name this so it is a Vietnamese but get a bun me but we are going to name it a little different because of the mini right so what are we going to call it the abundant me but a mini version so we're gonna call it a the mini right yeah okay cool alright then we're gonna go ahead and head into the kitchen and we are going to get started all right you should mix it yeast okay we are ready to knead this dough so there's Caitlyn on the left and myself on the right if you're doing this with your little kid oh please have them join you in this part because it's so fun for kid kids so when you first need the dough you can go hard but when you get it to about this stage where it's pretty combined you want to be gentle on it somewhat because you don't want to tear up all of the gluten that you have previously formed so most importantly it takes about three to five minutes but it just really depends on how hard you need but you want to get it to about this elastic stage here so once you are there form it into a ball and threes a bowl with some oil or butter and then just squeeze the top of the ball and place it back in there and place a plastic wrap and let it rise until it gets to double so double is different for every single kitchen for us it takes about 25 to 30 minutes so this is what it should look like so when you press on it it makes that indentation and it doesn't bounce back look how stretchy this dough is is even more stretchier than one right after we first need it so this is what you want right here so at this point go ahead and just form a log with it try to deflate some of that air and we are going to divide this into 13 graham pieces so with this recipe it can give you about 20 bunnies okay keep on dividing all of it and once everything have been divided we are going to shape these little pieces into small little balls so as you can see here you want to kind of take the inside of the dough and wrap it towards the outside and the outside towards the inside and form these these small little ball do it with all of them and kind of place them to the side and cover it with a towel and rest for 5 minutes after 5 minutes we are going to start shaping these little balls into mini bunnies you want to start with the ones that you shaped first and then because those are a lot more rested so what's shaping these with me is really all up to you there's many ways and to shape it here is probably the simplest way by using a rolling pin which is really easy to for your kiddos and then you can just kind of flatten at the end which is going to be the outermost layer of your bunny so that it can stay on the dough better make sure that you close this little gap here so that it isn't pop open when its resting and rising so here's one or you can do it like the way Kaitlyn does it when she rolls it out and then she rolls it towards her what she pinches the side of the dough and then just continue to roll it with her two fingers looks super tiny so once you're done just place it all on a baking rack when you first neat shape it you can feel it's pretty dense okay kinda heavy the texture or the consistency of this is going to be totally different once it Rises and so you want to get a feel for it go ahead and rest it for about 15 minutes 15 minutes into the resting process you're gonna go ahead and use a razor and make these small cuts on top at a 45 degree angle just like that and then spray it with some water and cover it all over and rest another 15 to 20 minutes the time I'm giving here is just an estimate it really depends on your kitchen guys so make sure that your but me looks like this super bouncy very very bouncy when you touches it and when you feel it is super soft like you can tell there's so much air inside you need to get the bunny all the way to this stage before you want to make it otherwise they're going to come out dense so I baked these at 375 degrees for 20 minutes every oven is different so test it out give it about 5 10 degrees lower you want to start out with that and then give it more time and then toss out your oven but look at them aren't they so gorgeous these many Burmese are so cute they're just they're just too adorable to eat but they are golden brown they're crispy on the outside a little soft and fluffy in the inside so as you can see here as a close-up you know they're a small piece of dough so of course it's going to be you know crispy and that's that's kind of what you want these are like little mini snacks Y for kids to eat is super fun okay listen to this crunch so imagine that crunch in your mouth and this like butter-flavored it's a aroma it's just so fresh and amazing it smells like almost like a butter of fresh out of the oven butter cookie it's just it I can't explain to you how it tastes it's just super super amazing what do you think it tastes really good did you enjoy doing the this recipe with mommy mm-hmm yeah what was the part that you liked the best [Music] well you don't need to know and I kind of like making the menus so is kneading the dough sort of like playing with what my planner or sign is that your favorite thing to do - mm-hmm okay that's why he loves to make this with mommy ham it's like it's like playing with mine so

deliver results of a consistent quality and predictable yield the use of supreme premixes not only saves your bakery time but ensures that your baked products are of a superior quality today i'm going to show you how to make a ciabatta bread using Supremes crispy crust premix it's a two-step process the first step is to make your bigger which will then ferment overnight it'll add it to your second dough the following day so to make the bigger you add your water to the mixing bowl add your yeast and lost the edge of flour and taking a whisk you'll notice that the better is very soft that's exactly what want to happen when I cover the sky with a damp cloth leave it overnight in a bakery in a swarm area I prepared this bigger yesterday you can see it's very soft in consistency it's making lovely bubbles and it's now ready to go into the next part of the mix now it can be one two the second part of the process you take your water mixing bowl crispy crust prepared mix into the mixing bowl add olive oil yeast finally we're going to add our bigger that has been fermenting overnight in the bakery now we're gonna lick the dial for between 8 to 10 minutes now we've finished the second part of the process we just molded into a ball like a flat surface and cover with a cloth and allowed to rest for about 20 minutes the next part of the process we can start the shaping of it buckle the a out stretch it a bit like about that long a little bit of olive oil spread it around you do a bit of a fall like and took it to the center and fold it over leave your dough cover it with a cloth again and let it rest for a further 20 minutes after a further 20 minutes we repeat the entire process cut the service of olive oil center fold it over get it back on the table this was no rest for a further 20 minutes after you have stretched and folded your dough three times resting it for 20 minutes between each time this is the result you should have now you can make this into the sizes we need try not push too much of the a out you actually want the big air bubbles inside so you just give it a bit of a push making cut off pieces in your bench scraper Fletcher dive pieces on a pan and leave it to proving the bakery just for around about 4045 minutes don't put it in the prover and that'll give you a great result now it's time to bake the Chia Buster's looking at a baking time of around about 45 minutes and a baking temperature of about 220 degrees Celsius very important at this stage you need to put steam into the oven the more steam you can get into the oven when you're baking the ciabatta the better your product will look now to cheer bottles of Finnish biking this is the kinda result you should see looking for a nice firm hard outer crust a nice rustic look really good-looking shibata's remember that consistency in quality ensure satisfied customers and superior product output supreme also offers a dedicated service team which means you have a partner who truly understands your bakery business I'm not going to show you how to shape a classic French baguette I've mixed the standard crispy crust dough I'm now going to cut the dough into the desired sizes line them all up into balls I'm gonna cover to the sheet and leave it to rest for about ten minutes to either gluten to recover supreme premixes will always deliver results of a consistent quality and predictable yield the use of supreme premixes not only saves your bakery time but ensures that your baked products are of a superior quality now that our dough has been relaxing for about 20 minutes turn upside down Flynn out with your knuckles rockin all the gas out and fold it in half towards you fish it with your knuckles again try and knock out as much gas as you can give it a bit of a stretch outside points to the center using your knuckles again just squash it down trying it as much a out as you can you should not be left with the last square little piece of dough starting on the far side roll it towards you the new zealand's like a swiss roll roll it up try not incorporate too much into the driving process and try and keep it as tight as you can then with the palm your hands slowly start rolling the die outwards try not to apply too much sideways force rather use the downwards force from your hands that you force the dough sideways what you can do as well just put your finger inside the ends just to neaten up the edges a little bit okay one robbing trying it the pieces uniform as possible now we can put it onto the pan important point here is find the seam that must always be at the bottom the seams at the top is gonna break open and try and place it in your pain as straight as possible now it's really to go to the prover I removed the baguettes from the proving I'm not gonna show you the traditional way of scoring a baguette the reason we score buckets is to know the excess gas to escape from the dough in a controlled manner never ever score dope before it's finished proving so you start at the top of the life of the blade at a 45-degree angle using short sharp movements go down then you overlap starting at the top 45-degree angle bring the blade down overlapped the previous cut 45-degree angle bring the blade down same again I have a lap 45 degree angle bring the blade down I have a lap 45 degree angle bring the light down I could get us finish the other three before I put them into the oven now that you put the baguettes into the oven and a temperature of around about 220 beat Celsius for between 20 25 minutes with liberal amounts of steam

hopefully that's not too loud my chair is already going crazy but a we on this consistent video [ __ ] so I'm trying to make this as entertaining as I possibly can while I'm stuck here in this room but even though I'm stuck in here in this room we're still gonna keep it well it is fun [Applause] anyways so we had a good one for you you already read the title the video so you already know what we doing right as a sign up so you know about my life cuz you know this is about me you know this is about me as well my life is my vlog I'm teaching y'all stuff to be helpful and try to make more videos but this about me so in my life you've been seeing it today I uploaded that video for 20 yeah I woke up for work right I exercise in my room not cleaning out for the day and then start recording this video and now after this my grandparents are making some [ __ ] food some steak some green beans and baked potatoes I'm me a baked potato myself once we get into this [ __ ] video so roll the intro let's get into it are y'all ready to be baked [ __ ] potatoes to Fung at home so so let's go new me for that right leg others want small bets really strong [Applause] stay tuned your [ __ ] macaroni alright now that that don't pass intro is over my intro memorize the leadership you should their quality content but what you'll need for this video Finan these papers that we can't roll ourselves with just the papers for some reason I'm slacking but hey you're watching this too so I'm just pre smokes or if you already have filters filter hey then you'll need a lighter at you maybe a Reiner I'm gonna use a grinder a packing stick out front package a stain stick alone for a long time but anyways we need a tray of course the most essential item of this whole process me I mean the drums so once you have your happiness as a crime in some countries you'll need to put that in a binder pack that [ __ ] up all up in there you know how we'd works I'm listening or if not why are you watching this video click off are you trying to click off are you over the age of 18 and a STONER that likes to a joins day I'm here for you yeah now right a different angle as you can see you can see the trade better but the other spot was unreliable I call it in the father stand but anyways oh [ __ ] now it's in the way [ __ ] so I want your weeds right enough like mine is you'll need a home to put it because you don't want your weed being homeless then the unemployment rate will go up even higher than it is because the coronavirus and then we'll have a serious problem it's imagine all the homeless weed out there it's [ __ ] heartbreaking so you're gonna take your front end filter then you grab one your papers wherever the [ __ ] NASA is ready alright one more thing I forgot you'll also need tape of some kind I'm gonna use this kind of packing tape or painters tape I don't even know think we use it for packing whatever you need tape it doesn't matter you'll see why take your paper take one [ __ ] I ripped it love it this should be fine lick the sticky part which in the rolled-up part until that sides flat you feel then you take your little filter you put it in like that little ways in and then so once you have a wraparound kind of nicely you lick the in getting nice and tight around this spot this is kind of a how much selling you just lift it up a bit so that gets tighter no and then should be completely open she'll be able to see all the way through make sure that the top just fold it on when you were covering it so it should steak should create a steady little circle around it but to ensure that when you're packing it the paper doesn't get just it doesn't just get pushed back that's where the taste can come in once you get a little piece of tape when I put it at the bottom where the filter and the paper meet connecting the two between sure and hopefully and won't go nowhere and you got a little bandaid on your joint kinda so and stuff now at this point you're pretty much treating like a regular phone a little less careless maybe it's a little bit more flimsy so be careful because they'll fold quite easily I just licked it in shape so now we can take the weed that we just grind it up take the pretty roll or comb now start packing some in just one scoop fill it up let it fall oh hey I'd say per scoop just pack it down lightly not too much not you little packing in there's some in let it fall and come in with the packing stick maybe hit the sides make sure it's all falling down as far as you can and then I'm going with the pants take gently but enough pressure that just feels right where you're not it doesn't feel like you're pushing it down any further but you're flying in it you know then go around the on the sides make sure it's all even hopefully in order for it to knock there but sometimes it does anyways but most the time I get pretty good for the sometimes sometimes it's a number of things that affect that whether that be [ __ ] it's too windy or the papers rolled a little weird which happens more often and when you roll at yourself in terms of just trying to make your own color so once you got it at your desired length or it's as full and tsukino with leaving a little bit of space at the top to seal it off and go ahead and down a little bit make sure you go around the sides everything's solid and try to turn it opposite of the ways wrapped around and then boom you got yourself your own little at home 20 newbie yeah Phil it's not meant it's a little crooked looking like a witch's finger but it'll do the job and if you don't believe me let's spark up now I'm eating today so I'm really looking forward to both this joint cause I'll hit it harder and then afterwards finally I'm to eat all that food I was

when I came", "HndA2UZmTIk": "hi I'm Steve and welcome to my kitchen today I want to demonstrate how to make an American baguette like these I want you to discard all your thoughts about how much work it is to make baguettes using new methods and techniques with only 10 minutes of work I will have fresh from the oven baguettes before we start I want to make one point Baker's have large evans we have smaller ovens we can't bake long baguettes like Baker's but we can bake demi baguettes which will taste just as delicious I set up my workspace with my utensils in my ingredients I'll be using 3 cups flour one and a half teaspoons salt quarter teaspoon instant yeast and 12 ounces cool tap water I'm going to start with the dry ingredients 3 cups flour I use the scoop and shape method for measuring flour I use bread flour but it's perfectly acceptable to use all-purpose flour all-purpose flour contains 12 percent gluten in bread flour contains 14 percent gluten while bread flour main as the package says be better for bread either is acceptable next 1/2 teaspoon salt I use every day table salt there are a number of no need recipes in which the salt varies from 1 to 2 teaspoons dependent upon your diet I use a heaping teaspoon to get my teas 2 and 1/2 and 1/4 teaspoon instant yeast sometimes referred to as bread machine used before we add the wet ingredients I want to mix the dry ingredients to ensure that the yeast and salt are evenly distributed throughout the flour now it's time for the wet ingredients 12 ounces cool tap water next we'll combine the wet and dry ingredients there note how the dough is beginning to stick to the bowl it means the ingredients are blended that my dear friends was the hardest part about making the dough no mixer no need no yeast proofing all we had to do is combine the wet and dry ingredients all we need to do now is cover the bowl with plastic wrap leave it on the counter proof at mother nature will do the kneading force I'll see you in eight hours dough should be proof for 8 to 24 hours which gives you a lot of flexibility you could make the dough in the morning and bake it for your evening meal or you can make the dough in the evening bake the next morning and have fresh from the oven bread for your lunch for eight hours and more than tripled in size it's time to fold shape and proof the dough second time I have set a sheet of parchment paper about the size of my baking stone off to the side of my workspace by making the parchment paper the size of the baking stone it will help me space the baguettes so that they will fit on the baking stone next I'll dust the workspace with flour and scrape the dough out of the bowl if string nature tells us mother nature has done her job with flowered hands I'm going to lightly Pat the dough to flatten stand using a bowl scraper I'll fold the dough over onto itself forming a ball I'm going to make four baguettes so I'm going to cut the dough into four parts I'll cut the dough ball in half form the ball and cut each in half form a ball each time helps me to buy the dough into equal portions I want to form a long rope but right now the dough was too elastic so I'll form each into a long rope and set them aside there I'm going to rest the dough for 10 minutes remember how elastic the duel was the ten-minute weight allowed the yeast to work and the dough relaxed now I can form each into a long roll the length of the parchment paper obviously I'm not using the sophisticated methods and techniques of a French Baker that's why I refer to these as American baguettes known in dough has a higher moisture content and I modified my methods and techniques to the wetter goal the average person will not know the difference my goal is simple to put fresh from the oven bread on the table that will make my guests go well and they're ready to proof I place the dough in the parchment paper and covered it with a flour sectile to proof before I leave the kitchen I'll prep the oven i position the rack on the lower part of the oven and inserted the baking stone I do in advance so I don't forget I'm going to proof the dough for an hour and a half and I want to preheat the oven for half an hour so I'm setting the timer for one hour dough should be proofed for one to two hours it's been one hour and I'm set in the oven to 450 degrees tile baking stones come to temperature faster than cast iron dutch ovens so I can start baking as soon as the oven comes to temperature proofing for over an hour and the oven has come to temperature it's time to bake the bread any time I bake no need bread on a baking stone I baste it so I'm going to start by making an egg wash one egg with one to two tablespoons of water which I'll whip with a fork and brush onto the baguettes I use the egg shell to measure the water you don't have to be exact the purpose of the water gets to dilute the egg and they can easier to base next I'll score the dough with the scissors I'll slide the pizza pedal under the parchment paper and slide it into the oven on the baking stone I'm setting the timer for 15 minutes I'll see you then it's been 15 minutes that gets her ready let's take a look here they are what do you think you'll find the American baguette to be very versatile today I'll be making a torpedo sandwich and the bread came out of the oven only 15 minutes ago that is what I call fresh I have a variety of videos demonstrating noni breads and smart new recipes you may want to take a look at my youtube channel it's free just click on the artisan bread with Steve tab above this screen"}
